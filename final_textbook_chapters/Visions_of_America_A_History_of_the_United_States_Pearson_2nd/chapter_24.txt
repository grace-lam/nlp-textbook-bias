 On June 6, 1944, the Allies launched D-Day (for “debarkation day”), their long-anticipated invasion of Normandy, in northern France, under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. “The eyes of the world are upon you,” the popular leader told his troops. Eisenhower, raised in a poor Jehovah Witness family in Kansas, became a national hero for his successful planning and execution of the D-Day invasions and subsequent offensives through France and Germany. His achievements and sunny personality would make him an appealing postwar presidential candidate in 1952 (see Chapter 24).

COMBAT PHOTOGRAPHY
War photography brings the realities of combat into the homes of ordinary citizens. How do pictures of combat force viewers to think about the overall meaning and worthiness of the conflict? For the first year and a half of American involvement, when there was little good news to report, the military believed that photographs of dead American soldiers would weaken morale on the home front. In 1943, Allied victories in the South Pacific and North Africa raised spirits at home— perhaps a bit too much for some officials. Aware of the long road ahead and the need for continued civilian sacrifice, the War Department approved the dissemination of bloody battlefield photographs. In September 1943, Life published a photograph of three American soldiers lying partially buried in the sand in New Guinea. In the accompanying editorial Life anticipated the public’s shock at seeing the first photograph of American war dead. “Why print this picture, anyway, of three American boys dead upon an alien shore? Is it to hurt people? To be morbid?” Life editors wrote. “Those are not the answers. The reason is that words are never enough.” Magazine editors chose their images from an ever-increasing supply of casualty pictures. Twothirds of the 291,557 American troops killed in battle during the war died in 1944–1945. Photographer Joe Rosenthal’s “Old Glory Goes Up on Mt. Suribachi, Iwo Jima,” a candid shot of five marines and one navy corpsman raising a flag on the Pacific Island of Iwo Jima on February 23, 1945, remains the most famous image from World War II. Rosenthal’s Pulitzer Prize– winning photograph would inspire a Marine Corps statue, erected in Washington, D.C., in 1954. 
 Military censors forbade publication of photographs containing identifiable war dead or badly mutilated corpses, worried that such pictures might depress morale on the home front.

 faced fierce German resistance on Omaha Beach, one of five landing points, the D-Day invasion was an overwhelming success. The heavy buildup for the attack, involving 175,000 troops, 6,000 aircraft, and 6,000 naval vessels, made complete surprise impossible. But the Allies had increased the invasion’s chances of success by deceiving the Germans into expecting the attack to come elsewhere. Diversionary bombing, false agent reports, and misleading radio communications convinced the Germans to station most of their first-rate infantry divisions farther north. Hitler continued to hold these units and his crack tank formations in reserve even after the D-Day invasion began, certain that the Normandy landings were just a diversion. The German delay in responding gave the Allies the time they needed to establish a beachhead that stretched for 55 miles by the end of the first day. Life photographer Robert Capa hit the beaches with the troops, living up to his famous statement, “If your pictures aren’t good enough, you aren’t close enough.” Anxious to see Capa’s photographs, a rushing darkroom technician used too much heat to dry the film and inadvertently melted nearly all his images. The excessive heat blurred the remaining few, creating a surreal aura to this instantly iconic image (23.18) of an American soldier struggling through the turbulent surf to reach the shore. Capa put down his camera long enough to pull this soldier to safety after a bullet struck him in the right shoulder. It was still a long way from Normandy to Berlin, however. After two more months of hard fighting, the Allies finally began to push forward. On August 15, 1944, the Americans launched a second invasion through the south of France. Within a month these troops had joined with the Normandy invasion forces to establish a continuous Allied front from the English Channel to the German frontier. But Hitler had no intention of going down without a fight. In December 1944, the Germans launched a massive counteroffensive. The Battle of the Bulge, so named for the Germans’ pocket of penetration into Allied lines, was the most massive battle fought by the American Army in Europe. Fighting in the snow and bitter cold, the Allies suffered 77,000 casualties before halting the German counterattack a month later.

 When Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met again in February 1945 at Yalta, a town in the Crimea on Russia’s Black Sea coast, to discuss their next step, Roosevelt was fresh off an unprecedented fourthterm victory in the 1944 presidential election. The Republican candidate Thomas Dewey, a popular New York State governor, had attacked Roosevelt as a “tired old man” no longer up to the challenge of running the war. Roosevelt solidified support within the Democratic Party by replacing the controversial liberal Henry Wallace with Harry S. Truman, a straight-talking moderate senator from Missouri, as his vice-presidential candidate. The selection of an acceptable vice-presidential candidate was important to Democratic Party bosses who feared that the ill Roosevelt might not live to complete a fourth term in office. Suffering from advancing heart disease and the strain of war, Roosevelt nevertheless displayed renewed energy during the campaign, convincing Americans not to “change horses in mid-stream.” He won 432 to 99 votes in the Electoral College, receiving 54 percent of the popular vote.

 CHAPTER 23

WORLD WAR II: FIGHTING THE GOOD WAR, 1939–1945

 At Yalta the larger question of how to defeat Germany was behind the Allies. The issues now on the table included governing postwar Germany, ensuring victory over Japan, and maintaining peace in the postwar world. At the conference FDR secured a Soviet promise to enter the war against Japan three months after Germany capitulated. In return Stalin wanted the United States and Britain to grant the Soviet Union territorial concessions in Japan, China, and eastern Poland. For the moment FDR acceded to Soviet control of Eastern Europe, but secured a pledge from Stalin, never honored, to hold free elections in a liberated Poland. The decision at Yalta to name the United States, Britain, France, China, and the USSR as permanent members of the proposed United Nations Security Council, each with the power to veto any resolution, cleared the way to officially create a United Nations (UN) to replace the defunct League of Nations. Delegates from 50 nations met in San Francisco between April 25 and June 26, 1945, to found the UN, an international organization that offered nations a place to discuss their differences and collectively promote economic development and peace throughout the world. To ensure that the United States joined the UN, its creators made participation in UN-peacekeeping missions voluntary. The Security Council veto also gave the United States (and the other major powers) a way to control UN activities. In contrast to World War I, when it failed to join the League of Nations, the United States was one of the first countries to join the UN, which built its headquarters in New York City. Now unstoppable in Europe, the Allies crossed the Rhine River into Germany in March. On April 30, 1945, Hitler committed suicide in a bunker 55 feet underground in Berlin. After dictating his will and marrying his longtime companion Eva Braun, Hitler bit into a cyanide capsule and shot himself in the head. Two days later Russian soldiers entered the bunker and took Hitler’s burned remains, so an autopsy could confirm he was dead. Germany surrendered unconditionally on May 7, 1945.

 America’s Response to the Holocaust In spring 1945, Allied troops began liberating the concentration camps holding Jews, Poles, prisoners of war, and other groups that the Nazis considered enemies or racially inferior. News of the Final Solution, Hitler’s plan to systematically murder the Jews

 and other “lesser” peoples, first reached the West in August 1942. Along with ten other nations, the United States condemned “in the strongest possible terms this bestial policy of cold-blooded extermination.” During the war mainstream American newspapers, fearful of reporting falsified atrocity stories amid a glut of war news, had published little about the Holocaust, the term used to describe this Naziengineered extermination. The United States did little initially to aid European Jews. In January 1944, however, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, who was Jewish, protested to FDR that antiSemitism within the State Department had thwarted a plan to ransom 70,000 Romanian Jews with private funds, leaving the United States open to charges that it was acquiescing in the “murder of the Jews.” FDR immediately issued an executive order establishing the War Refugee Board (WRB). Over the next year the WRB saved approximately 200,000 lives by convincing Romania and Hungary to stop deporting Jews and by helping Jews and other victims of Nazi persecution escape or survive in hiding. Envisioning Evidence: Deciphering the Holocaust depicts both the response of the United States to the Holocaust and the scope of German atrocities. Pressed by Jewish groups to undertake a dramatic rescue of Europe’s Jews by bombing either the concentration camps or the railroads leading to them, Roosevelt demurred. He argued that any diversion of military resources from the ultimate goal of winning the war would only prolong the Jews’ suffering. In February 1944 the War Department decided not to send armed forces to rescue “victims of enemy oppression unless such rescues are the direct result of military operations conducted with the objective of defeating the armed forces of the enemy.” Bombing Auschwitz, the main Nazi extermination camp in Poland, became a real possibility only in the summer of 1944. In August Allied planes dropped more than 1,000 bombs on synthetic-oil plants less than 5 miles from Auschwitz. Whether the Allies should have also bombed the gas chambers has provoked heated debate since the war. Advocates argue that destroying the railroad lines leading to Auschwitz or its gas chambers would have slowed down the killing as liberating Allied troops approached the camps, perhaps saving as many as 100,000 Jews. These would have included Anne Frank, a 13-year-old German refugee who was sent to Auschwitz after her family’s capture in Amsterdam and whose journal of her experience in hiding, The Diary of Anne Frank, became a postwar literary classic.

DECIPHERING THE HOLOCAUST
Over-simplifications about the Holocaust depict German Jews as the main victims of Hitler’s Final Solution and the United States primarily as liberators. As the graph shows, most of the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust were Poles. The Germans also killed over three million Soviet prisoners of war, two million nonJewish Poles, nearly 200,000 disabled individuals, 10,000 Jehovah Witnesses, and an undetermined number of homosexuals and Roma or Gypsies. The timeline reveals that during the Depression-plagued 1930s the United States reacted cautiously to Hitler’s persecution of the Jews. Nonetheless, of all nations, the United States still accepted the largest number of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. The map marks the major concentration camps that American ground troops liberated in Western Europe, including Buchenwald, Dachau, and Mauthausen, forced labor camps and detention centers where thousands were “worked to death,” starved, executed, and subjected to medical experiments. The Soviet army liberated the extermination camps, including Auschwitz, all located in Eastern Europe.

 “The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating, that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it cannot survive their being repeated.” American prosecutor, Supreme Court Justice ROBERT JACKSON, in opening the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials

 determination to use any means possible to slaughter the Jews, including mass executions by firing squads and forced marches, until the very end of the war. As the camps were liberated, reporters tried through words and pictures to convey how six million Jews had met their deaths. Even though Americans had grown accustomed to seeing photos of war dead, nothing prepared them for images from the concentration camps. American commanders invited the press into the camps to head off denials over the scope of the Holocaust and Nazi atrocities. Photographs of concentration camps were, one reporter wrote, “so horrible that no newspaper normally would use them, but they were less horrible than the reality.” Soldiers set themselves up as witnesses (a term used to describe both survivors

 and liberators) who could personally vouch for the extent of the horrors by posing in photographs before piles of corpses and skeletal survivors. “You can photograph results of suffering but never suffering itself,” observed one British politician. By documenting the act of discovering Nazi atrocities, witness photographs helped Americans share the horror that soldiers felt. The American military also posted photographs of concentration camp atrocities in German towns and villages for civilians to see, but many American commanders went further. In the photo shown here (23.19), American soldiers assembled German civilians before a truckload of corpses to listen to a lecture on the barbarity. Forcing German civilians to view the carnage with their own eyes, and in some cases to bury the bodies, was part of a deliberate Allied campaign to make all Germans accept responsibility for their nation’s war crimes. After the war the Allies jointly tried 22 Nazi leaders in the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. In these trials individual Germans were charged with starting the war, authorizing the killing of prisoners of war, and orchestrating the wartime genocide against victims, who mostly came from nations occupied by Germany (see the “Jews in the Holocaust” chart, page 709). The United States independently tried thousands of other German officials as well. These trials were not enough to calm the fears of survivors. Many left Europe to resettle elsewhere.

ENDING THE PACIFIC WAR



Ending the Pacific War
 Germany was now under Allied control, but in the Pacific the war raged on. There the fighting took a desperate turn in 1945, and each victory cost the United States dearly. Despite a mounting death toll, American troops edged closer to Japan, and officials began planning an invasion of the Japanese mainland. News of a successful atomic bomb test in the New Mexico desert dramatically altered political and military calculations on how to achieve victory. Employing this new, terrible weapon eventually generated conflicting views within the United States over the ethics of atomic warfare.

 kamikaze attacks alone killed 5,000 sailors, while ground troops squared off against an entrenched enemy determined to fight to the last man. As on Iwo Jima vast numbers of Japanese soldiers (70,000) perished on Okinawa. In this battle, however, an equal number of Japanese civilians either killed themselves (they had been told of mass rape and torture if taken prisoner) or were killed by Japanese soldiers if they tried to surrender. The Americans suffered 75,000 casualties in capturing Okinawa. With the actual invasion of the Japanese homeland targeted next, the Americans feared facing, in the words of Harry Truman, “an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other.”

Dropping the Atomic Bomb
 Franklin D. Roosevelt died at the age of 65 of a cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945, while at his cottage in Warm Springs, Georgia. Throngs of mourners lined railroad tracks and streets as the casket holding his remains traveled first to Washington, D.C., for funeral services in the White House and then to his final resting spot at his home in Hyde Park, New York. Many Americans could barely remember a time when FDR had not been president. Roosevelt’s firm grip on power had kept Vice President Harry Truman in the dark about the four-year, $20 billion Manhattan Project, the code-named secret government research program to produce the atomic bomb. Thrust into the presidency, Truman faced critical strategic decisions in Europe and the Pacific, none more important than what to do with the new atomic bomb. In mid-July 1945, the United States exploded its first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert. Choices and Consequences: How to Use the Atomic Bomb traces Truman’s options and the consequences of his decision to use the bomb against Japan. On August 6, 1945, a B-29 bomber christened the Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. As pilot Captain Paul Tibbets turned the Enola Gay away from Hiroshima, Sergeant George Caron snapped seven photographs, giving Americans their first look at the telltale mushroom cloud that came to signify nuclear annihilation. Three days later, acting on a standing order to use the atomic bomb “as made ready,” a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki.

 How did the war against Japan finally end?

 Saved from firebomb attacks because of their minimal military value, Hiroshima and Nagasaki presented virgin ground for a clear demonstration of the bomb’s force. The United States wanted to make a profound impression on the Japanese. Secretary of War Stimson believed “the atomic bomb was more than a weapon of terrible destruction; it was a psychological weapon.” The firebombed ruins of cities like Tokyo, therefore, presented a much less appealing target for demonstrating the full power of a nuclear bomb. American soldiers scheduled to take part in the planned invasion gave little thought to civilian victims. “When we learned to our astonishment that we would not be obliged in a few months to rush up the beaches near Tokyo assault-firing while being machine-gunned, mortared, and shelled, for all the practiced phlegm of our tough facades we broke down and cried with relief and joy. We were going to live. We were going to grow to adulthood after all,” recalled literary critic Paul Fussell in a 1988 essay, “Thank God for the Atom Bomb.”

The Final Surrender
 Truman and his advisers recognized that American possession of the atomic bomb would reshape postwar relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. To key presidential advisers, America’s nuclear monopoly increased the chances of limiting Soviet influence over Eastern Europe and ending the Pacific war without Soviet help. Spies in the Manhattan Project had already alerted Moscow of the bomb’s existence, before Truman finally told Stalin in July 1945 at the Potsdam Conference, held near Berlin, that the United States had developed a potent new weapon. When the first bomb destroyed Hiroshima, the Soviets quickly invaded Manchuria on August 8 to seize their planned territorial objectives before the war ended. By August 10, the combination of two atomic bomb blasts and the Soviet entry into the war caused Japanese Emperor Hirohito to take the unprecedented step of imposing his own views on official policy. Traditionally the emperor simply approved decisions taken by his cabinet. With the peace and militarist factions within his government still divided over whether to make a last stand against the Allies, Hirohito decided for peace. After key military leaders accepted the emperor’s wishes, Japan sued for peace with the condition that the Imperial Institution remain

ENDING THE PACIFIC WAR



Choices and Consequences
HOW TO USE THE ATOMIC BOMB
President Harry Truman considered the bomb a legitimate weapon to use alongside the more conventional tactics of terror bombing, an economic blockade, and a planned invasion of Japan. He did, however, face four choices over how to exploit this new weapon to meet his goals of securing an unconditional surrender from Japan, saving American lives, and establishing American postwar supremacy over the Soviet Union. 
Choices




Demonstrate the
 bomb’s destructive power in a trial blast on an uninhabited area to convince Japan to surrender.



 Drop one atomic bomb and give Japan time to react.



 Drop the two atomic bombs America had developed.



Inform the Soviet
 Union about the bomb before dropping it.

Decision
 Truman chose to drop both atomic bombs on virgin sites in Japan to magnify the psychological shock of one bomb causing so much destruction. Senior advisers rejected a test demonstration of the bomb as impractical. Truman vaguely informed Stalin of “a new weapon of unusual destructive force,” unaware that spies in the Manhattan Project had already alerted Stalin of the bomb’s existence.

Consequences
 On August 6, 1945, “Little Boy,” the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, destroyed three-fourths of the city and killed 80,000 people instantly. “Fat Man” destroyed two-fifths of Nagasaki and killed 35,000 people on August 9. The Emperor announced Japan’s surrender on August 14. Truman’s attempted secrecy increased Soviet distrust of the United States and unleashed a nuclear arms race between the two nations.

Continuing Controversies
 Should the United States have dropped the bomb? Supporters of Truman’s decision claim that dropping the bomb ended the war. It saved one million American lives by making an invasion of Japan unnecessary and convinced the Japanese government to end the war. Not all supporters, however, agree that the second bomb on Nagasaki was militarily necessary. Critics counter that the bomb was not needed to end the war. Traditional bombing, the blockade, and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria would have ended the war without the planned invasion, they claim. Because the United States accepted a modified surrender that allowed Japan to retain the Emperor, abandoning the demand for unconditional surrender earlier may have convinced Japan to surrender sooner. Finally, some detractors accuse Truman of using the bomb mainly to curtail Soviet territorial ambitions in postwar Europe and Asia. Bomb over Nagasaki, 1945

 intact. Truman agreed, thereby modifying the original goal of unconditional surrender. Could a Japanese surrender have come sooner if the United States had guaranteed the emperor’s office earlier? Before August 6, Truman likened keeping Hirohito to allowing Hitler to remain in power, and he believed that the American people would never accept these terms for peace. In mid-August, however, Truman concluded that letting Hirohito tell the Japanese people to lay down their arms would facilitate the occupation of Japan. Hirohito paved the way for a peaceful surrender, when he addressed the Japanese people on the radio for the first time ever, calling on them to accept his decision. Many of his subjects did not understand Hirohito’s formal Court language, illustrating the social distance

 maintained between the emperor and his subjects. The formal surrender took place on September 2 aboard the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay, attended by delegates from Japan and the Allied nations. The deadliest war in human history, whose death toll is charted in “The Human Cost of Global War” (23.21), had finally ended. When news of the Japanese surrender hit the United States, Americans swarmed into the streets to celebrate the good news. “Every female was grabbed and kissed by men in uniform,” recalled one woman who joined the crowd in Times Square, New York City. The celebrants included a sailor whose impromptu kiss with a passing nurse was captured by Life photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt. The candid shot, “Kiss in Times Square,” became known as “the smack seen round

Three nurses and eleven sailors later claimed that they were the individuals in the photograph. Hirohito was not tried as a war criminal, but the Allies intended to punish other Japanese leaders. In the few weeks between the Japanese surrender and the Allied occupation of Japan, more than 1,000 officials and officers committed suicide and others destroyed thousands of documents concerning Japanese mistreatment of prisoners

 of war and massacres of civilians in occupied countries. Nonetheless, the Allies convicted thousands of Japanese in war crimes trials throughout East Asia, including 28 major Japanese leaders in Tokyo. Combat, genocide, and terror bombing took millions of lives during World War II. Americans could rightly see themselves as having both suffered and caused the war’s deadly violence. The United States emerged from World War II as a military superpower, with new moral and strategic reasons to stay engaged in world affairs after its victories against Germany and Japan.

A
Divided World The Early Cold War, 1945–1963
 As World War II ended, Soviet and American troops, converging from different directions, met and shook hands on a bridge spanning the Elbe River in Germany. Each side was pleasantly surprised by this first encounter with their wartime ally. “They looked like ordinary people. We had imagined something different,” recalled one Soviet soldier of American troops. “I guess we didn’t know what to expect from the Russians,” an American soldier said after the meeting. “If you put an American uniform on them, they could have been American!” Within two years the lost promise of this friendly encounter was obvious to all. A 1947 U.S. propaganda film replayed footage of this historic meeting and struck a lightning bolt across the frozen image of Soviet and American soldiers shaking hands. “Here two worlds actually met,” the narrator thundered, “but this coalition was to be torn asunder” by Soviet postwar incursions in Eastern Europe that the United States viewed as part of a Soviet plan for global conquest. In the decade after the Allies’ victory against Hitler, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union soured dramatically. As the contours of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union took shape, two competing ideological visions, an escalating nuclear arms race, and confrontations in Europe and Asia, including a war in Korea, heightened fears that another world war was in the making. From 1946 to 1965, most Americans viewed the world as sharply divided into free and totalitarian societies. American leaders proclaimed that the United States was engaged in an epic struggle with the Soviet Union over the future of humankind. Protecting the world from the menace of Sovietled communism became a key American foreign policy goal. Americans also fought the Cold War at home, where citizens expressed differing views on whether government tactics in rooting out Soviet spies undermined American democracy or saved it. On the other side of the ideological divide, Soviet leaders developed an abiding distrust of Western motives as they sought to counter the American nuclear advantage with territorial and technological gains. As each nation struggled to extend its world influence, Americans again confronted the crucial question of defining their nation’s role in the world.

 “Communism is on the march on a worldwide scale, which only America can stop.” Senator ARTHUR VANDENBERG, April 26, 1946





 CHAPTER 24

A DIVIDED WORLD: THE EARLY COLD WAR, 1945–1963

Origins of the Cold War
 The United States and the Soviet Union worked effectively together in World War II to defeat Adolf Hitler, but each nation had dramatically different visions of the postwar world. The United States remained dedicated to free markets and democracy, while the Soviet Union embraced a Marxist vision that eschewed private property and celebrated concentrated state authority. Each nation also drew different lessons from the war. For the Soviet leader Josef Stalin, Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union underscored the need to secure its borders by controlling vast territories in Eastern Europe. The United States feared that Stalin was a Hitler-like dictator, intent on controlling all of Europe. American political leaders believed that peace in Europe hinged on spreading capitalism and democracy. These differing, often conflicting, visions triggered an immediate postwar clash between the former allies.

Differing Goals in
 the Postwar World The origins of the Cold War hark back to World War II. The victory against Hitler came at a huge cost for the Soviet Union. An estimated 25 million Soviet soldiers and civilians died, almost 90 times the 291,551 Americans who perished in combat.

 Germany had attacked Russia twice in the 30 years, a fact that contributed to Stalin’s obsession with protecting his nation from future attack. Stalin also suspected that the Americans and British had delayed opening up a second front in Europe (see Chapter 23) to further weaken the Soviet Union, causing him to distrust the United States. This photo (24.1) of a soldier waving the Soviet flag from the

 How does this photograph symbolize the Soviet victory over Germany?

ORIGINS OF THE COLD WAR



 “I have never been talked to like that in my life,” Soviet foreign minister VYACHESLAV MOLOTOV to Truman

 “Carry out your agreements and you won’t get talked to like that.” TRUMAN’S retort, angered over the Soviet’s refusal to hold democratic elections in postwar Poland

 roof of the Reichstag, the German parliament building, above the ruins of Berlin, illustrated Germany’s complete defeat at the end of World War II. It also represented a past that the Soviet Union had no intention of repeating. To protect his borders, Stalin installed puppet Communist governments throughout Eastern Europe to create a buffer zone between Germany and the Soviet Union. He also tried to keep Germany as weak as possible by carting off German heavy machinery to the Soviet Union, disarming the Germany military, and requiring large reparation payments. In the postwar era Stalin fully expected to retain his firm grip on power within the Soviet Union. Standing only five feet four inches tall with a bushy mustache, yellowed teeth from smoking, and a pockmarked face, Stalin was not physically imposing. In this case, however, images were deceiving. “An unforewarned visitor would never have guessed what depths of calculation, ambition, love of power, jealously, cruelty and sly vindictiveness lurked behind this unpretentious façade,” an American diplomat noted. Stalin had been responsible for the deaths of nearly ten million Soviet citizens before World War II, a result of failed agricultural policies that created widespread famine and relentless executions of all suspected opponents. The Soviet dictator was willing to sacrifice countless more lives to achieve his new territorial objectives. The postwar goals on the American side reflected lingering dismay over the nation’s failure to prevent the rise of expansionist regimes in Japan and Germany during the 1930s. Before his death in April 1945, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had argued that American leadership in the new United Nations (UN) could promote a peaceful future by deterring and punishing aggression before it spun out of control. Roosevelt also stressed the importance of preventing another global depression like the one that had helped bring Hitler to power and had fueled non-interventionist sentiment in the United States.

 By themselves these differing ideas on how to maintain peace in Europe did not necessarily guarantee a future clash between the United States and the Soviet Union. During the war the United States and Britain had accepted that the Soviet Union would exert considerable postwar political influence over Eastern Europe. FDR and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, however, had exacted a promise from Stalin to hold free elections in the region. Stalin had offered some backing for Western postwar schemes, agreeing to support the UN and a joint occupation of a defeated Germany. When Harry Truman became president after Roosevelt’s death, even the first signs of Soviet intransigence on fulfilling its wartime agreements failed to produce a permanent rift. To put pressure on Stalin to hold free elections in Soviet-occupied Poland, Truman abruptly canceled Lend-Lease payments, thereby denying much needed aid to the war-torn Soviet Union. When the Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov called on the new president in the White House, Truman went even further, berating Molotov for Stalin’s failure to schedule the promised elections. The long-term impact of this heated exchange was minimal, however. Truman quickly sent an emissary to Moscow to patch things up with Stalin. As a gesture of goodwill, he also reversed his decision to suspend Lend-Lease shipments to the Soviet Union.

The American Vision
 Takes Shape: Kennan’s Long Telegram Over time, however, these initial skirmishes developed into the Cold War. This intense ideological conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union and their allies led to hot wars around the globe, although the Americans and Soviets never fought each other directly. In the opening phases of the Cold War, each side focused on defining

 the exact threat that the other posed. At the heart of this clash lay both conflicting visions of the future and a mutual distrust that only deepened whenever the balance of power threatened to shift dramatically in favor of one nation or the other. To Stalin the American monopoly on nuclear weapons placed the Soviet Union at a strategic disadvantage that he intended to remedy as quickly as possible. For the United States Stalin’s attempt in 1946 to use military force to extend his reach into the Middle East and Mediterranean raised concerns that the Soviet leader sought world domination. Tensions mounted in 1946 when Stalin gave a belligerent speech predicting the inevitable triumph of communism over capitalism. Concerned State Department officials asked the American embassy in Moscow for more information about Stalin’s intentions. The response was the “long telegram,” an influential 5,000-word missive in which diplomat George F. Kennan outlined why America needed to develop an aggressive foreign policy aimed at containing Soviet expansionist impulses. Kennan concluded that Stalin needed an outside enemy to keep himself in power, because an external threat kept the Soviet public from focusing on his ruthless dictatorship. Stalin, Kennan also explained, believed that conflicts between capitalist societies would lead to their demise, allowing communism to triumph when capitalist societies collapsed. Given this Soviet mind-set, negotiations to resolve differences between the two nations would be fruitless, Kennan advised. He suggested strengthening Western-style capitalist and democratic structures to foil communist efforts to woo impoverished peoples. He predicted that Stalin would moderate his ambitions only if he encountered strong and steady resistance from the West each time he tried to expand beyond the Western-accepted Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. “It is clear that the main element of any U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies,” Kennan wrote in a version of the telegram that he published in 1947 under the pseudonym Mr. X in Foreign Affairs magazine. With this one statement Kennan articulated the philosophical foundation for containment, the label affixed to multiple American foreign policy initiatives meant to prevent the Soviet Union from increasing its influence around the globe. Kennan had

 economic and political policies in mind when he penned these words, but hard-liners in the Truman administration seized on his analysis to craft a new vision of U.S. military engagement in the world. A month after Kennan sent his long telegram, the former British prime minister Winston Churchill visited Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, where he used Kennan’s words to underscore that a military, not just ideological, standoff lay ahead. In his speech Churchill declared that there was nothing the Soviets “admire so much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than for military weakness.” Stalin accused Churchill of trying to provoke a war with his comment that an “iron curtain,” Churchill’s characterization of the military and ideological barrier erected by the Soviet Union, separated Western and Eastern Europe into free and dominated halves. Many American newspapers agreed, denouncing Churchill’s speech as too belligerent.

The Truman Doctrine
 and the Marshall Plan Turning the principles of containment into concrete action that had public approval took another year. By the end of 1947, the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan established containment as the new course of American foreign policy, a direction strengthened even further in 1949 with the creation of a post-World War II military alliance between the U.S. and Western European powers through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These initiatives evolved in response to a series of crises in Europe, portrayed in 24.2.

 CHAPTER 24

A DIVIDED WORLD: THE EARLY COLD WAR, 1945–1963

 In 1947, Truman briefly returned to FDR’s notion of working through the UN to resolve international disputes. That year the UN successfully pressured Stalin into removing Soviet troops from northern Iran. Truman also stationed the American Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean to prevent the Soviets from seizing Turkish-controlled shipping lanes through the Dardanelles. Stalin accepted the setback in oilrich Iran without fanfare, but he continued to demand unrestricted naval access through the Dardanelles passage, the only way for Soviet military and commercial vessels to travel from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. In 1947, Stalin sent troops to the Turkish-Soviet border to force Turkey to keep the passage open. The sense of crisis in the eastern Mediterranean soon deepened, encompassing both Turkey and Greece. Throughout 1946, the British had supported the Greek monarchy in its efforts to subdue Greek Communist rebels and had sent aid to Turkey to help it stand firm against the Soviet Union. In 1947, as part of a general decision to renounce its worldwide imperial role, a financially strapped Britain informed the United States that it could no longer give economic or military aid to Greece and Turkey. Fearing that the British withdrawal meant certain Communist success in Greece and Turkey, Truman asked Congress to grant American assistance to these countries. Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson outlined the threat to America in a meeting with congressional leaders. “Like apples in a barrel infected by one rotten one,” Acheson explained, “the corruption of Greece” would “carry the infection” of communism to Western Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In preparing his speech before Congress in 1947, Truman pondered how to convince the public that events in far-off Greece and Turkey necessitated an unprecedented peacetime interference in European affairs. “Scare [the] hell out of the American people,” Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg suggested. Truman followed this advice. Dividing the world into “us” and “them,” he told Americans that “at the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one.” The Western side of the divide championed democracy and freedom. On the other were Communist states where “terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedom” were parts of daily life. Drawing a line in the sand to stop the spread of communism was the nation’s responsibility to the

 world and the only way to protect the American way of life at home. While asking specifically to help Greece and Turkey, in this speech Truman set forth a more expansive view of America’s global responsibilities, asking the country to abandon its traditional non-interventionist stance. Instead the president proposed the Truman Doctrine, a foreign policy initiative that gave the United States an active role in stopping the global spread of communism by supporting “free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” The administration almost immediately used these principles to justify helping Western Europe as well. In the eastern Mediterranean the United States wanted to prevent Communist armies from taking over. In war-torn Western Europe, the American government feared that hungry, exhausted citizens might voluntarily turn to communism, which promised bread for all. Free elections in Western Europe offered the grim possibility that Communists might be voted into power. Embracing Kennan’s vision, Secretary of State George C. Marshall, the former army chief of staff who had designed the victorious American strategy in World War II, suggested offering massive financial aid to help European capitalistic economies recover. The Marshall Plan (1948–1952) aimed to restore Europeans’ faith in capitalism by sending $13 billion ($119 billion in today’s dollars) overseas to rebuild Europe’s ruined roads, bridges, factories, and farms. “Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos,” Marshall claimed, avoiding the dualistic “us” against “them” rhetoric of the Truman Doctrine. Based on the certainty that widespread economic suffering in the 1930s had caused desperate people to embrace fascism, which then led to World War II, the Marshall Plan explicitly linked peace with prosperity. All European nations (including the Soviet Union) were invited to submit proposals for aid. Stalin briefly entertained the idea of applying for American funds to rebuild his devastated nation, but as Marshall and Truman expected, he quickly abandoned this idea. Instead the Soviets publicly denounced the plan as an American plot to colonize Europe and refused to allow Eastern European nations to participate. Besides cash, the Marshall Plan offered European nations technical and management advice that helped spread American farming techniques, labor policies, and manufacturing practices. The economic recovery of Western Europe under the Marshall Plan furthered the ideological

 divide between the United States and the Soviet Union. These political cartoons (24.3 and 24.4) show the conflicting views of the United States and the Soviet Union. The American cartoonist Daniel R. Fitzpatrick (24.3) portrays the Marshall Plan as a lifeline to Western Europe pulling people out of war-inflicted misery and away from the looming Soviet menace (represented by the distant towers of the Kemlin in Moscow, a recognizable symbol of the Soviet Union to Americans). Americans took pride in the wave of Western European prosperity that resulted from the Marshall Plan, making it one of the great economic success stories of the Cold War. The contrasting Soviet view critiques capitalism as an exploitive, class-based system that enriched a few at the expense of many. Published in the Soviet magazine Krokodil, the Soviet cartoon (24.4) shows European leaders groveling at the feet of their American lord, depicted as a paunchy Uncle Sam relaxing with his feet on their backs. This cartoon implied that the Marshall Plan, rather than fostering recovery, enslaved Western Europe to the United States, which grew richer by the day. There was some truth to the Soviet claim that the Marshall Plan, which ran from 1948 to 1952, strengthened the American economy. Western European nations spent most of their funds in the United States on



 raw materials, food, machines, and fuel, creating a taste for American goods that continued even after the Plan ended.

 The Berlin Airlift and NATO Containment quickly evolved into more than a vision of American financial assistance for struggling governments and economies overseas. By 1949, it also meant a firm military commitment to defend Western European nations that allied themselves with America. Almost overnight the United States shed its traditional reluctance to intervene militarily in European affairs, as Americans became convinced that only they could stop Stalin from controlling Europe. In 1948, Stalin supported a coup by Czech Communists that overthrew the only democratic government in Eastern Europe. The quick demise of democracy in Czechoslovakia caused the West to fear that Germany, with its wrecked economy and nonexistent military, might be the next target for a Soviet-inspired communist revolution. With the country still divided into four occupied zones (American, British, French, and Soviet), the German economy was in shambles. Keeping Germany weak to punish it for World War II, initially a shared American and Soviet objective, made little strategic sense as the Soviet menace grew. By 1948, the United States saw strengthening Germany as a way to halt the Soviet expansionist drive across Europe. With this goal

 military confrontation of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States faced difficult choices. One option was to try to breach the blockade by sending an armed convoy down the autobahn (the German name for freeway) with permission to fire back if attacked by Soviet forces. In the midst of a difficult election campaign, Truman doubted Americans’ willingness to fight the Soviet Union to help a recent enemy. The other option was to try to circumvent the blockade by supplying the Westernoccupied sectors of Berlin from the air. The chances of an airlift working appeared slim, since each plane could carry only three tons of supplies, and the West normally sent an average of 12,000 tons of supplies a day to sustain a combined population of 2.3 million in their three zones. Faced with two unappealing choices, Truman gambled on the airlift and won.

 in mind, the United States, Britain, and France began discussing consolidating their separate occupation zones of Germany to form a new democratic German government and offering it Marshall Plan funds to bolster its economy. The Soviet Union firmly opposed any plan for rebuilding Germany and protested that its former allies were violating the 1945 Yalta agreement, which had stated that all four nations had to agree before any restructuring of Germany could occur. As the West and the Soviet Union argued, the stakes rose precipitously. To pressure the United States, Britain, and France to abandon either their plan to reunify Germany or their stake in Berlin, Stalin ordered his army to stop all overland traffic between the Western and Soviet zones of Germany. Berlin lay in the heart of the Sovietoccupied sector, but at the end of World War II, the Allies had agreed to divide the German capital into four zones of occupation, as portrayed on the map (24.5). To supply and reach their respective zones in Berlin, the Americans, British, and French needed to travel on roads, rail lines, and waterways that ran through the Soviet sector of Germany. Stalin now barred them from using these facilities, setting in motion the first direct

 “The situation was dark and full of danger.” State Department official GEORGE F. KENNAN on the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948

 In the Berlin airlift (1948–1949), American and British planes resupplied West Berlin for nearly a year to stymie the Soviet blockade of the city. It was a brilliant success, both a spectacular logistical feat and a propaganda coup for the United States worldwide. In sharp contrast to dour Soviet soldiers turning away convoys carrying needed food and medicine, the world saw photographs of German children cheering the arrival of American and British planes. This photo (24.6) underscored how much the world had changed in just three years. The children stood on the rubble of a building destroyed by Allied bombers during the war. Instead of fleeing for their lives as American planes approached, they now welcomed the Americans as saviors for a city where strict rationing meant most children received only gruel (hot milk and flour) for their noontime meal. Lieutenant Gail Halvorsen was so touched by the sight of children scanning the skies for food planes that he attached candy bars and gum to

 miniature parachutes (with a return address) and dropped them as he flew by. Hundreds of German children sent the original parachutes (and some homemade ones) back to Halverson, along with directions to their homes. “I live in the bombed out house on the corner. I’ll be in the backyard every day at 2 pm, drop it there,” Peter Zimmerman wrote in a letter than included a hand-drawn map. Halverson tried without success to find Peter’s home, resulting in a flurry of increasingly frantic letters. The pilot eventually just mailed him a package of candy after landing in West Berlin. The two later met and became lifelong friends. Images and stories like these convinced Americans of the stark contrast between Western humanitarian impulses and Soviet oppression. They also boosted Truman in the 1948 presidential campaign, as he squared off against the Republican challenger, Thomas Dewey, who led in the polls, and two other third party candidates. Faced with public dissatisfaction over rampant inflation at home and a badly divided Democratic Party, the Berlin airlift bolstered Truman’s image as a resolute leader. Truman could not correct all his political problems with photographs, however. The 1948 presidential campaign presented voters with sharply competing visions of what direction the country should take. Angry over Truman’s
