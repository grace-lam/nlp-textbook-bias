Now That We

Reconstruction and the New South,
1863–1890
 The Civil War ended in April 1865, concluding the bloodiest and most divisive conflict in American history. The period that followed came to be known as Reconstruction for several reasons. Most obviously, the name called to mind the need to rebuild the war-torn South. It also referred to the effort to reestablish the Union torn apart by secession. Finally, it indicated the need to remake Southern society in the wake of slavery’s destruction. The complexities and challenges of this last goal are evident in Winslow Homer’s 1876 painting, A Visit from the Old Mistress, which depicts ex-slaves being visited by their former owner. The elegant clothing worn by the “Old Mistress” suggests she has money, but clearly the relationship between the women has changed significantly in the wake of emancipation. To begin with, the mistress has come to visit the former slaves in their home, suggesting a diminishing of her status and power relative to them. The scene also lacks any sense of the affection that plantation owners always assured themselves existed between slaves and masters. Indeed, the three African American women eye the mistress warily. One of them even chooses to remain seated in what surely would have been considered a show of contempt. The old order was gone, but what would replace it remained unclear in the aftermath of the war. Americans entered the Reconstruction period facing the profound questions raised by war and emancipation. Could whites and former slaves live together in peace and mutual respect? What rights were the freedmen entitled to, and who would guarantee these rights? The different answers articulated by freedmen and white Southerners revealed sharply divergent visions of the future and led to a bitter struggle to define the meaning of freedom. “Verily,” observed ex-slave Frederick Douglass, “the work does not end with the abolition of slavery, but only begins.”

NOW THAT WE ARE FREE: RECONSTRUCTION AND THE NEW SOUTH, 1863–1890

Preparing for Reconstruction
 Long before the Emancipation Proclamation took effect on January 1, 1863 countless thousands of enslaved Africans took advantage of the chaos produced by the war to liberate themselves. Their actions raised a host of questions about what rights the freedmen would be entitled to, including land ownership and voting. Lincoln and his advisers preferred to wait until the war was won before addressing these questions, but actions taken by the freedmen to assert their rights and secure their liberty forced the Lincoln administration to develop policies during the war that ultimately shaped postwar Reconstruction.

Emancipation Test Cases
 Even before the Emancipation Proclamation took effect, the federal government realized that it needed to enact policies regarding the growing numbers of freedmen in areas of the South occupied by the Union army. These policies varied by region and were shaped by local customs and the attitudes of freedmen and white officials. As such, they amounted to test cases for the coming debate over Reconstruction. Three of these test cases revealed both the promise and the conflict surrounding emancipation. The first test case began when federal forces seized the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina in November 1861. They found a vast system of cotton plantations, but no planters. The latter had fled, leaving behind 10,000 slaves, who moved quickly to establish new lives based on their understanding of freedom. While clearly posed, “Planting Sweet Potatoes” (14.1), shot by a New Hampshire photographer visiting a regiment from his state stationed on one of the islands, captured one fundamental way in which ex-slaves expressed their freedom. Rejecting cotton, a crop they associated with slavery, they planted crops of their own choosing, such as sweet potatoes and corn for local consumption. Freedom for the African Americans of the Sea Islands

 meant a future as independent farmers living free of white control. Many Northern whites who arrived after the military takeover, however, brought with them a different vision of the future for the Sea Islands. Convinced that Sea Island blacks should resume their labors on cotton plantations—not as slaves but as paid wage earners—federal officials chose not to grant land to the freedmen. This decision was driven in part by the sincere belief that subsistence farming on small tracts of land was backward, harmful to the long-term

 interests of the freedmen and also by the racist notion that African Americans could not handle freedom responsibly without the guidance of white employers. Consequently, they auctioned the land off to the highest bidder. Northern investors bought most of the land, hired freedmen as wage laborers, and resumed cotton cultivation. A second test case unfolded on Davis Bend, the Mississippi plantations owned by Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his brother Joseph. Before the Civil War, they had tried to make Davis Bend a model slave-labor community, where slaves received better food and were granted considerable autonomy. The Davis brothers hoped other planters would follow their example and thus refute the abolitionist argument that slavery was inhumane. Instead, Davis Bend became a model of a very different sort of ideal, one that vividly demonstrated what freedmen could achieve if granted land and autonomy. When General Ulysses S. Grant arrived and found the former slaves running the plantations, he ordered federal officials to lease land to the freedmen. Unlike the freedmen of the Sea Islands, the African American residents of Davis Bend did not have to contend with Northerners seeking to reassert



 white control over the land and impose a wage labor system. As a consequence, by 1865 Davis Bend residents had established their own local government and cleared a profit of $160,000 in cotton sales. A third and far larger test case for emancipation policy began in Louisiana and was eventually extended up the Mississippi Valley affecting some 700,000 former slaves. Soon after Union forces seized New Orleans in April 1862, army officers established a policy to guide the transition from slavery to emancipation. As in the Sea Islands, the policy reflected the racist belief among Northern whites that African Americans could not responsibly handle their freedom and therefore needed strict rules of conduct and work. Blacks were required to remain on their plantations, working as wage laborers bound by one-year contracts. Those wishing to travel, even for short distances, required a pass from the plantation owner. Runaways and resisters, as depicted in this 1864 drawing (14.2), would be forcibly returned to their plantations. Offsetting these harsh provisions was a ban on corporal punishment for plantation labor. Freedmen bitterly opposed the new system, arguing that it rendered them nearly

 powerless under the authority of their former masters. In New Orleans, home to the South’s largest free black population before the war, African Americans began to demand equal rights for all freedmen, including the right to vote and hold office. Although their efforts failed, they sparked a national debate over freedmen’s rights that would dominate Reconstruction. The experiences in the Sea Islands, Davis Bend, Louisiana, and elsewhere during the war created conflicting visions regarding the rights of freedmen, land redistribution, and the authority of exslave owners. Yet emancipation also revealed the optimism of the freedmen and their commitment to defend their newly won freedom and make the most of it.

 Lincoln’s Ten Percent Plan Even as the Civil War raged, President Lincoln had begun to formulate an official Reconstruction policy. In keeping with his moderate political views before the war, Lincoln proposed a moderate Reconstruction policy. As he suggested so eloquently in his second inaugural address, he intended to deal with the defeated South “with malice toward none” and “charity for all” to “achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves….” He believed that extending lenient terms to the South would convince Confederates to surrender sooner and speed the healing process necessary for the good of the Union. Vengeance, he held, would only delay Reconstruction. It might even inspire defeated Confederate soldiers to form renegade bands of insurgents to wage a war of terrorism for years to come.

 “A more studied outrage on the legislative authority of the people has never been perpetuated.” Wade-Davis Manifesto denouncing Lincoln’s veto of the Wade-Davis Bill In December 1863, Lincoln issued his Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction, also known as the Ten Percent Plan. Intended to establish Southern state governments, the plan pardoned all Southerners (except high-ranking military officers and Confederate officials) who

 took an oath pledging loyalty to the Union and support for emancipation. As soon as 10 percent of a state’s voters took this oath, they could call a convention, establish a new state government, and apply for federal recognition.

Radical Republicans Offer
 a Different Vision Lincoln’s lenient plan enraged many Radical Republicans. In July 1864, Radical Republican leaders Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio and Congressman Henry W. Davis of Maryland cosponsored the Wade-Davis Bill, a Reconstruction program designed to punish Confederate leaders and destroy the South’s slave society. Southerners could reestablish new state governments only after a majority of a state’s voters signed an “ironclad” oath declaring they never aided the Confederate army or government. Southerners who served as high-ranking army officers or government officials would be stripped of their citizenship, including the right to vote and hold office. The former Confederate states would be readmitted only after a long period of punishment and a clear demonstration of their commitment to the Union, emancipation, and freedmen’s rights. Lincoln quietly pocket vetoed the bill. Furious, Radicals sought to replace him as the Republican Party presidential nominee in 1864. Although the effort failed, it exposed the deeply divided opinions regarding Reconstruction. Lincoln and his fellow Republicans did manage to find common ground on two issues. In late January 1865, at the urging of Lincoln’s administration, Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment, abolishing slavery. The measure ended any ambiguity over the Emancipation Proclamation, abolishing slavery everywhere in the United States and offering no compensation to former slaveholders. By year’s end 27 states, including eight former Confederate states, would ratify the amendment. In March 1865, Congress established the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands. Known simply as the Freedmen’s Bureau, it became an all-purpose relief agency in the war-ravaged South, distributing food, providing emergency services, building schools, and managing confiscated lands. It represented the first attempt by the federal government to provide social welfare services and quickly became the bedrock institution for implementing Reconstruction policy.

THE FRUITS OF FREEDOM



The Fruits of Freedom
 Many Southerners were stunned by the response of their slaves to freedom. Clinging to self-serving paternalistic notions of the plantation as one big family under the benign authority of the master and planter, they were taken aback when their slaves refused to obey their orders or exhibited anger or disrespect toward them. Susan Bradford, a young woman living on a Florida plantation, wrote in her diary that she was “hurt and dazed” when one of her former slaves refused to prepare a dinner for her mother. “Tell her if she want any dinner,” sneered the free woman, “she kin cook it herself.” “I believed that these people were content, happy, and attached to their masters,” wrote one South Carolina planter in 1865, unable to comprehend why slaves abandoned their masters “in [their] moment of need.” It would be the first of many such shocking experiences for whites, who never imagined that slavery might one day be abolished.

Freedom of Movement
 Even before the guns of the Civil War went silent, African Americans had begun to explore the meaning of their freedom and formulate their own vision of a reconstructed postwar South, both of which included unrestricted mobility. Under slavery, movement was sharply limited, and few slaves ventured far from their plantations. In the chaos of war, however, and later with official emancipation, African Americans hit the road. Many did so to escape the plantations that were home to their former masters and countless bitter memories. Others simply reveled in free and unfettered movement. They wandered for the pleasure of it with no particular destination in mind. As these advertisements (14.3) from the Colored Tennessean, Tennessee’s only African American–owned newspaper, indicate, many freedmen also journeyed in search of loved ones sold away years before. African American mobility led to a sharp rise in the black population of Southern cities. In contrast to rural life, black settlements in cities offered more varied job opportunities, albeit nearly always menial, difficult, and low paid. Urban life also provided freedmen access to strong black institutions such as churches, charities, and newspapers. Southern whites reacted to black mobility with both alarm and disdain. Just as former slaves equated freedom with mobility, their former masters saw in it a shocking reminder that the old order was gone. As a consequence, in one of the first expressions of resistance to black freedom, white Southerners passed vagrancy laws intended to restrict African American mobility.

 on Land Reform” (1865, 1866)

Forty Acres and
 a Mule Many freedmen also tried to become landowners. If travel was a symbolic expression of their new freedom, land was freedom in concrete form. Land, the freedmen believed, would give their freedom meaning by providing an independent living, free of planter control. The idea that freedmen would receive land in addition to their freedom originated during the war. As Southerners abandoned their plantations before the advancing Union army, ex-slaves often took control, partitioned land, and planted crops. Freedmen defended these extralegal actions as simple justice, citing the generations of unpaid labor that they and their ancestors had performed on farms and plantations. “The property which they [former slaveholders] hold,” asserted a group of freedmen, “was nearly all earned by the sweat of our brows.”

 1865 Special Field Order No. 15. It announced that 400,000 acres of abandoned land from northern Florida to the South Carolina Sea Islands would be distributed to freedman in 40-acre plots. Weeks later Congress established the Freedmen’s Bureau, authorizing it to rent to freedmen 40-acre plots of confiscated and abandoned land, along with a mule. By June some 40,000 freedmen lived on land distributed by Sherman, while thousands more rented plots under control of the Freedmen’s Bureau. Whether they owned land or worked as farm laborers for wages, African Americans used their freedom to change the way they worked. They often refused to work in gangs under overseers because it reminded them of slavery. Instead they preferred working independently, under the direction of elder family members. Many African American women left the field to work in their homes and care for children. African Americans and Radical Republicans wanted land redistribution programs, popularly known as “forty acres and a mule,” enacted across the South. Before long, however, their optimism would give way to bitter disappointment as nearly all the land was returned to its original white owners.

 Uplift through Education Along with land, freedmen sought education as an essential element of their freedom. Laws prohibiting the education of slaves had left most freedmen illiterate. But if they learned to read and write, they

 could conduct their own legal and business affairs, acquire better-paying jobs, read newspapers, and participate more fully in politics. General O. O. Howard, the first head of the Freedmen’s Bureau, also viewed education as an essential goal of Reconstruction. Working with charitable societies and African American leaders, the Freedmen’s Bureau helped build 3,000 schools across the South that by 1870 served 150,000 students of all ages. By 1875, literacy among freedmen jumped from 10 percent to 30 percent (and 52 percent by 1900). In the early years of Reconstruction, educated single white women from the North like the Cooke sisters (14.4) made up the majority of the teachers in these schools. Often sponsored by Northern charitable societies, they saw themselves as missionaries dedicated to the uplift of the freedmen. The journal that published this image in 1866, Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly, shared this vision. Note how the artist depicted the children in spotless attire with all of them focused on their studies. That the vision of these teachers and their sponsors went beyond merely teaching ex-slaves to read is shown in this image (14.5) of a brief biography of African American poet Phillis Wheatley. Published in 1866 by a Boston Christian organization, it demonstrates an effort to inspire ex-slaves’ quest for education and independence by instilling pride in African American achievement. Educating freedmen, however, proved no easy job. Southern whites often put up fierce resistance

14.5 Education and Inspiration

 to African American education, especially in more remote areas. One report in 1865 described the hardships teachers faced: “Compelled to live on the coarsest diet … subjected to the jeers and hatred of her neighbors … swamped in mud—the school shed a drip, and her quarters little better; raided occasionally by rebels, her school broken up and herself insulted, banished, or run off.” The Freedmen’s Bureau and Northern aid societies also established more than a dozen black colleges, including Howard in Washington, D.C., and Hampton in Virginia. One of their most immediate goals was to train black teachers. By 1870, African American teachers outnumbered white teachers in freedmen’s schools. Many freedmen teachers became community leaders and ran for political office. At least 70 former teachers won seats in Southern state legislatures during Reconstruction.

The Black Church
 The vast network of black churches established during Reconstruction provided an even greater source of community leadership. Black churches had existed in the South before the Civil War, but most were part of larger white congregations and subject to strict white control. Southern whites usually insisted that white ministers lead black congregations to ensure that preaching never challenged slavery and white domination. When the war ended, countless African American congregations of Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, and other sects separated from white ones. They resented their inferior status in white-controlled churches and longed to practice a more emotional, expressive worship style disdained by whites. Most important, they wanted black clergymen who could address their spiritual and social needs. Often churches assumed a central place in the lives of freedmen. Religious services provided spiritual and psychological support for blacks’ daily struggles. Churches also ran schools and provided charitable services to the community. As this illustration (14.6) of a freedmen community at Trent River, North Carolina, demonstrates, African Americans built a church in the center that doubled as a schoolhouse and meeting place. Churches also offered African Americans a degree of self-government, electing members to serve as trustees and on committees overseeing parish life and budget management. African American women, in particular, filled numerous roles, planning



 events, raising money, and running programs such as temperance societies. Like their white counterparts, African American churches also sponsored countless initiatives, such as burial societies, fraternal organizations, and youth groups. With the church taking so prominent a place in African American life, black ministers, like black teachers, assumed major leadership roles. White hostility convinced most ministers to concentrate on building up their communities from within. Still, many ministers entered politics to advance the cause of black equality, including more than 100 elected to Southern state legislatures during Reconstruction. Reverend Richard H. Cain, for example, went to Charleston, South Carolina, in 1865, where he assisted at a black church. Two years later he served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention, followed by terms in the state senate and U.S. House of Representatives. African Americans’ response to emancipation showed that they understood freedom as more than simply an end to slavery. Freedom included the right to free movement and travel, to labor for themselves under conditions of their own choosing, on land granted to them by the government. It meant self-improvement through education and self-help organizations. It meant establishing their own institutions and building their own communities. It also meant full civil and social equality with whites, including the right to vote and hold office.

14.6 The Black Church Anchors Freedmen Communities
 African Americans organized thousands of churches across the South to address both their spiritual and social needs. In the freedmen settlement of Trent River, North Carolina, a simple structure served as a church, school, and meetinghouse (from Harper’s Weekly, June 9, 1866).

 How did the black church become such a vital institution in freedmen communities?

The Struggle to Define
Reconstruction
 As freedmen in the South worked to define, protect, and extend their freedoms, political leaders in Washington, D.C., debated how to reconstruct the South. The debate revealed sharply divergent visions of the postwar South’s social, political, and economic order. Radical Republicans wanted to replace the old slavocracy with an interracial democracy protected by federal authority. Conservatives sought to limit Reconstruction to granting ex-slaves freedom and opposed proposals to distribute land and grant full equality to ex-slaves. Moderates held the balance of power in deciding most of these questions, but they lacked a clear vision of the postwar South and made their decisions in response to events as they unfolded. was a bitter racist who abhorred the notion of black equality.

 restored to them virtually all their lands, including the vast tracts of land that had been set aside in 40-acre plots for freedmen. In December, with all 11 former Confederate states having established new governments under his terms, Johnson announced the Union was restored, and Reconstruction was over. Johnson’s actions outraged Northern Republicans, including moderates. This political cartoon (14.7) shows Johnson accepting bags of cash from a former Confederate (depicted as the devil) in exchange for a pardon, while a “Pardoned Reconstruction Rebel” in the lower left kills “Union men and freedmen.” Three developments in the supposedly “reconstructed” South stoked Republican discontent. First, many of the state constitutional conventions had failed explicitly to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment; some even demanded financial compensation for the loss of their slaves. Second, and even more galling, in the state elections in November 1865, Southern voters elected dozens of ex-Confederate



 officials and army officers. Among them was Alexander Stephens, former vice president of the Confederacy, chosen to represent Georgia in the Senate. Third, new Southern state governments, beginning in late 1865 with Mississippi and South Carolina, passed laws known as Black Codes to limit the civil and economic rights of freedmen and create an exploitable workforce. Observing these developments less than a year after the end of the Civil War, many Northerners wondered if the great conflict had been fought in vain. Had hundreds of thousands died to defeat the Confederacy only to see its leaders quickly resume power? Had slavery been abolished only to be replaced with a similar system of unfree labor? One of the most common Black Codes (first established in Mississippi in 1865 and then replicated across the South) established the vague charge of “vagrancy”—having no regular home or employment—as a pretext for controlling freedmen. (See Competing Visions: Demanding Rights, Protecting Privilege.) Any freedman who

Competing Visions
DEMANDING RIGHTS, PROTECTING PRIVILEGE
In the aftermath of the Civil War, one question dominated the minds of Americans North and South: Now that slavery was abolished, what would be the status of the freedmen? While newspaper editors, clergymen, and members of Congress debated the issue, white and black Southerners set out to answer the question themselves. As you read the following documents, one from a convention of freedmen and the other from the state legislature of Mississippi, consider the starkly contrasted visions for the future of Southern society. Why do the freedmen feel compelled to say they bear no ill will toward their “former oppressors?” Why do Mississippi legislators define vagrancy in such vague terms? “Address to the Loyal Citizens and Congress of the United States of America,” Proceedings of the Convention of the Colored People of Virginia, Held in the City of Alexandria, August 2, 3, 4, 5, 1865. We, the delegates of the colored people of the State of Virginia … solemnly declaring that we desire to live upon the most friendly and agreeable terms with all men; we feel no ill-will or prejudice toward our former oppressors; are willing and desire to forgive and forget the past, and so shape our future conduct as shall promote our happiness and the interest of the community in which we live … We must, on the other hand, be allowed to aver and assert that we believe that we have among the white people of this State many who are our most inveterate enemies; who hate us as a class, who feel no sympathy with or for us; who despise us simply because we are black, and more especially, because we have been made free by the power of the United States Government … We claim, then, as citizens of this State, the laws of the Commonwealth [of Virginia] shall give to all men equal protection; that each and every man may appeal to the law for his equal rights without regard to the color of his skin; and we believe this can only be done by extending the franchise, which we believe to be our inalienable right as freemen, and which the Declaration of Independence guarantees to all free citizens of this Government and which is the privilege of this nation. We claim the right of suffrage: 
 Mississippi legislators in December 1865 enacted the first “Black Codes” to limit the freedoms of African Americans. Defining vagrancy in such vague terms allowed white Southerners to arrest freedmen at will and to curtail their freedom of movement. These measures were quickly copied in the remaining ex-Confederate states. Section 1. All rogues and vagabonds, idle and dissipated persons, … persons who neglect their calling or employment, misspend what they earn, or do not provide for the support of themselves or their families, or dependents shall be deemed and considered vagrants, … and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not exceeding one hundred dollars, with all accruing costs, and be imprisoned … not exceeding ten days.… Section 5.… In case of any freedman, free negro or mulatto shall fail for five days after the imposition of any or forfeiture upon him or her for violation of any of the provisions of this act to pay the same, that it shall be, and is hereby, made the duty of the sheriff of the proper county to hire out said freedman, free negro or mulatto, to any person who will, for the shortest period of service, pay said fine and forfeiture and all costs … Colored Men’s Convention 1869.

 hit the road seeking new opportunities could be arrested as a vagrant and fined. If a freedman could not pay his fine, he could be hired out for a time to a local plantation owner willing to pay his fine. As this drawing (14.8) dramatically shows, in some cases the contracts for such labor were auctioned off to local planters. The artist intended to conjure in the minds of Northerners a grim scene reminiscent of a slave auction, suggesting that one of the war’s chief accomplishments, emancipation, was being undermined. Some Black Codes required that the children of “vagrant” freedmen be forced to accept apprenticeships that bound them to an employer until age 21. Others coerced blacks to sign long-term work contracts as proof of employment, a practice that left them at the mercy of employers who were not required to pay them for work performed if they quit before the contract expired. Other laws restricted freedmen to renting land only in rural areas (to keep them on plantations), prohibited ministers from preaching without a license,



 outlawed interracial marriages, and barred blacks from serving on juries.

Congressional Reconstruction
 and the Fourteenth Amendment Republicans in Congress vowed to block Johnson’s rapid and lenient Reconstruction program for both idealistic and practical reasons. Excepting emancipation, none of the Republicans’ goals for changing Southern society had been accomplished, and the former slavocracy appeared poised to resume power—a result certain to revive the Democratic Party. A slower process of Reconstruction would allow the Republican Party to take root in the South, especially if African Americans were granted the right to vote, as many Radicals like Congressman Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania demanded. The confrontation began in January 1866 when Congress reconvened. Republicans first refused

 to admit the senators and representatives from the former Confederate states Johnson had declared reconstructed. Next, they established the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, a body that gathered evidence and testimony from hundreds of witnesses detailing widespread lawlessness and violence against freedmen and their white allies in the South. To counteract Southern resistance and the oppression of freedmen, Congress passed two bills. The first expanded the powers of the Freedmen’s Bureau and authorized it to continue operations for two more years. The second, the Civil Rights Act, declared African Americans and all persons born in the United States (except Native Americans) citizens. It also defined the rights of all citizens regardless of race—for example, the right to sue and to make contracts. Taking direct aim at the Black Codes, the law prohibited state

 governments from depriving any citizen of these “fundamental rights.” Johnson, infuriated at Congress’s rejection of his Reconstruction program and determined to thwart efforts to establish racial equality, vetoed both bills. Congress overrode the vetoes and the bills became law, but by June 1866, Republicans decided bolder action was necessary. Johnson remained opposed to freedmen’s rights, and violence against blacks was on the rise in the South. The worst incident (14.9), was a race riot in Memphis, Tennessee, on May 1–2 that left 46 blacks, many of them Union army veterans, and two whites dead. This drawing from Harper’s Weekly, a widely read publication that favored freedmen’s rights, was intended to arouse anger in the North over Southern intransigence and support for congressional action. The Civil Rights Act was an unprecedented piece of legislation,

THE STRUGGLE TO DEFINE RECONSTRUCTION

 but its supporters knew that it could easily be overturned by a future Congress. An amendment, on the other hand, became a permanent part of the Constitution. On June 13, 1866, Republicans passed the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Its five main provisions radically redefined the role of the federal government as the guarantor of individual civil rights. First, it declared all persons born or naturalized in the United States as citizens, a definition that necessarily included all freedmen. Second, all citizens were entitled to “equal protection of the laws” of the states where they lived. Third, states that denied adult male citizens, including African Americans, the right to vote would have their representation in Congress reduced. Fourth, all highranking former Confederates were prohibited from holding public office, unless pardoned by act of Congress. Fifth, it repudiated the Confederate debt (thus punishing those who lent money to the Confederacy) and prohibited financial compensation for ex–slave owners. Johnson greeted the unprecedented amendment with an unprecedented response: He went on the campaign trail to urge its defeat. Hoping to make the midterm state and congressional elections in November 1866 a referendum on the amendment, Johnson and his allies played on white racism, conjuring up images of racial equality and racial intermarriage to alarm Northern whites. Republicans responded in kind, portraying Johnson and the Democrats as traitors who waged war on the Union. Republicans won a sweeping victory in November. Northern voters, although still leery of racial equality, rejected Johnson’s lenient form of Reconstruction because it required too little of Southerners and restored planter rule.

Republicans Take Control
 Emboldened by their legislative and electoral success, congressional Republicans moved to take complete control of Reconstruction policy. In March 1867, Congress passed the first of four Reconstruction Acts. They divided the South (except Tennessee) into five military districts, each governed by a military commander empowered to restore peace and protect individuals, especially freedmen. As soon as order was established, the ex-Confederate states could begin a new, stricter readmission process. The act called for elections to select delegates to state constitutional conventions— elections that permitted African American men to



 vote, but barred Southerners who had served in the Confederate government and army. The new state constitutions drawn up by these conventions had to allow universal male suffrage, regardless of race. As soon as a state’s voters approved the new constitution, the state could hold elections to fill government offices. Finally, if Congress approved the state’s constitution and the state legislature ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, the state would be readmitted to the Union. Two years after the end of the Civil War, the federal government had finally adopted a clear Reconstruction plan. The delay was understandable, given Lincoln’s assassination and the lack of precedent. Yet delay granted Southerners time to recover from the war and mount an effective resistance to federal intervention.

 “The President has no power to control or influence anybody and legislation will be carried on entirely regardless of his opinion or wishes.” Republican Senator JAMES W. GRIMES, Iowa, January 1867

 President Johnson promptly vetoed the Reconstruction Acts, but the Republican Congress passed them again over his veto. Some of the more radical Republicans grew so embittered by the president’s actions and words that they attempted to remove him from office. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton in August 1867, Republicans charged him with violating the Tenure of Office Act, a constitutionally dubious measure they had passed in March. It required the president to seek congressional approval before removing a cabinet official. The House voted to impeach the president, charging him with 11 offenses. The trial began in March 1868 and after two months of heated debate and accusation, the Senate failed—by one vote—to convict Johnson and remove him from office. Johnson was saved by some moderate Republicans who feared setting a bad precedent if a politically motivated campaign succeeded in removing a president from office. Many moderate Republicans also considered Johnson’s likely replacement, Senator Benjamin Wade, far too radical. They also knew Johnson had less than a year left in office.

NOW THAT WE ARE FREE: RECONSTRUCTION AND THE NEW SOUTH, 1863–1890

Implementing Reconstruction
 As Congress engaged in its impeachment struggle with President Johnson in 1867–1868, the Reconstruction Acts took effect. A coalition of African Americans, poor up-country whites, and economically ambitious merchants (many originally from the North) and white planters formed the Republican Party in the South. They seized the opportunity presented by the congressional Reconstruction program and dominated the process of electing state governments and gaining readmission to the Union. The task would not be easy, especially as their different goals conflicted with each other and with those of most white Southerners, who would clearly oppose—politically, economically, and violently—any attempt to establish what they called “Negro rule.” 14.10 The Hated Scalawag Scalawags became despised figures in the popular Southern mind. Here a scalawag is depicted as an opportunist seeking political power by manipulating the black vote.

The Republican Party
 in the South The process of remaking state governments under the Reconstruction Acts fell to the Republican Party in the South, an organization comprising three distinct and in some cases antagonistic groups: Northerners who settled in the South, white Southerners,

 and former slaves. Northerners who moved south after the war were derided as carpetbaggers by white Southerners. The term suggested they were poor opportunists who carried to the South only a cheap suitcase, or carpetbag, which they intended to fill with plunder garnered from Southerners still reeling from the war. In reality most were middle class, often former Union soldiers or merchants, ministers, artisans, and professionals who viewed the South as a region of opportunity where they planned to settle permanently. Others came as idealistic relief workers, sent by Northern charitable and religious societies, intent upon aiding ex-slaves in their transition to freedom. The Republican Party in the South also contained many white Southerners. Most white Southerners referred to them derisively as scalawags and considered them traitors to their region and race, men eager to accrue riches and power by manipulating black voters (14.10). Most scalawags came from the less developed backcountry regions of the South, especially eastern Tennessee and Kentucky, northern Alabama and Georgia, and western North Carolina. Like carpetbaggers, they believed that the Republican Party offered them and their region the best chance for economic betterment. Most did not, however, embrace on the idea of racial equality. Former slaves made up the largest (about 80 percent), most significant segment of the South’s Republican Party. Empowered with the vote by the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and Reconstruction Act of 1867, African Americans turned out in huge numbers in late 1867 to vote in elections held to select delegates to state constitutional conventions. For supporters of black suffrage, this extraordinary moment—persons only recently considered property now exercising for the first time the right to vote—was captured in

 this Harper’s Weekly drawing (14.11). The dignified scene depicts three voters who symbolically represent a spectrum of blacks that includes common laborers, educated blacks who were free before the war, and Union army veterans. Most African American Republican leaders came from the second group. They tended to come from the North and possessed more wealth and education than the average freedman. The three factions of the Republican Party—carpetbaggers, scalawags, and freedmen—formed an uneasy alliance as they came together to reestablish Southern state governments. Nonetheless, their combined votes in the 1867 elections for delegates to state constitutional conventions led to a sweeping Republican victory. White Republicans, even though they comprised only 20 percent of party membership, won most of the seats. But freedmen won 265 seats overall and a majority of seats in South Carolina and Louisiana.

Creating Reconstruction
Governments in the South
 Republican delegates soon drafted new constitutions for former Confederate states according to the guidelines established by the Reconstruction Acts. In a few states, notably Virginia and Texas, conservatives delayed the process for more than a year. But by the end of 1868, seven Southern states had ratified new constitutions, created new governments, and been readmitted to the Union. These Republican governments achieved remarkable results. To begin with, they represented a revolutionary advance in the status of the freedmen. Held as slaves and denied citizenship only a few years before, African Americans now enjoyed

 the right to vote and hold office. Between 1869 and 1901, 22 African Americans would serve in Congress (20 representatives and 2 senators). More than 600 would win seats in state legislatures and to other state offices. While embittered white Southerners decried what they termed “Negro rule,” statistics show that white Republicans held a far greater share of offices than blacks. No African American was elected governor, and no state legislature ever had a black majority (the South Carolina lower house briefly had a black majority). What white Southerners really objected to was Republican rule

 and what it stood for: African American equality and empowerment. Republican-controlled Southern state governments also achieved several significant reforms. In contrast to the tightfisted governments of the antebellum era, they funded public works projects, built hospitals and orphanages, and founded public school systems. They also enacted more equitable tax codes and passed laws to help indebted farmers keep their land. Opponents of Republican rule denounced these initiatives (and the higher taxes needed to fund them) as wasteful and poorly managed. Fundamentally, they objected to their social and racial implications, since many of the projects were designed to aid the poor and freedmen. But the charges of corruption, mismanagement, and debt lodged by the opponents of Reconstruction governments were not entirely groundless. The rapid expansion of government services and expenditures caused many states to run up large deficits. It also created opportunities for graft and bribery which some Reconstruction legislators took advantage of. Democratic opponents railed against these abuses as alleged evidence that blacks were incapable of holding office and that their white allies were

 interested only in plunder. In reality the corruption in Southern state governments paled in comparison to that found in the North. New York’s Tammany Hall political machine, for example, under William “Boss” Tweed, stole more than $20 million from 1869 to 1871. Moreover, the spending by Southern state governments on social programs looked large only compared to the paltry expenditures on education, health care, and public works before the war. Nonetheless, charges of corruption and excessive spending, coupled with increased taxes, diminished support for the Southern Republican governments and created an unfavorable impression in the North.

 “We cannot vote without all sorts of threats and intimidations. Freedmen are shot with impunity.” Report of a Republican official, 1868

The Election of 1868
 By summer 1868, there was little doubt whom the Republican Party would nominate for president. General Ulysses S. Grant enjoyed widespread popularity across the North and among Southern Republicans for defeating Robert E. Lee and ending the Civil War. Grant conveyed a tone of moderation in a time of partisan and sectional acrimony. “Let us have peace,” became his campaign slogan. Democrats, still weak in the aftermath of the war and the disenfranchisement of many exConfederates, faced an uphill battle against Grant. Note how this political cartoon (14.12) “‘Tis But A Change of Banners” from a pro-Republican journal sought to link the Democratic nominees for president Governor Horatio Seymour of New York and for vice president Francis Blair of Maryland with both secession and postwar racial violence. But as this racist Democratic campaign song makes clear (14.13), Seymour ran an aggressive campaign designed to arouse fears that the Republican Party and black suffrage threatened the rights of white Americans. Republicans, his campaign claimed, must be prevented from spreading the disastrous experiment in black political empowerment to the North. Running on a message of political moderation, fiscal responsibility, and an even-handed approach

14.13 The Politics of Racism
 The campaign of Democratic Party nominees Horatio Seymour and Francis Blair appealed to white voters’ racism though the nominees’ speeches, campaign literature, and songs such as this one, “The White Man’s Banner.”

 to Reconstruction, Grant won 214 electoral votes to Seymour’s 80. The popular vote, however, was much closer: 53 percent for Grant, 47 percent for Seymour (14.14). This outcome reflected three things. First, it indicated the wide appeal of Seymour’s blatantly racist message to conservative whites in both North and South. Second, it showed how vital the freedman vote was for the Republican Party. Grant received nearly 500,000 African American votes, but won by only 300,000 votes. Third, it revealed the effectiveness of violence as a weapon in electoral politics. A reign of terror unleashed by violent whites before the election, especially in Georgia and Louisiana, kept thousands of black voters away from the polls.

 on the rise, many Republicans argued that another amendment was necessary to guarantee unequivocally the right of African Americans to vote. Women’s rights activists agreed, but many also argued for universal suffrage—the vote for all adult citizens regardless of race or gender. Bitterly disappointed over the reference to only “male citizens” in the Fourteenth Amendment, feminists, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, demanded that any subsequent amendment include women. This demand was opposed by former abolitionists and Radical Republicans, including fellow feminists like Lucy Stone and Frances Harper, who argued that gaining the vote for African American men was a higher priority. Including women, they argued, would doom the amendment because the nation was not ready for such radical change. The cause of women’s suffrage could be taken up immediately after black suffrage was secured. Stanton and Anthony rejected this reasoning, leading to a twenty-year split in the women’s rights movement. Most Republicans in Congress, however, agreed with Frederick Douglass’s assertion that this was the “Negro’s Hour,” and they drafted the Fifteenth Amendment to read succinctly: “The right of citizens of the United States shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” Passed by Congress in late 1869 and ratified in 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment presented a striking contradiction. It established a revolutionary experiment in interracial democracy, something no other slave society, such as those in the Caribbean or 3,013,421

 Latin America, did so soon and so completely after emancipation. Yet its spare wording left wide open the possibility that states could devise clever ways to deny blacks the right to vote that did not directly invoke “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”

The Rise of White Resistance


14.15 Another
Victim of the Klan
 Terrorist violence by white vigilante groups soared in the early 1870s. In this scene from Moore County, North Carolina, a freedman pleads for his life, surrounded by Klansmen in full regalia.

 The secret white terrorist organizations that first arose in 1866 and that wrought havoc in parts of the South during the 1868 election grew bolder and more violent by 1870–1871, especially during election season. Known by various names, including the White Brotherhood, Knights of the White Camelia, and especially the Ku Klux Klan, they functioned in much the same manner. As illustrated in a popular Northern newspaper (14.15), Klansmen often operated at night, wearing hoods, robes, and other regalia to hide their identities and terrify their victims. Blacks (and occasionally carpetbaggers and scalawags) targeted for “punishment” were beaten and frequently killed. Some had their crops or homes burned or their mules killed. Klansmen also targeted symbols of black self-improvement and independence, such as black churches, businesses, and schools.

 Why did groups like the Klan indulge in anti-black violence?

 Klan terrorism served many purposes. For the poor whites who made up the bulk of Klansmen, the violent suppression of African Americans provided the psychological reassurance that they were not at the bottom of the social order. For white elites who approved of and often assisted the violence, it prevented a political alliance between poor whites and blacks. It also maintained a large, exploitable workforce for plantations and industry by keeping African Americans powerless and poor. Klan violence also discouraged African American voting and thus threatened the Republican Party in the South. In response to surging violence in the South, Republicans in Congress, with strong support from the Grant administration, passed several Enforcement Acts in 1870 and 1871, outlawing “armed combinations” that deprived anyone of their civil or political rights. The Justice Department vigorously enforced these laws across the South, arresting and prosecuting thousands and weakening significantly the Klan and similar organizations by 1872. Although the Enforcement Acts demonstrated that federal authority could effectively protect the rights of freedmen, they also revealed the vulnerability of freedmen should the federal commitment to Reconstruction ever wane.

RECONSTRUCTION ABANDONED



Reconstruction Abandoned
 By the end of Grant’s first term in office in 1873, supporters of Reconstruction and freedmen’s rights could look with satisfaction at the many extraordinary changes that had taken place in the South. Yet ominous signs suggested Reconstruction was in trouble. Despite the crackdown on the Klan, white Southerners increasingly demonstrated their commitment to seizing power and imposing a new form of servitude on African Americans. Northerners, by contrast, seemed less and less willing to support a vigorous Reconstruction policy. Slowly, from 1872 to 1877, the extraordinary experiment in interracial democracy and progressive government in the South was dismantled in favor of oligarchy and white supremacy.

Corruption and Scandal
 A major factor in the pullback from Reconstruction was a series of corruption scandals that plagued the Grant administration. Grant himself was honest, but also politically naive and given to a hands-off style of leadership that gave officials in his administration unusual independence. Many of them took advantage of Grant’s trust to enrich themselves through illegal schemes. For example, in the 1869 “Black Friday” scandal, Wall Street titans Jay Gould and Jim Fisk conspired with Grant’s brother-in-law to corner the gold market. The plan failed but not before hundreds of innocent investors were ruined. In the Credit Mobilier scandal, Grant’s vice president and several high-ranking members of Congress took bribes from the company involved in the completion of the government-subsidized Union Pacific Railroad. In the so-called “Whiskey Ring” scandal, Treasury Secretary Orville E. Babcock made a fortune by illegally allowing whiskey distillers to avoid paying excise taxes. In yet another scandal, Secretary of War William W. Belknap accepted bribes from companies engaged in corrupt activities on Indian reservations. With so much negative publicity stirred up by corruption scandals, Grant’s administration took steps to minimize political controversies. To secure his reelection and keep the Republican Party in power, Grant adopted a more conservative approach to Reconstruction, by now a frequent source of rancor in Washington. In summer 1872, for example, Grant lobbied Congress for and then signed into law the Amnesty Act, granting a general pardon to all but a few hundred former Confederate leaders. Now eligible to vote and

 hold office, these planters and ex-Confederate army officers and officials wasted little time in reasserting their authority.

Republican Disunity
 The retreat from Reconstruction in the 1870s was also hastened by growing dissention within the Republican Party. Many Republicans, including some former Radicals, began to question the wisdom of maintaining a strong federal role in the affairs of Southern states. Some argued the fundamental goals of Reconstruction—citizenship, civil rights, and suffrage for the freedmen—had been accomplished. There was, they believed, a constitutional and moral limit to what the federal government could do for the freedmen. Now was the time for freedmen to use their new rights to elevate themselves economically, socially, and politically. Other Republicans argued for an end to Reconstruction for less idealistic reasons. Even though some of them had been abolitionists before the war and advocates of freedmen’s rights in the first years that followed, they now considered Reconstruction a failure. These Liberal Republicans, as they came to be called, had grown tired of the political strife produced by debates over freedmen’s rights.

 They also worried about the growing power of the 2,834,761 federal government. 43.8% Liberal Republicans also expressed disgust over the corruption and mismanagement of Southern Reconstruction governments. They accepted the argument of Southerners that freed0* men and their white allies were incapable of honest and effective govHorace Greeley ernment. No one embod(Democrat, Liberal Republican) ied this dramatic change of heart more than Horace Greeley, the progressive editor of the New York Tribune. Once the outspoken champion of abolition and freedmen’s rights, by the early 1870s, he advocated returning the South to white rule. Blacks, he wrote in 1870, were a “worthless race,” who would rather accept charity than help themselves. Their Reconstruction governments were based on “ignorance and degradation.” A similar transformation from a progressive to a reactionary view of Reconstruction was revealed in the political cartoons of Thomas Nast (see Images as History: Political Cartoons Reflect the Shift in Public Opinion).

The Election of 1872
 The dissatisfaction of Liberal Republicans reached full bloom in summer 1872. Disturbed by the prospect of Grant being renominated for a second term, they broke with the Republican Party and held their own convention in Cincinnati where they nominated Greeley for president. A divided Democratic Party also endorsed Greeley. But the election of 1872 proved disastrous for Greeley and his backers. The public viewed Greeley as an eccentric who during his long career in public life had supported many fringe causes such as vegetarianism, spiritualism, and utopianism. Greeley’s call for an end to Reconstruction and reconciliation between North and South also repelled many Northern voters who still associated Southerners and the Democratic Party with secession and civil war. In Grant’s sweeping victory over Greeley (14.16), Republicans had good reason to cheer. The Democrats’ and Liberal Republicans’ call for

 ending Reconstruction and returning the South to white rule had been rejected. Moreover, the Grant administration’s crackdown on the Klan had allowed African Americans unprecedented freedom to vote. Still, Northerners and Republicans in Congress were not prepared to support federal intervention in the South indefinitely. As new pressing issues emerged after 1872, support for Reconstruction rapidly eroded.

Hard Times
 The American economy had boomed after the Civil War. Hundreds of thousands of new businesses were established. These included massive factories that employed hundreds, in some cases thousands, of workers. Aiding this economic growth was the dramatic expansion of the railroad and telegraph systems and increased availability of capital through banks and stock sales. The booming economy encouraged businesses to expand and investors to take bigger risks. When these trends reached a critical point in late1873, a panic on Wall Street ensued. Some of the nation’s most prominent financial houses and banks went bankrupt. As credit became scarce, businesses began to fail. Hundreds of thousands of workers lost their jobs. By early 1874, the nation’s economy had plunged into a deep depression that lasted until 1877. The Panic of 1873 directly affected Reconstruction. As hard times set in, the fate of the freedmen became less of a concern to Northerners. Economic issues like currency reform and the tariff took precedence over civil rights and white vigilante violence against freedmen. The public, declared one Republican, is tired of hearing about Southern violence against the freedmen: “Hard times and heavy taxes make them wish the ‘everlasting nigger’ were in hell or Africa.” The public expressed its discontent in the congressional elections of 1874 by voting in a Democratic majority in the House for the first time since the war.

The Return of Terrorism
 Reconstruction was also undone by a resumption of violence waged by white terrorist groups like the Klan. As the Grant administration bowed to political pressure to reduce federal intervention in Southern affairs, advocates of white supremacy seized the opportunity. In one notorious incident in 1873, a large band of heavily armed whites overran

Images as History
POLITICAL CARTOONS REFLECT THE SHIFT IN PUBLIC OPINION
One of the nation’s most skilled and popular political cartoonists in the Reconstruction era was Thomas Nast. An immigrant from Germany, he landed a job in 1861 at Harper’s Weekly, the nation’s leading journal of politics and society. Nast’s artistic talent, combined with Harper’s vast circulation, soon turned him into one of the most influential illustrators of his day. As a staunch Republican and Unionist, his drawings during the Civil War were as intensely patriotic and proLincoln as they were anti-Confederate. After the war, Nast’s widely distributed cartoons continued to shape Northern opinion about Reconstruction and freedmen’s rights. Cartoons like And Not This Man? (August 5, 1865) proclaimed the dignity and humanity of the freedmen and their moral right to full citizenship and suffrage. In This is a White Man’s Government (September 5, 1868), he stressed the violent intent of white Southerners to reclaim power and the necessity of federal authority in carrying out the goals of Reconstruction. Nevertheless, Nast’s cartoons eventually reflected the growing disillusionment of Northern Republicans regarding Reconstruction. While he rejected the Liberal Republican call to end Reconstruction, Nast 
 nonetheless expressed the fear that African Americans were incapable of responsible government. Note the contrast between his earlier depictions of freedmen and that in Colored Rule in a Reconstructed (?) State (March 14, 1874). “Columbia,” an early symbol of America and democracy, advocates black suffrage. The globe is actually a nineteenthcentury ballot box.

 Colfax, Louisiana and slaughtered over 100 African Americans. Just as in the late 1860s, white vigilante violence had two goals: to strip away the freedmen’s hardwon rights and prevent them from voting and holding office. This effort peaked in Mississippi in 1875 when armed groups of whites closely allied with the Democratic Party waged a campaign of terror that came to be known as the Mississippi Plan. Through threats, beatings, and killings, they delivered an unambiguous message: blacks and their white allies who dared vote Republican risked their lives. But the Grant administration rejected Governor Adelbert Ames’s request to send troops to keep the peace and protect the polls. Not surprisingly, more than 60,000 Mississippi voters—nearly all black and Republican— stayed away from the polls on Election Day. Democrats swept to victory and took control of the state legislature for the first time since the Civil War. Immediately they threatened Governor Ames with impeachment and forced him to resign. The success of the Mississippi Plan in intimidating black voters and demolishing the Republican Party is indicated in this 1876 image, Of Course He Wants to Vote the Democratic Ticket (14.17). The artist shows the ruthless character of the white supremacy movement and the vulnerability of freedmen left without federal protection. Other Southern states soon employed their own version of the Mississippi Plan. One by one the remaining Reconstruction governments

 fell to a new class of political leaders known as Redeemers. As the name suggests, they cast themselves in almost biblical terms as saviors of Southern society. By 1876, only South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida remained under Republican control—largely because of the presence of federal troops. The removal of these troops in 1877 opened the way for the complete “redemption” of the former Confederacy and the restoration of white supremacy. Defenders of Reconstruction and the rights of freedmen in Congress were appalled at the rising tide of Redeemer oppression. In response they managed one final measure to bolster the rights of freedmen, the Civil Rights Act of 1875. It required that state governments provide equal access in public facilities such as schools and allow African Americans to serve on juries. The law was largely ignored, and in 1883 the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional.

The End of Reconstruction
 The final blow to Reconstruction occurred as the result of the presidential election of 1876. With the Democratic Party reinvigorated by gaining a majority in the House in 1874 and control of most Southern state governments by 1876, a close election was expected. The Democrats nominated Samuel J. Tilden, governor of New York and a well-known reformer. Republicans nominated Ohio governor and Civil War veteran Rutherford B. Hayes. The issues centered on political corruption, the failed economy, and of course, Reconstruction. On Election Day Tilden received 250,000 more popular votes than Hayes (14.18). But the electoral vote—which actually determines the victor—was unclear. Voting irregularities in South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida left both sides claiming victory—and the 19 electoral votes at stake in those states (one electoral vote was also in dispute in Oregon). Tilden needed to be declared the winner in only one of these four states to win a majority of electoral votes and thus the presidency. Hayes needed to win all three Southern states plus the Oregon vote to put him one electoral vote ahead of Tilden and into the White House. Both sides refused to budge, and a constitutional crisis loomed. Eventually they agreed

14.18 The Election of 1876
 In one of the most controversial presidential elections in U.S. history, Samuel B. Tilden won the popular vote (4,284,020 to 4,036,572), but lost the electoral vote to Rutherford B. Hayes, 185 to 184.

 March 2, 1877, the commission issued its decision, known as the Compromise of 1877. By a vote of eight to seven, the 15-member commission awarded all 20 disputed electoral votes to Hayes, giving him a 185 to 184 electoral vote victory over Tilden. Democrats denounced the “stolen election.” Yet the result proved beneficial to the party. Hayes’s presidency was weakened by the aura of illegitimacy (detractors referred to him as “his fraudulency”). More important, as part of a behindthe-scenes deal, he oversaw the final steps in the dismantling of Reconstruction. By the end of 1877, the last federal troops were removed from the South, and as the map (14.19) indicates, the last Reconstruction governments fell to Democratic Redeemers.

 CHAPTER 14

NOW THAT WE ARE FREE: RECONSTRUCTION AND THE NEW SOUTH, 1863–1890

The New South
 The optimism with which white Southerners greeted the end of Reconstruction gave rise to the term New South. It reflected the South’s development of a new system of race relations based on segregation and white supremacy. Even more so, the New South pointed to a profound economic transformation that swept across the region, bringing with it a boom in manufacturing, railroad construction, and urbanization.

Redeemer Rule


The Lost Cause


 The Redeemer governments that took control of Southern states by 1877 represented a new ruling oligarchy. Before the war a small and powerful class of planters dominated Southern politics. Now, in the aftermath of Reconstruction, a new elite took control. Although some were planters and former planters, most were men who drew their wealth and power from a new Southern economy based on industry, finance, commerce, and railroad construction. As men of business their politics reflected the dominant conservative economic theory of the era, which argued that the best form of government was small, frugal, and pro-business. Accordingly, Redeemer governments slashed taxes and spending on social programs and public education created during Reconstruction. Redeemer politics also championed a return to white supremacy. The return of one-party (Democratic) rule in most Southern states resulted in a steady decline in office holding by African Americans and Republicans. Intimidation and violence also led to a marked decrease in black voting across the South. Despite these setbacks, however, African Americans in many Southern states managed to vote and hold office in appreciable numbers into the 1880s and 1890s. Redeemer rule did not go unchallenged. In several states anger among poor farmers coalesced into full-fledged political challenges to oligarchic rule, inequitable taxation, and cuts to social programs. These insurgents denounced the new elite as “Bourbons” (the name of the former French royal family), a derogatory term that implied aristocratic ambitions. In Virginia, for example, a coalition of Republicans and disaffected Democrats called Readjusters turned out the Redeemer government in 1879. All of these challenges to Redeemer rule, however, ultimately failed.

 Southerners after 1877 embraced not only Redeemer rule, but also an image of the prewar South as an ideal society and the Confederate bid for independence a valiant Lost Cause. Southerners clung to this image because it provided them with a psychologically soothing explanation for why they lost the war. According to the Lost Cause idea, Confederate society was more virtuous than the North and its soldiers braver, but the South lost because the Yankees possessed overwhelming advantages in population, industry, arms, and ruthlessness. Defeat, while bitter and painful, was also a glorious martyrdom for a people and a way of life. Southerners expressed this interpretation of the war as a glorious, yet ill-fated campaign in poems, plays, songs, speeches, sermons, and books. One of the most popular Lost Cause poets was Rev. Abram Ryan, a Catholic priest from Norfolk, Virginia. Many of his poems, such as “The Conquered Banner,” became required recitations among white Southern schoolchildren for decades. These works by Ryan and others stressed courage, glory, duty, sacrifice, and the need for true Southerners to honor their Confederate heroes forever. As Ryan put it in one of his poems:

 What groups constituted the political leadership of the New South?

 But their memories e’er shall remain for us, And their names, bright names, without stain for us; The glory they won shall not wane for us, In legend and lay Our heroes in Gray Shall forever live over again for us. The Lost Cause carried with it an obligation to keep alive the memory of Confederate glory. Southerners built elegant battlefield cemeteries to inter the war dead and monuments to celebrate Confederate victories. White Southern women, many widowed by the war, played a major role in these efforts,

THE NEW SOUTH

 founding organizations such as the Ladies Memorial Association (1867) and the United Daughters of the Confederacy (1894). Southerners also erected thousands of statues honoring Confederate soldiers, including legends like Generals Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and Nathan Bedford Forrest. The photograph (14.20) demonstrates how enthusiasm for the Lost Cause only grew the further the Civil War receded into history. Lee had discouraged efforts to raise monuments to the Confederate cause, but soon after he died in 1870, they sprang up across the South, including this monumental rendering unveiled in Richmond in 1890. Thousands turned out for the dedication of the heroic statue by French sculptor Antonin Mercie and to hear Colonel Archer Anderson laud Lee for his “courage, will, energy …



 fortitude, hopefulness, joy in battle … [and] unconquerable soul.” Nothing that day, certainly not the speeches or Lee’s triumphant pose, recalled the fact that Lee had lost the war. But the Lost Cause legend served a second purpose beyond helping Southerners cope with their defeat in the war. It celebrated a nostalgic vision of the prewar South that supported their arguments for a resumption of white rule and African American subservience. Through literature, art, and music, Southerners (and some Northerners) fashioned romantic depictions of the “Old South” as a harmonious paradise where benevolent masters treated loyal, contented slaves with kindness, where chivalrous Southern gentlemen protected delicate, charming women, and where everyone revered tradition, family, and the Bible. Yet even as they glorified slavery, the proponents of the Lost Cause downplayed its importance as a cause of secession. The real issue, they insisted, was “states’ rights” and attempts by Northerners to run roughshod over them in the 1850s. The Lost Cause thus presented Southerners as victims of misguided and unjustified Yankee aggression who, in the wake of devastating war and humiliating Reconstruction, ought to be left alone to run their own affairs. The overt racism and self-serving depictions of slavery in Lost Cause rhetoric and imagery served to justify a resumption of white rule and the return of African Americans to the status of powerless, exploitable laborers.

The New South
Economy
 Even as Southerners revered the Lost Cause and Old South, their new leadership steered the region’s economy into an industrial future. In the 1870s and 1880s, they joined with Northern entrepreneurs who settled in the South during Reconstruction to develop a modern, market-oriented, and diversified economy. This effort entailed not simply the establishment of banks, textile mills, and railroads, but also the celebration and spreading of capitalist values, such as hard work, risk taking, thrift, and the profit motive.

 CHAPTER 14

NOW THAT WE ARE FREE: RECONSTRUCTION AND THE NEW SOUTH, 1863–1890

14.21 Celebrating the New South
 The Atlanta Exposition of 1895 offered a great opportunity for boosters of the New South to showcase the region’s newly diversified economy.

 The leading figure in this movement to establish a New South economy was Henry Grady, editor of the Atlanta Constitution. Beginning in the mid1870s, in editorials and speeches, he proclaimed industrialization as the solution to the South’s devastated postwar economy. His message inspired many Southerners, especially those who had never been part of the planter elite, to start businesses, invest, and support pro-business policies. Grady also convinced many Northerners, to invest in New South enterprises. The vast expansion of manufacturing represented the most stunning change in the New South. Drawn by low taxes, cheap labor, ample water power, proximity to cotton supplies, and the absence of unions, textile manufacturers moved their operations from New England to the South, What weaknesses limited the success of the New South economy?

 especially the Carolinas. By 1900, the South had become the nation’s leading producer of textiles. A similar transformation occurred in the tobacco industry, as the South went from merely producing raw tobacco to become the nation’s leading producer of finished tobacco products like cigarettes. Another significant aspect of the New South economy was the lumber and furniture industry. New South entrepreneurs took advantage of the region’s tremendous forest reserves and new technologies, such as rotary saws and dry kilns, and an expanded railroad system, and soon made the South the leading producer of lumber. In Mississippi alone the number of lumber mills jumped from 295 in 1880 to 608 in 1899. The furniture industry likewise boomed in the New South, especially in places like High Point, North Carolina, where a single factory opened in 1889, followed by 30 more over the next decade. Industry also flourished in the lower South. Birmingham, Alabama had only a few hundred residents when founded in 1871, but its position at the junction of two major railroads and nearby deposits of coal, iron, and limestone soon attracted iron and steel factories and the nickname, “Pittsburgh of the South.” By 1890, the South produced 20 percent of U.S. iron and steel. As this promotional poster (14.21) makes clear, the booming and increasingly diverse economy of the New South was the central theme of the 1895 Atlanta Exposition. Here “Liberty” carries in her left arm a cornucopia filled with symbols of traditional Southern products like cotton and sugar, but also steel and iron. Note the imagery at the bottom that suggests the Civil War–and all its destruction and lingering controversies—is long gone. As in the North the expansion of industry in the South relied on the existence of a large pool of cheap labor. But unlike the North, where millions of immigrants made up much of the workforce, the South relied on a rising population of poor white farming families pushed off the land by indebtedness, falling crop prices, and crop failure. In the rare

 instances where African Americans secured industrial employment, it was usually in the most menial, dangerous, and poorly paid jobs. Southern workers earned wages 50 percent lower than their Northern counterparts, revealing the limited success of the New South economy in overcoming the region’s poverty and social problems. Despite decades of impressive growth in industry, mining, and railroads, the South in 1900 lagged far behind the North in virtually every category of economic and social progress. Most Southern industry, for example, was small scale and focused on lowskilled labor, including growing numbers of child laborers. Per capita incomes in the South remained stagnant from 1880 to 1900. Other indications of backwardness and underdevelopment abounded. The infant mortality rate far exceeded the national average. And because Redeemer governments had slashed per pupil spending in public education to half the average in the North, the South led the nation in illiteracy; its high school graduation rate was one-third that in the Midwest.

The Rise of Sharecropping
 The limitations of the New South economy was most vividly revealed in the preponderance of Southerners engaged in agriculture. The region’s economy remained fundamentally tied to the production of cash crops, particularly tobacco, sugar, rice, and of course, cotton. Only 6 percent of the Southern workforce in 1900 was employed in manufacturing. The condition of Southern farmers, both white and black, deteriorated sharply between 1875 and 1900. While cotton production soared, the price plummeted, from 18 cents per pound in the early 1870s to 5 cents per pound in 1894. Shrinking profits forced many Southern farmers to forfeit title to their land and became tenant farmers. Some

 rented land for a set fee which left them free to grow whatever crops they desired. But most tenant farmers resorted to the sharecropping system, whereby they received the right to farm a plot of land in exchange for rent paid in the form of a share (generally one-third to one-half) of the harvest. By 1900, more than 70 percent of the South’s farmers (white and black) earned their living in this manner. Sharecropping granted African Americans a measure of independence. White landlords generally allowed their tenants to control their own time and to set their own work routines. The people in this photograph (14.22) are poor and live in a ramshackle house, but like most sharecroppers they work as families free of direct white supervision. Freedmen cherished this independence, given their experience in slavery of gang labor under the brutal control of overseers. And yet, as a closer look at this image shows, a well-dressed white man is in the background—probably the landlord who arranged for the photograph to be taken. Sharecroppers were not slaves, but as this photograph makes clear, they lived under the control of their white landlords.

THE NEW SOUTH

 These educated and relatively affluent African Americans provided leadership and direction for their communities, building social networks of churches, fraternal societies, and self-help organizations. The directors of the aforementioned North Carolina Mutual and Provident Insurance Company, for example, used their financial resources to support schools and establish a hospital, bank, and library to serve the black community of Durham. As Heroes of the Colored Race (14.24) suggests, middle-class blacks also cultivated pride in the accomplishments of African Americans after emancipation. This lithograph was published in 1881 for sale to African Americans. Note its emphasis on education and the role of African Americans in the Civil War and later as members of Congress. But in the late 1870s and early 1880s, Southern political leaders began to create a social and legal system of segregation and disenfranchisement that came to be called Jim Crow (named for a derogatory black character in a popular minstrel show). They understood that as long as some African Americans possessed civil, economic, and political rights, especially the right to vote, white supremacy was called into question. Redeemer politicians also recognized that stoking racial animosity protected their privileged status as a ruling elite by deflecting the frustration and anger of poor Southern whites away from them and onto African Americans. The Jim Crow system consisted of three main elements: segregation, disenfranchisement, and violence. The goal of segregation was to foment racial divisions by separating African Americans from as many aspects of everyday life as possible. Initial efforts focused on barring African Americans from hotels, restaurants, and railroad cars. Blacks denounced these violations of their constitutional rights-especially the Fourteenth Amendment-and challenged them in court. But a conservative Supreme Court sharply restricted the authority of the Fourteenth Amendment and its guarantee of equal protection. In Hall v. DeCuir (1878), for example, the Court

 declared unconstitutional a Louisiana law prohibiting racial discrimination on steamboats because the vessel was engaged in interstate commerce (running routes between Louisiana and Mississippi), which only Congress could regulate. Five years later, in the Civil Rights Cases, the Court declared the 1875 Civil Rights Act unconstitutional, asserting that the Fourteenth Amendment did not empower Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals and organizations. The ruling cleared the way for private individuals such as hotel owners and institutions such as men’s clubs to bar African Americans, but left standing the right of Congress to prohibit discrimination by state government institutions. As explained in Choices and Consequences: Sanctioning Separation (page 434), this issue came before the Court in an 1896 case, Plessy v. Ferguson. Hand-in-hand with segregation came the effort to eradicate black political power by circumventing the Fifteenth Amendment. Violence and intimidation in the 1870s had reduced black voting and office holding significantly, but not completely. In Mississippi, for example, black voter turnout averaged 39 percent in the 1880s. But rising fears over the voting power of both blacks and disgruntled poor whites led Redeemer

Choices and Consequences
SANCTIONING SEPARATION
In 1890, Louisiana required separate cars for black and white passengers on all railroads in the state. To challenge the law, an African American carpenter named Homer A. Plessy bought a first-class ticket on the East Louisiana Railroad and sat in the whites-only first-class car. As expected he was arrested. Plessy argued before a local judge named John H. Ferguson that the law violated the Thirteenth Amendment’s prohibition of slavery and the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause. Ferguson ruled in favor of the railroad, stating that separation did not violate Plessy’s rights, a decision upheld by the state’s Supreme Court. When Plessy appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, the justices considered three major options: 
Choices




 Refuse to hear the case and thus not render a judgment on the constitutionality of segregation, letting stand the Louisiana State Supreme Court decision.



 Rule in favor of Plessy and declare Louisiana’s segregation law unconstitutional.

Continuing Controversies
 How should African Americans respond to the imposition of Jim Crow laws? Black leaders in the 1890s were divided over the best strategy to oppose segregation. Booker T. Washington, the nation’s most prominent African American leader, argued that efforts to overturn segregation were doomed to failure due to black Americans’ lack of political and economic power (see Chapter 18). Instead he recommended blacks focus their energy and resources on selfimprovement, especially in education, a strategy that would one day empower them to challenge segregation. Founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), W. E. B. Dubois, rejected this policy and insisted that African Americans keep up a sustained legal and political effort to end segregation. Ultimately it was Dubois’s vision and NAACP attorneys that ended legalized segregation. In Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka in 1954, the Supreme Court overturned Plessy and rejected the concept of “separate but equal.”



 Reject Plessy’s appeal and uphold Louisiana’s segregation law as constitutional.

Decision
 On May 18, 1896, the Supreme Court by a vote of 7 to 1 chose the third option and rejected Plessy’s claim that the law violated his constitutional rights. The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, argued the majority, were never intended to establish full social equality of the races. Furthermore, legal separation of the races, a doctrine subsequently known as “separate but equal,” was constitutional so long as states provided equal facilities. The lone dissenting justice, John Marshall Harlan, blasted the majority opinion, declaring the law a racist violation of the nation’s “color-blind” Constitution.

Consequences
 In sharply limiting the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection provisions, the court allowed state governments to establish separate schools, hospitals, parks, theaters, restaurants, and public transportation across the South. The decision also opened the way for segregation laws aimed at Mexicans in the Southwest and Asians in California. In practice “separate but equal” proved only half accurate as segregated facilities were indeed separate, but never equal in terms of funding, staffing, and supplies.

 politicians to commence a program of disenfranchisement. Given the sparse and direct language of the Fifteenth Amendment, the proponents of disenfranchisement needed to devise laws that deprived African Americans of the right to vote without making specific mention of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” In 1889, Tennessee became the first of many Southern states to enact a poll tax, an annual tax imposed on all adult citizens in the state. Those who failed to pay it could not vote. As the image (14.25) of a Florida poll tax receipt for 1900 shows, the tax of $1 was low enough so that most white voters like Henry R. Nicks could pay it, but high enough to disenfranchise thousands of impoverished African Americans. Most states also required that all unpaid poll taxes from previous years be paid off before a citizen could vote, meaning that a black man who had fallen behind in his taxes for five years would need to pay $5 before entering a polling place. In 1890, Mississippi enacted a poll tax and an additional measure to facilitate disenfranchisement: the literacy test. It allowed state and local officials to bar from voting anyone who failed a literacy test. It usually required a potential voter to read a complicated section of the state constitution and explain its meaning—a provision aimed at excluding African Americans given their low levels of education. Most Southern states soon adopted similar tests. In the mid-1890s, Southern states added a third disenfranchisement policy, the so-called grandfather clause. It guaranteed the vote to anyone, even if they could not pass a literacy test, if their grandfather had been eligible to vote before 1867. Since no African Americans could vote before 1867, they were the only ones subject to literacy tests.

Hear the Audio A Georgia Lynch Law




 14.25 Disenfranchisement through the Poll Tax Because H. R. Nicks, a white man in Hernando County, Florida, in 1900, could pay his poll tax of $1, he was eligible to vote. Mired in poverty, many African Americans could not afford the fee and lost their right to vote.

 Adding to the effectiveness of the segregation and disenfranchisement movements was a stepped-up campaign of violence against African Americans. Vigilante groups across the South composed largely of poor whites, but often aided by local law officers and prominent citizens, launched an unprecedented wave of beatings, humiliations, and murders intended to intimidate blacks and “put them in their place.” Often an unsubstantiated accusation of rape or murder brought out a community’s lynch mob, but many killings were prompted by minor incidents of alleged disrespect such as arguing with a white man. Lynchings in the 1890s soared to an average of 187 per year, or roughly one killing every two days. By 1900, these disenfranchisement policies had reduced overall black voting in the South by 62 percent. In some states black voting was effectively eliminated. In Louisiana, for example, the number of black voters dropped from 130,334 in 1896 to 1,342 in 1904—a reduction of 99 percent. Thousands of poor whites were also disenfranchised, reducing the total white vote by 27 percent by 1900.White supremacy had triumphed.

 How did the poll tax and literacy test allow Southerners to circumvent the Fifteenth Amendment?

As soon as 10 percent of a state’s voters took this oath, they could call a convention, establish a new state government, and apply for congressional recognition. Freedmen’s Bureau Relief agency for the war-ravaged South created by Congress in March 1865. It provided emergency services, built schools, and managed confiscated lands. Black Codes Laws designed by the ex-Confederate states to sharply limit the civil and economic rights of freedmen and create an exploitable workforce. Fourteenth Amendment Drafted by Congress in June 1866, it defined citizenship to include African Americans, guaranteed equal protection before the law, and established the federal government as the guarantor of individual civil rights.
