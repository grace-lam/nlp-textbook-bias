Conflict and
Conquest
The Transformation of the West,
1860–1900
 Most Americans envisioned the conquest and transformation of the West as a tale of triumph. In John Gast’s 1872 painting, American Progress, the goddess Liberty glides westward, stringing telegraph wire and holding a book, symbols, along with the distant railroad, of the civilization and new technology that would soon tame the wilderness. Beneath her, Gast depicts farmers and pioneers intent on taking advantage of the West’s bountiful resources. Turned into a lithograph, it was advertised as worthy of hanging in both “the miner’s humble cabin” and the “stately marble mansion of the capitalist.” Publishers put the image on the cover of a popular guide to the West, The New Overland Tourist and Pacific Coast Guide. Before 1840 most Americans viewed the lands west of the Mississippi as a great, untamed, and dangerous wilderness of rugged terrain, extreme temperatures, wild animals, and hostile Native Americans. But beginning in the 1840s, an ever-growing number of farmers, miners, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers moved west, aided after 1869 by the completion of the transcontinental railroad and soaring demand for Western products and resources. Gast’s celebratory scene reveals, doubtless unintentionally, the bitter conflict that accompanied the transformation of the West. On the painting’s left border, a cluster of Native Americans flee before the advancing whites. Above them a herd of buffalo likewise make their escape. Gast’s matter-of-fact portrayal of the seizure of Indian land and the near extinction of the buffalo reflected the nation’s enthusiasm for “progress” and the inability—or unwillingness—to confront the human and environmental costs associated with it. By 1900, the West had been radically transformed. Networks of railroads and telegraph lines crisscrossed the landscape, as did millions of miles of fencing that marked the boundaries of farms and ranches. Western cities like San Francisco and Denver rivaled their Eastern counterparts. Perhaps even more remarkable than the appearance of these new aspects of Western life was the disappearance of others. By 1900, the American government had confined hundreds of independent Native American tribes that had once lived in virtually every corner of the West to reservations. Gone, too, were the millions of buffalo from the plains and, in areas of intensive mining, large sections of once pristine mountain landscape were defaced. The conquest of the West between 1865 and 1900 included many stories of success, achievement, and undeniable progress, but it was far more complex, violent, and tragic than Gast’s dreamy vision suggests.

 “The destiny of the American people is to subdue the continent—to rush over this vast field to the Pacific Ocean . . . to change darkness into light and confirm the destiny of the human race . . . Divine task! Immortal mission!” WILLIAM GILPIN, The Central Gold Region, 1859





 CHAPTER 15

CONFLICT AND CONQUEST: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST, 1860–1900

Natives and Newcomers
 Inspired by visions of unlimited opportunity and measures of Congress like the Homestead Act, westward migration increased dramatically after the Civil War. Contrary to the popular notions of a vacant landscape, much of the West was home to hundreds of thousands of Native Americans. Their many languages, lifestyles, and religious practices made for a rich cultural landscape, but also conflict with the rising numbers of newcomers.

Congress Promotes
Westward Settlement
 In 1862, Congress passed three major bills to facilitate settlement of the trans-Mississippi West, the vast region of the United States west of the Mississippi River. The Morrill Land Grant College Act of 1862 created a system whereby funds raised by the sale of public land went toward establishing colleges specializing in agricultural, mechanical, and technological education. Far more significant, however, was the Homestead Act. It provided 160 acres of free land to any settler willing to live on it and improve it for five years. Farmers with more capital could buy the land for $1.25 per acre after living on it for only six months. Those who took advantage of the program included immigrants, landless farmers from the East, single women, and ex-slaves. By making available more than 600 million acres of public land to be settled and farmed, the Homestead Act touched off the largest migration of people ever within the United States. Advertisements and promotional literature produced by land companies and railroads convinced many people to head West to acquire homesteads. Like this image (15.1), which ap-

 peared in a Czech language magazine, these enticements promised rapid success. Note the year-by-year progression that begins with a barren farm and humble house. By the fourth year the landscape features not only a substantial house and flourishing farm, but also trees, a road, and more homes, suggesting that the loneliness of life on the plains will be short-lived. One year later a church steeple appears, further suggesting the development of a community and all the blessings of civilization. But the actual results of the Homestead Act varied widely by region. On the Great Plains and the lands farther west—regions with a harsh climate, poor soil, inconsistent supplies of water, and limited access to transportation—farmers who participated in the Homestead Act often went bankrupt. By contrast, the act worked well in the northern and central portions of the Midwest, where the soil and the climate were favorable to farming. Some people prospered from the Homestead Act in ways not intended by Congress. Many “homesteaders” were actually speculators who claimed their 160 acres with the intention of selling them for a quick profit in a few years. Larger enterprises like railroads and real estate companies accumulated vast land holdings by buying out farmers who failed or paying people to file homestead claims and then buying the land from them. The Homestead Act did indeed attract farmers to the West, but by 1900, only 52 percent of original homestead claimants had acquired legal title to the land. The third major piece of legislation passed by Congress in 1862 to promote Western development, the Pacific Railway Act, created two corporations to build the transcontinental railroad spanning the continent. The Union Pacific was to build west

 from Omaha, Nebraska, across the Plains and the Rockies to meet the Central Pacific, which was to build from California through the Sierra Nevada Mountains. To help the railroad corporations raise capital to pay for the road, Congress granted them ten square miles of land (in a checkerboard pattern with the federal government retaining ownership of the remaining sections) for every mile of track completed. The law also granted the railroads cheap loans and cash subsidies for each mile of track laid. It took six years of low-paid, hard, and dangerous work by huge gangs of workers, especially Irish and Chinese, to complete the project. Scores were killed. On May 10, 1869, a grand ceremony marking the union of the two lines took place at Promontory Point, Utah. At the appointed moment, Leland Stanford, president of the Central Pacific, drove a symbolic golden spike into place, joining two rails, one placed by a team of Chinese workers and another by an Irish crew. Telegraph wires attached to the sledge hammer and spike sent a signal across the nation, announcing the



 long-anticipated news: the continent had been spanned. Keenly aware of the historic nature of the event, railroad officials staged this iconic photograph (15.2) showing the workers and locomotives of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific. It soon appeared in numerous publications, often as a lithograph. Conspicuously absent from the photograph, however, are any of the thousands of Chinese workers who labored on the Central Pacific.

The Diversity of the Native
American West
 As this map of the trans-Mississippi West (15.3 on page 442) shows, white settlers heading west encountered Native Americans belonging to hundreds of different tribes that comprised some 360,000 persons. That number was significantly lower than it had been a century earlier, reflecting the impact of earlier European contact, starting with the Spanish, French, and Russians, that brought conflict and

 More than 360,000 Native Americans, constituting some 500 tribes, lived west of the Mississippi River.

 devastating disease. Most Indians had lived there as far back as anyone could remember, while some had come from the East only decades earlier during the many forced removals (see Chapter 8). Before the arrival of Europeans, dozens of Native American tribes in what is now California lived in villages as small bands of hunters and gatherers. These include the Hupa, Karok, Northern Paiute, Pomo, Wintun, and Yuki peoples. Their way of life was first disrupted in the late eighteenth century when the Spanish established a line of Christian missions on the Pacific coast running north from San Diego. While thousands of Indians lived beyond the reach of the missions, many were gradually transformed by the Spanish into an exploited class of laborers, converted to Christianity, and absorbed

 into Spanish colonial society. Even greater change followed the discovery of gold in northern California shortly after the U.S. government seized the territory in the Mexican War. Waves of white fortune seekers soon arrived and drove the Native Americans off their lands. This violence, along with the starvation and disease that followed, killed thousands of Indians (see Chapter 12). Present-day Arizona, New Mexico, and west Texas also fell under Spanish colonial rule in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. But because this region was dry and remote, it attracted few Europeans. Its native inhabitants, therefore, retained core elements of their culture despite Spanish rule and the presence of Catholic missionaries. Indeed, missionaries managed to gain converts only

NATIVES AND NEWCOMERS

 by blending Christianity with local customs and traditions. One major group, descended from the ancient Anasazi people, included the Hopi, Zuni, and Rio Grande Pueblo tribes. They lived in settled farming communities in western New Mexico and eastern Arizona, growing corn, beans, and cotton, and herding sheep. They also traded with neighboring Mexican ranchers, exchanging their decorative pottery and woven cloth for manufactured products such as hoes and tools. Eastern New Mexico and western Texas harbored more tribes, including the Jicarilla Apache and Navajo. Like the Pueblo, they lived in relative isolation from Spanish missions and thus retained much of their traditional religion, language, and culture. Before the sixteenth century they had lived much like the Pueblos, but their adoption of horses and, for the Navajo, sheep which had been brought to America by the Spanish, transformed them into more migratory peoples. The Navajo tended large flocks of sheep, following them on their seasonal migrations. Sheep provided food, but also wool, which Indian women wove into cloth. Navajo silversmiths also produced beautiful jewelry. The Pacific Northwest, comprising presentday Washington, Oregon, and northern California, was home to thriving native societies such as the Chinook, Salish, Yurok, and Shasta. Living in large villages, they divided their time between growing vegetables, hunting in the lush forests for bear, deer, and moose, and fishing along rivers and the ocean shore. Highly skilled in woodworking, the men produced excellent canoes for fishing and elaborate totem poles. Women wove intricate baskets that were both beautiful and practical. Many of these tribes enjoyed a rich material life that was offset by their custom of potlatch—a ceremony during which rich tribe members gave away many of their possessions as an act of competitive benevolence and a demonstration of superior status.

Native American Tribes
 of the Great Plains While Native American tribes could be found in virtually every corner of the West, the largest group—constituting nearly two-thirds of all Native Americans in the West—lived on the Great Plains. This vast open territory stretched



 from present-day Missouri to the Rocky Mountains and from North Dakota to Texas. In the northern half (the Dakotas, Idaho, Minnesota, and Montana) lived tribes such as the Flathead, Blackfeet, Crow, Arapaho, Northern Cheyenne, and Sioux. Tribes in the southern Great Plains (present-day Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico) included those relocated from the East during the so-called Trail of Tears ordeal (Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, and Seminole; see Chapter 8), as well as Pawnees, Comanches, Kiowas, Southern Arapahos, and Cheyenne. The Plains tribes varied culturally, but many shared a similar tribal structure. Most tribes consisted of bands of about 300–500 related men and women, each governed by a council that welcomed community involvement in decision making. The Comanches, for example, divided their population of 7,000 (ca. 1870) into 13 bands. Religious beliefs and practices varied among the Plains tribes, but most shared important fundamental elements, beginning with the worship of one primary god whom the Sioux called Wakan Tanka (the Great Spirit). Plains Indians also believed in spirits found in everything in creation, from the earth itself, to plants, animals, stars, the moon, and sun, and they considered certain places, such as burial grounds, sacred. A shaman deemed wakan, or blessed, led religious ceremonies, healed the sick, and even decided where to hunt. Many Plains tribes lived in settled villages near rivers where they tended fields of corn, beans, and squash; fished; and hunted game, including bear, deer, and buffalo. Trade with white settlers, explorers, and trappers since the eighteenth century had allowed them to procure guns, kettles, and tools. These sedentary tribes included the Wichitas of northern Texas and Oklahoma, Pawnees of western Kansas, the Dakota Sioux of Minnesota, the Mandans of North Dakota, the Omahas of Nebraska, the Osages of western Missouri and Arkansas, and the Arikawas of South Dakota. Although essential aspects of this Plains lifestyle had changed little over the centuries, some of the largest tribes took to using horses by the eighteenth century and adopted a migratory lifestyle. These included the Crow, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche, and Lakota Sioux. The horse allowed the Plains tribes to follow the seasonal migrations of the buffalo, whose

 population stood at 30 million in 1800. This scene, Buffalo Chase over Prairie Bluffs, (15.4), painted in 1844 by George Catlin, who traveled extensively among Indian tribes in the West from the 1830s to the 1850s, reveals both the drama of the buffalo hunt and the extraordinary horsemanship of Plains Indians. It also shows the centrality of the buffalo in Plains Indian culture, for the hunters’ clothing, jewelry, spear tips, and bridles are made from buffalo parts. Other uses for the buffalo included flesh for food; skin for teepees and blankets; horns and hooves for glue; bones and tendons for weapons; hair for rope; teeth for ornaments; and dried dung for fuel. The military advantages of the horse and the material wealth provided by the buffalo led these migratory tribes to become the dominant powers on the Plains, allowing them to exact tribute from weaker sedentary tribes. But reliance on the huge migratory beasts also meant that tribes, such as the Lakota Sioux in the north and Comanche in the central Plains, traversed enormous tracts of land during their annual migrations, a practice that increasingly brought them into conflict with whites eager to acquire land. It also increased conflict between rival tribes, such as the Lakota Sioux and Crow, as white settlement forced tribes into closer contact. While not all Native Americans were warlike, the culture of most Plains Indians glorified battle. Warriors aspired to earn reputations as brave hunters and fighters. Warfare between tribes to control land and access to game consisted of small skirmishes where the goal was not so much to kill their opponents as to steal their horses (a measure of a tribe’s

Individual warriors earned fame and respect by “counting coup,” or touching an enemy with one’s hand or weapon. Respect was also earned through acts of charity. Sitting Bull of the Lakota Sioux, for example, became chief of his tribe both because of his success as a warrior and his generosity.

The Great Westward
Migration
 In the late 1840s, after the Mexican War and the discovery of gold in California, a steady flow of settlers into the trans-Mississippi West commenced. By the mid-1850s, thousands annually traversed the 2,000-mile Oregon Trail that stretched from Missouri to Oregon. What attracted them was a torrent of pamphlets, books, articles, and photographs produced by publicists and boosters, many employed by railroads and land companies, celebrating the West as a region of wealth and opportunity. Several groups led this migration westward. One was the recently freed slaves who hoped to secure new lives as independent farmers, free of the poverty and violence in the South. One of these ex-slaves, Henry Adams, who became a land promoter after emancipation, helped more than 20,000 other black “Exodusters” move in the “Exodus of 1879” from the South to farms in Kansas. This image from Harper’s Weekly (15.5) captures the hope this movement inspired. Note the contrast the artist draws between the “old style” of African American migration (a desperate escaped slave hiding from a passing steamboat) and “the new” (well-dressed ex-slaves arriving at their destination by steamboat). The name Exodusters reflected the belief that, like the Israelites in the Bible’s Book of Exodus, they were heading

NATIVES AND NEWCOMERS

 for a “promised land.” The inclusion of a black veteran of the Union army symbolizes the fulfillment of the promise of emancipation won during the war. Unfortunately many Exodusters settled on poor land and lacked the capital to establish successful farms. As a result only about one-third stayed. The rest moved on or returned to the South. Native-born whites constituted a second, much larger segment of the westward migration. Many were Eastern and Midwestern farmers who sought larger plots of land, either through purchase or by the Homestead Act, and opportunities for upward mobility. Others came to work in railroad construction or mining. In addition, many westward migrants were white soldiers who had been stationed in the West and elected to stay and settle after their terms of service expired. One distinct subgroup of native-born whites migrants were the Mormons. Joseph Smith had founded this religious sect in upstate New York in 1830. But violent persecution—Smith was killed by a mob in Illinois in 1844—prompted the Mormons to head west in 1846 in search of an isolated homeland that could ensure their security and survival. They eventually chose a valley in Utah near the Great Salt Lake, territory then under Mexican rule. After the United States acquired the region following the Mexican-American War, Congress created the Utah territory in 1850 (see Chapter 12), and by 1865 some 20,000 Mormons lived in the region under a form of theocratic local rule where the church controlled most property, businesses, and

 public services. Gradually, as more non-Mormons moved to Utah and federal officials condemned the sect’s practice of polygamy (a practice the Mormons officially banned in 1896), the church took a less prominent role in public life. Joining Exodusters, Mormons, and nativeborn Americans in the great migration into the trans-Mississippi West were more than two million immigrants. They were drawn by the same desire for free, or at least inexpensive, farmland or to find work in mines, on railroads, or in the rapidly expanding economies of Western towns and cities. Over time large concentrations of particular ethnic groups emerged. For example, 30 percent of Minnesota’s population in 1880 was foreign-born, including more than 66,000 Germans, 62,000 Norwegians, and 39,000 Swedes. Drawn by jobs in the copper mines, thousands of Irish immigrants settled in Butte, Montana. By 1900, it was the most Irish city in America.



15.5 Seeking
 a Better Life in the West In response to poverty and mounting violence in the South, more than 20,000 African Americans known as “Exodusters” migrated to Kansas in 1879–1880 to acquire homesteads and start new lives as independent farmers.

 “[I]f you strike off into the broad, free West, and make yourself a farm from Uncle Sam’s generous domain, you will crowd nobody, starve nobody, and . . . neither you nor your children need evermore beg for Something to Do.” HORACE GREELEY, Editor, New York Tribune, 1867

 CHAPTER 15

CONFLICT AND CONQUEST: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST, 1860–1900

 As in the East, increased ethnic and racial diversity and economic competition in the West led to tension and conflict that occasionally exploded into raw violence. Frequently victims of the violence were Chinese immigrants. By 1880, California was home to 75,132 Chinese, while 30,000 more lived elsewhere in the West. But as this drawing (15.6) from Harper’s Weekly shows, anti-Chinese racism surged in the 1870s and 1880s as white laborers accused the Chinese of taking jobs and lowering wages. In this attack in 1885 at Rock Springs, Wyoming, whites killed 28 Chinese miners. Two years later white laborers massacred at least 34 Chinese miners in Hells Canyon, Oregon. Railroads and land companies played a key role in promoting immigration to the West, sending agents to Europe and advertising there to encourage migration, sometimes by entire villages, directly to the West. Railroads brought more than two million immigrants to the trans-Mississippi West between 1870 and 1900. “California, Cornucopia of the World” (1883) was one of countless posters that railroads placed in Eastern seaports to attract newly arrived immigrants (15.7). The competition among Western states for settlers is indicated in the phrase “without Cyclones or Blizzards,” a clear attempt to make California more appealing than the Plains states like Kansas. Also significant is the claim of “Room for Millions of Immigrants,” since only one year earlier Congress, with heavy lobbying from California, passed the Chinese Exclusion Act that barred Chinese immigration to the United States. 15.7 The Railroads Promote Westward Settlement Railroads placed promotional posters such as this one from 1883 in Eastern cities to entice settlers to head west to settle on land owned by the railroads, much of it acquired in land grants from the federal government.

 Why did railroads promote the migration of immigrants to the West?

15.6 Anti-Chinese Violence Surges in the West
 In the 1870s and 1880s, Chinese workers in the American West faced hostility and violence from whites. In this incident at Rock Springs, Wyoming in 1885, whites killed 28 Chinese miners.

THE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST



The Economic Transformation
 of the West While many Americans were inspired to migrate westward by notions of Manifest Destiny, the primary motivation was economic—a search for land and work. As a result, economic development was the chief driving force behind the profound transformations of the West after 1865. By 1900, four major industries—the railroad, farming, ranching, and mining—had fundamentally reshaped the region. These industries employed millions of workers and supplied some of the essential needs of consumers and industry in the East and internationally. Such progress, however, was accompanied by labor exploitation, environmental damage, and conflict with Indians.

The Railroad Fuels Western
Development


 (15.8) shows, the transcontinental railroad marked only the beginning of a vast transportation network of both major east-west railroad lines, such as the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad and the Northern Pacific Railroad, and countless smaller feeder railroads. This growing network opened up more and more western lands for farming, allowing farmers in once remote areas to sell their grain in the national market. The railroad also benefited many non-farmers, opening up Western lands for mining and ranching and providing employment for thousands who built the lines

 Between 1860 and 1900, the country’s agricultural output soared. The number of farms in the United States grew from two million to six million, with most of the growth taking place in the West. Agricultural output increased from $1.6 billion in 1860 to $4.3 billion in 1900. Several factors account for this agricultural boom. New technologies such as the steel plow and mechanical reaper dramatically increased the acreage a farmer Seattle could till. The establishment of Portland many agriculture schools, most funded by states Promontory and the federal Point government, led Sacramento Salt Lake to advances in City Denver San fertilization, irFrancisco rigation, crop rotation, seed selection, and the Los Angeles care of livestock.

 and later gained employment as firemen, engineers, switchmen, mechanics, dispatchers, and clerks. Railroads also transformed the West by promoting urban growth. Many Western cities like San Francisco, Portland, and Denver, were significant centers of trade before the arrival of the railroad. Once connected to the national rail network, however, they boomed into major metropolises. Their economies diversified as demand for construction, food, transportation, and retail opened up new opportunities for entrepreneurs. By 1890, the West was more urbanized than any region in the United States except the Northeast. Between 1860 and 1890, for example, Denver’s population rose from 2,600 to over 100,000, while Omaha, Nebraska’s soared from less than 2,000 to over 140,000. Like their Eastern counterparts, Western cities struggled with urban problems, including crime, disorder, corruption, poor public health, inadequate water, and ethnic tensions.

Hard Times for Farmers
 While the overall trend in this period was one of expansion and profit, the reality for many farmers was struggle, frustration, and failure. To begin with, farmers faced unpredictable weather patterns. Farmers on the Plains, for example, enjoyed unusually high levels of rainfall between 1878 and 1886, leading them to think this was the norm and encouraging still more farmers to acquire homesteads. But a return to dry conditions and occasional drought after 1886 caused widespread hardship and failure. Other threats came from swarms of insects such as grasshoppers that attacked crops. Farmers also struggled with wild fluctuations in prices for their crops from year to year. A plentiful harvest of wheat or corn often meant a glutted market and low prices. In the 1880s, wheat farmers on the Plains saw prices fall due to competition with less expensive wheat grown in Russia, South America, Canada, and Australia. Sudden drops in prices pushed many farmers into foreclosure because most carried high levels of debt

 to finance the purchase of land and equipment such as harvesters, plows, and windmills. These conditions favored larger farms, revealing a significant flaw in the original Homestead Act: in the more arid regions of the West the 160-acre allotment was too small for profitable farming. By the 1880s, so-called bonanza farms of 1,000 acres or more became increasingly common in the Dakotas and California. With more capital, these large enterprises could better afford the expensive equipment needed for plowing, sowing, and harvesting. On top of all these challenges were the loneliness and drudgery of life on the Plains. As this photograph (15.9) of the four Chrisman sisters standing by their sod house in Custer County, Nebraska, illustrates, life on a Western farm was often Spartan. Sod houses and dugouts cut into hills lacked even the most basic amenities like running water and glass windows. Apart from occasional trips to town, church, court sessions, and harvest fairs, opportunities for social interaction were rare since farmers usually situated their homesteads far apart. The Chrisman sisters developed a strategy that diminished their isolation and allowed them to fulfill the Homestead Act’s requirement that they live on their land to receive full title to it. Beginning with Lizzie’s homestead claim in 1887 and Lutie’s in 1888, the two younger sisters took turns living on the homesteads, keeping their sisters’ company, helping on the farm, and waiting until they were old enough to file their own claims. Hattie eventually did, but all the homestead plots were gone by the time Jennie Ruth came of age. To improve the lot of American farmers, a former clerk in the Department of Agriculture named Oliver

15.9 Homesteading on the Plains
 Western farmers received 160 acres of free land through the Homestead Act, but success required years of hard work and sacrifices such as living in crude sod houses. This one, in Nebraska, was owned by one of the four Chrisman sisters shown here.

THE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST

H.
Kelley founded in 1867 the Patrons of Husbandry, or Grange. This social and educational society was dedicated to alleviating the problems faced by farmers by promoting fellowship, fraternity, and education. Grangers, as they were called, shared ideas about farming through a newsletter and attended lectures by traveling experts. Local chapters opened across the nation, and by the early 1870s, the organization had several hundred thousand loyal members. The Grange was transformed into a powerful political movement during the economic depression triggered by the Panic of 1873. Hundreds of thousands of farmers faced ruin as prices plummeted, while their creditors demanded payment for loans, and railroads charged high prices to transport their produce to market. In their desperation they created Granger Parties, which in 1874 won control of the legislatures of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota and gained significant influence in others. They enacted “Granger Laws,” some of the earliest regulations of banks and corporations, especially railroads. These measures set maximum rates for transporting or storing grain and banned abusive practices such as offering preferred customers special rates. Grangers tried, as this 1873 cartoon (15.10) indicates, to convince Americans not involved in farming to recognize the threat posed to them by uncontrolled railroad power. As a “Consolidation Train,” a name suggesting monopoly, pulls cars labeled “extortion,” “bribery,” “usurpation,” and “oppression,” a Granger warns unsuspecting citizens of their impending doom. Railroad magnates denounced these limitations on their power and profit as unconstitutional and sued. The Supreme Court, however, in two key cases in 1876 (Munn v. Illinois and Peik v. Chicago and Northwestern Railway) ruled that state legislatures had the legal authority under the Constitution to regulate commerce, including especially commerce between states. Despite this legal victory, the Granger movement faded when the depression lifted and farm product prices rose in the late-1870s. The Democratic and Republican parties also added pro-farmer planks to their platforms that made the Granger parties seem less necessary. 
The Cattle Kingdom
 Another key emerging sector of the Western economy was cattle ranching. When the United States annexed Texas in 1845, millions of longhorn cattle (introduced to Central America in the sixteenth century by the Spanish) roamed the range, raised mainly for their skins and tallow. But as Americans developed a taste

 for beef in the 1860s, ranchers envisioned the great profits to be made if they could get their cattle to Northern markets. A longhorn that cost $4 in Texas could be sold for $40 on the Northern market. Beginning in 1866 and lasting two decades, Texas ranchers began the first of the annual Long Drives of more than 1,000 miles to bring the cattle to market. Ranchers Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving drove thousands of cattle from Texas to Colorado, prompting many imitators. In 1867, another cattle entrepreneur, Joseph McCoy, established a stockyard, hotel, bank, and office in a small Kansas town along the Kansas-Pacific Railroad. Advertising heavily, he quickly turned Abilene, Kansas for a time into the premier cattle drive destination. By the late 1870s, more than 600,000 longhorns arrived per year to be sold and transported by rail to Chicago and other destinations for slaughter. Over time the need for the drives diminished as rail lines were extended from Kansas into Texas and entrepreneurs established large cattle ranches close to railroads in states such as Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado. The period of the great cattle drives lasted only 20 years, but it established the cowboy as an enduring icon of the Old West. Nineteenth-century dime novels, paintings, books, and plays (and in the twentieth century, films) depicted cowboys as paragons of manliness, independence, and courage who spent most of their days battling fierce Indians and driving cattle (see 15.21 on page 464) and nights in raucous saloons playing poker, brawling, and gun fighting. But the life of a cowboy was far more difficult and

 complicated. Cattle drives exposed them to harsh weather that included searing heat, flash floods, and deadly blizzards. Cowboys’ wages averaged only about $1 a day—or less if the price of beef fell—and they survived on a relentless diet of meat, beans, and coffee. They worked from dawn until dusk and then served a shift guarding the cattle at night against rustlers and Indians. Moreover, American cowboys were a far more diverse lot than the popular images depicting them as exclusively white men would indicate. Approximately one-third of cowboys in the American West were nonwhite, the largest group being Mexican vaqueros. Indeed, much of the equipment, clothing, techniques, and culture of the American cowboy derived from Mexican and Spanish traditions. This borrowing is evident in the many items associated with cowboys that bear names derived from Spanish. For example, the word cowboy itself is a direct translation of the Spanish term vaquero, while other terms such as lariat (la reata), chaps (chaparejos), and wrangler (catallerango) are anglicized versions of Spanish words. African Americans comprised the second-largest group of nonwhite cowboys. The eight black cowboys shown in this 1880s photograph (15.11) worked on the ranch of Thomas Jones (shown standing) in Texas. One of the most famous black cowboys was Bose Ikard. Born a slave in Mississippi in 1847, he was taken to Texas where he became a skilled cowboy. Freed by the Civil War, he played a key role in the first Long Drive led by Goodnight and Loving. Ranching held out the prospect of great profits, but ranchers faced big challenges. In the early 1870s,

 the invention of barbed wire soon ended open-range ranching and the long drives, as farmers enclosed their land to protect crops from cattle hooves. Cattle ranchers also clashed with other livestock enterprises, such as sheep herders, over access to water and grazing lands. These conflicts frequently led to violence and even widespread hostilities known as “range wars.” Ranchers, like farmers, also were vulnerable to extremes of weather, losing cattle to scorching heat and drought and freezing cold and snow. They also suffered from rapid expansion of the ranching industry in the mid-1880s and consequent flooding of the cattle market that caused a collapse of beef prices, bankrupting many ranchers.

Fortunes Beneath the
Ground: The Mining Booms
 While many Western adventurers found fortune and failure in railroads, farms, and ranches, still others tried their luck underground in the many mining districts that emerged in the West. The second great Western mining boom, after California in 1849 (see Chapter 12), began in 1859 with the discovery of gold in Colorado and silver in Nevada. The Comstock Lode, as the Nevada site was called, yielded an astonishing $400 million in silver in the next 20 years. As with most mining booms, the initial wave of small-time prospectors garnered only modest profits. The real fortunes came in the succeeding years as heavily capitalized and incorporated enterprises established mining operations to extract the ore that lay deep underground. Among the titans who
