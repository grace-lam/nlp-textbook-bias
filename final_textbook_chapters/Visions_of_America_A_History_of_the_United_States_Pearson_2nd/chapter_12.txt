 Why did Southerners interpret the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 as cause for secession?

 The seizure of vast tracts of land from Mexico in 1848 ushered in a period of intense conflict between the North and the South over whether to permit slavery in the territories west of the Mississippi. At the root of these tensions were the starkly different paths of economic and social development being pursued in the two regions. The South prospered in the 1840s and 1850s by expanding its agrarian, slave labor economy; the North, by becoming more urban, industrial, commercial, and multicultural. In the process, the two regions developed divergent visions of the ideal society: The South celebrated the virtues of slavery, states’ rights, and white supremacy, while the North touted the benefits of free labor, upward mobility, and equal opportunity. One of the first and most bitter controversies of the period emerged with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, a law requiring Northerners to assist Southerners in the apprehension of escaped slaves. It produced almost immediately a series of sensational incidents, in which abolitionists tried, with some success, to thwart the law and spirit escaped slaves to freedom. Drawn by an abolitionist in the midst of this controversy, this image seeks to humanize the plight of escaped slaves while at the same time dramatizing the inhumanity of slave catchers and slaveholders. The quotations from the Bible (‘Thou shalt not deliver unto the master his servant which has escaped from his master unto thee …’) and the Declaration of Independence (‘We hold that all men are created equal …’) highlight the fundamental claim of abolitionists that slavery violated both Judeo-Christian morality and republican principles. Southern slaveholders, of course, rejected these claims and asserted their inalienable right to property in all things, including slaves. This controversy set the tone for a decade that was to be rocked by a series of political, legal, and economic disputes that ultimately led back to the slavery question. By the mid-1850s, each region increasingly came to see the other’s system as a threat. Northerners became convinced that Southerners wanted to spread slavery to the West and even to the North, while Southerners believed Northerners sought to destroy slavery and the Southern way of life. When Republican Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860, Southerners declared the Union dissolved, setting in motion events that led to a far more bloody conflict, the Civil War.

 “It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become either entirely a slaveholding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation.” WILLIAM SEWARD, 1858





 CHAPTER 12

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

The Slavery Question
 in the Territories The election of 1848 revealed an emerging sectional divide between the North and South over the issue of slavery. The dispute centered on whether slavery would be allowed in the new territories. Given the small population of white settlers in the West, many politicians hoped that any decision on creating territories and admitting new states would not arise for years. But the discovery of gold in California in 1848 brought tens of thousands of fortune seekers. By late 1849, they constituted a population sufficient to apply for statehood. After much acrimony Congress eventually passed the Compromise of 1850, a set of measures that quieted but did not resolve the fundamental disagreement over the future of slavery in America.

The Gold Rush
 Although both Whigs and Democrats in Congress sought to avoid the contentious issue of slavery and the territories, the discovery of gold in California soon forced them to confront it. In December 1848, following four months of rumors, more than 300 ounces of pure gold arrived in Washington, D.C., sent by the new territorial government of California. The news touched off the Gold Rush in 1849, a migration of thousands of gold seekers from farms and workshops in the East to northern California on news of the gold strike near San Francisco. California’s population exploded, rising from just 14,000 at the start of 1849 to more than 100,000 by year’s end. By 1852, it reached 220,000. Eighty percent of the new arrivals were American-born (including free African Americans), with the rest coming from Mexico, South America, Europe, and Asia. Most were single white men in their twenties and thirties. They came to California not to settle but to strike it rich and return home. This fortune-seeking spirit led to the creation of a rough and raucous society. Mining camps and boomtowns sprang up almost overnight only to be abandoned the moment the gold disappeared or word arrived of a fresh strike elsewhere. Most mining towns lacked any formal government, including sheriffs and judges, leading to high rates of crime and violence. By 1852, most of the gold that could be easily extracted was gone and with it individual earnings as high as $20 per day in 1849 (compared to less than $2 per day back East). With much gold remaining embedded in rock deep beneath the earth’s

 surface, mining shifted from independent miners to corporations possessing the capital to pay for the expensive technology required to extract the hardto-reach gold. Most of the men who remained in mining after 1852 did so as wage laborers. Among them were thousands of prospectors who had sold their farms and shops in the East in a fruitless quest for easy wealth. While many panned for gold, thousands of migrants worked in enterprises that supported the mining industry such as hotels, restaurants, banks, saloons, and laundries. They realized that the surest way to riches lay in selling supplies such as pickaxes, shovels, rope, tents, and clothing at outrageous prices to eager miners. Many women earned high wages working in cooking, cleaning, and health care jobs, but many were forced into prostitution to survive, a practice that flourished in the maledominated society of California. By one estimate, one out of every five women in California in 1850 worked as a prostitute. Another group that found its dreams of riches thwarted were the Chinese, 45,000 of whom

 arrived in California by 1854. White miners, motivated by racism and greed, used violence and intimidation to confine the Chinese to the least desirable mining areas. The drawing shown here (12.1) depicts the segregated world of these Chinese miners. No whites appear in the scene, which shows the Chinese engaged in several activities, primarily mining. In 1852, the state legislature imposed a heavy tax on Chinese miners, prompting many to turn from mining to farming, fishing, and operating restaurants and laundries. But increased immigration and job competition with whites in the coming decades would lead to escalating anti-Chinese sentiment and violence in California (see Chapter 16). Much worse was the fate of the California Indians. The diseases brought by migrants killed tens of thousands, while ruthless bands of miners killed thousands more or drove them off their lands. Of the 150,000 Native Americans who lived in California in 1848, on the eve of the Gold Rush, only 30,000 remained by 1870. Meanwhile, countless Californios—Mexicans living in California—lost title to their lands through legal obstacles that the new American government imposed. The Gold Rush sparked Western development and accelerated the creation of a coast-to-coast American nation. But the immediate consequence of the Gold Rush was not economic or social; it was political. The arrival of tens of thousands of people in 1849 suddenly made California



 eligible to organize a territorial government as a prelude to statehood. Looming over any discussion of California statehood, however, was the divisive issue of slavery.

Organizing California
 and New Mexico Even before the discovery of gold forced national leaders to consider California statehood, the question of the Western territories and the status of slavery there took center stage in Congress. Tempers flared in the House when Northern representatives unsuccessfully attempted to approve a motion upholding the Wilmot Proviso in the Western territories, draft a bill to organize California as a free territory, and pass a bill ending the slave trade in the District of Columbia. The tension eventually subsided as congressmen decided to wait for president-elect Zachary Taylor to take office and reveal his opinions on slavery and the Western territories. Within weeks of his inauguration in March 1849, Taylor made it clear that although he was a Southerner who did not oppose slavery, he would put national unity above regional loyalty. Instead of creating territorial governments for California and New Mexico that would leave authority over the slavery issue with Congress, he proposed that they be made states

 immediately and thus have the freedom to decide the slavery question according to popular will. This would remove the contentious issue from Congress where it sparked bitter debate and increasing sectionalism.

 “The people of the North need have no apprehension of the further extension of slavery.” President ZACHARY TAYLOR at Mercer, Pennsylvania, July 1849

12.2 The Great
Seal of California
 The inclusion of 31 stars indicated the hope that California would be admitted as the thirty-first state.

 Residents of New Mexico and California responded enthusiastically to Taylor’s invitation. By the fall of 1849, California had approved a state constitution prohibiting slavery and applied to Congress for admission as a free state. They also adopted a seal (12.2) to symbolize their vision of the state and its future. In the foreground sits Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, while behind her a miner prospects for gold. (The motto, Eureka, is Greek for “I have found it.”) Sheaves of wheat at her feet (symbols of agriculture) and ships (symbolic of commerce) sailing on the nearby waters indicate their

 expectations for robust economic growth. In 1850, New Mexico’s residents also applied for admission. Taylor’s actions touched off a firestorm of protest in the South. State legislatures forwarded petitions of protest to Washington, while mass meetings across the region denounced Taylor and his Northern supporters. Then in June 1850 hard-line defenders of slavery, often called “fire-eaters,” convened a Southern rights convention in Nashville, Tennessee, “to devise and adopt some mode of resistance to Northern aggression.” What angered Southerners most was the threat Taylor’s plan posed to the balance of power in Congress. Because of the North’s greater population, it sent more representatives to the House. But with slave and free states numbering 15 each, Southerners enjoyed equal representation in the Senate, allowing them to block legislation deemed threatening to slavery or Southern interests (the so-called Southern veto). Admitting California and New Mexico as free states would tip the balance in favor of the North. Under such conditions it would only be a matter of time, warned Southern defenders, before a Congress dominated by Northerners abolished slavery altogether. “For the first time,” warned Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, “we are about permanently to destroy the balance of power between the sections.”

The Compromise of 1850
 As he had done in the Missouri Compromise in 1820 and the Nullification Crisis of 1832–1833, Henry Clay of Kentucky proposed a compromise. His plan admitted California as a free state and organized New Mexico into two territories where the people would eventually vote to decide whether to permit slavery in a process known as popular sovereignty. It also settled the border dispute between New Mexico and Texas, arranged for the federal government to assume Texas’s debt, banned the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and established a stronger federal fugitive slave law. The speeches inspired by the debate over Clay’s bill, among the most famous in the history of Congress, revealed an intensifying clash of visions over the future of slavery in America. On March 4 a dying John C. Calhoun of South Carolina had a colleague read his speech expressing the views of proslavery Southern hardliners. He demanded that the Northerners end their attacks on slavery, uphold Southerner’s rights in the territories (especially the right to own slaves), and enforce the fugitive slave provisions in the Constitution.

 Why did Southerners react so negatively to President Taylor’s plan?

THE SLAVERY QUESTION IN THE TERRITORIES

 Three days later the renowned Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster delivered his famous “Seventh of March Address,” an impassioned plea for moderation and compromise, warning that both proslavery and antislavery extremism threatened to destroy the Union. William Seward of New York then voiced the views of staunch antislavery Northerners. Rejecting the Southern argument that the Constitution guaranteed the right to extend slavery into the territories, Seward invoked the authority of “a higher law than the Constitution,” the law of God under which all people deserved to live in freedom. Congress, he argued, should instead be debating how to eliminate slavery peacefully and gradually. Debate over Clay’s compromise raged for months. The hostility spawned by the differences of opinion over slavery and the Western territories is captured in this 1850 political cartoon, Scene in Uncle Sam’s Senate (12.3). The cartoon is satirical, but it depicts a real incident in which Mississippi Senator Henry S. Foote pulled a pistol on Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton (shown holding his coat open and daring his opponent to shoot). The Senate finally voted the compromise down in July. Then the unexpected occurred. President Taylor died of severe gastroenteritis on July 9, 1850, and



 “The South asks for justice, simple justice, and less she ought not to take. . . . Nothing else can, with any certainty, finally and for ever settle the question at issue, terminate agitation, and save the Union.” JOHN C. CALHOUN, March 4, 1850

 was succeeded by Vice President Millard Fillmore, a moderate Whig from New York. Compared to Taylor, Fillmore was more sympathetic to the South and eager to reach a compromise. With his support, a young and ambitious senator from Illinois, Stephen A. Douglas, revived the movement for compromise. He broke up Clay’s massive bill into separate pieces of legislation and then, without appeals to patriotism or sectionalism, he assembled enough votes to pass each individually. As the map illustrates (12.4), Douglas’s bill, or the Compromise of 1850, contained five components, some of which appealed to proslavery Southerners and others to antislavery

 of 1850 The Compromise attempted to quell the political storm that arose over the slavery question by making concessions to both sides.

The Compromise also settled the dispute regarding the western border of Texas, established a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, and abolished the slave trade in Washington, D.C.

 Northerners. First, California entered the Union as a free state. To offset this concession to the opponents of slavery, a second bill created the New Mexico and Utah territories and left the question of slavery to be decided by popular sovereignty when each territory applied for statehood. Left unexplained was the status of slavery in the years leading to statehood. Third, Texas was required to relinquish claims to disputed territory on its western border to New Mexico (pleasing opponents of slavery by reducing the slave state’s size) in exchange for the federal government assuming the $10 million debt Texas had incurred as an independent republic (pleasing Southerners who held most of the debt). A fourth provision granted abolitionists a partial victory by banning the slave trade—but not slavery—in Washington, D.C. Finally, a new Fugitive Slave Act greatly increased the federal government’s commitment to returning escaped slaves to their owners,

 something Southern fire-eaters had been demanding for years. When the bills were all signed by midSeptember, joyful crowds gathered in the nation’s capital to serenade Congress with song and cheers of “The Union is saved.” But a close examination of the votes on the compromise’s bills reveals a weakening of party loyalties and a growing tendency toward voting along sectional lines. Most Northern Whigs, for example, supported the admission of California as a free state and opposed the Fugitive Slave Act. Most Southern Whigs voted in the opposite manner. Only 20 percent of Congress—generally moderate Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs—voted for all five bills. As many antislavery Northerners and Southern hardliners correctly predicted, the question of slavery, whether in the territories or elsewhere, would surface again.

THE SLAVERY QUESTION IN THE TERRITORIES



Sectionalism on the Rise
 One element in the Compromise of 1850—the Fugitive Slave Act—sparked a national controversy that intensified the sectionalism, or hostility between North and South over slavery. The act created a force of federal commissioners who possessed broad powers to pursue and return suspected escaped slaves to their owners. It also permitted federal marshals to deputize private citizens to assist in capturing fugitive slaves. Those who refused to help were subject to fines and imprisonment. Once apprehended, an accused fugitive had no right to a jury trial. His or her fate was instead decided by a federal commissioner who stood to earn a fee of $10 if he returned the accused to slavery and only $5 if he released him or her. Fugitive slaves escaping to the North did not become a major political issue until the 1830s. In that decade the growing abolitionist movement began to encourage and facilitate slave escapes along what came to be known metaphorically as the Underground Railroad. It was a network of safe houses and other secret hiding places along a series of routes leading to the North and into Canada where British law prohibited slavery. The existence of such a network is revealed in this page from the 1844 diary of Daniel Osborn, a Quaker living in Alum Creek, Ohio (12.5). Between April and September of that year—warm months ideal for travel—Osborn assisted 47 escapees. His home was situated approximately halfway between the borders of northern Kentucky (where all but three of the fugitives came from) and Canada. Many of his Quaker neighbors also harbored fugitives. Angry slaveholders and eager abolitionists spread fantastic stories of thousands of slaves being spirited north annually, but the Underground Railroad probably brought no more than 5,000 slaves to freedom between 1830 and 1860. Its most famous “conductor” was Harriet Tubman, an escaped slave who made 19 trips to the South to lead scores of slaves, including many of her relatives, to freedom. Osborn’s diary occasionally revealed a similar pattern on a smaller scale. In one eight-day period in August 1844, he recorded that an African American man passed through Alum Creek on his way back to Kentucky where he gathered his wife, child, and sister-in-law and returned safely. He was followed by a woman who came from Canada to bring four of her children and one grandchild to freedom. Most

 fugitives escaped to the North through less formal arrangements and a combination of perseverance, ingenuity, and luck. Although the number of escaped slaves remained relatively small, averaging 1,000 per year out of a total slave population that approached four million by 1860, Southern slaveholders grew increasingly angry over the unwillingness of Northerners to assist in the return of their “property.” Especially galling were the “personal liberty laws” passed by nine Northern states between 1842 and 1850, which prohibited the use of state officials or facilities like courts and jails for the capture and return of escaped slaves. With these precedents in mind, Southerners made clear in the weeks following the Compromise of 1850 that they expected Northerners to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act. “It is the deliberate opinion

 CHAPTER 12

 of this Convention,” resolved a gathering of Georgia fire-eaters, “that upon the faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Law … depends the preservation of our much beloved Union.” Southern insistence on a new fugitive slave law was full of contradiction. Even though Southern nationalists celebrated the sanctity of states’ rights, they condemned Northern states for enacting “personal liberty laws.” States’ rights doctrine also opposed any increase of federal power, especially when slavery was concerned, yet Southerners made an exception when it came to using federal authority to capture their escaped slaves. Abolitionists denounced the new fugitive slave law as “a hateful statute of kidnappers.” They formed vigilance committees throughout the North and vowed, in the words of one Illinois newspaper, “to trample the law in the dust.” Opportunities for resistance soon arose, for unlike the abstract questions raised by the Wilmot Proviso and popular sovereignty, the Fugitive Slave Act created a succession of concrete human dramas in dozens of Northern communities (see Choices and Consequences: Resisting the Fugitive Slave Act). Early and memorable incidents occurred in Boston, the unofficial headquarters of the abolitionist movement. In October 1850, just weeks after the law’s enactment, two slave catchers arrived there in pursuit of William and Ellen Craft, who had escaped from Georgia two years earlier. The city’s vigilance committee swung into action, hiding the Crafts and posting handbills throughout the city, denouncing the “kidnappers.” After five days of sustained harassment and physical threats, the slave catchers left the city. Taking no chances, the Crafts boarded a ship for England. The controversy over the Fugitive Slave Act played a significant role in popularizing and legitimizing antislavery

 sentiment—though not necessarily abolitionism— in the North. In the early 1850s, few Northerners were abolitionists. Indeed, many were deeply hostile to blacks and rejected racial equality. Other Northerners opposed slavery, but were not willing to jeopardize the national peace achieved by the Compromise of 1850 by supporting abolitionist vigilantism. Nonetheless, the controversies generated by the Fugitive Slave Act forced Northerners to confront the reality of an institution that had seemed distant and abstract. The vivid images of Southern agents seizing free people in a community of free citizens and returning them to a life of bondage shocked even the most conservative Northerners. As one conservative Whig wrote after seeing the fugitive Anthony Burns returned to slavery from Boston in 1854, “When it was all over, and I was alone in my office, I put my face in my hands and wept.” Although these and subsequent events in the 1850s did not convert masses of Northerners to abolitionism, they did move many to see slavery as an evil that at the least ought to be confined to its present boundaries to hasten its eventual demise. Many Northerners also gradually became more hostile to slavery as the result of reading antislavery literature. Although the growing number of firsthand accounts of slavery by escaped slaves proved popular, the most widely read and influential book was a work of fiction. First published in installments in an abolitionist newspaper, Uncle Tom’s Cabin appeared as a novel in 1852. Its author, Harriet Beecher Stowe, came from a prominent abolitionist family. Within a year her novel sold 300,000 copies, making it the best-selling book of the era. Soon thousands of theatrical versions of the story were being performed in cities across the North. Speeches, diaries, letters, and other evidence indicate that Stowe’s account of the brutality of slavery and the humanity of the enslaved moved millions of Northerners to become increasingly hostile to slavery, even if they did not believe in racial equality. By contrast, Southerners denounced Stowe as a “wretch in petticoats” and banned the book. They also published dozens of proslavery novels with similar titles. This image (12.6) from Aunt Phillis’s Cabin or Southern Life as It Is (1852), portrays slaves dancing, suggesting they enjoy free time and are happy. 12.6 Southerners Refute the Antislavery Claims of Uncle Tom’s Cabin This frontispiece from Aunt Phillis’s Cabin, or Southern Life as It Is (1852), presents slavery as a happy, carefree existence.

THE SLAVERY QUESTION IN THE TERRITORIES



Choices and Consequences
RESISTING THE FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT
In February 1851, Boston’s abolitionists faced a new challenge when federal authorities captured an escaped slave named Shadrach Minkins. As a federal judge ordered a hearing to determine Minkins’s status to be held three days later, 200 white and black abolitionists gathered outside the jail where he was held. Intimidating slave catchers and helping the Crafts avoid arrest had constituted resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act, but with Minkins in federal custody the question arose of whether abolitionists were willing to break the law to uphold their values. 
Choices




 Drawing on the civil disobedience tradition (see Chapter 11), declare the Fugitive Slave Act immoral and organize an extralegal effort to free Minkins.



 Respect the laws regarding fugitive slaves, but fight through the courts to prevent the extradition of Minkins and other alleged fugitive slaves.



 Respect the laws regarding fugitive slaves and accept the likely transportation of Minkins back to slavery, but organize a more effective effort to spirit fugitive slaves out of the country (like the Crafts).

Decision
 Convinced that the hearing would result in Minkins’s return to slavery, 20 African American men opted for Choice 1. They burst into the courtroom, overpowered the guards, and took Minkins to Montreal, Canada. The incident thrilled abolitionists, including Theodore Parker who wrote later,

 “I think it is the most noble deed done in Boston since the destruction of the tea in 1773.” Southerners and conservative Northerners like President Fillmore denounced the action as lawless.

Consequences
 When federal authorities apprehended another escaped slave, Thomas Sims, in Boston two months later, Fillmore sent 250 soldiers to guard the courthouse and escort the captive to a ship bound for Georgia. Nonetheless, similar extralegal incidents by abolitionists occurred elsewhere. In Christiana, Pennsylvania, in October 1851, for example, two dozen armed African American men killed a slaveholder from nearby Maryland who was pursuing two escaped

 slaves. These events outraged Southerners, especially pro-secessionist fire-eaters. South Carolina, Mississippi, and Georgia held conventions to denounce abolitionism and consider secession. The furor soon quieted down as the number of slave captures decreased sharply, largely because thousands of free blacks and escaped slaves fled to Canada (Ontario’s African American population doubled in the 1850s).

Continuing Controversies
 When are acts of civil disobedience and violence to further the cause of justice legitimate? In the 1850s, abolitionists deemed slavery such an outrageous violation of American freedom that acts of resistance—even violence—were justified. This question would generate heated debate in every subsequent era in American history, including movements for women’s suffrage in the 1910s and civil rights in the 1960s.

 What caused the furor over the Fugitive Slave Act to eventually subside?



 CHAPTER 12

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

Political Realignment
 Furor over the Fugitive Slave Act subsided after 1851, and American politics experienced a period of relative calm. Some felt a rising optimism over the prospect of territorial expansion into the Caribbean and Latin America. But unprecedented levels of immigration also spawned a powerful antiforeigner political movement that enjoyed widespread support until eclipsed by the reemergence of the slavery issue. Sectional animosity surged in 1854 as Congress debated whether to allow slavery in the Kansas and Nebraska territories. The resulting KansasNebraska Act prompted the collapse of the Whig Party and in 1856–1857, a violent and protracted conflict between pro- and antislavery forces, known as “Bleeding Kansas.”

Young America
 By late 1852, a prosperous economy and fear of disunion undermined the appeal of extremists in both North and South. Prosperity also helped calm the passions aroused by the Compromise of 1850 and the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. In the presidential election that year, both parties nominated moderate candidates (Democrat Franklin Pierce and Whig General Winfield Scott) and pledged to uphold the Compromise of 1850. Pierce won handily, but the most telling aspect of the election was the woeful performance of the Whig Party in the South (12.7) where Scott, allied with the antislavery wing of his party, won only Kentucky and Tennessee. The Whig Party was falling apart and soon would be gone. Pierce’s popularity stemmed from his reputation as a Northerner with Southern sympathies. He was also a member of a brash movement within 1,601,274 50.8%

 the Democratic Party called Young America. Enthusiastic about the notion of Manifest Destiny (see Chapter 11), Young America promoted a nationalist vision of territorial expansion, increased international trade, and the spread of American ideals of democracy and free enterprise abroad. America, they argued, possessed the right, even the obligation, to continue its expansion, especially into Latin America and the Caribbean.

 children, Leutze indicates that generations of future Americans will benefit from the land’s bounty. A radiant sunset implies God’s blessing on the enterprise. As president, Pierce proved an ardent proponent of expansion, which he believed would strengthen the Democratic Party and unite the nation. Yet his efforts had nearly the opposite effect. When Pierce entertained proposals to annex Hawaii and purchase Alaska, Southerners in Congress stymied the plans because the treaties would have outlawed slavery. Conversely, Northern representatives denounced his attempt in 1854 to acquire Cuba—with its plantation economy and 300,000 slaves—from Spain. Northerners likewise took a dim view of the invasions of Latin American and Caribbean countries by small armies of expansion-minded adventurers known as “filibusters” (an English corruption of the Dutch word for pirate). These operations delighted Southern slave owners, however, who viewed these lands as ideal, in the words of Mississippi Senator Albert G. Brown, “for the planting and spreading of slavery.” Pierce’s support for proslavery expansionism alienated Northern supporters and threatened to upset the sectional peace achieved by the Compromise of 1850. But the controversy over proposed expansion would pale by comparison with that sparked in 1854 over a plan to organize the territories of Kansas and Nebraska.

 territories and eventually states in the land west of Iowa and Missouri (essentially the northern half of the Louisiana Purchase). He was not alone. Farmers were eager to settle in the region’s fertile Kansas and Platte River Valleys, and promoters of a transcontinental railroad hoped to run a northern route through it. Neither settlement nor railroad construction could occur, however, before the federal government negotiated land treaties with Indians and organized the area as a territory. Douglas faced strong opposition from Southern congressmen who feared the new territories would eventually become two free states. They also had their sights set on a southern route for the transcontinental railroad, from New Orleans through the New Mexico territory to San Francisco. They told Douglas they would support his plan only if it included a repeal of the ban on slavery north of 36° 30' that had been a part of the Missouri Compromise in 1820. Promises of popular sovereignty, they warned, would not be enough. Fully aware that it would “raise a hell of a storm,” but hopeful it would boost his presidential ambitions for 1856, Douglas introduced his Kansas-Nebraska Act as a solution to the issues arising over these Western territories. In addition to repealing the ban on slavery north of 36° 30', the act

 called for splitting the area into two separate territories, Kansas west of Missouri and Nebraska west of Iowa (12.9). He intended this last provision to placate both North and South by allowing the eventual establishment of Kansas as a slave state (since its soil and climate were similar to neighboring Missouri) and Nebraska as a free state. The Kansas-Nebraska Act touched off a national debate more intense than that of 1850. Most Northerners, both Whigs and Democrats, considered the 36° 30' line an untouchable agreement that had ensured national peace for more than 30 years. Although some moderates had been willing in 1850 to allow slavery (via popular sovereignty) into Western territory lying south of the line, they now balked at doing so in land north of it.

 Free-Soilers and abolitionists denounced the bill as conclusive evidence that the South, now increasingly referred to as the “Slave Power,” was bent on spreading the curse of slavery wherever possible. They organized hundreds of “anti-Nebraska” rallies across the North and forwarded petitions to Congress. “Despite corruption, bribery, and treachery,” asserted one typical resolution, “Nebraska, the heart of our continent, shall forever remain free.” Undeterred, Douglas prevailed, and his bill passed in May 1854. But it was a costly victory that seriously weakened his Democratic Party and hampered his presidential ambitions by associating him with controversy. The impact on the Whigs was even worse, shattering the party along sectional

12.9 The Kansas-Nebraska Act
 The goal of Stephen A. Douglas in gaining passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act was to open the Great Plains to settlement and facilitate the construction of a transcontinental railroad (ideally running through his home state of Illinois). His repeal of the Missouri Compromise Line and the ensuing vigilante conflict in Kansas reignited the slavery controversy.

 lines. Every Northern Whig in the House and Senate voted against the measure, whereas most Southern Whigs joined the Democrats in support. More seriously, the death of the Whig Party in the South indicated that the bitter fight over Nebraska had permanently ended the long-standing spirit of accommodation between the North and South. Many Northerners resolved to make no more concessions to the Slave Power, whereas a growing number of Southerners resolved to preserve their rights from attacks by abolitionists. This intensifying polarization between North and South is revealed in these two sculptures of “Freedom” by Thomas Crawford (12.10). Crawford was commissioned in 1854 to create a statue of a monumental figure representing liberty to top the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. One year later he submitted a proposed model for the sculpture to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, who was overseeing the renovation of the Capitol. Davis approved of the overall scheme—a large classically robed woman holding a sword and shield—but one detail infuriated the vociferous defender of slavery from Mississippi. Crawford had given “Freedom” a cap worn by freed slaves in ancient Rome. Sensing an abolitionist plot (Crawford was a friend of leading abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner), Davis threatened to cancel the commission. Crawford quickly replaced the cap with a helmet surrounded by stars and a bald eagle.



 with the addition of proslavery Whigs. From that point the party came under growing Southern, proslavery control. The nascent Republican Party was not the only movement seeking to succeed the defunct Whig Party. Although many Northerners harbored growing concern about the Slave Power, others perceived a greater threat to their way of life: mass immigration. The flow of immigrants into the United States, rising steadily since the 1820s, became a tidal wave in the mid-1840s. Industrialization, population growth, and crop failure in Europe led hundreds of thousands of Irish, German, and other Western Europeans to seek new lives in America, where industrial jobs and cheap land abounded. Between 1845 and 1855, three million immigrants arrived, with most settling in Northern cities.

Republicans and
Know-Nothings
 The political impact of the Kansas-Nebraska controversy became clear in the 1854 Congressional elections. Free-Soilers, ex-Whigs, and antislavery Democrats in the North formed dozens of local parties under names like the Anti-Nebraska or the People’s Party. The most popular name, and the one under which they would eventually unite, was Republican. Despite their varied names, the parties shared an overriding commitment to opposing further concessions to Southern slave interests. As this loose collection of antislavery groups coalesced into the Republican Party, the Democratic Party was transformed. In the midterm elections of 1854, Northern Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives and all but two free-state legislatures. Many of the defeated Democrats lost because they had voted for the Kansas-Nebraska Act. But in the South the Democratic Party grew stronger

 CHAPTER 12

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

 This surge in immigration caused antiimmigrant sentiment, or nativism—native-born Americans’ belief in their superiority to the foreign born—to rise sharply. As Images as History: The “Foreign Menace” shows, Americans were upset not merely by the number of immigrants arriving, but also by their perceived character. Although most immigrants in previous decades had been Protestants from Britain—many of them with money and skills—a large majority of immigrants in the 1840s and 1850s were poor unskilled Catholics from Germany and Ireland. Anti-Catholicism, with roots in American history going back to the nation’s earliest European founders, surged into near hysteria. Some of the best-selling books in the antebellum period charged that Catholicism, with its emphasis on clerical authority and loyalty to the Pope in Rome, was incompatible with democracy. Nativists—those born in the United States—also feared that immigrants took American jobs, drank too much alcohol, refused to assimilate, and increased poverty, disease, and crime.

 “The ill-clad and destitute Irishman is repulsive to our habits and our tastes.” The Christian Examiner (N.Y.), 1848 Anti-immigrant sentiment reached a fever pitch in 1854 with the emergence of the American Party. Its core constituents were members of secret antiimmigrant societies founded in cities in the late 1840s. Because secrecy required them to answer “I know nothing” when asked about their organization, they earned the name “Know-Nothings.” Their political platform condemned both political parties as hopelessly corrupt and called for legislation restricting office to native-born citizens, barring public funds for parochial schools, and raising the period of naturalization for citizenship from five to 21 years. With the Whig Party in decline and the Democrats closely associated with the immigrant vote, Know-Nothings achieved stunning success in 1854, winning control of the state governments in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. About 75 Know-Nothing congressmen were sent to Washington. Elections one year later in 1855 saw the party

 win Maryland and Kentucky, elect scores of nativists in New York and California, and post impressive tallies across the South. After the elections of 1854, the big question was which of these two new political forces—antislavery Republicans or anti-immigrant Know Nothings— would replace the defunct Whig Party. But the American Party disintegrated almost as quickly as it arose, splitting like the Whig Party along sectional lines over slavery. Most of its members eventually joined the Republican Party. Although many former members retained their dislike of foreigners, they perceived the growing aggression of the Slave Power as a greater threat to the nation’s well-being. This threat seemed most menacing in the newly created territory of Kansas.

Ballots and Blood
 Even as opponents denounced Douglas’s plan to allow popular sovereignty to decide the status of slavery in the territories, they devised a plan to ensure the results went their way. “We will engage in competition for the virgin soil of Kansas,” William Seward warned his Southern colleagues in Congress just before passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, “and God give victory to the side which is stronger in numbers as in right.” Wealthy New England abolitionists established the Emigrant Aid Company and financed the migration of more than 2,000 antislavery settlers to Kansas. Thousands more went on their own. Proslavery interests, however, proved equal to the task of opposing them. To offset the soaring numbers of Northern settlers in Kansas, they organized bands of proslavery “border ruffians” to cross into Kansas from Missouri. Although some came as settlers, most were illegal voters determined to see Kansas enter the Union as a slave state. In spring 1855 men from Missouri cast nearly 5,000 illegal votes helping elect a proslavery territorial government that gathered in the town of Lecompton and legalized slavery. Antislavery settlers rejected the legitimacy of this “bogus legislature.” In fall 1855, they drew up a freestate constitution, held elections that resulted in an antislavery legislature and governor located in the town of Lawrence, and asked Congress to admit the territory as a free state. Kansas now had two governments, bitterly opposed to each other. Kansas quickly became a divisive issue in Congress. Although the Senate (controlled by

From the colonial period up to the present, Americans have held conflicted visions about immigration.

 Democrats) voted to recognize the proslavery government of Lecompton, the House (controlled by Republicans) recognized the free-state government in Lawrence. On May 20, 1856, Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, a rising figure in the abolitionist movement, delivered a speech titled the “Crime Against Kansas,” a harsh denunciation of Southern efforts to force slavery into the territory. Days later, South Carolina Congressman Preston Brooks attacked Sumner with a cane in the Senate chamber for his affront to Southern honor. Sumner nearly died from his injuries and never fully recovered his health. As the image suggests (12.11), antislavery Northerners hailed Sumner as a near martyr. The artist’s emphasis on Brooks’s brutality and Sumner’s vulnerability (he is armed with only a pen) popularized the abolitionist vision of slavery as an inherently barbarous institution and its supporters, both in Congress and on the plains of Kansas, as violent criminals who did not respect democracy or free speech. In contrast Brooks became a hero in the South for defending Southern rights and dignity. Hundreds mailed him notes of congratulations, and a few even sent canes as a symbol of their support, inscribed with phrases like “Hit Him Again.” Only days after Sumner’s speech, heavily armed proslavery vigilantes attacked Lawrence, Kansas, home to the antislavery territorial government.

 The posse sacked the town, setting fire to the main hotel and destroying its two newspaper presses. Antislavery settlers arrived too late to prevent the devastation. Among them was John Brown, a zealous abolitionist who believed himself God’s chosen instrument for eradicating slavery. Three days later he led abolitionist avengers in a counterassault at Pottawatomie Creek, Kansas. Falling upon a settlement of proslavery families, the abolitionists pulled five men from their beds and murdered them with swords. The violence touched off a wave of vigilante reprisals and counter-reprisals by proslavery and antislavery forces. Newspapers began referring to “Bleeding Kansas” to describe the quasi-civil war taking place there. The antislavery press in the North, as exemplified by this political cartoon from 1856 (12.12), inflamed abolitionist passions. Note how the artist depicts key Democratic politicians as “border ruffians,” the pejorative name used by opponents of slavery to describe proslavery vigilantes. In the center kneels Liberty, begging for mercy (“O spare me gentlemen, spare me!”) while President Pierce (to her left) and Democratic Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan (right) stand on the American flag and taunt her.

 man to death. Images like this, along with editorials, sermons, and speeches, inspired Northerners to send money and guns to aid the Free-Soil cause, or to join Free-Soil settlers heading for Kansas to thwart proslavery efforts. By the time President Pierce sent a new governor and 1,300 troops to Kansas in 1856, 200 people lay dead, including one of John Brown’s sons. The decadeslong bitter debate over the status of slavery had erupted into armed conflict. The highly charged events of 1854–1856 benefited the young Republican Party. Thousands of Free-Soil, Whig, and Democratic voters joined its ranks, making it the largest party in the North. Yet it was also a purely sectional party with no support in the South. Democrats had the advantage of being the only true national party, with strength in both sections.

 For the presidential election of 1856, Republicans nominated the famed Western explorer John C. Frémont and waged a campaign likened to an evangelical crusade. Groups calling themselves “Wide Awakes” staged torchlight processions across the North, touting “Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Men, Frémont!” Democrats chose James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, who, like Winfield Scott and Lewis Cass, presidential candidates in elections before him, was a Northerner with pro-Southern credentials. The centerpiece of Buchanan’s campaign was to play on the racism of many Northern voters by branding his opponents “Black Republicans,” a racist pejorative that suggested that Republicans who opposed the extension of slavery into the Western territories were dangerous radicals who favored abolition and racial equality. The fast-fading American Party nominated ex-Whig and former president Millard Fillmore.

 1857 when proslavery Kansans (who controlled the territorial legislature) held a convention in Lecompton and drafted a proslavery state constitution as a preliminary step to applying to Congress for statehood. When these proslavery men put the Lecompton Constitution before the people of Kansas in a referendum, antislavery residents, deeming both the legislature and the convention illegitimate, boycotted it. As a result, the constitution won approval easily and was forwarded to Congress. To complicate matters, however, in the fall the antislavery party won control of the territorial legislature and immediately authorized a second referendum on the proslavery constitution. This time proslavery residents boycotted, and the constitution was rejected by more than twothirds of the voters, who were overwhelmingly antislavery. The scene then shifted to Washington. President Buchanan gave in under intense pressure from Southerners in his cabinet and in Congress, who threatened secession if the proslavery Lecompton Constitution was not accepted and Kansas admitted as a slave state. Douglas came out against Lecompton because it was unpopular in his home state of Illinois, and it mocked his vaunted principle of popular sovereignty (even as it exposed its weakness). Months of rancorous debate ensued. A brawl broke out in the House, and some members of Congress began to come to the chamber armed. The Senate approved the Lecompton Constitution, but the House narrowly rejected it. Kansas would remain a territory indefinitely.

 CHAPTER 12

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

Two Societies
 From an economic standpoint the 1850s brought stronger bonds of interdependence between North and South. Northern textile manufacturers depended on a steady supply of Southern cotton, whereas Southerners relied on Northern manufactured goods, credit, and shipping. Yet overshadowing the increased economic integration of North and South was their splitting into two distinct societies. Northeastern and Midwestern states industrialized at a stunning pace, symbolized by the spread in these regions of the railroad and factory. In much of the South, by contrast, economic growth arose from an ever-expanding system of staple crop production, notably cotton that depended on the labor of four million slaves. Along with these divergent economies, North and South developed distinct philosophies that defined their vision of the proper social order.

The Industrial North
12.15 The Crystal
Palace, 1853
Hundreds of
 thousands of visitors flocked to New York City in 1853 to view the “Exhibition of the Industry of the World” in the Crystal Palace. The main building itself, made of cast-iron and glass, was an expression of the latest industrial materials and design.

 The industrial revolution that began in places like Lowell, Massachusetts in the early 1800s, and then staggered after the Panic of 1837, reached new heights after the economic recovery in the early 1840s. Centered almost entirely in the North, this boom was triggered by three main developments. First, starting in the firearms industry and spreading into clocks, sewing machines, and farming equipment, Americans pioneered in the creation of machines made of interchangeable parts, thus facilitating the rapid manufacture of inexpensive goods. Second, manufacturers began to power their machines with steam, an energy source that was more powerful, reliable,

 and flexible than water power provided by rivers. Finally, manufacturers benefited from the huge pool of cheap labor provided by a steady influx of immigrants. Manufacturing output soared, and by 1860 the total value of all goods produced in the North reached $1.5 billion (compared to $483 million for the entire nation in 1840). The dynamic and innovative character of the Northern industrial economy was displayed for all the world to see in 1853 at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in New York City. Modeled on a similar exhibition in London in 1851, the “Exhibition of the Industry of the World,” as it was officially known, featured more than 4,000 exhibits, most of them American. Even the building itself (12.15), a monumental cast-iron

TWO SOCIETIES

 and glass structure, reflected the latest trends in architecture, design, and construction materials. More than one million people came to see the latest in modern technology, including Cyrus McCormick’s mechanical reaper, Richard M. Hoe’s rotary printing press, and Elisha Otis’s elevator. The only Southern exhibitions of new technology were improved versions of the cotton gin. The same spirit of enthusiasm and confidence that inspired the Crystal Palace Exhibition is also captured in this advertisement for the Colt Patent Fire Arms Manufactury in 1862 (12.16). Samuel Colt from Connecticut patented a design for a revolver in 1837 and then established an enormously successful firearms manufacturing business in Hartford. The image that dominates the advertisement conveys two main ideas. First, it shows a huge manufacturing establishment, the very size of which is intended to suggest strength and power. Second, the image shows the modern factory nestled neatly within a small New England town, suggesting that industry poses no threat to smalltown American values. Colt’s was one of many arms-manufacturing businesses that flourished in the 1840s and 1850s. Nearly all of them were located in the North, accounting for 90 percent of national output. Equally important to the emerging industrial economy was the building of a massive railroad network. Trackage soared from more than 9,000 miles in 1850 to over 30,000 in 1860. Because most of this track lay west of Pennsylvania, it bound the states of the Northeast more closely with those in the Midwest, such as Illinois. Trade increasingly moved east to west along railroads and canals rather than north to south along rivers as in earlier decades, accentuating the growing sectional divide. The growth of the railroads, along with two additional technological innovations—the reaper and the cast steel plow— revolutionized Northern and Western agriculture, which was still the foundation of the national economy. Cyrus McCormick’s

 mechanical reaper was a piece of equipment on small wheels pulled by a horse. As it passed through a field, sharp blades moved back and forth severing stalks of wheat. The harvested grain was then collected in a cradle. The reaper allowed for a much faster harvest—often crucial in times of bad weather—and eliminated the need to hire expensive farm labor. John Deere’s cast steel plow sliced smoothly through the toughest soil, making farming much easier and more efficient. Both inventions allowed farmers to expand the size of their farms, knowing they could handle the additional plowing and harvesting. The railroad also allowed farmers to sell their produce in markets hundreds of miles away and to turn from raising a mixture of animal, fruit, vegetable, and grain products to specializing in single crops such as wheat, corn, or oats. Rising prices and growing demand from abroad for American grain augmented this trend. Industrialization brought rising wages and opportunity to most Northerners, but also new levels of poverty—especially among unskilled and immigrant workers who formed a growing class of urban poor. Wages in many industrializing sectors, such as shoe making and textiles, were too low for one earner to support a family. To increase their family’s income, growing numbers of women and children worked in factories or performed “outwork” in their homes, often for 60 or 70 hours per week. Many workers became unemployed for

 CHAPTER 12

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

Envisioning Evidence
THE RISE OF KING COTTON
Many Americans associate cotton cultivation with slavery, but the relationship really only took form in the last half century of slavery’s existence in the United States (roughly between 1810 and 1860). The growth of textile manufacturing in Britain and the Northern United States in the early 1800s created a booming demand for cotton. At the same time, the expulsion of Native Americans from the fertile lands of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Florida, and North and South Carolina opened the way for cotton cultivation on a mass scale. Between 1815 and 1860 millions of white settlers moved into these lands. They brought with them millions of slaves who they put to work raising cotton. By 1830 cotton had become the South’s most profitable product and slavery the single most important source of capital investment. Cotton’s value only increased over the next three decades, leading many Southerners to conclude that if the rising controversy over slavery led to secession, the South was strong enough to flourish on its own. “Cotton was King,” went a popular slogan in the late 1850s.

DeBow, started a magazine with the motto “Commerce is King” and held commercial conventions throughout the South. By 1860, DeBow and other proponents of greater Southern economic independence could point to substantial progress. Southern railroad mileage had increased fourfold to 9,000 miles, and there were 18,000 factories, most in the upper South. But the economy of the North grew even faster. Even as the South increased its textile manufacture by 44 percent in the 1850s, its share of manufacturing nationwide declined by two percent. Indeed, in 1860, the city of Lowell, Massachusetts, operated more textile spindles than all the Southern states combined. The South remained an agricultural society. So long as staple crops brought high prices, only a handful of Southerners seemed willing to pursue industrialization.

 Industry also flourished in the upper South, especially in Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri. But it paled in comparison to industrialization in the North and constituted only a fraction of the overall Southern economy. Production of cash crops such as tobacco, sugar, and rice soared, as did prices. Nothing, however, outperformed the South’s main staple crop, cotton. Production jumped from 1.35 million bales in 1840 to 4.8 million bales by 1860. (Each bale weighed approximately 480 pounds.) Southern cotton by this time accounted for three-fifths of American exports and three-quarters of the world supply. As one Southern nationalist put it, “Cotton is King.” What made cotton king in this period was the labor of slaves—nearly four million by 1860.

 sign of wealth and status. Others embraced a longstanding Southern doctrine that white freedom depended on slavery. Because slaves performed hard, menial labor, slavery established a floor in the Southern economy, below which even the poorest whites could not descend. “Break down slavery,” argued one Virginian, “and you would with the same blow destroy the great Democratic principle of equality among men”—by which he meant, white men. Above all, poor Southerners supported slavery because they accepted the essential tenets of white supremacy, in particular the notion that blacks were inferior to whites and destined to live under their dominance. “Now suppose they was free,” said a white Alabama farmer about slaves to a Northerner touring the South in the 1850s, “they’d all think themselves just as good as we.… how would you like to hev a nigger feelin’ just as good as a white man?”

Divergent Visions
 Southern society not only preached the superiority of whites over blacks, but also the superiority of slave labor over Northern wage labor. The most prominent defender of slavery was George Fitzhugh. In books and pamphlets published in the 1850s, he argued that all great societies in history practiced slavery and that the Southern version was remarkably humane because masters felt obliged to feed, clothe, and shelter their slaves. “The negro slaves of the South,” he wrote, “are the happiest, and, in some sense, the freest people in the world.” Moreover, argued Fitzhugh and others, such as the artist who drew this image that idealized slavery (12.17), slavery rescued Africans from the so-called barbarism of Africa and exposed them to “civilization” and Christianity. Pointing to the North’s urban slums swelled with poor industrial workers, Fitzhugh ridiculed the Northern contention that wage labor was morally superior to slavery. Northern factory workers, he asserted, were little more than “wage slaves.” Their condition was worse than that of the black slave because factory owners owed them nothing but the lowest possible wage. “Capital exercises a more perfect compulsion over free laborers than human masters over slaves,” wrote Fitzhugh, “for free laborers must at all times work or starve, and slaves are supported whether they work or not.” Northern society with its “hireling labor,” claimed an official in Charleston, was characterized by “pauperism, rowdyism, mobism and anti-rentism.”

 Why did Southern whites who owned no slaves support slavery?

 Republicans had an answer for the likes of Fitzhugh: a free labor philosophy that celebrated the virtues of individualism, independence, entrepreneurship, and upward mobility. As Fitzhugh did for the slave South, they offered an idealized vision of the industrial North that conveniently ignored the hopeless plight of many poverty-stricken city dwellers. “In the constitution of human nature,” wrote New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley, “the desire of bettering one’s condition is the mainspring of effort.” In contrast to the South, which reserved hard labor for slaves, argued Greeley, in the North all work was noble and moral, no matter how menial. Better still, for the ambitious, wage labor need only be temporary. If a man labored hard, saved his money, avoided drink, and sought opportunity, went the free labor philosophy, he would soon possess his own farm or small business. Nothing—not lack of money, family ties, formal education, or American birth—stood in the way of success. A slave-based society, then, for these Republicans, was the antithesis of this dynamic society of democratic opportunity. “Enslave a man,” wrote Greeley, “and you destroy his ambition, his enterprise, his capacity.” To Northern abolitionists, slavery also stifled the capacity of most poor and middling whites, protecting the privileges of the aristocratic few and leaving the rest with little opportunity for success. Even worse, slavery led to a culture that celebrated laziness, luxury, and decadence as opposed to the capitalist virtues of hard work, thrift, and self-restraint. Northern writers like Frederick Law Olmsted, who traveled the South in the 1850s, frequently commented on the backwardness of Southern life, its lack of public education, railroads, factories, and substantial cities as well as a general tone of despair and fatalism among poor whites. This ideological war of words intensified when a financial panic on Wall Street sent the economy plunging into a deep recession in late 1857, bringing unemployment and hard times to the industrial Northeast and agrarian West. But because the Southern economy was so geared toward the export of cotton, it experienced little of the Panic of 1857. Southern nationalists pointed to this as evidence that “cotton is supreme” in comparison to Northern industry. Southerners also argued that it proved the South could prosper on its own should the Union ever dissolve. The development of these divergent philosophies in the 1850s played a major role in creating a climate of extreme mistrust between North and South. Given the moral and social dimension of

 the proslavery argument, Southerners perceived Northern criticism of slavery and attempts to prevent its spread as attacks on their “way of life.” Likewise, Southern celebration of slavery and criticism of capitalist free labor convinced many Northerners that the slave power intended to spread slavery everywhere, including into the industrial North. The successful efforts by

 Southerners in Congress to defeat proposals for higher tariffs to protect Northern industry, land grants to promote a transcontinental railroad, and a homestead act to give 160 acres of public land to Western settlers accentuated hard feelings in the North. In 1858, a leading ideologue of the Republican Party, William Seward, predicted “an irrepressible conflict” between the two societies.

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

A
House Divided  By the late 1850s, slavery dominated national politics. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the congressional elections of 1858, especially in Illinois where Senator Stephen A. Douglas engaged in a series of famous debates, mostly on the slavery issue, with a little-known Republican challenger named Abraham Lincoln. Increasingly, Southerners became convinced that Northerners wanted not simply to exclude slavery from the Western territories but to destroy it. John Brown’s abolitionist raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia in late 1859 only added to this perception. The subsequent election the following year of Abraham Lincoln, whose Republican Party Southern hardliners believed was committed to abolition, sparked a secession movement that soon brought the nation to the brink of civil war.

The Lincoln-Douglas Debates
 In 1858, national attention turned to Illinois, where Stephen A. Douglas, a leading Democrat and certain 1860 presidential candidate, was running for reelection to the Senate. Many Americans were eager to see which direction he would take on the slavery issue. Opposing him was Abraham Lincoln, a former Illinois state representative and congressman. No abolitionist, Lincoln nevertheless believed slavery was immoral and hoped to prevent its spread to the Western territories. “A house divided against itself cannot stand,” warned Lincoln in his speech accepting the Republican nomination to run for senator. “I believe this Government cannot endure permanently half-slave and half-free.” The overwhelming underdog in the contest, Lincoln boldly challenged Douglas to a series of seven debates across Illinois. The ensuing LincolnDouglas debates focused on the fate of slavery, the legal and social status of African Americans, and the viability of popular sovereignty in the wake of the Dred Scott decision. Douglas portrayed Lincoln as a radical abolitionist and “Black Republican” whose policies would destroy the Union, elevate blacks to social and legal equality with whites, and promote interracial marriage. Lincoln denied these charges but made clear that a black man was “entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” In this “he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.” Lincoln also castigated Douglas for his professed moral indifference toward slavery. “If slavery is not wrong,” Lincoln asserted, “nothing is wrong.” Douglas won reelection to the Senate, but Lincoln had forced him to make statements that appeared both indifferent to slavery and willing to let residents

 in the Western territories ban it, thereby antagonizing both Southern fire-eaters and Northern free soilers. His opponents would use these words against him in the presidential campaign in 1860. More important, the debates made Lincoln a national figure and a rising star within the Republican Party.

 John Brown’s Raid In 1857, just months after staging the Pottawatomie Creek massacre in Kansas, abolitionist John Brown began plotting an invasion of the South that he hoped would lead to a widespread slave revolt and the end of slavery. A deeply religious man raised from an early age to hate slavery, Brown believed God had called upon him to destroy slavery. His sense of mission is revealed in this 1847 daguerreotype (12.18). In it Brown reenacts a scene from a decade earlier when he stood up in a crowded church, raised his right hand, and pledged to commit his life to abolition. Brown’s passion for the cause inspired many supporters and by the summer of 1859, with secret assistance from a number of prominent abolitionists, he had gathered 17 whites (including three of his sons) and five blacks and moved to a farm in Maryland. John Brown’s raid began at eight o’clock on the evening of October 16. Leading his raiders across the Potomac River to Harpers Ferry, Virginia, Brown quickly took control of the town and seized its federal arsenal full of guns and ammunition. They planned to fan out across the South, arming slaves and touching off a wave of rebellion. But they were quickly cornered, and on October 18 U.S. Marines under Colonel Robert E. Lee stormed their stronghold. The soldiers killed ten of Brown’s men, including two of his sons, and took Brown and six others prisoner.

12.18 John Brown Vows to Destroy Slavery
 In 1847, John Brown stood for this daguerreotype taken by African-American photographer Augustus Washington, reenacting a pledge he made to destroy slavery ten years earlier at an abolitionist meeting.

 Six weeks later a Virginia jury found Brown and his men guilty of treason and sentenced them to hang. When given the opportunity to speak, Brown declared that he had acted in accordance with the Bible’s call to fight for justice, a cause for which he was prepared to die. On the day of his execution, Brown wrote one last note that proved eerily prophetic of the coming Civil War. “I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood.” If in life Brown had failed to overthrow slavery, in death he furthered the abolitionist cause by becoming an instant martyr to many in the North. On the day of his execution, bells tolled in hundreds of towns from Boston to Chicago. At rallies and church services, Brown was lionized as a righteous instrument of God. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote of Brown as a Christ-like figure who had made “the gallows as glorious as the cross.” Abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, a life-long pacifist, told an audience in Boston, “I am

 prepared to say ‘success to every slave insurrection at the South and in every slave country.’” Not all Northerners were so enthusiastic, however; opponents of slavery like Lincoln and Greeley criticized Brown’s use of violence. Still there was no denying, observed one Northerner, that the “death of no man in America has ever produced so profound a sensation.” Sensation also struck in the South, but it was one of fear and outrage. Brown’s audacious act rekindled among Southerners what Frederick Douglass called the ever-present “dread and terror” of slave insurrection. Brown’s glorification by Northern editorialists, politicians, and ministers convinced many Southerners that Northern abolitionists would continue to conspire to instigate future slave uprisings to destroy Southern society. “Mr. Seward and his followers,” charged a Mississippi legislator saying that the North’s leading abolitionists, “have declared war upon us.” Increasingly, Southerners talked of dissolving their union with the North to protect their property and way of life. Robert Toombs of Georgia voiced the most pressing concern of Southerners: “Never permit this Federal government to pass into the traitorous hands of the black Republican party.”

The Election of 1860
 Throughout the 1850s, the Democratic Party had managed to withstand the strains of sectional discord that demolished the Whigs and created a Republican Party with virtually no support in the South. But when the Democrats met in April 1860 in Charleston, South Carolina, to nominate a presidential candidate, disagreements between Northern and Southern delegates caused the convention to disband, unable to agree on a nominee. The sectional split became official when a Baltimore convention of mostly Northern Democrats nominated Stephen A. Douglas, a man Southerners had become convinced would not protect slavery. A week later a convention of Southern Democrats also met in Baltimore and nominated John C. Breckinridge, Buchanan’s vice president and a staunch proslavery man from Kentucky. To complicate matters, former Southern Whigs and Know-Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee, a pro-Union slaveholder of moderate views. The split among the Democrats and the emergence of the Constitutional Union Party enhanced Republican chances for victory. Deeming Seward too controversial on the slavery issue, Republicans

 Breckinridge won all the Deep South states but polled just 18 percent of the popular vote. Bell of the Constitutional Union Party finished fourth taking three states of the upper South and 13 percent of the popular vote.

It was precisely the scenario Southern extremists had threatened would lead to dissolution of the Union.



 “That the South can afford to live under a Government, the majority of whose citizens … regard John Brown as a martyr and a Christian hero, rather than a murderer … is a preposterous idea.” Baltimore Sun, November 28, 1859

Secession
 Southern fire-eaters, having warned Southerners that the election of a “Black Republican” would lead to the end of slavery and the destruction of their society, wasted no time in calling for secession. Secessionist rallies broke out across the South. Nowhere was secession sentiment stronger than in the epicenter of Southern nationalism, South Carolina. Brushing aside the pleas of moderates to wait until the slave states could agree on a united course of action, South Carolina legislators called a convention to consider secession from the union. On December 20, 1860, this convention unanimously resolved that the “union now subsisting between South Carolina and the other States … is hereby dissolved.” In less than two months, six more states—Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas—also seceded (12.19). One by one their representatives in Washington delivered speeches, resigned, and headed home. Six of the seceded states sent delegates to Montgomery, Alabama, in early February where they organized a government similar to the one they had just left. The major exception, of course, was that its constitution declared slavery legal and protected everywhere in the new nation. They called their new nation the Confederate States of America and elected Jefferson Davis of Mississippi as its first president and Alexander Stephens of Georgia as vice president. They also created a Confederate Seal (12.20) that featured George Washington—not only the foremost Founding Father, but a Virginian and a slave owner—at the center and established his birthday, February 22, as the official birth of the Confederacy. These choices reflected the Confederates’ goal to legitimize secession by comparing it to the thirteen colonies breaking away from Britain during the American Revolution. Even as the new Confederate government took shape, President James Buchanan, a weak and timid leader with Southern sympathies, did little to avert the crisis, claiming that he lacked constitutional

 authority to do anything. Moderates mobilized to see if they could, as in previous sectional crises in 1820, 1833, 1850, and 1854, devise a compromise acceptable to both sections. Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky put forth the leading proposal. The Crittenden Compromise proposed constitutional amendments to protect slavery, including one extending the old Missouri Compromise line of 36° 30' to the Pacific, permitting slavery south of it, prohibiting it to the north. But while president-elect Lincoln expressed a willingness to compromise— including supporting a constitutional amendment protecting slavery where it existed in the South—he would not support the Crittenden Compromise. “On the territorial question,” he said in reference to the Republican opposition to extending slavery into the West, “I am inflexible.” With that the proposal died. Confederate President Jefferson Davis likewise professed an aversion to conflict, but rejected compromise. For the Confederate States of America, the decision to secede was permanent. The citizens of the Confederacy, he argued, asked simply to be left alone. The impasse left moderates in despair, but Lincoln placed his faith in pro-Union sentiment in the South. He believed that for all 12.20 The Confederate Seal: Linking Secession with the Spirit of 1776 By placing George Washington at the center of the Confederate Seal, Southerners sought to legitimize secession by comparing it to the decision of the thirteen colonies to break away from Britain in 1776.

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

 “The tea has been thrown overboard; the revolution of 1860 has been initiated.” Charleston (S.C.) Mercury, reacting to Lincoln’s election their bluster, Southern fire-eaters would eventually pull back from the brink of disunion and civil war as they had so many times before. After all, eight slave states in the upper South still remained within the Union. His inaugural address (see Competing Visions: Secession or Union?) emphasized reconciliation while also declaring the Union indivisible and secession illegal. Lincoln also asserted his intent to “hold, occupy, and possess” all federal property in the seceded states. Although the seceding states had seized nearly all federal property within their borders, two harbor forts remained in federal control, Fort Pickens in Pensacola, Florida, and Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina.

 With food and other necessities running low at Fort Sumter, Lincoln informed the South Carolina government of his intention to send a ship with non-military supplies to resupply the garrison. For Confederate leaders the moment of truth had arrived. If they submitted to federal authority, secession would appear hollow. If they fired on the ship, they would be branded as the aggressors in the coming struggle. Confederate officials decided to force the issue before the ship arrived and ordered Major Robert Anderson, in command of the fort, to surrender. When Anderson refused, Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard began an artillery assault on the morning of April 12, and by afternoon the next day, the Union garrison surrendered. Southerners exulted in their quick victory, and immediately raised the Confederate flag over the ruins as a symbol of their triumph and sovereignty as an independent nation (12.21). On April 15, Lincoln declared the lower South to be in a state of “insurrection” and called for 75,000 men to enlist to put down the rebellion. The Civil War had begun.

Competing Visions
SECESSION OR UNION?
Mississippi’s declaration of secession and Abraham Lincoln’s inaugural address from March 1861 present opposing views on secession. Note how both parties invoke the Constitution and other American traditions to justify their positions. How do the secessionists support their claim that the mere election of Lincoln justified secession? How does Lincoln reject the idea of secession and seek to place the responsibility for hostilities on the seceded states? Patterned on the Declaration of Independence, Mississippi’s declaration of secession sets forth a list of alleged attacks on slavery and states rights by the North. Our position is thoroughly identified with… slavery—the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes… the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth.… These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization.… The hostility to this institution commenced before the adoption of the Constitution…. It has grown until it denies the right of property in slaves, and refuses protection to that right on the high seas, in the Territories, and wherever the government of the United States had jurisdiction. It refuses the admission of new slave States into the Union, and seeks to extinguish it by confining it within its present limits, denying the power of expansion.… It has nullified the Fugitive Slave Law in almost every free State in the Union… It advocates negro equality, socially and politically, and promotes insurrection and incendiarism in our midst. It has enlisted its press, its pulpit and its schools against us, until the whole popular mind of the North is excited and inflamed with prejudice.… It has recently obtained control of the Government, by the prosecution of its… schemes, and destroyed the last expectation of living together in friendship.… Utter subjugation awaits us in the Union, if we should consent longer to remain in it. It is not a matter of choice, but of necessity. We must either submit to degradation, and to the loss of property worth four billions of money, or we must secede from the Union framed by our fathers, to secure this as well as every other species of property. For far less cause than this, our fathers separated from the Crown of England. Our decision is made. We follow their footsteps. We embrace the alternative of separation… The flag of Mississippi, adopted after the state’s secession in January 1861. 
 Lincoln used his inaugural address in March 1861 to respond directly to the assertions contained in the declarations of Mississippi and other seceded states. He attempted to reassure Southerners that his administration was not hostile to their interests, while rejecting their justification for secession. Fellow citizens of the United States: … I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination.… It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence, within any State or States, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances. I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.… In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. In YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail YOU. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. YOU have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to “preserve, protect, and defend it.” I am loathe to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.…
