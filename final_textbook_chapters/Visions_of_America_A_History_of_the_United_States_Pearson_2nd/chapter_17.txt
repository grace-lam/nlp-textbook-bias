 to industrial supremacy by 1900 even more astonishing. Every statistical comparison between 1860 and 1900, from factory production to railroad mileage, told the same story of phenomenal growth that saw the Gross National Product rise 171 percent (16.1). Several factors combined to allow the United States to surpass all other industrialized countries by % Increase 1900. First, the nation possessed enormous quantities of 142.3 two essential ingredients for rapid industrialization: raw materials and cheap labor. 180.7 Vast deposits of coal in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and 150.0 Kentucky, for example, provided a seemingly inexhaust263.0 ible supply of inexpensive fuel to fire steam locomo584.0 tives and factory machinery. Other plentiful resources 292.3 included iron, lead, copper, silver, gold, wood, cotton, and oil. Cheap labor came from 1982.7 two sources. Record levels of immigration (see Chapter 17) in the late nineteenth century pushed the number of foreign-born to one in five American workers (two in 165.8 five in manufacturing and mining) by 1910. Millions of 9064.8 American-born workers also moved from rural settings to manufacturing centers in 543.3 search of new opportunities. Many women and children, 79,761.5 both immigrant and nativeborn, also entered the paid 171.4 workforce.

THE EMERGENCE OF BIG BUSINESS

 The relentless development and adoption of new technology also furthered industrialization in the United States. Inventors flooded the U.S. Patent Office with applications, raising the number from an average of 1,000 per year in the 1850s to 20,000 per year in the 1890s. Some notable inventors, such as George Eastman (Kodak camera), William S. Burroughs (adding machine), Isaac Singer (sewing machine), Alexander Graham Bell (telephone), and Thomas Edison (incandescent light bulb, phonograph, motion picture camera, mimeograph machine, and more) became business giants. Less well known were the many women, immigrant, and African American inventors who filed thousands of patents in this period. For example, Jan Matzeliger, an immigrant of African and Dutch heritage from South America, invented a machine that simplified the most difficult and time-consuming step in making shoes ( 16.2). Although much of shoemaking had become mechanized by the 1880s, the difficult “lasting” process—attaching the upper portion of a shoe to the sole—could be done only by hand. Matzeliger’s lasting machine (patented in 1883) was a complex device, yet was easy for unskilled workers to operate, allowing manufacturers to boost production while slashing costs. Government policy also boosted American industrialization. The federal government and the states extended substantial support to railroad projects that totaled almost 180 million acres in land grants and $500 million in loans and tax breaks (see Chapters 13 and 15). Public officials, in an argument later used to justify government support for the interstate highway system and the Internet, defended this largess by arguing that railroads generated economic growth that benefited everyone from travelers to farmers to manufacturers. High federal tariffs that raised the price of imported goods, thereby helping domestic manufacturers, also promoted industrialization. Yet the government also facilitated industrialization by inaction. Public officials, business leaders, and conservatives subscribed to the philosophy of laissez-faire (French for “let do,” or “leave alone”), which argued that the government should impose no restraints on business, including workers’ demands for laws to regulate the hours of work, safety conditions, and wages. Government officials also ignored reformers’ demands for an income tax and laws curbing cutthroat business

 practices. As Thomas Nast’s political cartoon vividly shows (16.3), business and government leaders argued that government interference harmed the American economy, depicted here as a woman weighed down by government-imposed burdens such as income taxes, laws (regulations), and “ideal” money (money not backed by gold). The closed shop and idle ship in the background and the vultures circling overhead all suggested these policies would kill the economy. Widespread support for laissez-faire among lawmakers left capitalists to operate in a market free of the restraints of government regulation.

 CHAPTER 16

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

The Railroads
 The most dramatic change in the late nineteenthcentury industrial economy was the emergence of large corporations, business organizations established by a group of individuals and owned by people who buy shares of stock in the company. Before the Civil War, most American manufacturers were small-scale operations with fewer than 25 employees. They were usually privately owned and sold their products within a few hundred miles of where they were made. All this changed after 1865, as entrepreneurs, seeking bigger markets and greater profits that they could now reach thanks to the railroad and telegraph, began to form massive corporations that boasted thousands of employees in a single factory complex, operations in several states, and millions of dollars of investment capital raised from the sales of stock. The original big businesses were railroads, and they played a key role in transforming the United States into an industrial power. In 1865, scores of small railroad companies operated throughout the Northeast and Midwest and, to a lesser extent, the South. Comprising 35,000 miles of track, they serviced small areas and established their own standards for things such as track gauge (the distance between the rails). Nearly all suffered from financial instability and poor management. But by 1900, this haphazard system had developed into a massive, consolidated, and integrated national railroad network of 193,000 miles dominated by just seven large corporations. Railroads grew at such a ferocious pace because they could be built almost anywhere, creating a transportation network no longer confined to meandering rivers and expensive, slow-to-construct canals that often froze in winter. The railroad also offered another great advantage: speed. People, mail, and goods traveling by stagecoach might, on a good day, cover 50 miles. A steam locomotive pulling many times more people, mail, and goods could cover the

 same distance in less than two hours. And after the completion of the first trans-continental line in 1869 (see map 15.8), the railroad offered service from coast to coast. The quicker and cheaper transportation offered by the railroad benefited the national economy. Railroads opened new areas of settlement, enticing farmers to settle on nearby land (often sold to them by the railroad), confident that they could get their produce to market. Shopkeepers, artisans, laborers, and railroad employees (one million by 1900) settled in towns that sprang up along the tracks. In turn they became consumers of finished goods brought by the railroad from Eastern manufacturers. The railroad industry also contributed to the national economy by consuming large quantities of iron, steel, coal, and wood. Fierce competition among railroads initially led to the rapid expansion of lines. By the 1870s, many railroads tried to diminish competition by buying out rivals, leading to the creation of giant corporations such as the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad. Both owned thousands of miles of track in many states, employed tens of thousands of workers, and handled millions of dollars in investment capital and revenue.

Modern Business Practices
 The success of the large railroad corporations led to the modernization of business practices in two important ways. First, railroad corporations showed other types of businesses the advantages of incorporating and issuing stock. Stock sales allowed corporations to raise capital to expand the business (for example, to buy new and more efficient equipment, or a rival company). If the company earned a profit, stockholders benefited from an increase in the value of the stock (which they could sell for a profit) and sometimes by earning dividends. Stockholders played no direct role in running a company; a professional management team performed that

 “Railroad time, it appears, is to be the time of the future. And so, people will now have to marry and die by railroad time. Ministers will preach by railroad time, and banks will be required to open and close by the same time. The sun is no longer the boss of the job.” Indianapolis Sentinel, 1883

 function. But stockholders also enjoyed “limited liability”: If the company failed they were not liable for any of its debts or obligations; they stood to lose only their shares. By the 1870s, many companies involved in manufacturing, mining, communications, and finance had incorporated. Second, the sudden emergence of huge railroad corporations encouraged the development of modern, sophisticated management practices. Chief among these practices was standardization. For example, in 1883, the nation’s major railroads established the four time zones that are still in use today. This decision helped to combat the problem of irregular “local time” (for example, when local time in New York City was 12:00 p.m., it might be 11:55 a.m. in Philadelphia and 11:47 in Washington, D.C.) that often led to costly accidents between trains sharing a single track or crossing at a junction. Similarly, the development of standardized equipment like couplers, signals, and brakes allowed for easier operation and maintenance of a railroad’s growing fleet of rolling stock. In 1886, the railroads also established a standard gauge for track of 4 feet 8.5 inches, thereby eliminating costly delays caused by the need to transfer cargo from one train to another wherever tracks of two different gauges met. As this drawing (16.4) indicates, many Americans viewed standard gauge as bringing both economic and political benefits to the nation, since it promised to create both a more efficient railroad system and greater unity between the less developed South (see Chapter 14) with the rapidly industrializing North. The banner “The Last Spike of Our Commercial Union” likens the event to the 1869 completion of the transcontinental railroad. To oversee these vast commercial operations— the largest in the world—executives of the major railroads, such as Jay Gould, Tom Scott, and Collis B. Huntington, developed complex hierarchies of superintendents, managers, and clerks and new systems of accounting, advertising, information management, and pricing. Other big businesses, such as steel, oil, manufacturing, and retailing, soon copied these organizational practices, making them the norm in most large corporations.



 as “the modern emblem of motion and power— the pulse of the continent.” They delighted in the benefits of inexpensive and speedy travel and increased access to finished goods in new mail order catalogs. Yet many Americans worried about the larger implications of the railroad. This cartoon depicting

 tions further tarnished the railroads’ image and fueled concerted efforts to curb their power. Although few critics raised the issue at the time, later generations decried the railroad for its role in hastening the defeat of the Plains Indians and the near extermination of buffalo, on which they depended (see Chapter 15). Growing anxiety and anger over the abusive practices of many large railroads eventually compelled reformers to seek tighter regulation of the industry. Given the immense power and wealth of the railroad and politicians’ reluctance to regulate business, reform faced many setbacks. Farmers, bitterly opposing the high rates charged by railroads to transport and store agricultural commodities, led the first significant effort to curb laissez-faire business practices. Known as the Grange (see Chapter 15), it led a successful political movement in the 1870s to pass numerous laws regulating prices and outlawing unfair business practices.

 Why did many Americans come to see railroads as potential threats to democracy?

 Of all the new things produced by the explosion of industrial output after 1865, none was more important than steel. Much stronger than iron, steel became the essential ingredient in the transformation of America into an industrial society, allowing for the construction of the railroad and telegraph networks and tall buildings called “skyscrapers.” Steel also enabled the construction of huge factories, filled with powerful machinery— made from steel, of course. Sharp, durable, and deep-cutting steel plows and mechanical reapers accelerated the commercialization of American agriculture. More accurate and powerful, and thus more deadly, weapons made of steel also altered modern warfare. Steel, in short, was as influential and revolutionary a substance in the late nineteenth century as silicon (used to make computer chips) was to become in the late twentieth. Steel was important in still another way, for it brought to prominence the single most influential big businessman of the era, Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie’s success was all the more remarkable because of his humble origins. Born in Scotland in 1836, he immigrated to America with his family at age 12. Settling in Pittsburgh they struggled to earn a living. Young Carnegie dropped out of school and worked

 What policies contributed to Andrew Carnegie’s success in business?



 CHAPTER 16

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

 The result of Carnegie’s business policies was astonishing, bringing annual profits to $40 million by 1900. By then Carnegie Steel was the largest corporation in the world, with more than 20,000 employees and operations in many countries. Carnegie’s success was part of the larger story of the “age of steel.” By 1900, the U.S. steel industry employed 272,000 workers who produced 10.4 million tons of steel—an output more than twice that of its nearest rivals, Germany and Great Britain.

Rockefeller and the
Rise of the Trust
 Carnegie was the most famous industrialist in the late nineteenth century, but countless others developed key parts of the American economy. They included entrepreneurs like Philip Armour and Gustavus Swift (meat-packing), James B. Duke (tobacco products), George Eastman (Kodak camera), and Cyrus McCormick (farm equipment). Like Carnegie these industry leaders and thousands more succeeded by combining vision and ruthlessness, leading the public to both laud them as “captains of industry” who offered an ever-growing number of new products and services and denounce them as “robber barons,” greedy capitalists who grew rich by devious business practices, exploitation of workers, and political manipulation. One industrialist frequently denounced as a robber baron was John D. Rockefeller. His rise to dominance in the oil industry resembled that of Andrew Carnegie. Through relentless cost-cutting, acquisition of new technology, hiring top-notch managers and scientists, and making secret deals with railroads to undermine his competition, Rockefeller’s Standard Oil company controlled 90 percent of the nation’s oil-refining capacity by 1879. Unlike Carnegie, Rockefeller initially expanded his interests via horizontal integration (16.6), focusing almost exclusively on buying or building oil refineries. Later he followed Carnegie’s vertical integration model, purchasing oil fields, railroad cars and warehouses, pipelines, and barrel factories. Rockefeller’s chief contribution to the rise of big business was the invention of two new forms of corporate management: the trust and the holding company. Like many industrial magnates, Rockefeller

 paid lip service to the ideal of competition, but privately he believed competition between rival companies was wasteful and led to market instability. Because so-called pools—secret deals between ostensibly rival companies to set production limits to keep prices high and award each participant a certain share of the market—inevitably failed, Rockefeller devised the trust. Unlike pools, which lacked any legal basis and thus carried no penalty for cheating, trusts were legally binding arrangements that brought many companies in the same industry under the direction of a single board of “trustees.” To join a trust, a company turned over to a board a majority of its stock in exchange for trust certificates, which guaranteed it a share of the profits. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust, for example, consisted of 40 companies under the direction of a nine-member board of trustees selected by Rockefeller himself. As profits soared, dozens of trusts in other industries, such as sugar, lead, cotton, and oil, were formed, although not all successfully.

 “Honest labor never rusts: up with labor down with trusts.” Banner in 1889 Boston Labor Day Parade The rapid emergence of giant trusts, as with the rise of large railroads, alarmed many Americans. Fueling this concern was the unwillingness of Congress and the Supreme Court to curb the power of big business. In 1886, the conservative Supreme Court declared that state railroad commissions did not have the authority to regulate railroads because only Congress had the right to regulate interstate commerce (Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Co. v. Illinois, 1886). In a separate case (Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, 1886), the Court also declared that corporations were “de facto persons” and thus subject to all the protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. No state or local government, therefore, could impose limits on corporations “without due process of law”—in other words, approval by conservative federal courts. The next year in 1887, Congress attempted to curb the power of the railroads by establishing the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and making pools and rebates (special discounts by railroads

THE EMERGENCE OF BIG BUSINESS

 to favored customers) illegal. But the ICC proved weak and ineffective, especially in the face of a conservative Supreme Court. Of the 16 cases that resulted when railroads challenged a ruling by the ICC between 1887 and 1905, the Court sided with the railroads 15 times. Big business also benefited from enormous political influence in Congress. In this damning 1889 cartoon from the popular magazine Puck, The Bosses of the Senate (16.7), the bloated trusts, are clearly in charge. Congress was all too willing to do the bidding of corporate interests. Note that the doorway marked “People’s Entrance” is boarded shut while a much larger “Entrance for Monopolists” is wide open. Note too the bitter conclusion that big business has subverted American democracy: “This is a Senate of the monopolists, by the monopolists, and for the monopolists.” The fate of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890 seemed to verify this conclusion. It was originally proposed to empower the Justice Department to prosecute any illegal contract, combination, or conspiracy among corporations that was designed to eliminate

 competition or restrain free trade. In other words the act made trusts illegal. But months of lobbying by corporate interests influenced Congress to word the final version of the act so vaguely that it was essentially unenforceable. As a result, the Justice Department prosecuted only 18 antitrust cases between 1890 and 1904. Rockefeller’s other major corporate management innovation—the holding company—replaced the trust in the 1890s as the preferred big business model. The holding company was a huge corporation that bought and ran other corporations by purchasing their stock. Rockefeller’s idea caught on immediately because it offered protection from the Sherman Act and allowed for the creation of enormous corporations, many of which exercised near monopoly control of the market. Corporate mergers occurred at an astonishing pace. By 1900, one percent of corporations controlled 33 percent of the nation’s manufacturing output, a figure that rose to 44 percent by 1910. The same was true of the railroads. In 1900, seven colossal railroads controlled twothirds of the nation’s track mileage. Big business, despite the best effort of reformers, was here to stay.

 CHAPTER 16

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

Creating a Mass Market
 Railroads, oil refineries, textile factories, and steel mills were the most vivid symbols of the industrial era, but production was only one part of the story. Equally important was consumption—getting the public to purchase the growing array of the national economy’s new products. Advertising would play a crucial role in creating a consumer culture, as would the department store and mail order catalogs.

The Art of Selling
 To promote consumption, businesses developed sophisticated advertising techniques and marketing strategies. Many hired psychologists and other experts to develop advertising campaigns that appealed to both consumers’ fears and their desires. Ads for toothpaste and deodorant, for example, stoked the public’s fears about bad breath and body odor, while those for pianos and fine clothing played to desires to appear sophisticated and wealthy. Advertisers also cultivated brand loyalty through catchy slogans and impressive claims. The makers of Ivory Soap, for example, touted their product’s healthful qualities with the impressive, but ridiculously exaggerated, claim that it was “99 44⁄100 % Pure.” Recognizing the value of celebrity, some manufacturers hired famous entertainers and athletes to endorse their products and allow the use of their pictures in ads. The underlying idea of advertising—spending a portion of a business’s profits to generate more profit—soon became a standard business principle. Spending on advertising jumped accordingly, from $50 million in 1867 to more than $500 million by 1900. As advertising caught on among manufacturers and retailers, competition led to increasingly complex and sophisticated advertisements. Gone were the days from before the Civil War when advertisers relied exclusively on a few bold headlines in a newspaper or magazine and some accompanying text touting a product’s quality and price. With so many advertisements jamming the pages of these media, and adorning roadside signs, sides of buildings, and grocery store windows, a product’s advertisement had to be eye-catching, convincing, and memorable. Advertisers experimented with new styles and sizes of type, developed catchy slogans, and enlisted celebrities and “experts” like doctors to vouch for their product. Once developments in

 Why did advertising become so important to business success?

 print technology made it possible and affordable, they focused increasingly on images to sell their products.

Shopping as an Experience:
The Department Store
 With the emergence of advertising came the department store. Irish immigrant Alexander Turney Stewart established the first department store in New York City in 1846. Stewart and the entrepreneurs who copied his idea built giant stores that offered a huge selection of goods for sale usually organized into different “departments.” Customers also found a small army of clerks ready to assist them and fixed prices that eliminated uncomfortable negotiations. Retailers also offered attractive policies such as the money back guarantee and free delivery. By the 1870s, customers, increasingly called “shoppers,” flocked to department stores not only for the selection, price, and convenience but also for the experience. Retailers had discovered that it was not enough to offer the finest products at good prices. Shopping had to be a pleasurable experience, so merchants built palatial, richly decorated “emporiums,” an impressive Latin term meaning a store

 “You can now buy your pins, your outing shirts, your wines, your prayer books, your Indian clubs, your pianolas, your false teeth, your automobiles, … [and] your spectacles … in the same place.” The Wall Street Journal, 1903

CREATING A MASS MARKET

 that displayed a large variety of merchandise. One of the first merchants to do so was John Wanamaker, who transformed a Philadelphia railroad depot in 1876 into a massive and opulently decorated store called the Grand Depot. Rival stores soon sought to outdo each other in size and splendor, and customers came to look forward to store openings. On September 12, 1896, for example, 150,000 New Yorkers paraded through the new Siegel Cooper store on opening day. This new “shopping resort,” as the New York Times called it, employed 8,000 clerks and cashiers and 1,000 drivers and packers. It offered not only a huge selection of merchandise but also conveniences such as telegraph and long-distance telephone services, foreign currency exchange and stock trading, and a dentist office. As this photograph (16.8) of the central lobby shows, the store also wowed shoppers with its lavish interior. Note the marble columns, high, decorative ceilings, and the statue in the center of “The Republic,” a copy of the one carved by the renowned American sculptor Daniel Chester French for the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago. The success of the department store led some retail entrepreneurs to expand their operations to large regions or even the whole country. The most noted



 figure in this field was Frank W. Woolworth, whose “five and dime” stores specialized in low prices rather than opulence. He opened his first store in Utica, New York, in 1879. By 1911, he owned more than 600. Like their big business counterparts in manufacturing, Woolworth and other national retailers found that with size came advantages. Because he bought huge quantities of goods, Woolworth received big discounts from wholesalers and manufacturers that allowed him to sell his merchandise at low prices.

Bringing the Market
 to the Frontier Some entrepreneurs realized that despite advertising and the growth of department stores, a massive retail market remained untapped: rural America. Living on farms or in small towns far from cities, these potential customers had money and desire to spend but lacked access to consumer goods. In 1872, Montgomery Ward set out to change that. If rural America could not get to a department store, he would bring it to them—in the form of a single broadsheet offering two dozen items for sale by “mail order.”

 Why did retailers spend so much money to build lavish stores?



 CHAPTER 16

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

 Ward steadily expanded his list of offerings. By 1884, his broadsheet was now a catalog featuring some 10,000 items. By this time a rival mail order company run by Richard W. Sears and Alvah C. Roebuck had begun operation. Eager to reach this new market, established department stores like Macy’s in New York, Jordan Marsh in Boston, and Marshall Field’s in Chicago brought out their own mail order catalogs. The reach of corporate retailing beyond urban centers and into rural America (where most Americans lived until 1920) marked the emergence of a mass market. Whereas Americans had long shared a common language and republican political culture, they now developed a shared consumer culture. Exposed to the same advertising images and appeals, millions of Americans in different parts of the country began to adopt the same fashions, develop the same habits (cigarette smoking, for example), and purchase the same newfangled contraptions, including more than one million bicycles a year in the 1890s.

Selling to the World
 As the nation’s industrial production soared to unprecedented heights, manufacturers searched for new markets for their goods. The United States had long been an exporter of agricultural products like cotton and wheat, but the leading trend after the

 Civil War was the export of manufactured goods. The total value of exports rose between 1870 and 1900 from $450 million to $1.5 billion, with the percentage of manufactured goods rising from 15 to 32 percent. In addition to selling produce and goods overseas, American business interests also began to invest heavily in business ventures in foreign countries. By 1897, Americans had invested $635 million in overseas mines, plantations, oil wells, and increasingly, manufacturing plants ($94 million). By the 1890s, the Singer Sewing Machine Co. was an international corporation ( 16.9). With factories in Scotland and the United States, Singer sold its machines throughout the world. Note how the advertisement’s text, “The Singer Seam unites Two Continents,” and angelic female figures suggest that the company is pursuing humanitarian as well as capitalist goals. Farm equipment giant, International Harvester, likewise opened factories in Canada and Sweden. The globalization of the American economy brought many benefits to workers, consumers, and investors. But it also contributed to the growing sentiment in the 1890s that the United States needed to become an imperial power to protect overseas investments and ensure that markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America remained open (see Chapter 19).

 How did advertising promote the development of a national consumer culture?

THE WORLD OF WORK TRANSFORMED



The World of Work Transformed
 The huge industrial enterprises built by Carnegie, Rockefeller, and others ultimately depended not on their individual genius but on the collective labors of American workers. As the number and size of factories grew in the late nineteenth century, so did the industrial workforce expanding from 1.3 million workers in 1860 to 5.1 million in 1900. Many of them faced hardships: long hours, low pay, dangerous conditions, and frequent downturns in the economy. Workers responded by forming unions, staging strikes, and protesting the surging power of business as a threat to democracy.

The Impact of
New Technology


Hard Times for
Industrial Workers


 New industrial technology greatly increased manufacturing output, but it also changed the status of industrial workers. New machines produced more goods in less time and required mostly low-skilled labor to operate. Machinery transformed shoemaking, for example, from a skilled trade in the 1820s to a low-skill factory occupation by the 1860s. The same was true in the garment and textile industries. Because they could easily replace low-skilled labor, employers could pay low wages and demand long hours. They could also simply fire or replace workers who complained or failed to keep up the pace with other unskilled workers. This trend occurred unevenly across industrial America. For example, in building trades like carpentry and bricklaying, new technology did little to undermine the position of skilled craftsmen. In other settings new technology created new opportunities for some workers. Some found well-paid skilled work as mechanics, while others became foremen and floor managers who oversaw the work of unskilled operatives. These more fortunate workers often enjoyed far higher wages, shorter hours, and better treatment than the unskilled. Nonetheless for many workers new industrial technology eliminated their skilled jobs in favor of unskilled ones. Just as shoemaking changed from a skilled trade in the 1820s to a low-skill factory occupation by the 1860s, so did the garment and textile industries. In these settings, employers enjoyed increasing power over their employees for the simple reason that unskilled workers were easily replaced.

 New technology was but one of many difficulties confronting industrial workers in the age of industrialization. Most workers complained about long hours and low wages. Although averages for both varied by industry and region, workers often toiled 12 hours a day, six days a week, for wages that barely covered basic living expenses. By some estimates wage earners in the late nineteenth century made $400–500 per year, when living decently required a minimum of $600–800. Working-class families made up the difference by sending their children to work, taking in boarders, and bringing in “home finishing” work, performed by women and children, such as sewing buttons on new shirts. Compounding the precarious economic position of wage earners was the instability of the industrial economy. Severe depressions (1873–1877 and 1893–1897) and recessions interrupted periods of prosperity and economic growth and brought widespread business failure and high unemployment lasting years. The severe depression of the 1870s, for example, resulted in the loss of more than a million jobs and nearly 50,000 businesses. Those who did keep their jobs often found their wages slashed and hours increased by employers desperate to remain solvent or ruthless enough to take advantage of rising job competition between the employed and the unemployed. The monotony of industrial work also added to the difficulties wage earners faced. Many jobs required a laborer to perform the same task repeatedly, such as pulling a lever on a metal stamping machine. Workers felt, in the words of one machinist in 1883, that they were becoming “part of

 of Child Labor Because they could pay children less than one-half the wages of an adult, employers hired more children in the late nineteenth century, depriving them of education and often exposing them to industrial hazards.
