 only one direction. Counterclaims that the assassination was the result of a wider conspiracy involving other gunmen, the mafia, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, and the CIA continue to this day. Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) was riding two cars behind Kennedy in the Dallas motorcade. When Kennedy died within hours of the shooting, Johnson, who was next in line to assume the presidency, insisted on taking the oath of office before Judge Sarah Hughes with Jackie Kennedy on one side and his wife on the other before the presidential airplane Air Force One left Dallas. The presence of the slain president’s widow would, Johnson felt, immediately legitimatize the transfer of power in the eyes of the American people. Already on board the plane, which was carrying her husband’s body back to Washington, D.C., Jackie Kennedy complied with Johnson’s request, but had no chance to change her clothes. In this portrait (26.4) of Johnson’s swearing in, photographer Cecil Stoughton carefully framed out Jackie Kennedy’s skirt, which was stained with her husband’s blood. Her pale and drawn expression nonetheless reflected the day’s ordeal.

 up poor and worked as a teacher before entering national politics as an avid supporter of the New Deal in 1937. Johnson relied heavily on his superior political instincts and outgoing personality to rise to prominence. In the Senate, he became the most powerful majority leader in history. A larger-thanlife figure, his brashness contrasted sharply with the slain president’s debonair manner. Johnson’s most legendary gaff came in 1965, when he lifted his shirt during a press conference to show reporters his 12-inch scar from recent gallbladder surgery. Johnson wanted to reassure the nation about his recovery, but critics lampooned the act as crude and undignified.

The Gulf of Tonkin
 Lyndon Baines Johnson inherited a rapidly deteriorating situation in Vietnam after the Diem assassination. Like his predecessors he faced the choice of pulling back or escalating the American commitment, which at this point consisted of sixteen thousand military advisors and Green Berets and substantial financial aid to South Vietnam. After the Diem assassination, South Vietnam slipped into perpetual political instability as a succession of rulers failed to gain the support of the people. The shifting geopolitical situation also prompted a reappraisal of the American assumption that the Soviet Union was controlling the movements of communists throughout the world. The previous American conception of a global communist conspiracy became harder to maintain in the face of the open split between the Soviet Union and China in 1964. The Sino-Soviet alliance fell apart, when the Soviets suggested that the two countries scale back their support of worldwide Communist insurgencies to improve relations with the United States. Mao refused. Once again elected officials and policymakers differed behind closed doors on the best course of action. National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy told Johnson that “the right course is to continue to strengthen our struggle against the Communist terror (which is exactly what this is).” Senator Richard Russell, a close confidant of the president, disagreed with those who claimed that “we’ll lose everything in Southeast Asia if we lose Vietnam.” Johnson himself feared that

Choices and Consequences
MAKING VIETNAM AMERICA’S WAR
In early 1965, Johnson initiated a regular bombing campaign against North Vietnam and sent 82,000 ground troops to South Vietnam. The theater commander General William Westmoreland soon requested 150,000 more. In deciding how to respond to Westmoreland’s request, the president’s advisors gave Johnson the following choices in the summer of 1965. 
Choices




 Avoid a protracted war with little chance for a military or political victory over the Communists and seek a negotiated settlement in Vietnam.



 Continue at the present level of military aid to South Vietnam and push for political reforms there to create a more democratic antiCommunist government.



 Send the requested troops, expand the bombing campaign, and work for political reforms in South Vietnam.

Decision
 Johnson considered a negotiated settlement as tantamount to losing Vietnam to communism, an outcome he viewed as a threat to both Southeast Asia and his presidency. Certain that South Vietnam would lose the war without additional U.S. aid, he publicly agreed to send fifty thousand troops immediately. He privately guaranteed Westmoreland an additional fifty

 thousand and promised to send more as needed. He also approved heavy bombing of Vietcong strongholds in South Vietnam and tried to institute political reforms in South Vietnam to erode support for the Vietcong.

Consequences
 The United States was no longer simply aiding South Vietnam in its struggle against communism, but now took the lead in fighting the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese. By 1967, there were nearly 500,000 American troops in Vietnam. During the war the United States dropped more bombs there than it had in World War II. Johnson’s Dilemma. He is shown here with Defense Secretary, Robert McNamara.

Continuing Controversies
 Should the United States have fought a major war in Vietnam? Detractors claim that Johnson committed the United States to an unwinnable war by trying to use the military to solve a political problem in South Vietnam. He underestimated the will of the Vietcong and exaggerated the importance of South Vietnam to containing communism in the rest of Southeast Asia. He failed to build strong domestic support for a long war, leading to unrest at home over the draft

 and rising casualties. Johnson’s supporters argue that he honored a commitment to South Vietnam made by his predecessors. This reassured American allies worldwide that they could count on the United States. Retreat would only have invited further Communist aggression in Southeast Asia and Europe. Losing Vietnam would have weakened Johnson politically, putting his controversial domestic reform and civil rights legislative agenda in jeopardy.

FIGHTING IN VIETNAM



Fighting in Vietnam
 David Halberstam, reporting for The New York Times in 1962, summed up the military dilemma in Vietnam perfectly: “It is often impossible to separate the cruel and dedicated foe you want to kill from the simple and illiterate peasant you want to woo.” America and North Vietnam embraced competing strategic visions in fighting the war. While the American military preferred fighting against uniformed soldiers on a clearly defined battlefield, the Communists embraced guerilla warfare, where troops blended into the civilian population or stayed hidden in underground tunnels. The American military tried to defeat Vietnamese guerillas by bombing enemy bases and destroying their village refuges. These tactics created another set of competing visions about the war: the soldiers’ view of an unending conflict versus the image of imminent victory that the government championed at home.

The Bombing Campaign
 The American military relied heavily on bombing to defeat the Vietcong and North Vietnamese. The American bombing campaign was the largest air war in world history, with American planes dropping nearly five million tons of bombs in eight years. The Americans hoped to pressure North Vietnam into ending the war. The North Vietnamese instead learned to live with bombs. The sighting of American planes over the North Vietnamese capital city of Hanoi sent inhabitants scurrying into bombproof underground shelters. The government built thirty thousand miles of tunnels, which moved the nation’s transportation and communication infrastructure underground. The sustained bombing campaign bred anti-American feelings among the civilian population that made it easier for the North Vietnamese government to mobilize the country to “foil the war of aggression of the U.S. imperialists.” Navy Captain James Stockdale led the first American air strike against North Vietnamese oil tanks in the wake of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. A year later during another air raid, he was shot down over a small coastal village in North Vietnam where angry villagers beat him and broke his knee. Stockdale spent the next seven and a half years in a prisoner of war (POW) camp. His jailers brutally tortured him when he taught fellow POWs a walltapping code so they could communicate with one another during their years in solitary confinement. American planes also targeted the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a 600-mile North Vietnamese supply route that ran along the western border of Vietnam through the mountainous rain forest of neighboring Laos and Cambodia. Nearly five thousand Communist soldiers and workers completed the

 arduous three-month journey each month, bringing troops, munitions, and food to the Vietcong. North Vietnamese propaganda glorified the difficult journey with images that emphasized the toughness and determination of its people. This photo (26.6) shows a North Vietnamese camera crew filming teenage volunteers from the north as they push bicycles, which the North Vietnamese called “steel horses,” through the woods to carry rice and guns to Communist troops in the south. Improvements turned the dirt paths into an open road by the 1970s. Surface-to-air missiles and antiaircraft guns helped protect trucks from bombing.

 26.6 Hardships along the Ho Chi Minh Trail North Vietnamese propaganda relentlessly publicized the arduous journey along the Ho Chi Minh Trail to highlight how Communist ingenuity had stymied the world’s greatest military power. Here, a Communist movie crew films teenage volunteers transporting bags of rice and guns strapped to their bicycle handlebars in 1970.

 What messages did North Vietnamese propaganda send?

 Americans also extensively bombed South Vietnamese “free fire zones,” villages that supposedly contained only enemy combatants. The American air campaign included spraying defoliants, usually Agent Orange, that stripped trees of their leaves to expose Vietcong hideouts and killed the crops that might feed enemy troops. “Only you can prevent forests,” American pilots quipped, a satirical

 reworking of a popular environmental slogan “only you can prevent forest fires.” Defoliants ultimately destroyed half of Vietnam’s forests and caused lasting health problems for both American pilots and the Vietnamese that included cancers and birth defects. Responding to negative publicity, the military stopped using defoliants in 1971. American pilots also dropped napalm, a jellylike gasoline that ignited on impact, to destroy South Vietnamese villages hiding enemy troops. Napalm severely burns the body, contributing to the misery of civilians subject to bombing attacks. Reports of mounting civilian suffering energized the U.S. peace movement, a loose coalition of antiwar activists that included pacifists, students, professors, clergy, hippies (young people who rejected middle-class values and adopted a bohemian lifestyle), civil rights activists, and middleclass liberals. In making his decision to go to war, Johnson had focused on placating his hawkish critics without considering the political fallout of antagonizing the left. By 1967, however, belatedly realizing the price he was paying for waging the war, the president noted, “The major threat we have [politically] is from the doves.”

 War II, Phil Caputo viewed joining the Marines as a way to escape suburbia and serve his country. “I saw myself charging up some distant beachhead, like John Wayne in Sands of Iwo Jima,” noted Caputo, recalling a popular 1949 film that romanticized the battle responsible for the iconic World War II photo of six men raising the flag over Mount Suribachi (see Images as History, Chapter 23). Combat, however, quickly shattered the idealism of men like Caputo. In 1965, Life photojournalist Larry Burrows spent a month with helicopter crews, documenting their heroism and the harrowing combat. In this photo (26.7) gunner James Farley fires on enemy troops below as the pilot lands to rescue a downed American helicopter crew. Subsequent photos captured the anguish on Farley’s face when he realized that the rescued pilot had died. The drafted men sent to Vietnam in later years had fewer illusions than the initial volunteers. Conscripts were often working-class men who did not qualify for draft deferments, which only collegebound and married men enjoyed. Volunteers and conscripts served one-year tours in Vietnam, and as the time to return home neared, they often became more averse to taking risks in combat. Some soldiers even used their helmets as calendars, openly marking off the days left until their tour of duty ended. In World War II American soldiers had fought against a clearly distinguishable enemy in the Pacific island jungles. Vietcong forces, however, infiltrated

 unintentionally created incentives for soldiers to lie. “You guys want a day off, we got to be getting more kills,” one commander told his men. In compiling their body counts, troops made little effort to separate friend from foe. The credo, “If it’s dead and it’s Vietnamese, it’s Vietcong,” lumped enemy soldiers with innocent civilians. Eventually the inaccuracy of body counts became common knowledge. Gary Trudeau mocked the preoccupation with body counts in this Doonesbury comic strip (26.9). His rendition of an American captain using the day’s

 had killed more enemy soldiers than the Communists could replace in the field. To boost morale at home, Westmoreland publicly assured the nation that “we have reached an important point where the end begins to come into view.” Johnson was also upbeat. “The enemy is not beaten,” he told the nation before Christmas, “but he knows that he has met his master in the field.” A Vietnamese offensive in 1968 exposed the hollowness of these claims. On January 30, 1968, during the Vietnamese New Year holiday known as Tet,

 date as his official body count echoed an uncomfortable truth about the value of these officially circulated figures.

 North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces launched the Tet Offensive, a massive, coordinated assault against more than 100 cities and towns in South Vietnam. The map of Vietnam (26.10) depicts the wideranging attacks. “Uncle Ho was already quite old,” and the entire army and population were exerted to do “their best to liberate the South before his passing” a North Vietnamese officer recalled. By demonstrating their determination to fight forever, the North Vietnamese wanted to convince Johnson that the cost of an American victory was too high. The Communists also expected their attack on previously calm cities to spark a revolution within South Vietnam. Before the Tet Offensive the Communists had lured nearly fifty thousand American troops away from the cities by laying siege to a remote Marine garrison in Khe Sanh and attacking a few isolated towns. The weakened American presence left the urban centers vulnerable to enemy attack. A shocked American public watched on television as 19 Vietcong commandos entered the courtyard of the American Embassy complex in Saigon and battled guards there for six hours. It took heavy fighting and more than a month before American troops regained control of South

The Tet Offensive
 In 1967, Americans’ support for the war began to flounder. Nearly nineteen thousand American soldiers had died so far, and each month draft boards inducted another thirty thousand into the military. Johnson’s call for new taxes to meet rising war expenses further dismayed Americans. Some leading policymakers also changed their minds. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara underwent the greatest shift in views. He went from strenuously advocating war (some critics called it “McNamara’s war”) to conceding that “Ho Chi Minh is a tough old S.O.B. And he won’t quit no matter how much bombing we do.” Rather than making his breach with the president over Vietnam public, however, McNamara quietly left the administration. In the same year General Westmoreland assured Johnson that the war of attrition had reached a crossover point, meaning that American soldiers

Images as History
THE POWER OF THE PRESS IN VIETNAM
Photographers typically convey a point of view through their photos. However, the differing interpretations surrounding some of the most famous photographs from the Vietnam War suggest that each photo took on a life of its own as Americans disregarded the photographer’s original reason for taking the photo and imposed a different meaning on the image that reflected their own political views. Rather than creating new ideas or values, these images became iconic visual statements 
 about the war because they reinforced strongly held beliefs within the population. In examining the text and photos in this box, consider what kind of power the press had to mold public opinion about the war. In the midst of the 1968 Tet Offensive, Associated Press photographer Eddie Adams saw South Vietnamese police apprehend a Vietcong suspect in the streets of Saigon. Adams snapped his prize-winning photo just as South Vietnamese General Nguyen Ngoc Loan aimed his pistol at the man’s head and pulled the trigger.

 Instead of justifiable retribution many Americans saw an execution. Prisoners of war have the right to a trial under international law, critics argued.

 “He killed many of my men and many of your people,” Loan told Adams. The New York Times caption echoed Loan’s justification for his act. “GUERILLA DIES: Brig. Gen. Nguyen Ngoc Loan, national police chief, executes man identified as a Vietcong terrorist in Saigon. Man wore civilian dress and had a pistol.”

 This striking image of one man’s death became a symbol of the failed U.S. effort to establish the rule of law in South Vietnam, prompting fears that American soldiers were also killing prisoners of war.

 Adams regretted taking a photo that forever tarnished Loan’s reputation, whom he felt had simply acted impetuously in the heat of combat. “Pictures do not always tell the full story, and this is one case where that is true,” Adams contended.

 In 1966, Life photographer Larry Burrows went into the field with a group of marines trying to stop North Vietnamese infiltration through the demilitarized zone along the seventeenth parallel, a supposedly combat-free strip of land that separated North and South Vietnam.



 He snapped this image of a wounded black soldier reaching out to a white buddy sprawled on the ground. Life published the photo twice, once right after Burrows took it and again in 1971 to eulogize Burrows after he died a helicopter crash in Laos.

 In their letters to Life, many readers said that Burrows’s portrait illustrated how the shared burden of combat inspired men to transcend the “great racial problems” of American society. Burrows’s photo gave some viewers hope that whether “purple, polka-dotted or streaked,” Americans could also learn to live together as brothers at home.

 In his captioning Burrows emphasized soldiers’ suffering in the midst of combat, simply noting, “At a first-aid center, during Operation Prairie, a wounded GI reaches out towards a stricken comrade.”

 The interracial compassion captured by Burrows’s photo told only one side of the story. Racial conflict permeated the armed forces in the rear and on ships, suggesting that fighting together did not magically heal the racial divide.

 The wounded soldier lies in a crucifix position, establishing a symbolic link between Christ who suffered on the cross to redeem humankind and a soldier sacrificing his life to save his nation.

 How does this image compare to combat photographs from World War II and the Korean War (see Chapters 23 and 24)?



 CHAPTER 26

A NATION DIVIDED: THE VIETNAM WAR, 1945–1975

Controversy on the Home Front
 Advocates for peace have opposed every American war, but their dissent rarely influenced the mainstream political debate. During the Vietnam War these rebellious voices offering an alternative vision of peace moved from the fringes to the center of American political life. Growing in strength as more Americans began to oppose the war, the peace movement made itself visible through mass demonstrations, propaganda posters, and press coverage of celebrities who joined it. The very existence of a vocal peace movement in the midst of a war, however, also invited controversy because Americans held differing views on the legitimacy of wartime dissent. Many peace activists believed they were preserving the American tradition of freedom of speech. Public opinion polls from 1965 to 1973, however, consistently showed that most Americans disliked both the war and the peace movement.

The Antiwar Movement
 In announcing his decision not to run for reelection in 1968, Johnson noted that “there is division in the American house right now.” In the 1960s the rise of a youth-based counterculture and a powerful civil rights movement roiled the country (see Chapter 27). The night of his announcement, however, Johnson was referring to the domestic debate over the war in Vietnam. Although many working- and middle-class people opposed the war, overcoming existing cultural and class divisions in American society to create a unified antiwar movement proved difficult. The organized antiwar movement tended to attract mostly white, middle-class, college-educated Americans or individuals already engaged in crusades of social justice. Many working-class women and African Americans with grade-school educations and lowpaying jobs, opposed the war, but had little interest in marching alongside middle-class college students in street demonstrations.

 “Hey, hey LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?” A popular chant during antiwar demonstrations Uniting around one universal vision also posed difficulties for the antiwar movement. All peace activists wanted to end the war in Vietnam, but they offered different arguments for doing so. Some made a primarily moral argument. They claimed that a war involving napalm, search-and-destroy What differing visions did peace activists offer on the war?

 missions, and forced relocation into strategic hamlets hurt the Vietnamese more than living under Communist rule did. Others focused on the futility of fighting an unwinnable civil war. Another group accepted that the nation needed to stop Communist China from expanding its influence. They argued that working with Ho Chi Minh could accomplish this goal more effectively than fighting a war in Vietnam. These critics noted that while Ho accepted Chinese aid to fight the United States, he was leery of Chinese ambitions to control Vietnam. America had worked successfully in Europe with the independently minded communist leader Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia to contain Soviet ambitions in the Balkans. Why could it not do the same in Vietnam? Other activists saw a chance to open the nation’s eyes to injustice at home, as well as overseas. Student leaders from the nation’s top universities founded the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) at Port Huron, Michigan, in 1962. A leader in the New Left movement, SDS combined staunch opposition to the war with a scathing critique of the inequities of capitalism (see Chapter 27). Although their reasons for opposing the war differed, peace advocates agreed that the war was destroying American democracy. They noted violations of American democratic values: going to war without a formal declaration of war from Congress, presidential secrets and lies, FBI surveillance of peace protesters, and unjust draft deferments for middle- and upper-class men who could afford to go to college. When civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. spoke out against the war in 1967, he denounced both the destruction of Vietnamese culture and the war’s negative impact on African Americans. The war’s high cost diverted funds from antipoverty programs at home, King rightly View the Image “Vietnam—I want out”

 contended. The disproportionately high numbers of African American men fighting and dying in Vietnam further illustrated ongoing racial injustice within the United States, he continued. (King’s criticism was valid in 1967, but over the entire war, black soldiers did not incur higher casualty rates than the rest of the population.) One antiwar poster (26.11) captured this link between racial inequality and the war by picturing two African American soldiers as they advanced into the jungle under the headline, “The only time we’re in the front is when it’s time to die.” The rebuke against King for these statements was swift and severe, including criticism from civil rights activists who worried that his antiwar views would discredit their cause. King died a year later from an assassin’s bullet, cutting short his career as a civil rights leader and antiwar activist. The peace movement brought the debate over the war out of the halls of government and into the streets. In 1965, University of Michigan faculty and students organized the first teach-in, a series of public lectures and debates protesting the war. Over the next eight years, scholars and students on hundreds of other college campuses held teach-ins. Some teach-ins invited counterprotests. At the conclusion of a teach-in at the University of Wisconsin, for example, six thousand students signed a petition supporting President Johnson. Like other Americans, college students held differing views about the war. The draft made the war more than an abstract humanitarian or foreign policy question for millions of American men. Male college students would lose their draft deferments once they graduated, giving many personal, as well as political and moral, reasons to oppose the war. Peace activists organized ceremonies where men burned the notices from their draft boards ordering them to report for induction. When 1,500 peace activists gathered in New York City in 1965 to watch five men burn their draft cards, an onlooker bolted from the crowd with a fire extinguisher and doused the protesters before the cards caught fire. The activists nonetheless managed to ignite their soggy draft cards while hundreds of New Yorkers stood on the other side of police barricades and chanted “Burn yourselves, not your cards!” a macabre reminder, perhaps unintentional, of the Buddhist suicides in Vietnam in 1963. Johnson tried to discredit the peace movement by claiming it was communist-run and gave solace to the enemy. Other defenders of the war charged the peace movement with treason. However, some war supporters believed that the general unpopularity of the peace movement helped bolster the resolve

 of Americans in the political center to stay the course. The presumption that Senator Robert Kennedy, brother of the slain president, would seek the Democratic nomination as a peace candidate had encouraged Johnson to abandon a quest for a second term. On June 4, 1968, Sirhan Sirhan, a Jordanian immigrant upset with Kennedy’s pro-Israel stance, shot and killed the senator as he walked through the kitchen of a California hotel moments after finishing his victory speech for winning the state primary. At the Chicago nominating convention, the Democratic Party selected Vice President Hubert Humphrey as its presidential candidate, a man much like Johnson who supported liberal causes at home and the war in Vietnam. Instead of uniting liberal and conservative Democrats, Humphrey’s candidacy fractured the party. Outside the convention hall radical antiwar protesters denounced his nomination and clashed violently with police. “The war is destroying our

 country as we are destroying Vietnam,” the writer I. F. Stone lamented. The outcome of the 1968 presidential election suggested that the peace movement had helped the conservative cause. Believing that the protesters, rather than the police, had gone too far in Chicago, many working- and middle-class Americans responded positively to Republican candidate Richard Nixon’s call for a return to “law and order.” During the campaign Nixon suggested that he had a “secret plan” to bring about a “peace with honor” that he could not reveal to the enemy. The election became a three-man race when Alabama Governor George Wallace ran as an independent candidate, attracting conservative Southern whites and white Northern blue-collar workers with his attacks on

 integration, elites in Washington, D.C., and antiwar protesters. “If any demonstrator ever lays down in front of my car,” Wallace proclaimed, “it’ll be the last car he’ll ever lay down in front of.” As Election Day neared Humphrey picked up liberal support by pledging to end bombing over North Vietnam immediately. Despite losing conservatives’ votes to Wallace, Nixon won the Electoral College vote handily but only received 44 percent of the popular vote (26.12). Opposition to the war never resulted in widespread support for the peace movement. Most Americans remained staunchly anti-communist, even as their dissatisfaction with the war in Vietnam grew. Gallup Polls in 1969 revealed that by a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent, Americans labeled themselves as doves not hawks and most described the war as indefen4 sible. Three-fifths, however, also believed that the peace movement 8 4 helped the enemy and made it more difficult for the president to end the 10 3 war. Americans, it seemed, wanted an end to the fighting overseas and at home.

 Why did the peace movement have trouble winning support from mainstream America?

 Johnson had calmed the American public in March 1968 by announcing he would open negotiations with the North Vietnamese. Keeping his promise, he began fruitless negotiations with Hanoi. Johnson continued trying, however, to win the war before he left office. Believing that a final push against a weakened enemy could finish the job, American soldiers renewed their attacks on the Vietcong. The largest search-and-destroy missions of the war occurred in March

 and April, involving more than 100,000 troops. During one of these in the village of My Lai, American soldiers massacred hundreds of civilians, an atrocity that fueled the strident domestic debate over the American mission in Vietnam. On March 16, 1968, 75 American soldiers in two platoons under the command of Lieutenant William Calley entered My Lai. Before the mission, these troops had spent long days wading through the rice paddies and even longer nights battling snipers and insects, looking for Vietcong who had killed a popular sergeant the week before. By the time the men approached My Lai, they were in an ugly mood. By attacking during the morning hours, the company’s officers anticipated that their troops would confront 250 enemy troops and few civilians, whom the Americans expected would follow the usual daily ritual of leaving the village to visit a local market. None of these predictions came to pass. In the village the men found only unarmed women, children, and the elderly. The Vietcong had retreated into the western mountains before the Americans arrived. Rather than leaving, however, the Americans engaged in an orgy of rape, torture, and slaughter that took four hours to complete and left more than 500 villagers dead. Army photographer Ron Haeberle snapped this image (26.13) of terrified women and children huddled together moments before American soldiers killed them. “Guys were about to shoot these people, I yelled, ‘Hold it’ and I shot my pictures. As I walked away, I heard M-16s open up, and from the corner of my eye I saw bodies falling but I did not turn to look,” Haeberle recalled. Seeing the carnage from the air, pilot Hugh Thompson landed his helicopter between the soldiers and 11 survivors, whom he flew to safety. Thompson reported the atrocity to his superiors to no avail. Only the perseverance of Ron Ridenhour, a sergeant who was not even at My Lai, finally brought the massacre to light. After hearing stories from men who took part, an outraged Ridenhour wrote to President Nixon, the Pentagon, and members of Congress. When the story broke in 1969, Haeberle sold his photos to Life. A military investigation headed by Lieutenant General William Peers resulted in Calley’s court martial for premeditated murder. Calley’s conviction in 1971 exposed Americans’ conflicting views over the meaning of My Lai. Was the atrocity a unique episode or representative of American conduct in Vietnam? Competing Visions: Who Was Responsible for the My Lai Massacre? (page 800) explores this question in more detail.

 Responding to the public outcry over Calley’s conviction, Secretary of the Army Howard “Bo” Callaway reduced Calley’s life sentence to ten years, and President Nixon pardoned Calley after he had served only five months in prison. By this time Calley had been transformed from villain to hero in the American imagination. People on both the left and the right of the political spectrum defended Calley. The left saw him as a scapegoat for failed American policies, while the right argued that civilians were fair targets in a guerilla war.

WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MY LAI MASSACRE?
Americans disagreed over who bore responsibility for the massacre at My Lai. Some commentators focused on those directly involved in the killings, others on the orders given by higher-ranking officials to destroy the village. As you read the following excerpts, try to reconstruct the domestic dispute over My Lai. Is one argument stronger than the other? Who was to blame: Calley, the two platoons, the commanding officers, or the American people? Fellow soldier Dennis Conti told Army investigators that he saw Calley and Private Paul Meadlo kill civilians in My Lai. 
 The National Review rejected suggestions that the nation bore the blame and should abandon the war in Vietnam.

 They were bringing people out [of their huts], and then we pushed them out into the rice paddy, onto the dike there … Lieutenant Calley came back, and said: “Take care of them.” So we said: “Okay.” And we sat there and watched them like we usually do. And he came back again, and he said: “I thought I told you to take care of them.” I said: “We’re taking care of them,” and he said: “I mean kill them.” So I looked at Meadlo and he looked at me, and I didn’t want to do it, and he didn’t want to do it … then [Calley] said: “Come on, we’ll line them up here, we’ll kill them.” So I told him: “I’ll watch the tree line” … Then they opened up, and started firing. Meadlo fired a while. I don’t know how much he fired, a clip, I think. It might have been more. He started to cry, and he gave me his weapon.

 “That America and Americans must stand in the larger dock of guilt and human conscience for what happened at My Lai seems inescapable.” So observed Time [magazine], adding: “Men in American uniforms slaughtered the civilians of My Lai, and in so doing humiliated the U.S. and called in question the U.S. mission in Vietnam in a way that all the antiwar protesters could never have done.” One’s mind staggers: Are “America and Americans” generally guilty, the same America and Americans now preparing to bring the accused to trial? And even if it turns out that atrocities were committed, how does this call in question the U.S. mission in Vietnam? Do the innumerable atrocities committed by both sides in World War II add up to the proposition that resistance to the Nazis ought to have been abandoned? … Irrational and irresponsible comment on [My Lai] has become collective madness.

 This New York Times editorial suggested that higherranking officials than Calley bore some responsibility for ordering and observing the My Lai massacre. Who gave the orders? Who knew what was going on? Was any attempt made to stop it? Who is responsible? … [Paul Meadlo] was one of 18 witnesses to describe a briefing the night before the assault at which Captain [Ernest L.] Medina told the men they were going into battle with a hardened Vietcong battalion; that their mission was “search and destroy” and they were to destroy everything in the hamlet—houses, crops and people … Helicopter pilots, radio men and artillery observers said the higher officers had flown over the scene for several hours and had seen bodies on the ground, had conference with the other officers and, as one pilot said, “knew what was going on” all through the day … the Geneva conventions, the Nuremburg doctrines and the Army’s own rules of land warfare make plain that obedience to orders is not a blanket defense, that orders that to a “prudent” or “reasonable” man seem patently illegal need not be obeyed. The question here, then, is whether the order, if that is what it was, to kill everything was one that a prudent man should obey when he found that everything included women, children, and infants.

THE LONG ROAD TO PEACE



The Long Road to Peace
 When Richard Nixon entered the White House in 1969, he told his advisors, “I’m going to stop that war. Fast.” Nixon was also intent, however, on preserving America’s international reputation. He had a different vision from his predecessor, he assured the public, pledging to seek “peace with honor.” Nixon’s promises proved empty, however. The war did not end quickly, but continued for four more years. At home Nixon benefited politically by portraying the peace movement as out of step with the values of law-abiding citizens. When he extended the war into Laos and Cambodia and became embroiled in political scandal, his actions fueled the political debate over whether Americans could trust their government.

 Seeking Peace with Honor For Nixon a peace with honor meant winning the war. He and his national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, pursued four different tactics to achieve this goal. First Nixon implemented Vietnamization, which turned the bulk of the ground fighting over to the South Vietnamese Army. By 1971, the American presence in Vietnam had diminished dramatically. In many respects this was a return to the pre-1965 approach, when America propped up an independent South Vietnam with financial and military aid. Announcing Vietnamization in November 1969, Nixon asked for support from “the great silent majority of Americans,” referring to the many Americans who supported the war quietly in the privacy of their homes. He also rebuked the peace movement. “Let us be united for peace. Let us also be united against defeat. Because let us understand: North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States. Only Americans can do that.” Polls indicated that the “silent majority” overwhelmingly supported his plan. Vietnamization promised to give America exactly what it wanted: victory with minimal loss of American lives. The United States quickly transformed the South Vietnamese Army into one of the largest and best-equipped military forces in the world. At the ongoing peace talks, a North Vietnamese negotiator wondered aloud how the United States, when it could not win with its own troops, thought it could “succeed when you let your puppet troops do the fighting.” That dilemma, Kissinger admitted, “also torments me.” In implementing Vietnamization Nixon hoped to disarm the peace movement by replacing images of civilian suffering on the evening news with pictures of troops withdrawing and returning home.

 In March 1970, he announced the incremental withdrawal of another 150,000 soldiers to “drop a bombshell on the gathering spring storm of antiwar protest.” He simultaneously reformed the draft, replacing the controversial deferment system with a lottery that randomly drafted men by date of birth. Nixon hoped these changes would buy his administration enough time to win the war. The controversial actions of peace activists inadvertently helped Nixon solidify the support of Middle America. In 1972, the actress Jane Fonda accepted an invitation from the North Vietnamese government to visit Hanoi. While in the enemy capital, she made radio broadcasts urging American pilots to mutiny. A photo of Fonda joking with North Vietnamese soldiers as she sat on an antiaircraft gun used to shoot down American planes created a backlash against the peace movement that Nixon exploited. Vietnamization was more than a reaction to declining popular support for fighting in Vietnam. It was also part of Nixon’s attempt to reshape the role that the United States played in global geopolitics. Nixon and Kissinger viewed the longstanding vision of a bipolar world that pitted the United States against the Soviet Union as obsolete. They embraced a competing strategic vision of multipolarity that focused on negotiating with Europe, China, Japan, and the Soviet Union to construct a new balance of power system to keep the peace. In this foreign policy reformulation, the United States would refrain from direct involvement in regional conflicts, such as Vietnam. The Nixon Doctrine, formulated in 1969 and 1970, announced that the United States expected its friends to take the lead in defending themselves. Nixon’s second tactic linked Vietnamization to the resumption of massive bombing in North

 Vietnam, which Johnson had halted when he initiated peace talks in 1968. As American troops left Vietnam between 1969 and 1972, the number of bombs dropped increased spectacularly (see this shift in Envisioning Evidence: Vietnam: The War by the Numbers). America had not used enough military force to achieve victory, the president and Kissinger concluded. They intended to correct this problem. For a while the news of troop withdrawals diverted attention from the intensified bombing of North Vietnam. Alongside Vietnamization and renewed bombing of North Vietnam, Nixon and Kissinger’s third tactic used diplomacy to decrease Soviet and Chinese support for North Vietnam. Exploiting the discord between China and the Soviet Union, Nixon pursued independent negotiations with each nation to strengthen their ties to the United States and deepen their distrust of each other. He reshaped the Cold War by pursuing his vision of multi-polarity through détente, using diplomatic, economic, and cultural contacts to improve U.S. relations with China and the Soviet Union. Fearing that the United States might form an alliance with the other, the Soviet Union and China each eagerly accepted these overtures. In return for a more congenial relationship with the United States, Nixon expected China and the Soviet Union to end their support of North Vietnam. Although both countries continued to send aid to North Vietnam, once they decided to normalize trade relations and enter into arms limitations agreements with the United States, the Soviet Union and China began pressuring Hanoi to seek a negotiated peace.

Cambodia: Invasion
 and Outrage The fourth tactical component of Nixon’s Vietnam policy involved the neutral country of Cambodia, which bordered Vietnam to the west. In 1969, Nixon initiated a secret bombing campaign of Cambodia. He hoped to cut off supplies filtering through the Ho Chi Minh Trail and thus pressure North Vietnam into accepting the American terms for peace that included an independent South Vietnam. In April 1970, Nixon shattered the public consensus he had carefully created for Vietnamization by ordering an American ground force invasion of Cambodia. Before the invasion Nixon sought inspiration from repeated showings of the movie

 How did Nixon try to win the war?

 Patton in the White House, a film that portrayed the hard-nosed and belligerent World War II tank commander General George S. Patton leading American forces to victory. Nixon announced in a televised speech that American troops needed to destroy Communist bases in Cambodia to help the South Vietnamese army defeat the Vietcong. But the two-month-long incursion only pushed the North Vietnamese further into the interior of Cambodia, where they began supporting the Khmer Rouge, Communist rebels who seized power in Cambodia in 1975 and unleashed a wave of mass murder so brutal that the country became known as “the killing fields.” Nixon’s claim that he was expanding the war to end it sooner persuaded few. Protest erupted on college campuses nationwide and in Congress where the Senate symbolically terminated the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. Many university demonstrations turned violent as protesters clashed with police and set fire to college buildings. A defiant Nixon stood his ground, assuming that the “silent majority” agreed with his assessment that the protesters were just “bums blowing up the campuses.” In Kent, Ohio, student-organized demonstrations protesting the invasion of Cambodia took a nasty turn, recalled Phil Caputo, who had left the Marines after two tours in Vietnam and was now a reporter for the Chicago Tribune. In a May weekend rampage, “store windows had been smashed in town, [and] radicals had burned down the ROTC building,” according to Caputo. Calling the protesters “the worst sort of people we harbor in America,” Governor James Allen Rhodes promised to “use every weapon possible to eradicate the problem,” as he sent National Guardsmen to restore order. On Monday morning a few hundred students gathered on the campus of Kent State University for a rally, defying a ban on protests. National Guardsmen fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, who responded by throwing rocks and shouting obscenities at the troops. Suddenly, as bystanders and students on their way to class watched the mini-battle unfurl, the troops sprayed bullets into the crowd, killing four and wounding nine. The National Guardsmen claimed that they had fired in self-defense when protesters began throwing concrete slabs. Two of the victims were passers-by, however, and all four were too far away from the troops to have hit them with anything more than pebbles.

Americans’ opinions about the Vietnam War varied over the course of the war, eventually influencing the strategy pursued there. Even as the war became more unpopular, however, at least 40 percent of the nation continued to believe that the nation had done the right thing by sending troops to fight in Vietnam. The United States also tried to use its air superiority to win the war, dropping more bombs in the Vietnam War than in World War II. 
 In 1968 the U.S. troop commitment reached its highest level and bombing of North Vietnam remained intense, but after the Tet Offensive for the first time the majority of Americans (54%) felt that it had been a mistake to send troops to Vietnam.

 Responding to Nixon’s earlier characterization of the protesters, the father of one of the dead told reporters, “My child was not a bum.” The cover of Life (26.14) showed terrified students trying to save the life of one victim, underscoring that the war’s killing had come home to America. This photo, along with the others inside the magazine, inspired musician Neil Young to write the song “Ohio” to protest the shootings, the war, and the Nixon administration.

 “Tin soldiers and Nixon coming, We’re finally on our own. This summer I hear the drumming, Four dead in Ohio.” Lyrics from Neil Young’s song “Ohio,” written in response to the Kent State shootings

 “A nation driven to use the weapons of war upon its youth is a nation on the edge of chaos,” concluded the presidential commission that investigated the Kent State incident. The Kent State shootings unmasked the growing “town and gown” divide over the war and latent anger at the peace movement. “They should have shot more of them,” suggested one Kent resident, still angry over the weekend riot. Radio stations refused to play Young’s “anti-Nixon” song. While protests over the shooting engulfed more than half the nation’s college campuses, workingclass unions staged counter-protests to support the war. In New York City hundreds of longshoremen wearing hard hats attacked students who were protesting the Cambodian invasion. During a subsequent meeting at the White House, sympathetic labor leaders presented the president with a “commander-in-chief” hard hat. The wave of protests after the Kent State shootings nonetheless bothered Nixon. At the end of a sleepless night on May 9, 1970, he made an impulsive decision to have his valet drive him, without his Secret Service detail, to the Lincoln Memorial at five o’clock in the morning so he could talk to the antiwar demonstrators camped out there. According to the protesters Nixon talked disjointedly about college sports and surfing and assured them that he shared their wish for peace in Vietnam. Despite his clumsy attempt to talk directly with peace activists, Nixon remained determined to see the war through to victory. Clinging to the belief that success would vindicate his methods, Nixon expanded the theater of war again in February 1971 by ordering an invasion of Laos. This time South Vietnamese troops fought on the ground with American air support. Once again, however, the hopes of permanently disrupting the Ho Chi Minh Trail bore meager results. Administration officials claimed that the Laos invasion illustrated the success of Vietnamization. Skeptics pointed to the sight of South Vietnamese soldiers clinging in panic to the skids of departing helicopters during their chaotic retreat back into South Vietnam. In 1971, antiwar demonstrators staged 62 demonstrations in Washington, D.C., bringing

 over 100,000 demonstrators to the nation’s capital (26.15). That summer The New York Times published the Pentagon Papers, a secret Department of Defense study that criticized the way Kennedy and Johnson had handled the war, stoking the flames of antiwar sentiment in the wake of the Calley conviction, the failed Cambodian and Laos invasions, and the Kent State killings. The Pentagon Papers, leaked by Pentagon official Daniel Ellsberg, confirmed that presidents Kennedy and Johnson had intentionally lied to the public about the extent of previous American involvement in the war. Many Americans assumed that Nixon was also misleading the country. By now only 34 percent of Americans approved of his handling of the war. Controversy over the war also seeped into the military. Morale plummeted as soldiers became unwilling to risk their lives for a cause that the nation seemed poised to abandon. In 1970, the military reported nearly 200 incidents of “fragging,” which were deadly fraternal attacks by enlisted men on officers, named for the hand grenade fragments that did most of the damage. Escalating use of marijuana, opium, and heroin, all readily available in Vietnam, among servicemen was another sign of disintegrating discipline.

Withdrawal
 Nixon envisioned détente creating a new world order in which the United States used trade agreements and arms limitation treaties to curtail the expansionist ambitions of its enemies. His administration made significant headway with this approach in 1972, beginning with a highly publicized trip to China in February and culminating with a May summit meeting in Moscow. The carefully orchestrated pictures of the staunch anti-communist Nixon toasting China’s communist leader Mao during an official banquet and lauding the achievements of Chinese civilization during a trek to the Great Wall signaled an important turning point in

 Sino-American relations. Improved relations with China also demolished one of the main arguments used to justify the war in Vietnam. American leaders had always linked the war to the larger American goal of containing communism in Southeast Asia. They considered the region, rather than Vietnam itself, vital to American strategic interests overseas. Nixon now demonstrated that diplomacy could perhaps contain communism in Southeast Asia more effectively than war. Why then, many Americans wondered, was the nation still fighting in Vietnam? The improving relations between its communist benefactors and the United States alarmed North Vietnam. When the North Vietnamese grumbled about Mao shaking hands with Nixon, Mao advised them to sign a peace treaty, regroup while the Americans withdrew, and then resume the war. North Vietnam eventually followed Mao’s advice. They first tried, however, to replicate the political success of the Tet Offensive by launching a major invasion of the South. The North Vietnamese timed the so-called Easter Offensive of March 1972 to coincide with the start of the American presidential campaign. In response Nixon ordered a massive retaliation against North Vietnam that included bombing, a blockade, and mining a key harbor. Unlike Tet the Easter Offensive did not greatly alter the political equation in the United States or worldwide. At home Nixon’s approval ratings rose for defending South Vietnam from attack. Moving from his successful meeting in China to Moscow, the U.S.-Soviet summit proceeded as planned. When Nixon returned with the first disarmament agreement ever signed by the Soviet Union, he bolstered his image as a tough negotiator who got results. The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I) limited the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles

 and submarine-launched missiles each side could stockpile and the number of antimissile launching pads. Once again, however, Nixon’s diplomatic success undercut his argument that the United States needed an anti-Communist South Vietnam to win the Cold War. By summer 1972, both the United States and North Vietnam concluded that the costs of continued fighting had become too great. Recognizing that Democratic presidential candidate Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, a peace advocate who promised to withdraw U.S. troops from Vietnam, was trailing in the polls, the North Vietnamese decided to seek the best terms possible from Nixon. Although Nixon had discredited McGovern by suggesting that he would abandon American POWs in Vietnam, the president was also eager to negotiate. With his reelection assured Nixon wanted to fulfill his campaign promise to end the war, so he could pursue his larger goal of refashioning Cold War relations among the world’s superpowers. Despite this renewed willingness on both sides to negotiate, it still took months to seal the deal. The final 1973 peace treaty called for American withdrawal, allowed North Vietnamese troops to remain in South Vietnam, and left the existing South Vietnamese government in place.
