 All left the Paris negotiating table knowing that the cease-fire existed only on paper. The war would go on, only now without American advisors, soldiers, or pilots. Despite the spiral downward in Vietnam, Nixon retained a durable base of domestic support due to the success of détente with China and the Soviet Union and his effective portrayal of the antiwar movement as out of step with mainstream America. This political base, however, eroded quickly when he became embroiled in a major political scandal. The Watergate scandal (1972), a botched Republican-engineered break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., forced Nixon to resign in 1974. On June 17, 1972, members of Nixon’s campaign staff had broken into the Watergate building office to fix broken wiretaps (listening devices on telephones) that they had installed during a previous burglary in May. Congressional challenges to his Vietnam policies and investigations into potential criminal activity by Nixon and members of his administration (see Chapter 28), weakened Nixon politically as he began his second term.

THE LONG ROAD TO PEACE

 In the midst of the Watergate crisis, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution to curtail presidential war-making powers. The 1973 law required congressional approval for any deployment of American troops overseas that lasted for more than 60 days. Critics pressed for even greater restrictions, arguing that the constitutional authority to declare war lay solely with Congress whether a war lasted 60 days or 60 years. Nixon countered that the law interfered with the president’s constitutional role as commander in chief of the armed forces. Ignoring Congress’s desire to end American involvement in Vietnam, he tried to continue funneling money and arms to South Vietnam. In response Congress sharply reduced funding for South Vietnam in 1974. When Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974 to avoid impeachment, VicePresident Gerald Ford assumed office. (Nixon had appointed Ford as his vice president in 1973 when Spiro Agnew resigned following an unrelated corruption scandal.) The political controversy at home and Americans’ widespread distrust of executive power in the wake of the failed war in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal weakened President Ford’s ability to respond to the imminent collapse of South Vietnam. In March 1975, North Vietnam renewed its offensive. With no American help in the offing, South Vietnam collapsed. Within eight weeks North Vietnamese troops neared Saigon. They walked along highways littered with boots and uniforms discarded by deserting South Vietnamese soldiers who hoped

 to blend into the civilian population and avoid execution. Ho Chi Minh did not live to see the end of the war (he died in 1969), but the Communists renamed Saigon “Ho Chi Minh City” in his honor. Victory in the 30-year conflict did not end civilian suffering in Vietnam, however. Famine and prison camps caused thousands to flee in overcrowded boats to refugee camps in Thailand and Malaysia, where they faced an uncertain future waiting for permanent asylum in the United States or Europe. For America the war concluded with the image of South Vietnamese citizens climbing a ladder on the roof of the American Embassy in Saigon to board one of the American helicopters that flew American citizens and 150,000 South Vietnamese to safety in the final days of the war (26.16). The frantic evacuation was a disheartening end to America’s longest war to date, one that claimed the lives of 47,415 combatants and cost the nation $173 billion (26.17). How to remember such a divisive and controversial war continued to provoke debate within the United States. The 1982 Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., listed all the names of American war dead on two black marble slabs that descended into the ground. “Hidden in a hole, as if in shame,” complained one veteran. “It is exactly the right memorial for that war,” countered another. Festering rumors that Vietnam was still holding American soldiers hostage deepened public bitterness against the nation’s former foe. The United States finally normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1995, 20 years after the fall of Saigon. It was time, one veteran wrote, “to recognize the truth. The war is over.”

A
Decade of Discord  The Challenge of the 1960s In April 1968, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, to support a black garbage men’s strike. Around 6:00 p.m. on April 4, 1968, as King leaned over a balcony railing outside his second-story room at the Lorraine Motel to chat with two friends in the courtyard below, shots rang out. A wounded King collapsed on the floor of the balcony, and colleagues frantically tried to stem the bleeding with towels while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Within an hour hospital doctors pronounced the 38-year-old minister dead. As news of King’s assassination spread, rioting erupted in black communities throughout the nation, and images of violence saturated the television airwaves. In this photo King’s 13-year-old daughter Yolanda sits inside a car peering at mourners, reflected in the car window, while her mother Coretta Scott King sits solemnly behind her as they leave King’s funeral in Atlanta, Georgia. This somber photograph, as much as the images of rioters, captured the crushing disappointment of dashed dreams. It was a sentiment shared by many Americans in the 1960s, white and black, who failed to fully realize their goals of either reforming America or ending the cultural turmoil. America was rife with discord during the 1960s. Much debate centered on liberalism and its willingness to use the government to protect civil rights and expand economic opportunity. Throughout the decade social reformers working within the liberal tradition advanced competing visions of social justice and shared prosperity. Some visions were bold; some, truly radical. King dreamed of using nonviolence to achieve racial equality; more militant activists advocated armed self-defense. Building on the reform legacies of the Progressive Era and the New Deal, Democratic Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson launched their own wars against poverty. Their legislative agendas were too timid for young radical activists, who wanted to revolutionize American capitalism. Feminists, Chicano activists, and Native American protesters also mobilized to demand equal rights. These visions of reform, especially the more radical revolutionary ones, appeared like nightmares to conservative segments of the population that abhorred liberalism. Southern segregationists organized to prevent government-mandated dismantling of Jim Crow, and white Northerners increasingly resented taxpayer-supported programs for unruly minorities. The rise of a hippie counterculture that emphasized love and pleasure convinced many working- and middle-class whites that liberalism meant the end of law and order and traditional values. If there was one point of agreement throughout the 1960s, it was that the political and cultural battles that defined the decade, for good or ill, transformed the nation. By 1970, frustration over unfulfilled dreams left Americans divided over whether the nation had changed too much or not enough.

 “We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.” MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., 1963





 CHAPTER 27

A DECADE OF DISCORD: THE CHALLENGE OF THE 1960S

The Liberal Moment
 The 1960s was the heyday of American liberalism, thanks in part to presidential reform agendas and to pivotal Supreme Court rulings. Presidents Kennedy and Johnson viewed themselves as heirs to the New Deal legacy, and they intended to follow in Harry Truman’s footsteps, who as president had desegregated the American military and secured federal funds for urban public housing, education, and public works projects. Kennedy and Johnson each believed in the power of the federal government to reform American society, but each faced intense resistance from conservatives who were certain that the less the government interfered in the economy or society, the better.

Kennedy and the
New Frontier
 Nearly 20 percent of Americans, 70 percent of them white, lived in dire poverty during the most prosperous moment in American history. Many middle- and upper-class Americans learned this startling statistic by reading Michael Harrington’s The Other America: Poverty in the United States (1962). Harrington documented the deteriorating schools, substandard hospitals, and dead-end jobs that created a cycle of poverty that continued unabated for generations. Just like Jacob Riis’s nineteenthcentury exposé, How the Other Half Lives (see Chapter 17), Harrington made the lives of the nation’s poor “visible” to the rest of the nation. Harrington claimed that a “culture of poverty” filled with extramarital sex, illegitimate children, and broken families created “a different kind of people” who did not share the values or outlook of middle-class America. Like Riis 70 years earlier, Harrington succeeded in awakening the social consciousness of affluent liberals, including John F. Kennedy. While campaigning in West Virginia during his 1960 presidential bid, Kennedy came face to face with appalling poverty as he sat and talked with coal miners, pictured here (27.1), about their lives. This moment of intimate conversation, one of his speechwriters noted, was “Kennedy at his best” as he gathered details about children who never drank 27.1 Presidential Candidate John F.

 milk and their fathers’ dangerous work underground. “I was better off in the war than they are in the coal mines,” Kennedy, a World War II veteran, told his campaign staff after this photo was taken. “It’s not right.” “Let us begin anew,” John F. Kennedy told the nation in his 1961 inaugural address, setting a tone

 “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” Kennedy’s Inaugural Address, 1961 of hope that inspired young people and liberals throughout the nation. After eight years with the moderate Republican Dwight Eisenhower in the White House, Kennedy wanted to reinvigorate the liberal agenda through a legislative program called the New Frontier. Kennedy’s proposed reforms included raising the minimum wage, reducing overcrowding in schools, and providing health care for the elderly. Kennedy advocated cutting taxes and increasing government spending to stimulate the economy, reasoning that as incomes rose more tax revenue would flow into federal coffers to pay for these programs. Kennedy also needed large sums for the ongoing space race with the Soviet Union, begun when the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 (see Chapter 24). The Soviets sent the first astronauts into space in 1961, prompting Kennedy to announce that the United States intended to recover its reputation as the world’s technological leader by putting a man on the moon. The youngest elected president in American history, Kennedy’s charisma and idealism inspired many baby boomers, who were just reaching adolescence or entering college. Thousands rushed to join the Peace Corps, an agency established by Kennedy that sent recent college graduates to work on humanitarian projects in developing nations. “I really believed that I was going to change the world,” recalled one teenager. By 1970, over 10,000 Peace Corps volunteers had traveled abroad to teach, build hospitals, set up water treatment plants, and establish irrigation systems. Kennedy raised unemployment and Social Security benefits and the minimum wage, but he had trouble implementing other parts of his

 liberal legislative program. Unskilled in lobbying legislators, just over one-third of his proposals became law. Conservative congressmen balked at using deficit spending to fund the tax cuts and programs Kennedy proposed. Southerners objected to Northerners’ insistence that federal education funds go only to racially integrated schools, while Protestants resisted offering public monies to private Catholic parochial schools. It was one of the “great ironies of American politics,” a New York Times reporter noted, that “JFK, the immensely popular president, could not reach his legislative goals.”

A
Liberal Court  Under the leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren from 1953–1969, the Supreme Court became an aggressive champion of individual rights, fostering the liberal agenda more successfully than Kennedy and Democrats in Congress. Warren believed that the Constitution gave the government the power, and the responsibility, to protect the relatively powerless against oppression by the majority. By rendering opinions on a wide range of social justice issues, the Warren Court brought about a legal revolution in the United States that permanently altered American schools, politics, the criminal justice system, and cultural norms. Northern liberals cheered these decisions, but conservatives in both parties viewed the Warren Court as an activist court, rewriting rather than upholding the Constitution. In 1954, the Brown v. Board of Education decision (see Chapter 25) paved the way for school desegregation. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the court dismantled Jim Crow piece by piece, striking down segregated interstate and city buses, upholding the rights of civil rights protesters to hold sit-ins, and embracing mid-1960s federal laws that desegregated public places and guaranteed the right to vote as constitutional. Another innovative judicial premise, the right to privacy, accompanied the Supreme Court’s new support for civil rights. The court struck down state laws that outlawed possession of obscene publications, prohibited the use of contraception, and prevented interracial marriages. Individual Americans, the court ruled, had the right to decide what to read, to use birth control, and to marry whom they wanted. Other decisions redefined how the police arrested and interrogated suspected criminals. The police now had to inform individuals of their constitutional rights to have a state-funded

Choices and Consequences
IS SCHOOL PRAYER CONSTITUTIONAL?
In 1962, parents in New York State challenged the constitutionality of the short nondenominational prayer that the state Board of Regents had adopted in 1951 for use in the public schools. The question was whether government-directed prayer violated the First Amendment clause that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” The Fourteenth Amendment made this clause applicable to state law. 
Choices




 The prayer was constitutional because students were not required to recite it.





 An official prayer, regardless of its content, violated the First Amendment.

 School prayer simply recognized the importance of religion in American society without establishing an official religion.

Decision
 In Engel v. Vitale (1962) the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 1 that state-directed school prayer was unconstitutional. Justice Hugo Black wrote the majority opinion, stating that the First Amendment prohibited “official prayers for any group of American people to recite as part of a religious program carried on by government.”

Consequences
 The Warren Court received more mail opposing this case than any other. In 1963, the court also banned reciting the Lord’s Prayer and Bible-reading in public school, ruling that to remain neutral the government could not support “the tenets of one or all religions.” Outrage over school prayer rulings helped forge a new political coalition between Southern fundamentalist Protestants and Northern Catholics, whose grassroots activism against liberalism contributed to the conservative right’s resurgence in the late 1960s. Subsequent court decisions in the 1980s and 1990s prohibited moments of silence for private prayer, minister-led prayers at high school graduations, and student-led prayers at high school football games.

 First-graders praying

Continuing Controversies
 Does school prayer violate the First Amendment? Those who answer “yes” believe that the Founding Fathers included the establishment clause in the Constitution because the union of government and religion often leads to persecution of those not adhering to mainstream religious views. Freedom of

 religion requires a completely secular government that neither advances nor inhibits religious beliefs. Many conservatives argue that the court’s decisions violated their First Amendment right to exercise free speech and destroyed the spiritual heritage of the nation that stretched back to the Pilgrims.

 Why did so many Americans object to the Supreme Court’s ruling against school prayer?

A DECADE OF DISCORD: THE CHALLENGE OF THE 1960S

 In deciding which delegation to seat, the convention’s Credentials Committee heard gripping testimony from MFDP delegate Fannie Lou Hamer. Thanks to the live television feed covering the proceedings, Americans throughout the nation heard her describe being beaten, losing her job, and receiving a $9,000 water bill even though her house had no running water—all retribution for trying to register to vote. “Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, where we are threatened daily because we want to live as decent human beings?” she asked before the cameras. Suddenly the networks broke away for an impromptu presidential news conference that Johnson had called to interrupt coverage of Hamer’s moving personal story. Johnson did not want the convention and his subsequent campaign to center on civil rights. To end the matter, he tried to broker a deal off-camera. When the MFDP rejected the offer of two delegate seats, the all-white Mississippi delegation took the floor. In the election of 1964, the Democrat and Republican parties fielded candidates who offered starkly different visions of the role that government should play in American society. Johnson spoke of creating a Great Society with social welfare reforms that would make the amenities of modern life—a decent standard of living, education, health care, clean water—available to all Americans. Like turn-of-the-century Populists and Progressives, and 1930s New Dealers, he wanted to use the power of the federal government to rein in the wealthy and help economically disadvantaged Americans. Having begun his congressional career as an avid New Dealer in the 1930s, Johnson shared Franklin D. Roosevelt’s desire to provide the deserving poor with a decent standard of living. Johnson, however, believed even more strongly than previous generations of liberal reformers in the ability of the government to improve the quality of life in America. Under Johnson the federal government began com-

 bating pollution, supporting the arts, and planting trees and flowers along the nation’s highways—a beautification project strongly endorsed by his wife, Lady Bird Johnson. Johnson aspired to do more than put food in people’s bellies; he also wanted to nurture their spirits. Barry Goldwater, a conservative Republican senator from Arizona, offered a radically different view of what responsibilities the government should assume. Instead of more government Goldwater proposed dismantling most of the New Deal, including Social Security, and opposed federal civil rights laws, because he saw them as the first step toward creating “a police state.” “My aim is not to pass laws but to repeal them,” he declared. Goldwater spoke for the radical right, staunch conservatives who felt that the government’s interference in the economy and society did more harm than good. His extreme conservative views, however, alarmed prominent moderate Republicans who openly supported Johnson. In the campaign the Democrats astutely used Goldwater’s most extreme pronouncements against him, making the liberal Johnson look almost moderate in comparison. Amplifying a remark by Goldwater that NATO commanders should have the authority to use nuclear weapons, a Democratic television campaign ad pictured a little girl counting as she picked the petals off a daisy (27.3). When she reached nine the camera froze on the image of her uplifted face before dissolving into a countdown to a nuclear bomb explosion. As the mushroom cloud dissipated, the screen turned dark and these words appeared: “Vote for President Johnson on November 3. The stakes are too high for you to stay home.” The ad provoked its own firestorm of controversy and only aired once. It succeeded, however, in planting the image of Goldwater as a dangerous extremist who might lead the nation into nuclear war.

 Johnson won the election with over 61 percent of the popular vote, the largest percentage in American history. The Democrats also widened their control of Congress, strengthening Johnson’s hand. Johnson knew that he had to strike immediately to enact his legislative agenda. “Hurry, boys, hurry,” he told his staff. “Get that legislation up to the hill and out. Eighteen months from now Landslide Lyndon will be Lame-Duck Lyndon.”

The Great Society
 Admiring the trees and landscaping along a national highway, reading a food label listing nutritional content in the supermarket, buying unleaded gas at a service station, and watching a documentary on the Public Broadcasting System (PBS): these are all experiences of modern life made possible by Johnson’s Great Society. Reflecting liberal faith in the power of the government to do good, the adherents of the Great Society hoped to remove the causes of debilitating poverty by improving the nation’s educational system, providing health care to the aged, disabled, and indigent, and creating a new cabinet-level position in housing and urban affairs

 to oversee housing and economic relief to struggling cities. Johnson’s Great Society also included a new Department of Transportation to manage the federal funds pouring into highway construction and landscaping. Johnson worked hard to create consensus for his liberal ideals. He offered conservative industrialists tax breaks in return for supporting his social welfare programs, arguing that his programs would create highly skilled workers who consumed more. “Doing something about poverty is economical in the long run,” he told them. From his long years in Congress, Johnson knew how to lobby legislators. To secure a needed vote, Johnson brought legislators to the White House and subjected them to “The Treatment,” a mixture of cajoling, horse-trading, and intimidation. One congressman recalled the 6’3” Johnson grabbing him by the lapels of his coat, pulling him close and holding his face inches away while he “talked and talked.
