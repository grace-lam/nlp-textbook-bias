 accrued stupendous fortunes were four Irishmen— John Mackay, Jim Fair, James Flood, and William O’Brien—known collectively as the “Silver Kings.” They bought a controlling interest in a mine many declared “spent” and virtually worthless. Yet in 1873, their miners hit the greatest silver vein of them all, the Big Bonanza, that eventually yielded more than $100 million. Most fortune seekers, however, earned modest livings as wage earners working in the mines, while others flocked to the resulting boomtown, Virginia City, to work in construction, dry goods stores, and saloons. Thousands of women in Virginia City found work in hotels, laundries, and restaurants. Unfortunately, low wages and a lack of a family network to fall back upon forced many women to become prostitutes. Other discoveries of gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc, followed in Colorado, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. As in Nevada, the initial prospectors eventually gave way to larger, more sophisticated industrial operations that possessed the capital to invest in the technology needed to dig deep shafts, extract the ore from rocks, process it on site, and ship it by rail to market. Like Eastern industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, these corporations often integrated their resources with the means and methods of production to maximize profits (see Chapter 16). The industrial revolution was not merely an Eastern phenomenon.

The Environmental Legacy
 Economic development in the trans-Mississippi West led to countless success stories of enterprising and risk-taking individuals who established farms, ranches, mines, and small businesses, or who simply found lucrative employment in the region’s many urban centers. But such development often came at the expense of the natural environment. Mining, for example, came in many forms, but in nearly every case it left behind a badly scarred landscape. Open-pit mining of the Mahoning iron ore mine in Minnesota’s Mesabi Range eliminated vast tracts of forest and created massive gouges in the land (15.12). These changes shattered the local ecosystem and choked surrounding waterways with muddy runoff water. Hydraulic mining, or the use of high-pressure water streams to wash away soil and gravel, created similar problems.

 Ore processing often used toxic chemicals to separate ore from rock or other materials. Miners simply dumped them into rivers or open fields, where they eventually seeped into the water table and throughout the ecosystem. The arrival of ever-growing numbers of humans in the West altered the delicately balanced Western ecosystems. On the Great Plains, for example, hunting and other human activity led to the eradication or near eradication of elk, bear, wolf, and buffalo populations. Conversely, settlers introduced foreign animals and plants that, lacking natural predators, spread rapidly and disrupted the balance of the ecosystem. For example, cheatgrass, accidentally introduced to the West from Asia in the 1890s, quickly spread over millions of acres, wiping out or diminishing other flora and greatly increasing the incidence of wildfires. Farming in arid areas of the West, through the use of deep-cutting steel plows that loosened hard-packed dry soil, contributed to significant topsoil erosion. Vast herds of livestock had a similar effect as their grazing eliminated the grass whose roots held the soil in place. Likewise the practices of the timber industry led to deforestation, the loss of habitat for many animal and plant species, and without trees to shield the soil from heavy rainfall, erosion. Some Americans decried this environmental damage, but most viewed the West through the lens of Manifest Destiny, seeing it as a place of limitless resources provided by God for the enjoyment and enrichment of human beings.

 of Unchecked Economic Development Western states bowed to the powerful and profitable mining industry, leaving its practices unregulated. As a result, methods such as open-pit mining led to serious environmental damage.

CONFLICT AND CONQUEST: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST, 1860–1900

 Native Americans under Siege Westward expansion benefited many Americans, but it devastated Native Americans. They faced a relentless tide of white settlers who possessed both superior weaponry and a belief that they had a higher claim to Western land. White settlers also enjoyed the support of the federal government and army. The result for Native Americans in the last third of the nineteenth century was broken treaties, devastating wars, relocation to reservations, and forced assimilation. 15.13 Promoting an Image of Indian Savagery This 1853 sculpture by Horatio Greenough promoted the idea among white Americans that Native Americans were violent savages.

Mounting Problems
 for Native Americans In 1851, as it became clear that the traditional government policy of simply forcing tribes into the West was no longer viable because of increased white migration into the region, Congress passed the Indian Appropriations Act. It set aside vast tracts of the Oklahoma Territory as reservations for dozens of Native American tribes. That same year the U.S. government, the Sioux, and other Plains tribes signed the first Treaty of Fort Laramie. In exchange for declaring nearly all of the central and northern Great Plains off limits to white settlement, the tribes agreed to allow whites to pass unmolested along the Oregon Trail as they moved westward. But the lasting peace that government officials and tribal leaders hoped the treaty would secure did not materialize. Tension and violence between white settlers and Native American tribes only increased in the coming years. One of the most serious problems Native Americans faced in resisting Euro-American incursion onto their lands was the racism of white Americans that characterized Indians as backward, pagan, violent savages who lacked a rightful claim to

 the lands they occupied. As Competing Visions: Inevitable Progress or Unjust Invasion? makes clear, many Americans believed their own culture was vastly superior and viewed Native Americans as obstacles to national progress that must be removed. These notions originated in the colonial period, but greater contact and conflict between whites and Indians after 1850 led to a proliferation of largely negative depictions of Native Americans in newspapers, magazines, songs, plays, and works of art like The Rescue, by sculptor Horatio Greenough (15.13). Commissioned by the federal government and placed at the entrance to the U.S. Capitol in 1853, the scene drew on the many sensationalized stories and paintings of white settlers, especially women, being kidnapped, raped, and murdered by Native Americans. But Greenough departed from the traditional depictions and introduced a towering, dominant white settler. Note the contrasts in the men’s size, demeanor, and clothing. “I have endeavoured,” Greenough explained, “to convey the idea of the triumph of the whites over the savage tribes.” By 1874, the scene had merged with the life of the famous pioneer and icon of frontier masculinity, Daniel Boone (15.14). Both images proclaim Indian savagery and justify white domination, a message that eventually resulted in the sculpture’s removal from public view in 1958.

INEVITABLE PROGRESS OR UNJUST INVASION?
As more and more Euro-Americans moved westward in search of land and opportunity, they came into conflict with the region’s Native American inhabitants. As you read these documents from 1877, the first by an Englishman William Blackmore and the second by the famous Sioux Chief, Sitting Bull, consider the sharply different ideas expressed over which group had the higher claim to the land and which culture brought a more moral and enlightened notion of how to treat it. How does Blackmore make the extinction of Native Americans seem natural and inevitable? What message does this notion convey to white Americans? How does Sitting Bull express the Native American vision of nature and access to resources? How does he criticize the vision of whites like Blackmore?

 All authorities who have investigated the subject are unanimous in predicting that the Red Men are a doomed race. The … Indians will as surely disappear before the progress of the more energetic and aggressive Anglo Saxon, as sure as the snows of winter melt away before the summer sun. But sad as the fate of the Red Man is, yet, even as philanthropists, we must not forget that, under what appear to be one of immutable laws of progress, the savage is giving place to a higher and more civilized race. Three hundred thousand Red Men at the present time require the occupation of an entire continent as large as Europe, in order that they may obtain an uncertain and scanty subsistence by the chase. Ought we, then, to regret if in the course of a few generations their wigwams, tepees, and mud lodges, rarely numbering more than one hundred in a village, are replaced by new cities of the West, each equaling, perhaps, in magnificence, in stately structures, and population (exceeding that of all the Indians), either in St. Louis or Chicago? Or if in supplanting less than 300,000 wandering, debased, and half-naked savages, we can people the self-same district with a population of many tens of millions of many prosperous and highly civilized whites? . . . in a few years the only reminiscence of the Red Men will be the preservation of the names of some of the extinct tribes and dead chiefs in the nomenclature of the leading cities, counties, and States of the Great West.

Sitting Bull, Speech at the Powder River Council, 1877
 Behold, my friends, the spring is come; the earth has gladly received the embraces of the sun, and we shall soon see the results of their love! Every seed is awakened, and all animal life. It is through this mysterious power that we too have our being, and we therefore yield to our neighbors, even to our animal neighbors, the same right as ourselves to inhabit this vast land. Yet hear me, friends! we have now to deal with another people, small and feeble when our forefathers first met with them, but now great and overbearing. Strangely enough, they have a mind to till the soil, and the love of possessions is a disease in them. These people have made many rules that the rich may break, but the poor may not! … They claim this mother of ours, the Earth, for their own use, and fence their neighbors away from her, and deface her with their buildings and their refuse. They compel her to produce out of season, and when sterile she is made to take medicine in order to produce again. All this is sacrilege. This nation [of whites] is like a spring freshet; it overruns its banks and destroys all who are in its path. We cannot dwell side by side. Only seven years ago we made a treaty by which we were assured that the buffalo country should be left to us forever. Now they threaten to take that from us also. My brothers, shall we submit? or shall we say to them: ‘First kill me, before you can take possession of my fatherland!’

 Why did many white Americans believe they had a right to take lands inhabited by Native Americans?

CONFLICT AND CONQUEST: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST, 1860–1900

 “Women and children were killed and scalped, children shot at their mothers’ breasts, and all the bodies mutilated in the most horrible manner. . . . Colonel J. M. Chivington all the time inciting his troops to their diabolical outrages.” MAJOR EDWARD WYNKOOP, testimony before congressional committee investigating the Sand Creek Massacre White hostility to Native Americans shaped government policy, especially when it came to signing and honoring treaties. Invariably, it seemed, federal officials negotiated treaties with tribes that promised to permanently fix the boundaries of their hunting grounds and places of habitation, only to find soon thereafter that whites, hungry for land, had begun settling there. Rather than enforce the terms of the treaty and force the removal of white settlers, the government inevitably revised the treaty to further shrink designated Native American lands. This combination of white settlers’ desire for land and disregard for Native Americans’ rights, and the efforts of Native Americans to resist

 white encroachment, led to repeated outbreaks of violence. One of the worst incidents was the Sand Creek Massacre. On November 29, 1864, angered by sporadic attacks on settlers by Native American tribes in Colorado, a military outfit under Colonel John M Chivington raided a peaceful encampment of 800 Cheyenne at Sand Creek. With most of the Cheyenne men off hunting, Chivington’s force slaughtered more than 200 Indians, mostly defenseless women and children, mutilated their bodies, and returned to Denver with their scalps. Native Americans also confronted epidemics of diseases such as smallpox and measles—diseases that they possessed little or no resistance to. While the worst devastation had taken place in previous centuries during initial European contact (see Chapter 1), epidemics continued to kill thousands. For example, a smallpox outbreak in the Pacific Northwest in 1862 killed some 12,000 Indians. The widespread abuse of alcohol, a commodity obtained

 through trade with whites, further compromised Native American health. Additionally, long-standing animosities among tribes prevented Native Americans from developing a united front against the U.S. Army. White officials took advantage of these divisions to obtain help from one tribe, in the form of guides and even soldiers, against another. Disunity within tribes also contributed to this problem, as individual bands guarded their autonomy and resisted the idea of centralized tribal authority. For example, in 1863 leaders of the Nez Perce tribe split over whether to sign a treaty that would confine them to a reservation. The Plains tribes’ dependence on the buffalo left them particularly vulnerable in the 1870s. Railroad companies, disdainful of the large herds that occasionally disrupted the passage of trains, hired gunmen to kill buffalo. Entrepreneurs made buffalo robes fashionable in the East, thereby encouraging hunters to kill still more buffalo. The army soon recognized the strategic value of wiping out the great herds to undermine the independence of the Plains tribes and force them to stay on reservation lands. The scale of extermination was staggering. In this photograph (15.15), workers at the Michigan Carbon Works prepare thousands of buffalo skulls for processing into fertilizer, glue, and other products. The buffalo population, estimated at 30 million in 1800, plunged to only a few thousand by the early 1880s creating a crisis for the Plains Indians who depended on them. The technological disparity between Indians and white settlers left the latter at a great disadvantage. Euro-American settlers and soldiers alike were heavily armed with modern rifles. The army also had early machine guns (called Gatling guns) and heavy artillery. While many Native American tribes had long ago acquired firearms, they never produced guns and ammunition and remained dependent on whites for them. The telegraph also allowed the army to communicate over great distances about troop movements and Native American military activity, and request supplies and reinforcements.

Wars on the Plains
 Despite its lack of commitment to honoring them, the federal government nonetheless signed many treaties in the late 1860s hoping to bring peace to the West and allow continued settlement by whites. Treaties were drawn up and signed with the Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho in

 Read the Document Chief Red Cloud’s Speech



1865, the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache in 1867
 (the Medicine Lodge Treaty), and the Sioux (the second Fort Laramie Treaty) in 1868. The latter treaty ended Red Cloud’s War (1866–1868), a conflict that erupted when the army announced plans to build forts along the Bozeman Trail in the Wyoming and Montana territories to protect white migrants drawn by the discovery of gold in Montana. It guaranteed to the Sioux ownership of the Black Hills and land and hunting rights in South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. It also explicitly barred white people from these lands. “From this day forward all war between the parties to this agreement shall forever cease,” declared the treaty in words that would soon prove false. “The government of the United States desires peace, and its honor is hereby pledged to keep it.” Despite these measures, continued violation of treaties by white settlers who ventured onto Indian lands and bands of Indians who refused to accept confinement on reservation lands led to increased bloodshed. The Red River War broke out in 1874 on the southern plains in present-day Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas when bands of Kiowa, Comanche, southern Cheyenne, and southern Arapaho, angered over the federal government’s failure to uphold its obligation to provide adequate supplies and keep whites off the reservation land (the army actually organized buffalo hunting parties that devastated local herds), left the reservation and raided white settlements. Led by General Philip Sheridan, the army crushed the rebellion by the spring of 1875, thereby ending Native American resistance on the southern plains. By then the primary conflict had shifted to the northern plains. The discovery of gold in the Black Hills of South Dakota in 1874 touched off a flood of white fortune seekers into the region that was indisputably (as stipulated in the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty) territory granted exclusively to Native American tribes. Rather than keep white trespassers out, however, the federal government demanded the Sioux vacate their Red River hunting grounds and return to their reservations. When the tribes refused to comply, the army launched an offensive. In the late spring 1876, the Seventh Cavalry, led by a young and vainglorious lieutenant colonel named George Armstrong Custer, closed in on a large band of Cheyenne, Sioux, and Arapaho warriors, including the well-known Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, near the Little Bighorn River in

 Montana. Eager to earn fame and believing there were only a few hundred Indian warriors when in fact the number was closer to 2,000, Custer attacked before the rest of the army (and other officers who might overshadow him) arrived. The Battle of Little Bighorn quickly disintegrated into

 one of the most devastating defeats ever suffered by the U.S. military as Custer and more than 250 of his men were killed. Although the battle was an overwhelming triumph for the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho, it quickly proved a hollow victory. As this cartoon ( 15.16) published in the New York Graphic a few weeks after the battle demonstrates, the Eastern media ignored Custer’s blundering and instead depicted him and his men as valiant victims and demanded vengeance. Note the artist’s blunt depiction of Indians as savage, semi-animal beings in stark contrast to the two white soldiers, one a heroic victim and the other a coolheaded executioner. The caption, “The Right Way to Dispose of Sitting Bull and His Braves—What the Country Expects of General Sheridan,” was a not-so-subtle assertion of the popular belief that the government was showing too much leniency toward Native Americans who resisted white expansion. Responding to this pressure, the government expanded military action in the Black Hills and forced the Sioux and other defiant tribes onto reservations.

 Farther west, native tribes encountered similar problems. During the last third of the nineteenth century, the states and territories west of the Rockies also were growing. The mining and railroad industries, the economic centerpieces of that

 region, required a great deal of land—land long occupied by Native Americans. Just as on the Great Plains, the tribes on the West Coast and in the intermountain West faced an encroaching white population that considered the land theirs for the taking. In 1876, following the massacre of Custer and the Seventh Cavalry, army and government officials increased pressure on tribes to move to reservations. One such group targeted was a portion of the Nez Perce tribe that lived on the northwestern plateau of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. In 1863, most of the Nez Perce had agreed to move onto a reservation, but about a quarter had refused. Led by Chief Joseph, about 750 Nez Perce (500 of them women, children, and elderly non-combatants) fled the region to escape the army. Over the ensuing four months, they engaged in an epic flight of 1,400 miles, hoping to cross into Canada. Despite their small numbers and dwindling supplies, they defeated the army in several battles and came within 40 miles of the Canadian border before they were forced to surrender to the army and to life on a reservation. Similar scenes of final military resistance played out in the Southwest. An Apache warrior named Geronimo had emerged in the 1860s and 1870s as a fearless opponent to encroaching Euro-American and Mexican settlers. Captured in 1874, Geronimo and some 4,000 Apaches were sent to a reservation at San Carlos, Arizona. The grim life on the reservation led him to escape and resume his campaign of resistance. He surrendered in 1884, but in 1885 and again in 1886, Geronimo escaped with a few warriors and their families and eluded capture for months. These escapades added to his already legendary status, but he eventually surrendered for good in 1886, ending the last significant Native American resistance. In the 1880s and 1890s resistance to exploitation and abuse also erupted in the Southwest among Hispanos (descendants of Spanish colonists) and Mexicans. Euro-American settlers who arrived in New Mexico in the mid-nineteenth century eventually gave rise to a powerful ruling class of politicians, landowners, and ranchers. Many allied themselves with powerful gangs that provided protection and intimidated (and sometimes killed) their rivals. Poor Hispano and Mexican farmers often bore the brunt of these ruling Euro-Americans’ ruthless tactics and hunger for

 land. When officials began to sell off to speculators and ranchers what had long been used as common grazing lands, the poor farmers resisted. The most famous of these resistors were Las Gorras Blancas, or The White Caps, a secret militant vigilante group of Mexican men who in the late 1880s and early 1890s wore white masks and cut fences on lands taken over by speculators. They also destroyed railroad bridges, buildings, and crops.

In Pursuit of a Solution
 While most Americans expressed little concern over the fate of Native Americans in the West, a few did protest. One of the first was Helen Hunt Jackson. Inspired by an 1879 lecture by Susette La Flesche and her uncle, Chief Standing Bear, relating the plight of the Ponca tribe to an audience in Connecticut, she began speaking and lobbying on behalf of Native Americans. In 1881, she published A Century of Dishonor, a book that chronicled in searing detail the misguided and murderous treatment of Native Americans by the U.S. government. The book prompted Congress to appoint a commission to study Indian affairs and seek a new and more humane policy.

 “Hear me, my chiefs! I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.” CHIEF JOSEPH, shortly after his surrender in 1877

 Another influential reformer garnered a wide audience as an authentic spokesperson for the Native Americans. Sarah Winnemucca, the granddaughter of a Northern Paiute chief, had received some education from white families in Nevada and California and worked as a translator for the army. In the late 1870s, her lectures in the East demanding more humane treatment of the Paiutes and other tribes brought her to the attention of reformers. Winnemucca tried to gain credibility among whites by presenting herself as an “Indian Princess,” an image firmly established in American popular

 culture by the mid-nineteenth century, notably in the story of Pocahontas (see Chapter 2). In her posed portrait (15.17), hardly anything in her costume, especially the crown and bag embroidered with a cupid and bow and arrow, resembles traditional Paiute clothing and jewelry. Nonetheless, in an era when the political and social opinions of women, especially Native American women, were largely ignored, Winnemucca’s strategy brought extensive and respectful press coverage of her speeches and eventually her book, Life Among the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims (1883). “In the history of the Indians,” wrote one reporter in 1885, “she and Pocahontas will be the principal female characters.” Both Jackson and Winnemucca promoted education for Native Americans, but with different goals in mind. Jackson represented the reformers who believed it the duty of the government to elevate Native Americans from “savagery” by educating and assimilating them into white Euro-American society. In particular they advocated the establishment of boarding schools for Indian children and the eventual dissolution of reservations (see Choices and Consequences: Forced Assimilation Versus Cultural Preservation). In contrast, Winnemucca believed in formal education, but not at the expense of eliminating Native American culture. She believed that Indian children could become educated and productive Americans, while retaining the core of their culture and traditions. Jackson’s ideas prevailed among reformminded legislators in Congress concerned about the plight of Native Americans, especially Senator Henry L. Dawes. In 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Severalty Act to break up the reservations

 Why did reformers like Dawes believe the break up of reservations would benefit Native Americans?

 and assimilate Native Americans into the dominant white Christian American culture. The plan offered Native American heads of household allotments of 160 acres of reservation land (with smaller amounts going to those unmarried or under age 18) to encourage them to become independent family farmers. Remaining reservation lands would be sold off and the profits set aside for tools and education. Native Americans who accepted these terms could apply for U.S. citizenship. To prevent speculators from defrauding Indians, land allotments would be held in trust for 25 years before full ownership was conferred. The Dawes Severalty Act (and subsequent related laws) was born of high ideals and good intentions, but it proved devastating to the Native Americans it was intended to help. The program was rife with flaws, beginning with the allotment of land that was often of poor quality, making successful farming difficult if not impossible. It also included restrictions on

Choices and Consequences
FORCED ASSIMILATION VERSUS CULTURAL PRESERVATION
The Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 stipulated that revenue generated from the sale of reservation lands be applied to the education of Native American children. As with the land allotment plan, the principal motivation of people like Dawes and reformer Helen Hunt Jackson was to assimilate Indians into American society, which they believed would be facilitated by providing vocational training to enhance their job prospects. But the act did not specify what kind of education ought to be provided, and so Congress and the Bureau of Indian Affairs faced a choice. 
Choices




 Establish reservation-based schools offering a traditional public school curriculum, while allowing Native Americans to maintain their culture and language.



 Establish reservation-based schools offering a traditional public school curriculum, while requiring a higher degree of assimilation (especially learning English).



 Establish off-reservation boarding schools committed to eliminating all vestiges of Native American culture.

Decision
 The government chose to establish off-reservation boarding schools. The model was the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Established in 1879, it operated on the simple, but brutal principle of “kill the Indian, save the man.” As the “before and after” photographs indicate, Native American children sent to boarding schools were required to cut their hair, wear American clothing, take an American name, and speak only English. Some schools made conversion to Christianity a top priority.

Consequences
 Removal from families and fellow Native Americans on their reservations caused many children to suffer psychological trauma. Many also suffered from physical abuse, malnutrition, and poor health care. About one in seven ran away, and many committed suicide. Still, by 1902, 25 federally funded boarding schools, and many more private ones, operated in 15 states with 6,000 students.

Continuing Controversies
 What was the long-term impact of the boarding schools? Along with the trauma inflicted on generations of children, it hastened the demise of Native American culture, including the disappearance or near disappearance of many languages. Native American groups have filed lawsuits against the government and the churches that ran the schools and demanded formal apologies.

 hunting, further limiting options for participants. Despite safeguards, white speculators and scammers found ways to con Native Americans out of their allotted land long before the 25-year term. The act also allowed, as indicated by the poster (15.18), the government to sell land deemed “surplus” to white settlers. This poster touts the high quality of the estimated 350,000 acres being offered for sale in 1910. As the map (15.19) shows, by the time the Dawes Act was replaced in 1934, two-thirds of Native American reservation land had been lost.

 How did the Dawes Act play a key role in the loss of Native American land?

RESISTANCE AND ROMANTICISM



Resistance and Romanticism
 The surrender of Geronimo in 1886 symbolized the end of significant armed resistance by Native Americans to the Euro-American settlement of the trans-Mississippi West. Nonetheless, a revival movement called the Ghost Dance, offered one final chance to reverse the fortunes of Native Americans. When that effort was brutally crushed by the army at a place called Wounded Knee, Native Americans turned to more subtle and enduring efforts to preserve their tribes, families, and culture. At the same time, white Americans continued to fashion a pleasing image of the West as a place of adventure, heroism, individualism, and opportunity. This image found its way into art, literature, music, and popular culture in the twentieth century. Yet historians and activists have offered a corrective to this romantic image that takes into account the experiences of Native Americans, Mexicans, and women, and the impact on the environment.

Persecution and Persistence
 The last major form of resistance to the EuroAmerican conquest of the West emerged in the late 1880s. The Ghost Dance movement originated in the 1870s, but did not become widely popular until a Northern Paiute shaman named Wovoka began preaching a message of Native American revival based on a vision he had experienced during a total eclipse of the sun in 1889. In this vision, which he related to his followers, a great flood scoured the land clean of all white settlers, leaving behind Indians who had remained true to traditional teachings and a renewed herd of buffalo. Wovoka told his followers to perform the Ghost Dance, a ritual ceremony where participants donned special shirts and danced in a circle until brought to an ecstatic state that they believed drew to them the spirits of ancestors who would protect them from the white man’s bullets. The hopeful message of the Ghost Dance spread rapidly among Native Americans from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, alarming federal officials who feared it contained the seeds of rebellion. The director of the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota ordered Sitting Bull arrested. When he resisted, the police shot him dead. Two weeks later, on December 29, 1890 the army confronted about 300 Sioux Ghost Dancers at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota. When one of the Indians accidentally fired his gun, the soldiers attacked and

 massacred more than 200. This photograph (15.20), “The Medicine Man Taken at Wounded Knee, S.D.,” conveyed the brutality of the event. The date of January 1, 1891, on the photograph indicates that bodies were left unattended for days before being interred in a mass grave. Note the rifle placed on the body by a soldier, so that the photographer could present an image of a hostile Indian. It was not the bloodiest clash between Native Americans and the U.S. Army, but the Wounded Knee Massacre symbolized the brutality associated with the conquest of the West. The end of armed conflict did not mean an end to resistance for Native Americans. In the coming

 decades, as they struggled with the loss of tribal lands, the cultural erosion caused by the boarding schools, and high levels of poverty and alcoholism, Native Americans found ways to preserve their culture, including languages, artistic forms, and religious beliefs. They did so by maintaining traditions within families and establishing informal methods of passing on traditions from one generation to the next. As a result, when a Native American rights movement emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, it included a commitment to reaffirming and strengthening traditional Native American cultures.

Creating Mythical Heroes
 and Images The story of the American West has long been the object of romanticism and myth. The image of the West as a place of high adventure, heroism, rugged individualism, and endless opportunity developed with the first enthusiastic reports of Western explorers such as Lewis and Clarke (see Chapter 7). But this image really flourished after 1850 as more migrants and journalists headed west and sent back to the East countless letters and dispatches describing the West’s wide-open lands, roaring rivers, and majestic mountains, as well as the heroic struggles of pioneers against weather and hostile Indians. Eventually writers turned to fiction, especially a new genre known as the “dime novel.” The first Western dime novels appeared in the 1860s and their subjects—characters like cowboy Deadwood Dick and his rough and ready girlfriend Calamity Jane—soon became pop heroes. So too did Buffalo Bill. Stories based on the legendary exploits of a real Western scout, buffalo hunter, and Pony Express rider named William “Buffalo Bill” Cody first appeared in a newspaper and then in dime novel form as Buffalo Bill, King of the Border Men. When it sold well, its author (and many imitators) wrote hundreds more Buffalo Bill stories. Cody grew famous but he earned no royalties from the novels. To capitalize on his fame, he created in 1883 “Buffalo Bill’s Wild West,” a circus-like production that purported to show audiences the thrilling and harrowing life on the frontier, replete with huge reenactments of cattle drives and clashes between Indians and cowboys, and exhibitions of marksmanship,

 cattle roping, and riding. Immensely popular, it grew more elaborate every year, eventually topping out at 400 horses and 650 cowboys, Indians, musicians, and support staff. Over time Cody added big-name stars like the famous sharpshooter Annie Oakley and even the Sioux chief Sitting Bull. Most Americans, indeed, much of the Western world, viewed the West, through Buffalo Bill’s performances, as a place of heroism, optimism, gallantry, and success (see Images as History: Annie Oakley).

The West in Art
 and Literature Western imagery and ideas also shaped American art and literature. Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens, emerged in the late nineteenth century as one of the first American novelists generally unaffected by European mores. Twain headed west in the early 1860s seeking adventure and wealth in Nevada’s Comstock Lode mines. The result was his classic book Roughing It (1872). Based on his experiences of the wild life in Virginia City, Nevada, the book fit in with the evolving Western tradition of the yarn or tall tale. Twain’s major works, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), were set along the earlier frontier of the Mississippi River and both contained Western themes of adventure, individualism, and a desire to escape the constraints of modern society for a purer, more authentic world. When Huck Finn sets out at the end of the book to start life anew, he heads for the West. Many subsequent writers like Owen Wister and Zane Grey popularized this vision of the West, especially the figure of the cowboy as the embodiment of American manliness, decency, courage, and common sense. In addition to writers, artists popularized a heroic image of the West. One of the most famous was Frederic Remington. Raised in the east, Remington eventually made his way West where he worked a variety of jobs before becoming a newspaper artist covering battles between the army and Native Americans. Drawing upon earlier Western artists like George Catlin (see 15.4), he painted, drew, and sculpted vivid scenes of Western life. Most were vignettes of the lives of unknown cowboys, Native Americans, and soldiers.

RESISTANCE AND ROMANTICISM



Images as History
ANNIE OAKLEY
Two years after William Cody launched his Wild West show, he hired a woman who became one of his most celebrated performers. Born and raised not in the West, but in Ohio, Annie Oakley was a gifted sharpshooter. She had been taught to shoot at a young age and killed game to earn money for her struggling family. At age 16 she beat a professional in a sharpshooting match. She soon married the man and joined him on stage. In 1885, they joined Buffalo Bill’s Wild West. For 16 seasons Oakley thrilled audiences with her marksmanship. She shot cigarettes from her husband’s mouth and coins from his fingers. She blasted an endless succession of glass balls thrown in the air. 
 She hit a target behind her by holding a mirror in one hand and shooting over her shoulder with the other. No one could match the “peerless lady wing shot.” But as this photograph and virtually every one she posed for show, an essential part of Oakley’s appeal lay in her image as an ideal frontier woman who combined Victorian femininity and rugged, almost masculine, strength. Oakley’s adoring public was not put off by her entry into the traditionally male world of guns and horses because she presented a pleasing and reassuring feminine persona. In so doing Annie Oakley, the woman from Ohio, played a key role in shaping the evolving mythical image Americans held of the Old West.

•


 Oakley’s dual image as both feminine and tough is captured in her facial expression. In all of her studio portraits, she presents herself as beautiful and composed, but unsmiling, to emphasize her grit and fearlessness.

•


 While Oakley radiated a beguiling feminine charm (she entered the show ring skipping and blowing kisses to the audience), this hand-on-hip pose was masculine and expressive of the manly self-assuredness that audiences associated with cowboys.

 Oakley’s outfit was modeled on the cowboy’s, but with exceptions to emphasize her femininity. Unlike the oblong cowboy hat, hers had a broad round brim. She set it on the back of her head to reveal her face and ladylike curls.

•
 Conforming to Victorian mores about proper behavior for women, Oakley always wore a dress and rode side saddle.

•


 She always appeared with a gun, a central icon of how Americans in the late nineteenth century understood the West. It was a symbol they associated almost entirely with men.

 Her many medals were intended to lend her authenticity, as if to say that although she was a performer, her skills as a shooter were real.

CONFLICT AND CONQUEST: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST, 1860–1900

 One exception was Lt. Col. George A. Custer, whom Remington helped make into a hero after the Battle of Little Bighorn. Charles Russell, a cowboy-turned-artist, also emerged as a leader of Western art, producing works that often depicted more sensational and imaginative scenes than Remington’s. Both men played a central role in creating the iconic image of the American cowboy. Russell’s 1897 painting (15.21) is typical of most depictions, showing skilled and fearless cowboys roping a bull.

15.21 The Making
 of an American Icon Artists such as Charles Russell, who painted this scene, The Herd Quitters, in 1897, played a central role in promoting the cowboy as a symbol of the West and the West as a place of heroism, daring, and manly individualism.

 Another key influence on the way Americans came to develop a particular image of the West was the work of historian Frederick Jackson Turner. In 1893, he published an essay, “The Significance of the Frontier in American History,” that focused on a recent announcement by the Census Bureau (based on data compiled from the 1890 census) that the American frontier was “closed,” that is, the United States was essentially “settled” from coast to coast. He argued in what historians came to call the Frontier Thesis that the frontier had played a vital role in shaping the American character and American institutions. The frontier’s importance began with the first settlers along the Eastern seaboard during the colonial period and continued in every succeeding generation as it pushed farther and farther west. This seemingly endless supply of land created

 widespread opportunity for upward mobility. The demands of the frontier, Turner argued, forced Americans to develop a spirit of rugged individualism and innovation. Frontier life also fostered values such as equality and democracy because success was determined not by one’s background but rather by one’s ability to work hard, sacrifice, and command the respect of others. Turner’s thesis proved enormously influential. Generations of Western historians based their writing and research on his ideas about the frontier. His influence also spread well beyond Western history— indeed, well beyond the study of history itself. Some American politicians and policy makers reacted to the apparent closing of the frontier in the 1890s by embracing imperialism to acquire new lands and markets that might make up for the absence of new places to conquer within the United States (see Chapter 19). During the second half of the twentieth century, a new generation of historians challenged Turner’s thesis. One of the leading figures in this “new Western history” movement is Patricia Nelson Limerick who in 1987 published The Legacy of Conquest: The Unbroken Past of the American West. Just as Turner’s article was a product of the optimism and anxiety of late-nineteenth-century American society, Limerick’s book offered an interpretation that reflected the fact that she was a woman raised in the 1960s, a time of social ferment, when historians began to focus more on racial, ethnic, and gender issues. Consequently she brought a far more critical eye to her study of the West than Turner. While Turner had depicted white EuroAmerican settlers as triumphing over such “obstacles” as a stubborn landscape and “a fierce race of savages;” historians like Limerick present a far more complicated story. They emphasize, for example, that Native Americans had inhabited the West for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans and thus had a legitimate claim to the land. Viewed from this perspective, the story of westward migration was one of violence, exploitation, and conquest. New Western historians also stress the diversity of the West, seeing it as a meeting place of Native Americans, Euro-Americans, immigrants from Europe and Asia, African Americans, Mexicans, and Hispanos who contributed to and shaped a Western

 culture that was not simply “white.” Finally, these historians study the environmental impact of westward economic development. This new way of seeing the history of the West in recent years has had an impact beyond the history books. Hollywood films on Western themes also began to change. In the classic Western epics of the 1940s and 1950s, cowboys were heroes, fighting Indians who terrorized innocent white settlers. Beginning in the 1990s, filmmakers began to present a more complicated view of westward settlement, lawlessness, and white-Indian conflict. Dances with Wolves (1990), for example, presented Native Americans in sympathetic terms. Unforgiven (1992) presented the West as a place of violence, lawlessness, failure, desperation, and corruption, where the line between good and evil is not at all clear. Many more such films followed. This reassessment of the West’s history has also changed the way museums and public memorials present key chapters in American history. Nowhere is this more apparent than at the site of

 the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn. For more than a century following the battle, the site memorialized Custer and his men as heroic martyrs who died in the cause of Western settlement. Named the Custer Battlefield National Cemetery it featured a memorial to the Seventh Cavalry and some Indian scouts on Last Stand Hill. Native Americans, who, of course, won the battle, were ignored. But the influence of new Western history and Native American activism led to the renaming in 1991 of the site as the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument and in 2003 the unveiling of the Native American memorial shown here (15.22). Only 100 yards from the Seventh Cavalry monument, it features three bronze outline sculptures representing Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors who participated in the battle. Its official theme is “Peace through Unity,” but it also represents a growing awareness that for far too long Americans relied on an incomplete and overly simplistic understanding of the history of the American West.

 Why are Native Americans so committed to reshaping the interpretation of historic sites like Little Bighorn?

Wonder and Woe
The Rise of Industrial America,
1865–1900
 This scene of industrial discontent, The Strike (1886) by artist Robert Koehler, was inspired by the great railroad strike of 1877. Set in an unidentified industrial town, it captures a moment of confrontation as workers pour out of a factory to gather outside the office of their employer. Unlike most scenes of labor unrest painted or drawn in the late nineteenth century, Koehler presented these workers as sympathetic characters, painting each as an individual rather than as nondescript members of a mob. Many wear square hats popular among various skilled trades, suggesting that these are more established workers. They appear as hardworking and hard-pressed men voicing their anger to the employer, perhaps over a wage cut or layoffs, through the spokesman at the bottom of the stairs. Yet the painting is fraught with tension and an atmosphere of impending violence. Note, for example, the worker in the foreground stooping to pick up a rock. Maybe he is doing this merely as a dramatic show of anger, but perhaps he fully intends to throw it. Note also the scene to his left where a woman tries to calm down another angry worker. Again, it is not clear that she will succeed. And what about the employer? He appears to be listening patiently to the workers’ representative, but whether he will accede to their demands is unclear (his stiff, emotionless bearing suggests he will not). The uncertainty in the painting over both what is about to happen and which side—workers or employer—is in the right illuminates a central theme in American society as it experienced rapid industrialization in the late nineteenth century. By 1900, the Industrial Revolution had transformed the United States from a predominantly agricultural nation that ranked well behind Britain, Germany, and France to the world’s most formidable industrial power. While many Americans celebrated the Industrial Revolution for the unprecedented material wealth and progress it brought, others grew disturbed by some of the grim consequences of industrialization, especially the immense power accrued by big businesses and capitalists and the growing number of workers living in squalid slums. The result of these conflicting visions was an intense debate—much of it vividly captured in Koehler’s painting—over the proper role of government in regulating the economy, the rights of workers to form unions and strike for better wages and working conditions, and the impact of growing disparities of wealth on America’s republican traditions.

 “This association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times…. It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts to our civilization, and which not to answer is to be destroyed.” HENRY GEORGE, Progress and Poverty, 1879

Revolution by
 the Numbers During the second half of the nineteenth century, every area of the economy produced enormous increases in output and value. Huge population increases helped to drive industrial and farm output.

 America’s huge supplies of key raw materials, its rapidly growing urban workforce, and its tradition of imposing few restraints on business enabled industrialization to boom after the Civil War. The railroads quickly emerged as the first big business, followed by steel and petroleum. All three industries pioneered in establishing modern business practices, but they also drew increasing criticism as Americans worried about their extraordinary power.
