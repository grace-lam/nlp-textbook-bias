 Americans responded well to Hoover’s patriotic appeals to conserve food, but whether the government could quell labor unrest for the duration of the war remained questionable. Wilson quieted industrial class conflict by throwing money at the problem. The steel, copper, petroleum, and meatpacking industries enjoyed a healthy increase in profits, once they began selling their products to the government. Wilson also offered industrialists, still bristling over Progressive-era laws that curtailed monopolies and regulated working conditions (see Chapter 18), an olive branch by giving them a role in setting the government’s wartime price, wage, and production codes. Labor also benefited during the war. The government built high wages and union protection into its wartime contracts in exchange for a no-strike pledge from labor. The National War Labor Board (made up of representatives from government, business, and labor) required industries that accepted government contracts to honor the eight-hour day and fortyhour week. These companies also had to pay a living wage, maintain high safety standards, and recognize a union’s right to recruit members at work. Not all labor groups benefited equally from the sudden government attention. Official support for collective bargaining helped the more moderate unions that formed the American Federation of Labor. Radical labor groups that continued to oppose the war suffered when the government arrested their leaders and members for sedition. Even the gains for moderate labor unions proved fleeting, however. Workers received higher wages, but after adjusting for wartime inflation, real wages only increased four percent. When the war ended and the government canceled its contracts, workers lost federal protection for organizing unions. Without the government stopping them, many manufacturers quickly returned to their old union-busting ways (see Chapter 21).



Black Migration
 Immigrants had long provided American industry with inexpensive labor. The war disrupted the flow of immigrants to the United States just when the demand for industrial goods exploded. In 1914, 1.2 million immigrants entered the country. In 1917, only 110,618 arrived. Labor-recruiting agents soon turned to white and black Southerners to fill the void. During the war over 500,000 African Americans migrated from southern farms and cities to the North, lured by high-paying industrial jobs. The African American painter Jacob Lawrence celebrated this mass exodus in a series of paintings he completed in the 1940s. His first painting showed brightly dressed streams of families preparing to board trains through doors marked “Chicago,” “New York,” and “St. Louis” (20.8). Many migrants exalted at their newfound freedom in the North. “I can quit any time I want,” one noted, without forfeiting a year’s pay as in the sharecropping system. Another man realized that in Chicago he was no longer afraid “to rub up against a white person” accidentally on the street or sit down next to one on a streetcar. In the South he had constantly feared the consequences of an unintended breach of Southern racial etiquette. Migrants also discovered, however, that despite the absence of overt segregation or intimidation, racial prejudice existed in the North.

20.8 The First Wave of the Great
Migration (1916–1919)
 “Around the time of WWI, many African Americans from the South left home and traveled to cities in the North in search of a better life,” wrote artist Jacob Lawrence to explain this 1940 painting.

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

 The migration of Southern blacks northward also unveiled regional and class tensions within the black community. Working through organizations like the Urban League and the Young Men’s Christian Association, paternalistic Northern middle-class blacks tried to help Southern migrants adjust to the rhythms of industrial jobs and urban life. Besides wanting to genuinely assist recent arrivals, middle-class blacks worried that migrants’ rural customs might harm the reputation of the entire Northern black community. A list of dos and don’ts published by the Chicago Defender, a newspaper serving the African American community, entreated migrants to watch their language, mind their manners, respect the law, keep their houses clean, and send their children to school. The Urban League had reason to fear that racial rioting might accompany the arrival of black workers from the South. The explosive combination of economic competition, housing shortages, and latent racial hostility triggered racial riots in Northern cities during the war. The most deadly one occurred in East St. Louis, Illinois, in July 1917. In East St. Louis companies recruited immigrants and Southern blacks to undermine union activism. Company owners knew that racial and ethnic prejudices would prevent native-born whites from allowing these new workers to join their unions, which in turn undermined the union’s ability to mount a strike. Viewing black migrants as potential strikebreakers, white workers initiated minor attacks on black workers that escalated into a full-fledged racial riot on July 2, 1917. The antilynching black crusader Ida B. Wells-Barnett interviewed over 50 black eyewitnesses for a report that she submitted to Congress. One witness recalled seeing black men exit homes with their hands raised. As they pled for their lives, mobs stoned them to death. Overall the riot left nine whites and 39 blacks dead and hundreds wounded on both sides. The subsequent Congressional investigation held white employers, labor leaders, and politicians responsible, but 6,000 African Americans left the city anyway.

Female Suffrage
 The war inadvertently provided an opportunity for women to gain suffrage and for the temperance reform movement (see Chapter 21), where women held leading roles, to build momentum. Mobilizing the home front meant securing the

 active cooperation of women. During the war, savvy female leaders successfully parlayed their newly recognized economic clout into a demand for political power. Women did the shopping and cooking in most homes, so the Food Administration needed their full support for its food conservation efforts to succeed. “Will you have a part in Victory?” queried one propaganda poster above the image of a young woman in a stars and stripes gown scattering seeds in a “victory garden” to provide vegetables for her family. Over eight million women volunteered for Red Cross work, producing surgical dressings, sweaters, socks, and mittens for soldiers and refugees. With workers in short supply, companies increasingly recruited women to fill positions in factories, and the government hired many as clerks. In desperate need of laborers, companies in Bridgeport, Connecticut, even hired airplanes to scatter leaflets throughout residential neighborhoods that urged housewives to apply for jobs in munitions factories. Overall, however, few homemakers entered the workforce. Instead, the eight million women already at work shifted positions, taking advantage of new, albeit temporary, opportunities to work at better paying and higher skilled jobs. Suffragists wanted the nation to thank women for their war work by giving them the right to vote. The vision of an engaged female citizenry working to defend the nation reduced the appeal of longstanding arguments against votes for women. In the past the close ties between female suffragists and the temperance movement had led some urban and midwestern males to resist enfranchising women, because so many women supported prohibition. The South feared that female suffrage meant extending the right to vote to black women. Other opponents argued that the male head of the household adequately represented his family’s interests in the public domain, holding fast to a vision of women as primarily domestic, not public, figures. In the 1910s, the middle- and upper-class women leading the suffragist movement had divided into radical and conservative factions (see Chapter 18), and each offered a competing vision of how to obtain the vote for women. For months members of the militant National Woman’s Party stood outside the White House with banners asking “how long must women wait for liberty?” Once the United States entered the war, militant suffragists turned Wilson’s democratic rhetoric against

 him. They erected a sign (20.9) intended to embarrass Wilson as he greeted a delegation from the parliamentary government that ruled Russia for a short time in 1917, before Lenin seized power. Wilson hoped to convince the delegates to keep Russia in the war so democracy could triumph over autocracy in Europe. The suffragists instead focused on the recent introduction of female suffrage in Russia, urging the envoys to “help us make this nation really free” by convincing Wilson to support female suffrage. Daily scuffles broke out between outraged war supporters and the picketing suffragists, whom the press vilified as unpatriotic. After the police arrested the suffragists, the women initiated a hunger strike to protest their poor treatment in prison. When accounts of prison guards forcing feeding tubes down the throats of suffragists leaked out, Wilson pardoned them. Unbowed the female militants burned him in effigy at the White House gates. The more moderate National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) followed a different tack. It presented the vote, not as a question of equality or democracy, but as a way to reinforce the traditional desire of women to protect their families (see Chapter 18). The NAWSA also seized on wartime prejudices against German Americans, whose loyalty many Americans increasingly questioned. “It is a risk, a danger to a country like ours to send 1,000,000 men out of the country who are loyal and not replace those men by the loyal votes of the women they have left at home,” NAWSA president Carrie Chapman Catt proclaimed. All these arguments eventually swayed Wilson. In September 1918, he became the first president to endorse national female suffrage, convinced that women’s supposedly pacifist nature could help secure his postwar goals for a lasting peace. Congress sent the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women the right to vote, to the states on June 4, 1919, seven months after the war ended. Final ratification came on August 26, 1920.

Rallying the Public
 To control the flow of information and shape public opinion about the war, Wilson formed the Committee on Public Information (CPI). Headed by George Creel, a Progressive muckraking journalist, the CPI disseminated propaganda posters, press releases, and films. It translated its pamphlets into multiple languages to reach the nation’s huge immigrant population. The agency also recruited socalled Four-Minute Men to speak before audiences in movie halls, markets, fairs, and churches. The CPI limited each speech to four minutes to fill the time that it took to change the reels for silent films in movie theatres. Creel estimated that 75,000 FourMinute Men gave nearly seven million impassioned speeches during the war on topics such as German submarine warfare and German espionage. Hollywood helped the propaganda effort by making movies like To Hell With the Kaiser, which depicted the German leader as a depraved lunatic who receives a much-deserved punch in the mouth from the American soldier who captures him. The government also used war bond campaigns to win over hearts and minds. Rather than

Teaching Americans to despise anything German had negative consequences on the home front, where German Americans went from being one of the most respected immigrant groups to one of the most hated. Wartime propaganda also questioned the patriotism and masculinity of men who refused to serve. What made these wartime posters effective propaganda? 
 In his war address Wilson told the American people that “we have no quarrel with the German people.” But he also privately predicted that “a nation couldn’t put its strength into a war and keep its head level; it had never been done.” The government soon plastered the country with propaganda posters that relied on negative images of Germany and Germans to rally support for the war. This 1917 army recruiting poster depicts the Germans as savage beasts who raped, pillaged, and killed.

20.10 Tarring
 and Feathering a German American, German-American farmer John Meints from Luverne, Minnesota sued the members of the mob that tarred and feathered him, and they eventually paid him $6,000 in 1922 to settle the case.

 Some Americans took matters into their own hands, attacking German Americans and their businesses. In the war’s most infamous incident of vigilante justice, a mob murdered Robert Prager in Collinsville, Illinois, after he challenged the local mining union for expelling him because of his German descent. When the first attempt to hang Prager failed, the assailants granted his request to write a letter, expecting him to detail a plot to dynamite a mine. Instead Prager wrote to his mother and father who still lived in Germany. “Dear parents,” he wrote in German, “I must on this fourth day of April, 1918, die. Please pray for me, my dear parents.” The murder went unpunished. To protect themselves from similar assaults, many German American families changed their names, stopped teaching German to their children, and purchased war bonds. Germans Americans occasionally fought back. Responding to rumors that German-American farmer John Meints would not buy war bonds, 75 of his Luverne, Minnesota neighbors abducted him one summer evening in 1918. Driving Meints to the South Dakota border, the mob beat, whipped, and finally tarred and feathered him. Ignoring warnings to leave the state forever, a defiant Meints sued his assailants for $100,000 in 1919. He used these photos as evidence of the assault (20.10). After the presiding judge told the jury

 “that the evidence was overwhelming in support of the contention that Meintz [sic] was disloyal,” the jury acquitted the defendants (even though they admitted taking part in the attack). Meints appealed, and won a new trial in 1921. Rather than risk public censure now that the war was over, his assailants paid him an out-of-court settlement of $6,000 in 1922. Besides routing out suspected spies, the Espionage and Sedition Acts also helped the federal government suppress pacifists who refused to give up opposing the war and radical political groups like the Socialist Party and Industrial Workers of the World that had long opposed capitalism. “The master class has always declared the wars; the subject class has always fought the battles,” declared Eugene Debs, the leader of the Socialist Party. During the debate over declaring war, before passage of the Espionage Act, members of Congress had uttered similar denunciations of the rich and powerful. But as punishment for uttering these words in 1918, a federal judge sentenced Debs to ten years in prison. Debs became a hero in some quarters for his steadfast opposition to the war. In 1920, two years after the war ended, Debs made his fifth and final bid for the presidency from his jail cell and received one million votes. President Warren Harding pardoned him in 1921.

FIGHTING THE WAR



Fighting the War
 Germany had good reason to assume that it would take time for the United States to pose a threat on the Western Front. The country confronted significant challenges raising and training an army quickly. In 1917, the American armed forces numbered just over 300,000. Over the next 19 months, however, the military grew to more than four million and arrived overseas in time to prevent a German victory.

Raising an Army
 When the nation entered the war, the government faced the choice of raising its armed forces with volunteers, instituting conscription immediately, or waiting until enlistments began to flag before turning to a draft. In previous wars the government had selected the third option. Wilson, however, chose to implement conscription immediately. He knew that the United States needed to supply the Allies with troops, munitions, and food. The draft gave the government the power to decide who worked in essential wartime industries and who went into the army. Letting individuals decide might deprive industry of its best workers or leave the military understrength once the initial enthusiasm for enlisting subsided. To combat the impression that conscription forced reluctant men to fight, the government renamed the draft “selective service.” Selective service, the government repeatedly told the American public, placed men where they could best serve the war effort. To offer the public a visible demonstration of male patriotism, all men registered publicly for selective service on the same day. On June 5, 1917, ship horns, church bells, and factory whistles rang out, and crowds gathered to cheer for men filling out their draft registration cards. Three million men, or 11 percent of the draft-eligible population, refused either to register or serve. Some went to jail; others eluded authorities by changing jobs often. The Selective Service Act allowed conscientious objectors from recognized pacifist religious sects like the Quakers to apply for noncombatant duty. Those who opposed fighting for philosophical or political reasons had no legal way to stay out of fighting units. The most famous conscientious objector of the war was Sergeant Alvin C. York who, like 80 percent of drafted conscientious objectors, eventually agreed to fight. Choices and Consequences: Alvin C. York, Deciding to Serve (page 610) explores York’s decision to serve in the army. Conscripts ultimately accounted for 72 percent

 of the four million men in the wartime army. Overall, 20 percent of draft-eligible males (ages 18–45) served in the wartime military, 15 percent of the total adult male population.

 “You’re in the Army Now” In makeshift training camps across the country, soldiers trained (sometimes with wooden rifles) and spoke eagerly of getting to France before the “big show” ended. The army reflected the diversity of the American population. Approximately 18 percent of the entire force, or one in five, were foreign-born. Nearly 12,000 Native Americans served, composing only a small fraction of the total military force, but representing nearly 25 percent of the Native American male population. Sixteen thousand women went overseas as nurses, telephone operators, or welfare workers working in army canteens. African Americans made up 13 percent of the military, though they were only 10 percent of the country’s population. The army remained strictly segregated. Black soldiers received few chances to demonstrate bravery or leadership, since 89 percent served as labor troops under mostly white officers. Although they received little recognition from white authorities, these troops built the roads and bridges required to keep a modern army in the field. In France many black troops discovered a more racially tolerant environment where white French had no qualms socializing with African American soldiers. “You now know that the mean contemptible spirit of race prejudice that curses this land is not the spirit of other lands,” noted the African American minister Francis J. Grimké to a group of returning black soldiers. The fear that black servicemen intended to bring the fight for democracy home provoked postwar riots and lynchings that often targeted black veterans in uniform. Determined to fight back against white supremacists, black veterans helped forge a more militant postwar civil rights movement (see Chapter 21).

 Why did the government choose to draft the wartime army?

Choices and Consequences
ALVIN C. YORK, DECIDING TO SERVE
Alvin C. York grew up poor in the Tennessee Appalachian Mountains, where he became an expert marksman hunting wild turkeys in the forests. He spent his youth carousing, gambling, and drinking. As an adult he underwent a religious conversion and joined the Church of Christ in Christian Union, a pacifist Christian sect. Drafted six months before his thirtieth birthday, York faced an agonizing decision on whether to fight. “I believed in my Bible,” he said. “And it distinctly said, ‘THOU SHALT NOT KILL.’” But, York acknowledged, “I wanted to be a good Christian and a good American too.” 
Choices




 Request noncombatant duty as a conscientious objector.



 Refuse to perform any military duty.



 Agree to serve and fight.

Decision
 Like many men claiming conscientious objector status, York faced intense pressure to fight once he entered a training camp. After conversations about the Bible with his commanding officers, York decided that the biblical

 injunction “Blessed are the peacemakers” overrode the Sixth Commandment prohibiting killing because the war promised to be “the war to end all wars.” York agreed to fight.

Consequences
 York became the most celebrated American hero of the war for his feats on the battlefield in France. On October 8, 1918, York was credited with killing 24 Germans, silencing 35 machine guns, and capturing 132 enemy soldiers during

 the Meuse-Argonne offensive. Surviving combat without a scratch reaffirmed York’s faith in God, but on his deathbed he still wondered whether God would punish him for killing men in battle.

Continuing Controversies
 What is the ultimate meaning of York’s experience? Some historians note that York’s transformation from pacifist to warrior demonstrated that Wilsonian ideals inspired many Americans to fight in World War I. With Americans divided in 1941 (before the Japanese attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii) over the merits of entering World War II, the Hollywood film Sergeant York sent the message that fighting to defend the country was a citizen’s Christian and patriotic duty. Others note that York personified the poorly educated and underprivileged conscript who did the bulk of the fighting along the Western Front. Some believe that the army exaggerated York’s feats to boost morale. Rather than a

FIGHTING THE WAR

 To help the army turn this polyglot force into a functioning military force, civilian psychologists administered intelligence tests to soldiers in the training camps. Quickly assessing a recruit’s intelligence could help the army immediately identify whether a man was officer material or better suited for unloading boxes of supplies off ships in France. To the psychologists’ surprise, 25 percent of the soldiers had to take the test designed for illiterates. Most native-born white soldiers had completed only seven years of school. Foreignborn men averaged 4.7 years and Southern black men 2.6 years of schooling. Psychologists claimed their exams measured native intelligence, but the questions suggest the tests primarily assessed level of education, economic background, and familiarity with mainstream American culture (20.11). Tabulated results claimed that the white American soldiers had a mental age of 13, while the average for Russians was 11.34, for Italians 11.01, for Poles 10.74, and for American-born blacks 10.41. Critics argued that the tests only showed that



 immigrants and blacks needed more comprehensive schooling. Social Darwinists, who used Charles Darwin’s ideas of survival of the fittest to establish a hierarchy of superior and inferior human races, believed these figures validated their ideas about white northern European superiority. After the war public schools began administering intelligence tests to determine the aptitude of their pupils, a trend that continues today.

On the Western Front
 The United States entered the war at a critical moment. The peace with Russia gave Germany a clear numerical advantage on the battlefield. As U-boats began sinking Allied shipping indiscriminately, the Germans transferred over one million men from the Eastern Front with Russia to the Western Front in France. In March 1918, the Germans accomplished what many had thought impossible: They broke through the trench stalemate and began marching once again toward Paris.

20.11 Intelligence Tests for Soldiers
 These questions come from an intelligence test on logic given to literate soldiers in training camps. The pictorial exam for illiterates and non-English speakers required that soldiers draw in the missing item.

 The map (20.12) reveals how much French territory the Germans captured during their spring offensives against the British and French. As in 1914, however, the pace of the offensive exhausted German troops, who quickly outran their supply lines. The arriving American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), the American soldiers who fought overseas under the command of General John J. Pershing, played a critical role in stopping the German drive toward Paris in battles at Cantigny, Belleau Wood, and Château-Thierry. In July American soldiers fought with the French in

 a six-week counteroffensive that pushed the German army back to where it had begun the spring offensives. These campaigns initiated American soldiers to the reality of fighting along the Western Front. Men collapsed from the strain of continuous artillery bombardments and the sight of bodies blown to bits. Soldiers diagnosed with shell shock suffered from panic attacks, and some could not sleep or speak. Private Duncan Kemerer arrived at a military hospital in such poor condition that the sound of a spoon dropping sent him frantically searching for cover under his bed. American soldiers soon settled into the predictable routine of trench warfare. The three-dimensional trench shown in the feature Envisioning Evidence: Understanding the Battlefield portrays the components of a working trench. A strip of territory known as No-Man’s Land separated the Allied and German trench systems. The actual distance between the two lines averaged 250 yards. Scores of barbed wire entanglements covered this barren area, which was filled with huge craters formed by artillery shells. The U.S. Army rotated soldiers, putting them in the trenches for 21 days, with a week to recuperate in the rear before their next rotation. Each day just before sunrise, the men assembled and went on alert. If dawn passed with no enemy attack, then the men spent the day trying to stay out of sight from snipers and airplanes that strafed troops with machine gun fire. By feasting on corpses rats grew to gigantic proportions and multiplied by the thousands. Troops became infested with lice and fleas. Adding to the misery of trench life, the constant rain in northern France created a thick, gooey mud in which troops had to stand and often sleep. At night, No-Man’s Land came alive as small patrols scrambled out of the trenches to repair damaged wire or raid enemy lines for prisoners who might reveal valuable information. German artillery bombarded the Allied lines, day and night. “To be shelled is the worst thing in the world,” noted one American soldier. “It is impossible to adequately imagine it.” Troops developed an array of superstitions to try to make sense of who lived and who died in the trenches. “They claim that a man’s shell has his name on it, if it’s for him,” joked Sergeant Harry Weisburg. “But it is the part of a wise man to keep his nose out of the way of another man’s shell.” By 1918, one of

 every four shells fired on the Western Front contained poison gas. Troops especially feared mustard gas, which caused painful burns on exposed skin and was deadly if inhaled. Slow-moving tanks also made their first appearance on the battlefield, but the war ended before either side could exploit their full offensive potential.

Flu Epidemic


 20.14 AntiSpitting Campaign, 1918. Trying to stem the influenza epidemic, employers cooperated with public health officials by posting reminders that spitting spread germs.

 In 1918, in the midst of mounting battlefield casualties, the world suddenly encountered a new vicious killer. Without warning, a lethal strain of influenza traversed the globe. The virus became known as Spanish Influenza because the Spanish press first reported its outbreak. Biologists speculate that the influenza germ began as a mutated version of avian (bird) flu in the American Midwest in March 1918. American soldiers carried the germ to France, and the virus spread rapidly from Europe to Africa, Asia, and Central America. Nearly 25 million Americans fell ill, a quarter of the entire population, and 675,000 died. The virus also sickened over one million American soldiers, hampering the overseas military campaign. General Pershing, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, and

 What impact did the flu epidemic have at home and worldwide?

 President Wilson all suffered from the flu, but survived. Anecdotes of people who went to work healthy in the morning, only to die before dinnertime, illustrated how suddenly the lethal virus could strike. Influenza was usually most severe for children and the elderly, segments of the population with weak immune systems. This flu virus, however, attacked young adults especially hard—making it particularly terrifying. When the flu struck, victims first felt pain in their muscles. Within hours high fevers made them delirious. Most victims recovered after weeks of bed rest, but 25 percent developed influenza-related pneumonia. Already weakened, half of these patients suffocated to death when their lungs filled with fluid, turning healthy pink tissue into blue sodden masses almost overnight. Influenza was an airborne virus that could easily penetrate masks or screens, but scientists did not identify disease-causing viruses until the 1940s. Instead, medical experts incorrectly believed that droplets spread the disease, reasoning that sneezes, coughs, or touching contaminated objects transmitted flu germs from person to person. Physicians consequently devised useless precautionary measures to prevent transmission, such as spraying public areas with a topical disinfectant. Public officials closed movie houses, schools, churches, and office buildings in an effort to contain the epidemic. Masked mailmen ( 20.13) and police became familiar sights on city streets, and masked conductors refused to let unmasked passengers board streetcars. Posters, like this one in a naval aircraft factory in Philadelphia alerted people to the dangers of spitting ( 20.14). In mid-1919, as suddenly as it had come, the virus disappeared, having run out of susceptible human beings to infect. The Spanish Influenza pandemic had a catastrophic effect worldwide. From 1918 to 1919, the disease killed 30 million people. Nine million men died in battle from 1914–1918. The bloodiest war to date thus coincided with the deadliest influenza epidemic yet recorded.

FIGHTING THE WAR

The Final Campaigns
 In September 1918, the AEF attacked at St. Mihiel (see 20.12). The battle reduced a bulge in the lines (called a “salient”), thereby weakening German defenses. Two weeks later, the Allies began a massive coordinated assault along the entire Western Front. The Americans hit the Germans hard in the Meuse-Argonne region, while the British and French struck farther north and west. Advancing in heavily wooded and hilly terrain against dense German fortifications, the American effort stalled. Regrouping, the Americans began pushing the Germans back in October. Battle casualties averaged 2,550 a day, with 6,000 Americans dying each week of the 47-day Meuse-Argonne offensive, making it the most costly battle in U.S. history. “It was most assuredly the Americans who bore the heaviest brunt of the fighting on the whole battle front during the last few months of the war,” the German General Erich Ludendorff later recalled. Besides making headway on the battlefield, Allied convoys also stymied the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign. Instead of letting individual ships take their chances at sea, British and American naval vessels began escorting groups of Allied merchant vessels through U-boat infested waters in convoys. In November, the German government requested an armistice. On the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918, the Armistice went into effect and guns fell silent along the Western Front.



 What overall contribution did American troops make to the final victory? During the victory celebrations, American enthusiasts wildly claimed that the United States had single-handedly won the war. Allied critics contended that the British and French had dealt the final devastating blow on the battlefield. The truth lay somewhere in-between. The Americans may not have won the war for the Allies, but they certainly kept them from losing it. At key moments in the German spring offensives in 1918, American soldiers helped stop the Germans from taking Paris. American divisions provided key strength for the French-led counteroffensives over the summer, and in the Meuse-Argonne campaign, American soldiers leveled a devastating blow to the German army that helped make British and French advances to the north possible. Also important, the prospect of fighting a million more fresh American recruits in 1919 convinced Germany to seek a negotiated peace. The Allies bore a heavy cost for their victory. The numbers of war dead: France (1.3 million), Britain (722,000), and Germany (1.8 million). By comparison, the 116,516 American deaths seem slight. Other figures tell a different story. In the last six months of the war, the American death rate jumped to 820 a day as U.S. troops experienced their share of brutal fighting, fewer than the 900 Frenchmen, but more than the 457 British, who died each day. The “America at War” chart (20.15) suggests yet another way to assess the impact of the war on the United States revealing that more Americans died on the battlefield in World War I than in Korea or Vietnam, both much longer wars.

 CHAPTER 20

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

Peace
 The Armistice ended active fighting in Western Europe, but the peace settlement took months to negotiate. Twenty-seven nations and four British dominions sent delegates to the Paris Peace Conference. Germany expected to join the negotiations, but instead the terms of peace were determined in secret by the Big Four: Wilson, French Premier Georges Clemenceau, the British Prime Minister Lloyd George, and the Italian Premier Vittorio Orlando. The Versailles Peace Treaty (named after the palace outside Paris where the treaty was signed) required Germany to pay reparations and disarm. Germany signed the treaty under protest on June 28, 1919, the fifth anniversary of Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s assassination. In the end the flawed and controversial Versailles Peace Treaty laid the groundwork for future conflict in Europe and raised questions at home about the role America wanted to play in the world.

The Paris Peace Conference
 Woodrow Wilson enjoyed worldwide popularity on Armistice Day. Throughout the United States and Europe, his idealistic pronouncements had raised hopes that the slaughter might pave the way for a lasting peace. Wilson broke with tradition and decided to travel overseas to negotiate the peace treaty himself, rather than sending representatives to hash out the details. As he toured Paris, London, Rome, and Milan, newspapers greeted him as “The Savior of Humanity.” British and French leaders, however, knew that four years of suffering had created a deep-seated desire for revenge against Germany within their nations. The war had also hardened Wilson’s view of Germany, and he agreed to weaken postwar Germany by eliminating its navy and colonies. He disagreed, however, with the French insistence on eviscerating the German economy and military permanently. Certain that America had played a vital role in winning the war, Wilson felt confident asserting his right, along with Britain and France, to shape the terms of peace. British and French leaders, however, publicly downplayed America’s contribution to defeating Germany, hoping to limit Wilson’s say in the peace treaty. At the request of Allied leaders, the British and French press began printing disparaging reports about the American army’s inexperience and leadership. Resentful over the Allies’ apparent ingratitude for their wartime sacrifices, Americans’ postwar disillusionment grew as the treaty-making process got underway. Wilson’s domestic political problems weakened his negotiating position. In November 1918,

 the Republicans won control of Congress despite Wilson’s plea to voters to return a Democratic majority as a vote of confidence for his peace proposals. The reasons for the Republican victory were complex, a result of unease with conditions at home and concern about Wilson’s ideals. The Democrats’ loss energized opponents of the League of Nations, a Wilson-supported collective security organization whose member nations agreed to mediate future international disputes to prevent wars and work together to improve global conditions. Domestic opponents of the League worried that by joining the international organization America would lose control over its own foreign policy and invite international meddling in the Western Hemisphere. They also doubted that the League could maintain world peace. League critics divided into two camps, each offering conflicting visions of America’s role in the postwar world. Isolationists, led by Republican Senator William E. Borah from Idaho, preferred adopting an official policy of neutrality. The isolationists believed that if the United States kept out of all foreign disagreements, the country could avoid going to war in the future. By contrast the faction headed by Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, the Republican majority leader and chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, favored a return to the former balance of power system in Europe. Lodge wanted the United States to help rebuild, and perhaps join, a strong alliance among democratic European nations that could contain Germany indefinitely. Eager to shore up support for the League of Nations at home, Wilson briefly sailed home to

 confer with Republican leaders who were still upset that he had not invited any leading Republicans to join his negotiating team. The possibility of compromise appeared slim. Lodge detested Wilson, whom he regarded as sanctimonious. Wilson returned the distain, viewing Lodge as narrow-minded. Discussion soon stalled. On the day before Wilson returned to Paris, Lodge handed the president a pledge signed by 39 senators who vowed to reject the League covenant in its present form. Hoping to appease his Republican critics, Wilson managed to incorporate key Republican demands in the final League covenant. The covenant now stated that the League of Nations would respect the Monroe Doctrine, the 1823 American pronouncement that the Western Hemisphere was off-limits to other world powers, and allow nations to withdraw from the League. Wilson also tried outmaneuvering his domestic critics. He opted against creating two international agreements, a peace treaty and a covenant creating the League of Nations that would each require a separate Senate ratification. Instead Wilson decided to incorporate the League covenant into the peace treaty. The Senate, he gambled, would never refuse to ratify the peace treaty, even one that contained a controversial League of Nations.

 “With his mouth open and his eyes shut, I predict that he will make a Senator when he grows up.” WILSON’S joke about his infant grandson touched upon his political troubles with Republican Senators Allied leaders also pressured Wilson to compromise. To get them to accept the League, Wilson gave up his idea of peace without victory. When Supreme Commander of Allied Armies Marshal Ferdinand Foch read the harsh demands of the Peace Treaty, he accurately predicted, “this isn’t a peace, it’s a twenty year truce.” The treaty required that Germany pay reparations to French and Belgian civilians for the mines, factories, and fields its troops had destroyed during “the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany.” This war guilt clause held Germany alone responsible for starting World War I. The treaty also forced Germany to



 disarm. The Reparations Committee set Germany’s initial bill at $33 billion in gold, although commissions in the 1920s significantly reduced this amount. The United States accepted no reparation payments and in the 1920s even loaned Germany money to help it pay this debt. The war guilt clause and the reparations bill created tremendous resentment in Germany. In the 1930s, Adolf Hitler cultivated this anger to fuel a resurgent national fervor dedicated to restoring German economic and military strength. Other nations also left the conference feeling slighted. Italy resented the Allies for denying it more Austrian territory along the Adriatic Sea, a humiliation that the fascist leader Benito Mussolini vowed to avenge when he took power in 1922. Japan protested the failure to incorporate into the League covenant a statement protecting the rights of nonwhite nations, helping breed Japanese resentment against the West. In the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, the peace treaty transferred colonial possessions from the losers (the Ottoman and German empires) to the victors—Britain, France, Belgium, and Japan— under a mandate system. In theory the mandate system named a Western nation as a League of Nation trustee for territories in need of political instruction before they assumed the responsibilities of self-government. In reality the mandate system simply cloaked old-style imperialism in the new rhetoric of self-determination. By redrawing the map of the Middle East to expand their global influence, Britain and France set in motion political, religious, and cultural conflicts in the region that created tremendous strife throughout the twentieth century and beyond. Denying Arab nationalist demands for independence, France took control of Lebanon and Syria. Britain ruled Transjordan (present-day Jordan) and brought together three distinct groups—the Kurds and Sunni and Shiite Arabs—who had previously lived in semi-autonomous regions under the Ottomans to form the Kingdom of Iraq under a puppet monarch. When the British took over Palestine, they kept wartime promises to open up part of it to Jewish immigration, angering its Arab inhabitants. Competing claims to this territory continue to this day. The Versailles Treaty settled old territorial disputes in Europe, but the dismemberment of the Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian empires created new sources of tension. The map of Eastern Europe was redrawn to reflect

 Wilson’s principle of self-determination, fulfilling the ambitions of ethnic groups in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia to create their own nations (20.16). But the Allies disregarded the desires of German-speaking peoples in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the new republic of Austria to unite with Germany. These three weak independent states remained vulnerable to German and Soviet expansionist schemes. Twenty years later, Hitler justified his annexations of Austria (1938), and Czechoslovakia (1938–1939), and his joint invasion of Poland with Soviet leader Josef Stalin (1939) as a drive to unite parts of the

The Treaty Fight at Home
 Wilson saw the flaws in the final treaty, but he hoped that over time the League of Nations could modify the treaty’s worst excesses. To counter the initial burst of enthusiasm for joining the League, Republicans challenged Wilson’s idealistic pronouncements promising world peace. “Are you ready to put your soldiers and your sailors at the disposition of other nations?” Senator Lodge asked the American people. The political cartoon Looking

 a Gift Horse in the Mouth (20.17) captured the public’s mounting concern about the League. While Wilson tries to assure Uncle Sam that the League is better than nothing, the Senate carefully examines the mule. Wary of going against public opinion too strongly, Lodge did not urge outright rejection of the Versailles Treaty. He instead proposed adding 14 American reservations. The most important one required explicit Congressional approval before American troops went overseas. Wilson refused to accept modifications. Instead he tried to create a groundswell of support for the League that would force the Republicans to accept the treaty as written. To reignite public enthusiasm for the League of Nations, the president traveled 10,000 miles in three weeks by train and made 40 speeches to hundreds of thousands of people. The political cartoon Ratification Rapids (20.18) offered a sympathetic portrayal of Wilson, shown here using all his strength to steer the treaty and League



 Covenant to safety. In the cartoon a young woman clutches both documents to her breast, symbolizing both the besieged nation and innocent victims of war. Wilson dismissed Republican concerns about sending American troops throughout the world as impractical. “If you want to put out a fire in Utah, you don’t send to Oklahoma for the fire engine. If you want to put out a fire in the Balkans, if you want to stamp out the smoldering flames in some part of Central Europe, you don’t send to the United States for troops,” Wilson told an audience in Salt Lake City. Competing Visions: Joining the League of Nations (page 620) explores the debate between Wilson and Lodge. Pushing himself to the limit, an exhausted Wilson paid the price. On September 25, 1919, hours after he reminded a Pueblo, Colorado, audience that American soldiers had died to protect “the liberty of the world,” the president fell ill. His physician rushed a twitching and nauseous Wilson

 CHAPTER 20

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

Competing Visions
JOINING THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson and Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge debated the wisdom and value of joining the League of Nations. Consider the exact wording of Article X, and then the differing interpretations of it offered by Lodge and Wilson. What changes in American foreign policy does each foresee arising from the League? Are there any points of agreement between the two about the future world role of the United States? Article X of the League Covenant ignited tremendous controversy over whether the United States should join the League of Nations. The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all the members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled. 
 Lodge contended that the League Covenant stripped Congress of its power to declare war in this August 12, 1919, congressional address. We should never permit the United States to be involved in the internal conflict in another country, except by the will of her people expressed through the Congress which represents them. With regard to wars of external aggression on a member of the league, the case is perfectly clear. There can be no genuine dispute whatever about the meaning of the first clause of article 10. In the first place, it differs from every other obligation in being individual and placed upon each nation without the intervention of the league. Each nation for itself promises to respect and preserve as against external aggression the boundaries and the political independence of every member of the league. … It is, I repeat, an individual obligation. It requires no action on the part of the league, except that in the second sentence the authorities of the league are to have the power to advise as to the means to be employed in order to fulfill the purpose of the first sentence. … We may set aside all this empty talk about isolation. Nobody expects to isolate the United States or to make it a hermit Nation, which is a sheer absurdity. But there is a wide difference between taking a suitable part and bearing a due responsibility in world affairs and plunging the United States into every controversy and conflict on the face of the globe.

 Who has the more compelling argument regarding the League of Nations, Wilson or Lodge?

 Wilson defended the League in a speech on September 25, 1919, in Pueblo, Colorado, that recalled the sacrifices of soldiers during the war, bringing many in the audience to tears. But you will say, “what is the second sentence of article 10? That is what gives very disturbing thoughts.” The second sentence is that the Council of the League shall advise what steps, if any, are necessary to carry out the guaranty of the first sentence, namely, that the members will respect and preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of the other members. I do not know of any other meaning for the word “advise” except “advise.” The Council advises, and it can not advise without the vote of the United States [as a member of the Council]. … Whether we use it wisely or unwisely, we can use the vote of the United States to make impossible drawing the United States into any enterprise that she does not care to be drawn into… My friends, on last Decoration Day I went to a beautiful hillside near Paris, where was located the cemetery of Suresnes, a cemetery given over to the burial of the American dead. … I wish some men in public life who are now opposing the settlement for which these men died could visit such a spot as that. I wish that the thought that comes out of those graves could penetrate their consciousness. I wish that they could feel the moral obligation that rests upon us not to go back on those boys, but to see the thing through, to see it through to the end and make good their redemption of the world. For nothing less depends upon this decision, nothing less than the liberation and salvation of the world.

 back to Washington, D.C., where two days later he suffered a stroke. Permanently paralyzed on his left side, he spent the rest of his presidency hidden in the White House. Wilson, the British Prime Minister Lloyd George remarked, was “as much a victim of the war as any soldier who died in the trenches.” The White House kept the president’s illness a secret, issuing a vague statement that he was recovering from exhaustion. For weeks, however, Wilson only spent three hours a day out of bed and saw no one except his physician and his family. His wife, Edith Wilson, controlled all correspondence reaching the president and helped compose his replies. Critics later accused her of serving as a shadow president during Wilson’s convalescence, but she maintained that the president made every decision himself. Wilson rejected all private suggestions that he resign and still refused to accept any reservations to the Versailles Treaty. With Wilson absent from the public stage, opposition to the League of Nations spread. His refusal to compromise doomed the treaty. The Senate rejected both the original treaty and one with Lodge’s reservations attached. The Senate therefore never ratified the Versailles Treaty. It also refused to accept Armenia as a mandate, despite Wilson’s plea to become the “friends and advisors” of a people ravaged by wartime Turkish massacres and deportations. It took two more years for the war to end officially for the United



 States. In October, 1921, the Senate finally ratified separate peace treaties with Germany, Austria, and Hungary (the United States had never been at war with the Ottoman Empire or Bulgaria). Nations that ratified the Versailles Peace Treaty also agreed to join the League, with the exception of Germany, which was not allowed to join until 1926. The League remained headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, from 1920 until 1946, when the United Nations took its place. Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919 for his efforts to establish the League of Nations, but without American membership the League became little more than a place to air grievances. Wilson never regained his health, and he died in February 1924. (Senator Lodge, his unyielding opponent, died just eight months later.) John Steuart Curry’s 1938 painting Parade to War, Allegory (20.19) captures the growing feeling by the 1930s that U.S. participation in World War I had been a mistake. In the painting uniformed men march off to war, slowly turning into corpses before the cheering crowds. The young boy running alongside them fails to notice this transformation, and instead remains mesmerized by the pageantry and excitement of war. Only the two mothers in the scene (one to the left weeping quietly and the other on the right whom a policeman stops from interfering with the parade) understand the true sorrow that war brings to families and the nation.

 What ideals informed American foreign policy in the 1920s?

 On a cold December afternoon in 1926, two young women posed for the camera as they danced on the ledge of a Chicago hotel. With their short skirts, bobbed hair, and heel-kicking dance steps, they displayed a carefree lifestyle that defied the stricter morals embraced by their mothers’ generation. The pair embodied the high spirits of a generation ready to put the tragedy of World War I behind them and move forward into the modern era. Novelists and journalists referred to these women as flappers, an old slang term for young girls. Now it was used to describe independent young women who smoked, drank, danced to jazz, and flaunted their sexual liberation by wearing revealing clothes. Rebellious postwar writers made flappers a cultural icon. Their youthful exuberance and daring behavior excited some Americans and created a sense of moral outrage in others. The flapper controversy was one of many cultural conflicts that turned political in the turbulent twenties. Flappers and the equally controversial birth control movement championed the right of women to take control of their bodies. Other Americans preferred using the government to control behavior. Prohibition of the manufacture and sale of alcoholic liquors became the law of the land in 1920, promising to rid the nation of poverty, crime, and disease. To prevent the communist-inspired Russian Revolution of 1917 from spreading to the United States, the government arrested suspected political radicals and drastically reduced the flow of European immigration. Meanwhile religious fundamentalists argued that the country was morally adrift and launched a well-publicized crusade against teaching evolution in public schools. African Americans, too, played an important role in changing America’s cultural landscape, creating new artistic centers and political movements that challenged the methods of established civil rights leaders. Putting the Progressive Era faith in trust-busting aside, the government allowed large industrial conglomerates to dominate key industrial sectors, such as steel and automobiles. Still staunchly antiunion, some factory owners nonetheless became more responsive to workers’ grievances to reduce labor strife. Mass production, accompanied by mass consumption, spurred the decade’s economic prosperity. Cars, suburbs, and asphalt highways soon dotted the American horizon, changing the living habits of millions. In the twenties domestic cultural conflict dominated political discourse, yet a distinct foreign policy also took shape. Despite its refusal to join the League of Nations, the country remained active in world affairs. By exerting rising international influence through diplomacy and foreign aid, Republican presidential administrations offered an alternative way to maintain world peace. How much of the old order would America jettison or protect as it entered the postwar age? Throughout the twenties Americans held competing visions of what modernity had to offer.

A TURBULENT DECADE: THE TWENTIES

Cars and Planes:
The Promise of the Twenties
 During the twenties America became a car culture. Car registration jumped from 9.2 million in 1920 to 26.5 million ten years later. By 1927, 80 percent of the world’s cars were in the United States. Conflicting ideas soon emerged, however, over how much car-based commerce should transform the American landscape and whether all Americans could be trusted with the new freedom their cars bestowed. The push to produce cars and other consumer goods more efficiently caused industrialists to change how they treated their workforce. Competing visions of industrial work culture between industrialists and workers emerged alongside ongoing clashes over wages and hours. Could man and machine coexist harmoniously?

The Car Culture


21.1 Cottage
Gas Station
 Many businessmen built gas stations that looked like country cottages to assure passing motorists that their establishments were safe and clean.

 At the turn of the century, cities were smelly, dirty places. In New York City alone, horses dumped 2.5 million tons of manure and 60,000 gallons of urine on streets yearly. The car seemed to offer a clean, flexible solution to city transportation problems. Paving the streets with asphalt would remove the dust that often forced dwellers to keep their windows shut. No one foresaw that a fleet of privately owned cars would soon clog city streets, or that their exhaust would become a public health hazard. Although initial expectations focused on the improvements that cars would make in cities, farmers also benefited from the new technology. Tractors made plowing easier, while trucks transported produce more quickly to market. Whole families piled into cars on Saturday morning to head into town, ending the isolation that had characterized farm life.

 A car represented a significant purchase for a family. Cars cost between 20 and 45 percent of a non-farm family’s annual income, and between 50 and 100 percent of a farm household’s yearly earnings. Credit plans required that purchasers pay one-third in cash as a down payment and spread the remaining payments over one year. Most plans also came with hefty interest rates averaging around 16 percent. Besides enriching automobile manufacturers, the explosion in car ownership meant boom times for numerous other industries. To satisfy the unquenchable thirst for gasoline, the petroleum industry underwent a major expansion with new oil wells appearing daily in Texas and California. The building trades saw their business take off, when millions took advantage of the mobility that cars afforded and moved to the suburbs. An acute need soon developed for tunnels and bridges to link cities by car to ever-dispersed commuter suburbs. In 1927, the Holland Tunnel, the nation’s first underwater motor vehicle tunnel, opened between New York City and New Jersey. On its first day of operation, nearly 50,000 people paid 50 cents to drive through the tunnel that ran under the Hudson River.

On the Road
 The ease of car travel encouraged many Americans to take vacations away from home for the first time, and to satisfy their wanderlust, the public demanded good roads through rural areas. The government responded with a massive

 road-building and paving program. Following the precedents set in the nineteenth century when the federal government had funded canal construction and given railroad companies huge land grants to build railroads (see Chapter 15), the federal government now helped states build a new national highway system. Car travelers also needed food, lodging, and gas. To entice tourists to stop at their establishments, rural businessmen erected eye-catching signs and buildings. A revolution in commercial roadside architecture was soon underway. Small clusters of cottages where tourists could spend the night on long road trips, forerunners of today’s motels, appeared in remote areas. The miniature house (21.1) emerged as the most popular type of commercial roadside building in the twenties, a way to assure the passersby that the restaurant, store, or gas station was a safe and respectable establishment. Other retailers used surreal images to entice motorists to stop. An array of giant milk bottles, toads, and hot dogs soon lined the highways of America. The Teapot Dome Service Station (21.2), built in 1922 along a highway in Zillah, Washington, humorously reminded patrons of the Teapot Dome political scandal that rocked the Harding

 White House in the early twenties. The Republicans had selected Warren Harding, an unassuming senator from Ohio, as their 1920 presidential candidate because his easygoing nature and call for “a return to normalcy” presented the electorate with a welcome respite from Democrat Woodrow Wilson’s stern wartime leadership. Winning 60 percent of the popular vote, Harding easily defeated Democrat James Cox, who suffered when he stood by Wilson and his failed League of Nations crusade (see Chapter 20). Harding’s two years in office (he died of a heart attack in 1923, making his vice president Calvin Coolidge president) were, however, tarnished by scandal. The largest scandal involved Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall, who went to jail for accepting bribes from two wealthy businessmen to lease government-controlled oil reserves in Teapot Dome, Wyoming. The enterprising owner of this service station gave his customers a laugh at the president’s expense by selling oil and gasoline in a teapot-shaped gas station. Cars also transformed recreational habits. Ministers complained that instead of spending Sundays in church,

 many families chose to take all-day drives. Cars let teenagers take their courting out of the family parlor and into the backseat of the family automobile, to the dismay of parents everywhere. “The best way to keep children home is to make the home atmosphere pleasant—and let air out of the tires,” quipped author Dorothy Parker. Automobiles also made it harder for town officials to regulate red-light districts, causing one judge to declare that “the automobile has become a house of prostitution on wheels.”

Welfare Capitalism and
Consumer Culture
 During World War I the government had mandated that industrialists with wartime contracts pay high wages, provide clean and safe working conditions, and allow unions to organize within their factories (see Chapter 20). In return for this official protection, the government demanded a no-strike pledge from unions. When the war ended in 1918, the government abruptly canceled its orders and withdrew from managing worker-industrial relations. The government’s handsoff attitude emboldened many industrialists to reinstate low wages, long hours, and blacklists for union members. To protect their war-time gains, unions orchestrated the greatest wave of strikes in American history in 1919. Although they rallied millions of workers to the picket lines, out-matched unions lost this battle. Industrialists accused unions of following in the footsteps of the recent Russian Revolution and trying to spread communism in the United States. These accusations won industrialists the support of local governments, who again forcefully broke up many picket lines. Defeated steel, coal, and garment unions, however, did not give up organizing and continued to attract members. In the early 1920s, union ranks grew to five million, the largest to date. When faced with the dismal vision of unending labor strife, Progressives had crafted government regulation to rein in business and improve working conditions (see Chapter 18). In the 1920s, industrialists used the guarantee of government noninterference to pursue a different vision. Throughout the decade the Harding and Coolidge administrations left industrialists free to fashion their own solutions to such labor troubles, adopting an openly pro-business stance. The Wall Street Journal exulted that “never before, here or anywhere else, has a government been so completely fused with business,” referring to Commerce Department workshops that helped businesses
