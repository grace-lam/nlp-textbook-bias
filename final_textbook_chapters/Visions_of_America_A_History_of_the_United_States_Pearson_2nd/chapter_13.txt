A
Nation Torn Apart The Civil War, 1861–1865
 The Civil War began in 1861 as a conflict over whether Southern states possessed the right to secede from the Union. But when Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation took effect on January 1, 1863, it became a war against slavery. The soldiers depicted in this joyous scene were among the nearly 200,000 African American soldiers who contributed to the Union army’s successful campaign to defeat the Confederacy. In February 1865, a few weeks after the second anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, the popular magazine, Harper’s Weekly, published this drawing, “Entrance of the Fifty-Fifth Massachusetts (colored) Regiment into Charleston Feb 21, 1865.” The image reflected not merely a growing acceptance of slavery’s demise among Northerners, but also the celebration of emancipation as a noble cause, along with restoration of the Union, that helped the North justify the terrible human cost of the war. Emancipation was but one of the many extraordinary aspects of the Civil War that make it the most written-about event in American history. The war pitted American against American, in some cases brother against brother. Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, for example, saw two sons become generals, one Confederate and the other Union. Mary Todd Lincoln, the president’s wife, lost three brothers who fought for the Confederacy. The Civil War was also an unusually bloody war. The 618,000 Americans who died in the four years of conflict far outnumber the 117,000 lost in World War I and the 417,000 in World War II. The war also brought to the fore larger-than-life personalities such as Generals William Tecumseh Sherman, Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, and it produced moments of heroism that would become the stuff of legend. If these aspects of the war explain its popularity as a historical subject, they also indicate why the Civil War has generated such heated debate. For generations Americans have argued over the true cause of the war and why the North won (or as some like to put it, why the South lost). They have debated the significance and wisdom of crucial decisions such as Lee’s move to attack the North in 1863 or Union General George Meade’s failure to pursue the weakened Confederates after Gettysburg. Yet for all this debate, few commentators dispute this fact: The Civil War brought profound social, political, and economic change to the United States. Most also agree that although the war ended the contentious question of slavery, it immediately raised equally challenging questions about racial equality.

Mobilization, Strategy,
 and Diplomacy Neither the North nor South envisioned the character and course of the war that began with the South’s firing on Fort Sumter in April 1861. Both sides had to hastily mobilize, recruit, train, and outfit modern armies. The North possessed overwhelming advantages in population and industry, but the South enjoyed superior military leadership, a white population largely united against invading Union armies, and a hope that France or Britain would intervene in the conflict on their behalf.

Comparative Advantages
 and Disadvantages As North and South prepared for war, both sides believed they would win decisively. Journalist Horace Greeley spoke for many Northerners when he boasted of the president of the Confederate States of America and his administration that “Jeff Davis and Co. will be swinging from the battlements at Washington at least by the 4th of July.” On paper this confidence seemed justified. As the table (13.1) illustrates, the Northern states possessed more than twice the population of the Confederacy, giving the North an enormous advantage in soldiers, farmers, and industrial workers. The North also possessed a vast industrial system, nine times greater than that of the Confederacy. Producing 97 percent of the nation’s firearms, 94 percent of its cloth, and 90 percent of its shoes and boots, this system could

13.1 Union Advantages on the Eve of War, 1861
 The enormous disparities between North and South suggested to many a quick Union victory. But many factors beyond these statistics, notably superior Confederate military leadership, would make for a long and bloody war.

 What significant advantages did the North hold over the South on the eve of war?

 provide the Union armies with unlimited supplies. The North also had a modern railroad system twice the size of the Confederacy’s, and it was far more integrated. A final advantage was the firm belief among many Northern soldiers that they were fighting to uphold the Constitution, and the Union. This sentiment was stoked by a profusion of speeches, songs, and printed matter like the poster The Eagle’s Nest (13.2), extolling the Union cause. Demonizing secession as treason by invoking the famous 1830 declaration of President Andrew Jackson, a Southerner and slave owner, “The Union! It must and shall be preserved,” it also draws on familiar images of patriotism such as the bald eagle and the American flag. Many Northerners believed they were indebted to the Founding Fathers, whose sacrifices won American independence and established a republic where all possessed equal opportunity to succeed. Southerners likewise sought to boost their wartime morale. As the song sheet “Secession Quick Step” (13.3) shows, they often drew on the same patriotic images and themes as Northerners. This song and the accompanying image seek to connect the colonists’ break from Britain during the American Revolution with the South’s quest for Confederate independence. Note the reference to “Minute Men” the “Don’t Tread on Me” snake, a popular image of colonial resistance to British authority in the 1770s (see Chapter 4). Southerners also matched Northerners in their confidence about achieving a quick victory. “Just throw three or four shells among those blue-bellied Yankees,” boasted one North Carolinian, “and they’ll scatter like sheep.” Confederates were keenly aware that although they lacked population, industry, and infrastructure, they possessed certain advantages. To begin with, they

 were fighting a war for independence that carried with it a sense of destiny that would sustain them through the difficult times ahead—just as it had sustained, they reminded themselves, the overmatched colonists in their fight for independence from a superior Great Britain nearly a century earlier. The South also enjoyed an important geographic advantage: To deny Confederate independence, the North had to conquer the South, an area as large as Western Europe. Furthermore, this monumental invasion and occupation would likely unify the South, including poor whites who might otherwise view the conflict as a war to protect the interests of slaveholders. The South could thus fight a defensive war until the North grew tired of the conflict and withdrew, or until a European power, most likely Britain, which depended heavily on Southern cotton, intervened militarily and forced the North to let the states secede. Finally, whether they knew it or not, in April 1861 Southerners had the upper hand in military leadership. For the first half of the war, generals such as Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson would stymie much larger and better-equipped Northern armies led by inept generals.

Mobilization in the North


13.3 Connecting to the Colonial Cause
 As in the North, Southerners fostered unity, emphasizing the connection between the colonists’ revolt against British rule during the American Revolution and the Confederate bid for Southern independence.

 Mobilization of the Union Army began days after the firing at Fort Sumter with Lincoln’s call for 75,000 volunteers for 90 days’ service and the imposition of a naval blockade along the Southern coast. Eager volunteers jammed recruiting stations, convinced the Union would win quickly and with little loss of life. Among those who clamored to join the Army were thousands of free African Americans anxious to defeat the slaveholding South. Yet they were turned away because of an overabundance of white volunteers and Lincoln’s desire to sidestep issues of slavery and race to avoid provoking the slaveholding states that remained in the Union—Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri—from seceding.

 Why did Southerners seek to link secession to the American Revolution?



 CHAPTER 13

A NATION TORN APART: THE CIVIL WAR, 1861–1865

 Unfortunately for Lincoln, the Union Army’s enthusiasm was no substitute for experience. In 1861, there were only 16,000 professional soldiers in the Army, most of them stationed in the West. One-third of the Army’s officers joined the Confederacy. Of those officers who remained, few possessed any real combat experience. To make matters worse, because state officials named the officers to command the new regiments of volunteers, they invariably chose men whose chief qualifications were their political connections and fondness for parading. One regiment, the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry, was perhaps the most vivid example of this phenomenon. As this print (13.4) shows, these volunteers donned flashy uniforms patterned after the Zouaves, France’s famous regiments in Algeria, replete with red silk pantaloons and green jackets. The New York Zouaves enjoyed great celebrity at the war’s outset, and one of them, Colonel Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth (at right), became the Union’s first martyr when he was killed pulling down a Confederate flag in Virginia. Despite their stylishness, however, the 11th New York Zouaves performed disastrously at Bull 13.4 The Zouaves of the 11th New York Many regiments raised to fight for the Union and the Confederacy included inexperienced men whose romantic visions of warfare were expressed in their fanciful uniforms.

 Run. As the war progressed both armies replaced special regimental uniforms with Union blue and Confederate gray.

Mobilization in the South
 Unlike the North, the Confederacy needed to create an Army from scratch. Immediately after seceding, Southern states revived, reorganized, and expanded their militias, many of which were more like social clubs than military units. In March 1861, the Confederate Congress established an army of 100,000 volunteers for one-year terms of service, leading to the merging of most state militia companies into the Confederate Army. To thwart the Union’s intended blockade of the Southern coastline, the Confederacy commenced creating a navy and authorizing privateers to seize Union ships. Equipping their soldiers and sailors proved a far greater challenge. Lacking the industrial base of the North, the South built arms factories that eventually turned out some 350,000 rifles. They also imported 700,000 more. Nonetheless, throughout the war Confederate soldiers often needed to scavenge battlefields to find weapons and ammunition. The Confederate effort to thwart the Union blockade was similarly hampered by a lack of shipyards. The Davis administration also had to pay for the war. Possessing few banks and limited reserves of gold and silver, the government tried several schemes, including requiring individual states to pay for the war and imposing an income tax. When none of these policies worked, the Confederate government simply printed paper money. With more than $1 billion in circulation by 1864 (twice the amount issued in the North), the citizens of the Confederacy faced punishing inflation, which reached 9,000 percent by 1865 (as compared with 80 percent in the Union). Another obstacle to Confederate victory was the South’s popular doctrine of states’ rights. It envisioned the ideal national government as one that left most power and authority to the states. Even though the Confederacy ultimately managed to overcome states’ rights opposition and create a centralized national government and military, its efforts were hindered by vociferous critics. Governors Zebulon B. Vance of North Carolina and Joseph E. Brown of Georgia, for example, opposed the incorporation of their state militias into the Confederate Army. Later when the Confederacy enacted a military draft, they raised a loud protest and created hundreds of exemptions for friends and state officials.

 What made the Border States so economically and militarily valuable to the Confederacy?



 CHAPTER 13

A NATION TORN APART: THE CIVIL WAR, 1861–1865

Wartime Diplomacy
 Davis hoped to gain from Britain and France diplomatic recognition for the Confederacy and perhaps even military intervention. He knew the leaders and aristocracy of both countries sympathized with the Confederate cause and that their economies depended heavily on Southern cotton. Accordingly, Davis sent emissaries to Britain and France to lobby for recognition. To increase the chances of foreign intervention, the Confederacy in 1861 also established a cotton embargo, a ban on the export of cotton, the South’s most valuable commodity. Because

 the Confederacy wanted to avoid any appearance of blackmailing cotton-importing nations like Britain and France, the embargo was voluntary and unofficial. Although the embargo damaged the Southern economy, Confederates believed it a worthwhile risk if it caused enough economic pain in Britain and France to, in the words of one Charleston newspaper editor, bring about either “the bankruptcy of every cotton factory in Great Britain or France or the acknowledgement of our independence.” Keenly aware that foreign intervention would likely demolish his goal of restoring the Union, Lincoln dispatched his own emissaries to Britain and France. Shortly after Fort Sumter both nations, seeking to avoid war, declared their neutrality and agreed to honor the Union blockade. This was crucial to the North because had Britain or France insisted on their right as neutrals to trade with the South, Lincoln would have been forced either to stop their ships—a policy certain to draw them into the war—or allow them to pass and thereby provide the Confederacy with badly needed supplies. Despite diplomatic efforts, conflict with Britain soon erupted, threatening British neutrality. In November 1861, a U.S. warship stopped the British ship Trent and removed two Confederates heading for Europe to press for foreign recognition. As indicated in this cartoon (13.6) from the British magazine Punch, Britain reacted with outrage to the Trent Affair, putting its military forces on alert. “You do what is right,” Britannia warns a bellicose but smaller America, “or I’ll blow you out of the water.” Lincoln, determined to avoid war, released the two Confederates, claiming that the captain had acted without authority. The roles were reversed in 1863 when the British government, faced with a Union threat of war, prevented delivery to the Confederacy of two ironclad warships built in a British shipyard.

THE EARLY CAMPAIGNS, 1861–1863



The Early Campaigns, 1861–1863
 Beginning with Bull Run in July 1861, the Confederacy won repeated victories in Virginia, thwarting Union attempts to seize Richmond, the Confederate capital. The Union found success in the West and moved closer to securing control of the Mississippi River. By 1862, new technologies in communications, transportation, and armaments made warfare more complex, protracted, and deadly. The war also assumed a revolutionary character, as slaves flocked to invading Union armies, eventually convincing the Lincoln administration to embrace emancipation as a goal of the war.

No Short and Bloodless War
 In the weeks following Fort Sumter, pressure mounted in both the North and South for a decisive victory, despite the disorganized state of their armies. Although some argued that given the South’s limited resources, its best chance of victory lay with a defensive military posture, most Southerners wanted their army to take the offensive, believing that one or two early victories would bring foreign intervention or prompt Lincoln to abandon efforts to restore the Union by force. Northern leaders faced similar demands. General Winfield Scott had devised a grand strategy called the Anaconda Plan to slowly envelop and strangle the South, but popular sentiment demanded an immediate strike to crush the rebellion. The anticipated first clash, the first Battle of Bull Run, came in mid-July 1861. General Irwin McDowell led 30,000 Union soldiers of the Army of the Potomac south toward the town of Manassas, Virginia, site of an important railroad junction and a small Confederate force commanded by General P. G. T. Beauregard. Hundreds of curious and confident spectators from Washington, D.C., followed the army, many with picnic baskets in hand, hoping to witness some of the excitement. Beauregard positioned his army above Manassas on the south side of a small stream named Bull Run. On July 21 McDowell attacked and nearly drove the Confederates from the field. Beauregard, however, stabilized his troops, and with reinforcements staged a counterassault. Lines of exhausted and undisciplined Union soldiers soon disintegrated into a chaotic, humiliating retreat to Washington. Victory boosted Confederate spirits and confirmed their belief that one Southerner could whip ten Yankees. For the North the stunning humiliation demolished the notion of a short and bloodless war.

 Within a week of the debacle, Lincoln authorized the enlistment of one million volunteers for three-year terms of service. To rebuild the demoralized Army of the Potomac, Lincoln turned to General George B. McClellan. Dubbed the “Young Napoleon” by the press, McClellan was an impressive but arrogant man who treated Lincoln with barely disguised contempt. Lincoln tolerated this disrespect because McClellan inspired professionalism among his troops and by the spring of 1862, had transformed a mass of inexperienced volunteers into a well-trained army numbering some 150,000.

 “I seem to have become the power of the land. I almost think that were I to win some small success now I could become Dictator or anything else that might please me.” GEN. GEORGE B. McCLELLAN to his wife, 1861 As the Army of the Potomac regrouped, Union forces in the West gained two desperately needed victories. As indicated in the map (13.7 on page 382), in February 1862, Union forces led by a virtual unknown named Ulysses S. Grant seized Forts Henry and Donelson. The twin victories gave the Union control of vital communication and transportation routes on the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers and drove the Confederates out of Kentucky and most of Tennessee. They also created an early hero—Ulysses S. Grant—whose initials, the press suggested, stood for “Unconditional Surrender.” Grant continued south along the Tennessee River to seize more railroad lines as part of the

 Why did the Peninsular Campaign fail?

The Peninsular Campaign
 Lincoln welcomed the successes in the West, but recognized that defeat of the Confederacy required victory over its armies in Northern Virginia. Accordingly, he pressed McClellan to begin an offensive early in 1862. Despite his gallant martial image, however, McClellan seemed unwilling to fight, claiming his troops were not yet prepared. Only after weeks of goading did he agree to begin an offensive. The Peninsular Campaign, as his plan was known, reflected McClellan’s flamboyant style. Rather than a direct overland march on Richmond, he designed a complex plan whereby 400 ships deposited 120,000 soldiers on a long peninsula just east of Richmond at Fortress Monroe, between the James and York Rivers (13.8). To Lincoln’s frustration it took three weeks for the soldiers to get in place. Then McClellan continued to delay. The Confederates exploited McClellan’s delays by sending 17,000 men under General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson into the Shenandoah Valley. There between early May and June, he defeated larger Union forces, raising fears that he would capture Washington. Concerned for the capital’s security, Lincoln withheld a large force of 30,000 that was scheduled to join McClellan. When McClellan finally began to inch his army toward Richmond in late May, he confronted Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston in the Battle of Fair Oaks from May 31 to June 1, 1862. Although technically a Union victory since Johnston failed to dislodge McClellan’s army, the battle proved inconclusive. Yet it was a turning point in the war because Johnston, severely injured, was replaced by General Robert E. Lee. Lee proved a brilliant commander and strategist who made the most of the Confederacy’s limited resources to bedevil and defeat much larger Union forces. Often this meant taking the offensive as in the Seven Days Battle (June 25–July 1, 1862). Lee attacked with 85,000 troops against McClellan’s 110,000 and forced the Union commander to retreat to a secure location on the James River. The week-long clash produced staggering carnage, but McClellan lost proportionately fewer men than Lee, and his army lay just 25 miles from Richmond. He refused, however, to move on Lee’s

 killing a man from a distance of 400 to 500 yards (versus 100 yards for traditional muskets). The key technological breakthrough for the rifle was the minie ball, invented in France in the 1840s. As these photographs (13.9) show, the conical-shaped minie ball (left) replaced round musket balls (right) and were the forerunners of the bullet. The grooves inside the rifle barrel caused the minie ball, when fired, to spiral much like a football, increasing its accuracy. Other aspects of modern war included the emphasis on destroying the enemy’s army rather than merely seizing and holding territory and a willingness to inflict suffering on the civilian population. Military commanders on both sides, however, were slow to adjust to these changes. Schooled in traditional warfare at military academies such as West Point, most were reluctant to abandon the strategy of attacking entrenched enemy positions with massed infantry. When defenders of these positions turned their modern weaponry on charging soldiers, the results were horrific.

Toward Emancipation
 Along with modern technology, slavery also shaped the Civil War. At the outset of the conflict, moderates like Lincoln insisted the goal of the war was to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. They realized that while many Northerners opposed slavery, they also rejected the idea of racial equality. They also feared that talk of emancipation would cause the Border States to secede and alienate pro-Union residents of the South, who Lincoln hoped would overthrow Confederate rule and return their states to the Union. Abolitionists, however, argued that because the Southern states seceded to protect slavery, reunion could occur only after it was destroyed. But while white Northerners debated emancipation, enslaved African Americans in the South

 How did Lincoln expect the Emancipation Proclamation to benefit the Union war effort?

 took matters into their own hands by fleeing to Union Army lines. Only weeks after the war began, in May 1861, an angry Virginia slaveholder demanded the Union Army observe the terms of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act and return his three escaped slaves. General Benjamin Butler refused, declaring fugitive slaves contraband of war, or seized property. The Lincoln administration endorsed the contraband policy as a shrewd war tactic likely to cause havoc in the South. Self-emancipating slaves continued to arrive at Union Army camps in ever-growing numbers, totaling close to one million by the war’s end (see Images as History: Who Freed the Slaves?). In response to these events, Congress slowly began the process of dismantling slavery. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act declared free any slaves used in the Confederate war effort. A Second Confiscation Act in July 1862 empowered the army to seize and render “forever free” the slaves of anyone aiding the Confederacy. That same month Congress authorized the president to let African Americans fight in the Union Army. These measures demonstrated a growing understanding among Northerners that winning the war required the abolition of slavery. The threat to slavery posed by these actions was not lost on Southerners, who feared not only the loss of their slaves but also a large-scale slave insurrection. Slave escapes, rumors of slave revolts, and the increased insubordination of many slaves led to rising anxiety among Southerners. They accordingly stepped up slave patrols and scrutinized slave behavior for any sign of ill intent. Lincoln gradually came to see emancipation not merely as inevitable but as essential for Union victory, since it would “strike at the heart of the rebellion” and prevent British intervention. On July 22, 1862, he informed the cabinet of his intent to issue a decree of emancipation. But to avoid the appearance of acting in desperation, Lincoln waited for a Union victory before issuing this decree. The Union victory came two months later in mid-September at the Battle of Antietam, in Maryland. Lee, choosing to wage a bold offensive, led his army north into Maryland.
