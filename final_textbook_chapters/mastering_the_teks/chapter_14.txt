CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 285
A.
During the Reconstruction Era, Southern states needed to rebuild their economies and to be re-admitted into the Union. B.
Lincoln sought to treat the South leniently by asking 10% of its voters to take an oath of allegiance and have the state ratify the Thirteenth Amendment. When he was assassinated, the next President, Andrew Johnson, sought to follow Lincoln’s plan by treating the South leniently, pardoning former Confederates. C.
One of the biggest issues facing the South was the fate of the freedmen. Despite experiments during the war, the freedmen were not given their own land. The federal government set up the Freedmen’s Bureau, with offices throughout the South, to help the freedmen adjust and to set up schools to educate them. D.
Southern state legislatures created “Black Codes,” based on older slave codes. These limited the civil rights and freedom of movement of the freedmen. E.
Radical Republicans in Congress were outraged by the Black Codes. They passed the Civil Rights Bill, granting freedmen their civil rights. This act later became the Fourteenth Amendment. The Congress passed Military Reconstruction, dividing the South into districts governed by the army. Former Confederate leaders lost their political rights, while the freedmen were given the right to vote. F.
Congress also impeached President Johnson. He was “impeached” {accused) by the House of Representatives, but the Senate failed to remove him from office. G.
During Reconstruction, three amendments were added to the Constitution. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed all citizens “equal protection of the laws” and “due process.” The Fifteenth Amendment prohibited denial of voting rights on the basis of race. H.
During Reconstruction, freedmen, carpetbaggers, and scalawags held power in Southern governments. For the first time, African Americans were elected to government posts. Hiram Rhodes Revels became the first African American elected to Congress. Reconstruction governments built roads, schools, and took steps towards racial equality. However, after Northern troops were withdrawn, Southern states passed segregation laws in the 1880s. I.
Southerners also developed a new economy during Reconstruction. Many former slaves became tenants and sharecroppers, giving a share of their crops to the landowner. New industries developed in the South, especially in larger cities. J.
This period also saw the opening of the Great Plains to settlement in the West. Congress passed the Homestead Act and Morrill Act during the Civil War, giving away federal lands to settlers in the West. The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad (1869) helped develop the West. K.
The Indian Wars forced Indians onto government reservations, while the widespread massacre of the buffalo on the Great Plains destroyed their food supply. In 1887, the Dawes Act, meant to help Indians, failed to respect tribal customs and led to the loss of most of their remaining land. L.
The Civil War provided a great stimulus to industrial production in the North. New banking laws and higher tariffs helped Northern industries to expand. Immigration from Europe stimulated the growth of Northern cities, while workers organized into trade unions for higher wages and better working conditions. Name
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 287
The looming battle between Lincoln and Congress over Reconstruction never occurred. In 1865, only a few days after the South surrendered, Lincoln was assassinated. The new President, Andrew Johnson, was from the border state of Tennessee, and lacked President Lincoln’s stature and authority.
Initially, Congress believed Johnson would not be lenient on the South. Johnson made wealthy planters write personal letters for clemency. One Senator remarked about Johnson: “I thank God that you are here. Lincoln had too much of the milk of human kindness to deal with these dam rebels. Now they will be dealt with according to their just deserts.” But in the end, President Johnson followed Lincoln’s plan of lenient treatment. Johnson was especially sympathetic to poor Southern whites. He recognized newly formed Southern state governments and pardoned most rebel leaders. Many Southern states then elected former Confederate leaders for seats in the new Congress.

THE "BLACK CODES"
Another problem facing the South was how to deal with the millions of freed slaves, known as freedmen. During the war, the Union army had even given some freed slaves land in the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia as an experiment. Congress established the Freedmen’s Bureau to help the freed slaves with food, clothing and medical care.
Some of these agents were former Northern veterans, empowered to settle disputes between the freedmen and their former masters. The
bureau also searched for lost family members, made slave marriages legal, opened schools to teach former slaves to read and write, and organized to demand their civil rights. The new Southern states were slow to extend voting rights to the freedmen. Some freedmen called for Southerners to give them their own land and tools —“20 acres and a mule” — but Southern governments refused to do so.

Freedmen’s Bureau school. Instead, Southern states passed “Black Codes,” based on older “Slave Codes,” in order to regulate the lives of the freedmen. The aim of these codes was to preserve traditional Southern society despite the abolition of slavery. For example, the “Black Codes” made it illegal for freedmen to hold public office, to travel freely or to serve on juries. Any freed-man found without a job could be fined and jailed.

THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON
Even before 1867, a number of Radicals had called for Johnson’s removal, fearing that Reconstruction could never be successful so long as he remained in office. To enforce its program, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, limiting the President’s power to dismiss his own Cabinet members. Johnson refused to obey this law, which he believed was unconstitutional. When Johnson dismissed his Secretary of War, Congressional leaders moved to remove Johnson from office through the process of impeachment. Under
the Constitution, this process involves two steps. Johnson was first impeached {accused) by the House of Representatives. Next, the process moved to the Senate, where the Radical Republicans fell one vote short of removing Johnson from office.
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 289

THE GRANT PRESIDENCY
Shortly after the attempt to remove Johnson from office, Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877), the Republican candidate, was elected President. Although Grant had been a brilliant general, his administration was characterized by weak Presidential leadership and widespread corruption at the national and local levels. His two terms in office coincided with the rest of Reconstruction.
Following the Civil War, the Radical Republicans in Congress introduced three new Constitutional amendments: the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, known as the Civil War Amendments. Their purpose was to abolish slavery, provide citizenship to the freedmen, and guarantee their civil rights.
THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT
(1865) "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any plate subject to their jurisdiction."
Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation has been called a hollow document since it “freed no slaves.” The Proclamation only freed persons held as slaves in rebelling states. Lincoln realized that as President, he had no legal grounds to single-handedly end the institution of slavery. He recognized that the Emancipation Proclamation needed to be followed by a constitutional amendment in order to guarantee the abolition of slavery. Passed in 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery throughout the nation, confirming the intent of the Emancipation Proclamation.

CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 291
One special motive behind the Fifteenth Amendment was the Republican desire to secure its power base in both the North and the South for future elections. African-American voters were expected to support Republicans. Ratification of the amendment actually had little effect in the South, since terrorism and special hurdles to voting were later used to prevent African Americans from voting once Reconstruction ended.

Women reformers, who had been key to the abolitionist movement, were greatly disappointed when the Fifteenth Amendment guaranteed the right to vote for freedmen, but not for women. In 1872, Susan B. Anthony was arrested for illegally leading a group of women to vote in Rochester, New York, in the Presidential election. An all-male jury found her guilty of the election laws. The judge ordered Anthony to pay a $100 fine — which she refused to pay.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
Susan B. Anthony asked to say a few words before Judge Ward Hunt passed his sentence. She told the court:
“Your Honor, all forms of law are made by men, interpreted by men, administered by men, in favor of men, and against women.
Your verdict of guilty against a citizen for the exercise of ‘that citizens’ right to vote,’ is simply because that citizen was a woman and not a man. But, yesterday, that same man declared it a crime punishable with a fine and imprisonment, for you or me to give a cup of cold water, a crust of bread, or a night’s shelter to a fugitive as he was making his way to Canada. Every man or woman in whose veins coursed a drop of human sympathy violated that wicked law, [regardless] of consequences, and was justified in so doing.... [N]ow women, to get their voice in this government, take it. I have taken mine, and mean to take it at every possible opportunity.”
What historic comparison did Susan B. Anthony make to prove her point?
Later that night, Anthony wrote in her diary that the trial was “the greatest judicial outrage history has ever recorded!” Why do you think she felt that way?
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 293
Reconstruction was a first step in correcting the many injustices done to African Americans since colonial times. Republican governments came to power in each Southern state. African Americans held positions of authority in Southern governments for the first time. New state constitutions established free statewide public school systems, open to African Americans as well as to whites. Reconstruction governments built new hospitals, orphanages, roads, and railroads. They banned racial discrimination.
Representative of the changes taking place in the South was the election of Hiram Rhodes Revels. He became the first African American to serve in the U.S. Congress. Born in North Carolina, Revels attended college in the North and became a minister. He helped raise two regiments of African Americans during the Civil War. During Reconstruction, he moved to Mississippi, where he served in local and state governments before being elected as a U.S. Senator in 1870. In the Senate, he spoke on behalf of racial equality and amnesty for former Confederates. Senator Charles Sumner, a Radical Republican, spoke of the importance of Revels’ election: “The Declaration was only half established by Independence. The greatest duty remained behind. In assuring the equal rights of all, we complete the work.”
Hiram Revels (1827-1901)
THE SHARECROPPING SYSTEM
Following the war, plantation owners in the South faced a dilemma. Even if a family still owned a large amount of land, they could not farm it by themselves: they needed workers. The Southern economy was in such shambles that in many instances landowners lacked the money to buy seed and farm implements, much less to hire laborers. To deal with the South’s economic problems, plantation owners and freedmen developed the system of sharecropping as a replacement for slavery. Former plantation owners provided livestock, tools, and land to former slaves in exchange for a share of the crop. Other former slaves became tenant farmers, paying rent for use of the land.
A group of sharecroppers work the land raising cotton.
Their arrangements soon developed into a new means of oppression of the freedmen. The larger plantations even printed their own paper money as an advance to their tenant farmers against the following year’s crop, rather than giving them real cash. Plantation money could only be used at plantation stores, which often charged high prices for basic necessities.
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 295
African-American leaders such as Booker T. Washington, author of the book Up From Slavery, and W.E.B. DuBois, founder of the N.A.A.C.P., spoke out against these injustices. But it would take another 80 years before these conditions were reversed by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and the efforts of leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

The state could then sell this land and use its earnings to fund public colleges that taught agriculture and the mechanical arts. Sixty-nine colleges were founded using these land grants. Although they began as agricultural and technical schools, many of these colleges grew into large public universities that later helped educate millions of Americans.
THE SETTLEMENT OF THE FRONTIER
The American frontier has generally been defined as the line separating areas of settlement from “unsettled” wilderness territory. From another point of view, the American frontier marked the dividing line between areas where Native Americans lived and areas where more technologically advanced peoples lived. Since the arrival of the first colonists, the American frontier had moved slowly westwards. By the end of the Civil War, American settlers occupied the mid-Western prairies and had a foothold along the Pacific coast. Between these two lines was a vast expanse of territory.
Much of this last frontier consisted of the Great Plains, home to millions of buffalo and the Native American Indians who lived off their food and hides. From about 1860 to 1890, these herds of buffalo were destroyed, the Native Americans were forced onto reservations, and the Great Plains were divided into farms and ranches.
THE IMPACT OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD
The extension of the railroads was one of the principal factors behind the settlement of the Great Plains. Before the Civil War, Northerners and Southerners could not agree on a route for a transcontinental railroad. After the South seceded, it was clear that the route would go through the North. After the war, separate crews of engineers and laborers worked from California eastward and from the middle of the country westward.

CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 299

Native Americans Indians had once occupied all of the United States. Native Americans were composed of many different groups, speaking hundreds of languages. The advancing line of settlement and diseases from Eurasia like smallpox had severely reduced Native American populations and pushed them westwards. By the end of the Civil War, Native American Indians nevertheless still occupied the Great Plains.

As settlers moved westward, they killed off millions of buffalo — essential to Indian survival.
Tribes, like the Sioux, lived by hunting the millions of buffalo that grazed the Great Plains.
However, with the Homestead Act and completion of the transcontinental railroad, land-hungry settlers wanted this land for themselves.
The "Indian Wars." Expansion into the Great Plains and mountain regions by miners, ranchers and settlers led to a growing number of conflicts with the Native American Indian population of the West.
From the 1840s to the 1880s the
U.S. military fought several battles, usually in the form of small skirmishes, in an effort to clear routes to the West for white settlers and to establish government control over this vast territory. During these “Indian Wars,” the U.S. Army defeated the Plains Indians and forced them onto reservations. The technological superiority of the federal troops’ made resistance by the Native American Indians impossible. Government reports estimate that as many as 45,000 Indians and 19,000 whites were killed.
THE RESERVATION
Once a particular Native American tribe submitted to federal authority, its members were settled on reservations. Reservation lands were usually smaller than the lands from which the tribe was removed and often consisted of undesirable land. The federal government promised food, blankets, and seed, but this policy clashed with tribal customs since Native Americans were traditionally hunters, not farmers.

Immigration. Industrial growth also led to increased immigration. The development of ocean-going passenger vessels made the journey to America easier, cheaper, and faster for many immigrants. Immigrants continued to come from Germany and Ireland, but they were now joined by newcomers from Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Poland.
Anti-union cartoon showing a competent worker supporting an incompetent one on his back.
One of the main reasons for the rapid economic growth of the North following the Civil War was the increasing exploitation of industrial workers. Gains in industrial productivity were made at terrible costs to workers. Working conditions at factories were often hazardous. Employers hired the cheapest possible laborers. Immigrants were willing to work for low wages. Factories often employed women and children at especially low pay.
The 1860s saw the emergence of labor as an organized force in the United States. A trade union is an association of workers who act together in making demands to employers for higher wages and better working conditions.
The earliest unions were also mutual assistance societies.
Members contributed part of their wages to create a fund to help members who became sick or died. Trade unions were formed on a national scale between 1861 and 1866.
The first attempt to unite all trade unions into a single federation took place in 1866, with the formation of the National Labor Union. However, in 1872 this union disbanded because of internal friction.
In 1869, the National Labor Union was succeeded by the Knights of Labor. By 1886, they had grown into a national organization with more than 700,000 members. Their policies pushed for state and national laws to improve conditions. The Knights demanded an 8-hour work day, higher wages, safety codes in factories, an end to child labor, and equal pay for women. They backed restrictions on immigration, which they saw as competition for their jobs.
In what ways did the further growth of industry contribute to the birth of a national labor movement at this time?
Were labor unions justified in opposing immigration to the United States? Explain your answer.

CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 305
Bom in Missouri, Mark Twain (1835-1910) was the first major American writer bom away from the East Coast. Two of his masterpieces, Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, chronicled life along the Mississippi River. His fictional characters spoke like real people and sounded distinctively American, using local dialects, newly invented words, and regional accents. His honest and candid approach revealed what life was really like for many African-Americans along the Mississippi. As he grew older, his writings came to express the sad view that all human motives were selfish. Today, he is best remembered as a humorist who used sharp wit, comedy, and exaggeration to attack false pride and self-importance.
Mark Twain
AMERICAN MUSIC
The music of America is the culmination of many different styles that have grown and changed over the years. American music has been especially influenced by both African and European musical styles.
Slave spirituals and work songs grew in popularity after the Civil War. Chamber music and parlor songs were also quite popular in many American homes during this period. Stephen Foster (1826-1864) was a noted composer whose songs were uniquely American in theme, characterizing a love of home, work, politics, battlefields, slavery and plantation life. His songs included “My Old Kentucky Home,” and “Oh! Susana.”
In these years, most small towns in America had an amateur brass or wind band. Many of these bands originated in the military. Brass bands were especially popular in parades. John Philip Sousa was a key early composer, who composed many marches. He is most famous for The Stars and Stripes Forever.
