In this chapter, you will study one of the most important events in American history — the American Revolution. You will learn how British colonists in North America objected to new taxes imposed by the British. This dispute, along with other issues such as the Proclamation Line of 1763, eventually brought the colonists into armed conflict with Great Britain. Actual fighting between the British army and the colonists broke out in Massachusetts at Lexington and Concord in 1775. Open warfare finally pushed colonial leaders to declare their independence from England a year later.

By the 1750s, the British claimed control of the Ohio River Valley just across the Appalachians from the British colonies. Meanwhile, the French had built forts along the Great Lakes. They also claimed control of the Ohio River Valley, southwest of their settlements.
War between Britain and France broke out in 1754. Because many Indian tribes sided with the French, the conflict became known in North America as the French and Indian War. French military bases were located in Quebec and Montreal, while the British had bases along the Hudson River. The area between them became the main battleground. In 1756, the war spread from North America to Europe.
The French and Indian War was fought for control of North America.
A
British force captured the French city of Quebec in 1759. This victory gave the British control of the St. Lawrence River. Under the terms of the peace treaty (1763), France lost most of its colonial empire in North America, including Canada and all lands east of the Mississippi River. These lands became British. What was the main cause of the French and Indian War?

THE ISSUE OF TAXATION
Disagreements quickly arose over the right of the British Parliament to tax the colonists. After the French and Indian War, Britain faced a huge national debt. It also cost money to station British troops in the 13 colonies and the West Indies. In Britain, people already paid higher taxes than the colonists.
The British government therefore proposed a series of new taxes on the colonists. However, these taxes were passed by the British Parliament without first consulting the colonists. British leaders thought this was only right because the colonists were not paying their fair share towards their own defense. Since the colonists lived so far away from London, it seemed impossible for them to participate effectively in the British Parliament.
Taxation without Representation. Wealthy colonial merchants and landowners, used to acting in their colonial assemblies with little British interference, resented these new policies.
Colonial leaders were also influenced by Enlightenment writers, like John Locke and William Blackstone. Locke had written that government was a “social contract.” He said the purpose of government was to protect individual freedom and property.
If a government failed to do this, Locke argued its citizens had the right to overthrow it. Blackstone defined the rights of individuals in English law, as well as property rights that could not be violated, even by the king.
Following both Locke and English traditions, Samuel Adams and other colonists argued that the British government should not tax the colonists w nists believed that “taxation without representation” wa
The Stamp Act. The next new British tax was the Stamp Act (1765). Parliament ordered that every newspaper, pamphlet, and other public or legal document had to be printed or written on paper with an official stamp, or seal, on it. This was a form of tax, because the British government was to be paid for the official stamp.
The Stamp Act created a firestorm of protests in the colonies. Colonists objected that the British government had imposed this new tax without their consent. Colonists held meetings, boycotted (refused to buy) British goods, and even attacked British officials in protest. In Virginia, Patrick Henry (1736-1799) denounced the Stamp Act, and the House of Burgesses passed resolutions against it. Samuel Adams organized a series of protests in Boston. A “Stamp Act Congress” against the act was held in New York City.
Colonists produced petitions to the king and Parliament stating their position on these new taxes. These petitions argued that the colonists could only be taxed by their own consent.

Crispus Attucks, a man of mixed African and Native American Indian ancestry, was the first colonist killed. The soldiers were put on trial, but were ably defended by a young attorney, John Adams (1735-1826). Adams argued that the soldiers acted in self-defense and they were found to be innocent. Nevertheless, his cousin Samuel Adams and other opponents of British rule called this incident the “Boston Massacre.” They circulated pictures and used this tragedy to win public support against the British.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The following statement was given by Captain Thomas Preston, of the 29th British Regiment, concerning events on March 5, 1770 (the Boston Massacre):
“... I was soon informed of [a mob of colonists’] intention
to carry off a soldier and murder him ... I sent an officer and 12 men to protect the sentry and followed myself. The mob became more outrageous, raising their bludgeons and calling out, ‘come on you scoundrels, fire if you dare.’ I [used] all my power to persuade them to retire peaceably. They continued to advance. [Someone] asked if I intended to order the men to fire. I answered no.... While speaking, a soldier received a severe blow, and instantly fired his gun. Turning to ask him why he fired without orders, I was struck with a club on my arm, which had it been on my head would have destroyed me....”
How do you think Samuel Adams’ description of this event might have differed?
In 1772, Samuel Adams formed the first Committee of Correspondence with James Warren and his wife, Mercy Otis Warren (1728-1874). Mary wrote a series of pamphlets and satires against the British. The new Committees of Correspondence organized opponents of British polices throughout the colonies. With her husband off fighting, Mercy wrote the first history of the American Revolutionary War using her notes from meetings and conversations. Her ideas and writings convinced many people in the colonies to take up the Patriot cause.
Mercy Otis Warren
The Tea Duty and the Boston Tea Party.
In response to colonial protests, the British again canceled all of the new taxes except the duty on tea. In the evening of December 1773, a group of colonists dressed as Mohawk Indians boarded three British ships in Boston Harbor and seized 45 tons of tea. They protested against the tea tax by dumping the tea into Boston Harbor.

THE STRUGGLE SPREADS
In May 1775, colonial representatives met again In Philadelphia for the Second Continental Congress. All of the colonies sent delegates to Philadelphia. Delegates included John and Samuel Adams from Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin from Pennsylvania, and Thomas Jefferson from Virginia. The delegates quickly voted to join Massachusetts in its fight. In Williamsburg, Virginia, Patrick Henry (1736-1799) considered the finest orator in America, convinced the House of Burgesses to support the war with his stirring speech,
97
Patrick Henry, “The Voice of the American Revolution.”
“Give me liberty or give me death.” Although the Second Continental Congress lacked the legal authority to govern, it boldly assumed that responsibility.
The Continental Congress appointed George Washington, a Virginian who had fought in the French and Indian War, to lead the Continental Army. The selection of a Virginian helped to unify the colonies. Washington proceeded directly to Boston. In March 1776, using cannons captured by Ethan Allen at Fort Ticonderoga in upstate New York, Washington drove the British out of Boston. The British retreated to New York City.
Imagine that you and your classmates are representatives meeting in the Continental Congress. Hold an imaginary session in which you discuss: (1) complaints of the colonists against Great Britain; and (2) possible solutions to the crisis.
THOMAS PAINE'S COMMON SENSE
A variety of colonial viewpoints developed in response to the outbreak of war. Loyalists still wanted to remain under British rule. In the provinces of Canada, colonists stayed loyal to the Crown. There were also many Loyalists in the thirteen colonies. Some wanted to stay a part of the British Empire, but with more rights for the colonists. The Iroquois sided with the British, as did many black slaves, who were promised their freedom for helping the British in the war.
Thomas Paine, an Englishman living in the colonies, published a pamphlet, Common Sense, early in 1776. Paine believed it was ridiculous for America to be governed by a small, distant island across the vast ocean. He said the colonists derived no benefit from British rule. In fact, the British had dragged the colonists into European wars. Many Patriots {supporters of the Revolution) began to demand complete independence.

This philosophy teaches that each individual is endowed at birth with rights that are “unalienable” because they were given to us by our Creator. This idea of “unalienable rights” became a basic belief of American government — that some rights are derived from nature and may not be taken or violated by the government.
•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••a
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
Jefferson argued that citizens had the right to overthrow an oppressive government to protect these unalienable rights. This argument is found in the most important paragraph of the Declaration:
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government....” Briefly summarize this paragraph in your own words.

The Declaration of Independence went on to list the grievances of the colonists against King George III and his ministers. Most of these grievances related to the belief that the British Crown was threatening the colonists’ rights in favor of tyrannical rule.

THE ROAD TO VICTORY
In the first years of the war, the colonial army barely managed to escape disaster. Washington and the Continental Army occupied New York City in 1776. However, the British drove Washington and his army out of New York after the Battle of Long Island. British troops then occupied New York City.

CHAPTER 7: The American Revolution: The Road to Independence
The plan then failed entirely when the largest army, commanded by General John Burgoyne, was defeated at Saratoga in 1777 by General Horatio Gates. General Burgoyne was unprepared because, like many British generals, he held the erroneous belief that the rebels were ignorant farmers who could easily be swept away by highly trained British regulars.
One of those fighting in Saratoga was church leader, historian, and judge Wentworth ChesweSl (1746-1817). Cheswell is considered the first African American elected to public office in America.
The Battle of Saratoga marked a turning point in the war. The victory at Saratoga helped Ben Franklin and John Adams, who had been sent overseas to persuade the French government to supply military assistance to the Americans.

THE WINTER OF
AT VALLEY FORGE
Despite the victory at Saratoga, the war was far from over. The Continental Congress had to leave Philadelphia, which was occupied by British troops. Washington and his battle-weary army spent the winter at Valley Forge in Pennsylvania. Here, Washington faced the problem of feeding his 12,000 troops, and even faced threats to his leadership from some of his officers. Long marches had destroyed the soldiers’ shoes, and warm blankets were scarce. There were desertions, and many suffered from diseases such as typhus, typhoid, and pneumo- nia. Although no battle was fought at Valley Forge, it represented a major test for the new Continental Army.
Washington used his time at Valley Forge to train and discipline his troops. Foreign volunteers, like Baron von Steuben from Germany and the Marquis de Lafayette (1757-1834) from France, helped train the soldiers of the Continental Army. Although the French King forbid him from going to America because France was not at war with England, Lafayette purchased a ship and gathered a group of French officers to help in the struggle. His volunteer service was seen as a major triumph for the American cause.

Cornwallis surrenders to Washington.
THE BATTLE OF YORKTOWN
(1781) After several more years of fighting, General Washington managed, with French help, to force General Charles Cornwallis and the main British army into a comer at Yorktown, Virginia. The French fleet blocked their escape by sea. After a few days of combat, Cornwallis and his 8,000 British soldiers were forced to surrender in October 1781.
The Battle of Yorktown turned out to be the last major battle of the war. Occasional fighting contin-
ued after the surrender at Yorktown, and Washington feared the war might still drag on for another year. However, when word reached England of the defeat at Yorktown, the Prime Minister was forced to resign and the new government decided to give up the fight.
INDEPENDENCE RECOGNIZED
The Treaty of Paris of 1783 formally ended the American Revolutionary War. Under its terms, the British recognized the independence of the colonies. The British promised to remove all of their troops from the country. In addition, they gave all the land between the Mississippi River and the Atlantic, from the Great Lakes to the border with Florida, to the new United States. This move gave the new nation twice the area of the former colonies.
A variety of factors were responsible for the American victory over Great Britain, then the world’s richest and most powerful empire:
.............. • "*"i
THE AMERICAN VICTORY WAS DUE TO MANY FACTORS
hi
Fighting for their Homeland. The colonists were defending their own soil. The British were fighting a war thousands of miles from their homeland.

Methods of Warfare. Colonial forces used unconventional methods to fight the British. They took advantage of hiding behind trees and other tactics. The British fought in a more traditional manner, with soldiers aligned in a straight formation out in the open.
Local Support. The Continental Army received support from the local population, including women. The British were fighting a war on a hostile terrain. Nevertheless, the British did receive support from Loyalists, and used Canada as a refuge and as a staging ground for attacks against the colonists.
Leadership. Washington was a very capable general. He received help from experienced foreign military leaders, such as Baron von Steuben, Kasimir Pulaski, and Marquis de Lafayette. These European volunteers helped turn the Continental army into a more disciplined fighting force.


	
The French Alliance. Volunteers, money, troops and naval support from France were essential to the
American victory.
