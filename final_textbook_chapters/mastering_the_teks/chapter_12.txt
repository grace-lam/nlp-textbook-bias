CHAPTER 12: Manifest Destiny and the Rise of Sectionalism
227
A.
The United States expanded westward to the Pacific Ocean by acquiring a series of new territories. These territories included the Louisiana Purchase, the purchase of Florida, the annexation of Texas, the acquisition of part of the Oregon Territory, the Mexican Cession, and the Gadsden Purchase. B.
Americans came to believe it was their fate, or “Manifest Destiny,” to occupy North America from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Manifest Destiny had political, economic, and social roots. Americans felt they needed these territories to be secure against foreign powers and that these lands would bring new wealth. Finally, Americans believed God had ordained them to occupy the West. C.
By the mid-nineteenth century, the nation consisted of three different regions or “sections.” Many Americans felt greater loyalty to their section than to the country as a whole. This strong regional loyalty was known as sectionalism. D.
The North was the most industrialized. Factory workers produced manufactured goods. Farmers raised livestock to supply food to towns and cities. Railroads connected natural resources with factories and consumers. E.
The West became the “breadbasket” of the country, growing wheat and other crops. Cities developed on the banks of the Great Lakes and along major rivers. F.
The South was transformed by the invention of the cotton gin and the growing demand for cotton by English and Northern factories. Plantation owners grew, harvested, and shipped cotton with large forces of slaves. Ge Immigrants contributed to both economic and demographic growth in this period. Irish immigrants came to escape the famine in Ireland. German immigrants came to escape political repression. Many Irish settled in cities in the Northeast, while Germans often settled in Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.
H.
Northern states abolished slavery. Some Southern slaves were freed by their owners and became free blacks. Most moved to the North. I.
Abolitionists wanted to abolish slavery. William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Tubman were leading abolitionists. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin revealed the brutality and violence of slave life. J.
Some slaves escaped slavery in the South on the Underground Railroad. K.
Henry David Thoreau developed the strategy of civil disobedience, refusing to obey laws a citizen believed to be unjust. Slavery apologists, like John C. Calhoun, argued that slavery was justified by the Bible. L.
The struggle over slavery focused on the issue of its extension into new territories. Southerners feared the North would take control of Congress and abolish slavery. Under the Compromise of 1850, California was admitted as a free state, and the Fugitive Slave Law was greatly strengthened. M.
The system of compromise started to breakdown when the Kansas-Nebraska Act let settlers decide if they wanted slavery, adding violence to the issue. N.
The Republican Party was founded against the further spread of slavery. O.
The Dred Scott decision, holding that African Americans had no right to citizenship, and that Congress could not limit slave owners’ control of their property, ended the possibility of further compromise of the issue. Name ________________________________________________

OREGON TERRITORY
(1846) In 1818, Great Britain and the United States had agreed to joint control of the Oregon Territory, which reached as far north as the latitude 54° 40'. In the 1840s, large numbers of pioneers began moving along the Oregon Trail to the fertile Wil-liamette Valley in Oregon.
Thousands caught “Oregon Fever.” Groups crossed the 2,000-mile trail in covered wagons. After crossing the Rocky Mountains, most of
these pioneers moved to Oregon, but some moved southwest to California — then still a part of Mexico. The trail was often treacherous — over deserts, rivers, and mountains — and more than 20,000 people died along the route.
THE MORMONS IN UTAH
The Mormons were founded in upstate New York in 1830 by Joseph Smith, at the time of the “Second Great Awakening.” They moved from New York to Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois, but were driven out of these states because of their unique religious beliefs, which included marrying several wives. In 1847, their leader, Brigham Young, led them westward by covered wagon to the Great Salt Lake in Utah, a seemingly desolate and barren region in the Great Basin, which
The move West by followers of Joseph Smith.
could be cultivated only through irrigation. Here they found comfort in their isolation. By the time of Young’s death in 1877, 125,000 Mormons lived in Utah.
THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS
(1845) In the 1820s, a group of Americans reached an agreement with the government of Mexico to settle in the region of Mexico known as “Texas.” As the number of Anglo-American settlers increased, the Mexican government feared losing control of the area. In 1830, the Mexican government announced a law prohibiting additional settlers from immigrating to Texas from the United States.

A joint Congressional resolution stated that if any new states were to be created out of the lands of Texas, those north of the “Missouri Compromise Line” should enter as free states, while those south of the line should choose whether or not to permit slavery. Many Americans feared that the annexation of Texas, with its boundaries in dispute, was likely to lead to war with Mexico. Northern critics suspected that the whole project was being carried out in the interests of slavery.
U.S.-MEXICAN WAR
(1846-1848) Shortly after Texas was annexed, a dispute broke out between the United States and Mexico over the southern border of Texas. Was the border to be the Rio Grande or the Nueces River? President Polk ordered troops into the contested area.
Hoping to use the incident to extend America’s borders, Polk declared war on Mexico. Americans living in California also rebelled and declared their independence. U.S. troops landed in Mexico and marched to Mexico City. Mexico was defeated and forced to give up California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and parts of Colorado and New Mexico. In the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States agreed to pay Mexico $15 million for these areas, known as the Mexican Cession.
In the Mexican-American War, more than 1,700 Americans were killed.
GADSDEN PURCHASE
(1853) In 1853, the United States completed its expansion in the Southwest with the Gadsden Purchase. This small slice of territory was purchased from Mexico for $10 million. President Franklin Pierce was anxious to insure U.S. possession of the area. As the railroad age progressed, business-oriented Southerners saw that a railroad linking the South with the Pacific Coast would greatly expand trade opportunities.
The area was seen as the most practicable route for a southern
railroad to the Pacific. James Gadsden, U.S. minister to Mexico, was responsible for negotiating the deal.

Many women and children worked in factories. In 1840, the federal government agreed to the ten-hour workday on public projects. A few states also passed ten-hour workday laws.
THE WEST
The Appalachians had once posed an obstacle to the opening of lands further west, but the availability of cheap land and construction of the National Road and canals opened the region to settlers. Pioneers carried their possessions in Conestoga wagons. After the construction of the Erie Canal, farmers could send their produce up the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes, over the Erie Canal and down the Hudson River to New York City. The Midwest, with its flat land and fertile soil, became the main producer of grains like wheat and com. Farmers began using machines like the mechanical plow, reaper, and thrasher. The West replaced the North as the nation’s “Bread Basket” — growing com and wheat, and milling flour.
By the mid-1800s, the number of settlers moving to the West (now the Midwest) had increased rapidly. The desire for land and new opportunities continued to fuel westward expansion. The region’s fertile soil attracted many farmers. Removal of the Native Americans to lands west of the Mississippi greatly accelerated westward settlement. All along major rivers, towns like Pittsburgh, Louisville, St. Louis, and Memphis sprang up. Ohio soon had more residents than Massachusetts.
Settlers moving west with a Conestoga wagon.
Settlers to the West set about clearing the land and preparing it to grow crops.
The attraction of the West was more than just farmland for settlers — the lure of timber, gold, silver and grazing lands was an important motive for many to endure the hardships of the region. White settlers poured across the Mississippi to establish ranches, dig mines, and farm the land. Some free blacks also came West, convinced that economic prosperity could be found there.
What role did geography play in helping to make the North and West different? What role did technological advances play in helping to shape each of these regions?

THE SOUTH
At the time of the Constitutional Convention, it appeared that slavery in the United States would gradually die out. The prices of tobacco, rice, and indigo were falling, and planters in Virginia were introducing wheat, which did not require slave labor. Thomas Jefferson denounced slavery as despotism, although he did not free his own slaves.
Impact of the Cotton Gin. In 1792, however, the inventor Eli Whitney developed the cotton gin — a machine that combed through cotton and separated out the seeds. One machine could do the work of fifty workers separating the seeds by hand. As a result of this invention, cotton cultivation became profitable. Plantation owners began using more slaves, and the price of slaves more than doubled almost overnight. Over the next forty years, the plantation system and cultivation of “King Cotton” spread throughout the South. It was hard to satisfy the enormous demand for raw cotton from the factories of the Northeast and England.
In Jacksonian times, the South actually had a variety of economies based on its geographic diversity. In the Piedmont and Appalachian regions of Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, families were mainly subsistence farmers, who may have grown a few cash crops. Few farmers had slaves. On the Atlantic Coastal Plain, however, plantation owners used slave labor to grow cotton, rice, and tobacco for export to Northern cities and European markets. Major Southern cities, like New Orleans and Charleston, served as ports for shipping Southern exports.

What relationship do you see between these two graphs?
An over-emphasis on the cultivation of cotton and other cash crops led some Southern states to ignore improvements in industry and transportation. Southern plantations often exhausted the soil, fell into debt, and failed to develop new technologies. The South fell behind the North in the number of railroads, factories, and schools. Southern cities generally remained small and lacked industry.

CHAPTER 12: Manifest Destiny and the Rise of Sectionalism 239
Despite their horrible living and working conditions, many slaves held onto their rich African heritage through music, religion, and folklore. Many also resisted slavery by not cooperating, by escaping, committing sabotage or theft. In some cases, open rebellion was carried out. Nat Turner’s Rebellion in 1831 caused a wave of fear among slave owners. The uprising terrorized white Southerners. As a result, Southern lawmakers passed stricter regulations, tightly controlling the activities of both enslaved and free blacks.
THE FREE BLACKS
Benjamin Franklin and others organized an end to slavery in Pennsylvania, which became the first state to abolish it in 1780. Most other Northern states passed laws gradually eliminating slavery, while many Southern states then passed laws making it easier for slave owners to free individual slaves.
After the American Revolution, thousands of slaves were freed. In 1800, there were already 100,000 free blacks in the United States, while by 1810, three-quarters of the African Americans in the North were free. On the eve of the Civil War, about ten percent of African Americans in the United States, about a half a million people, were free.
Even free blacks however, lived in an atmosphere of racial prejudice. Some stayed in Southern cities where they became skilled craftsmen. A large number moved to the North, especially to port towns, where they worked in dockyards or opened shops in their own neighborhoods. Free African Americans also opened their own churches, which became centers for education and community life. Discrimination against free blacks increased as white workers began facing new competition from immigrant laborers. In the South, free blacks had few legal rights.
By the mid-1800s, each of these sections of the country had developed its own distinctive way of life. These differences led to sectionalism — the greater loyalty many Americans felt toward their own section than to the country as a whole. In particular, Southerners felt their way of life was being threatened by the North. Northerners feared the South wanted to spread slavery throughout the nation. The North’s focus was on business and industry, as they concentrated on manufacturing, shipping, and trading goods. By contrast, the South’s economy centered around plantations, cash crops, and steady agricultural growth.

Frederick Douglass (1818-1895)
Abolitionists believed that slavery was morally wrong and wanted to end it. In the decades leading up to the Civil War, abolitionist leaders were men and women of high moral purpose and courage who sought to make the issue of slavery a focus of national politics. At first, most abolitionists were widely denounced. Mobs sometimes attacked them even in the North. Southerners burned antislavery pamphlets and excluded them from the mails. The U.S. Congress imposed the “gag rule” to avoid considering abolitionist petitions. John Quincy Adams, who had returned to Congress after his term as President, spent much of the final years of his political life fighting against this gag rule.
In 1833, the British Empire abolished slavery. By 1838, more than 1,350 antislavery societies existed in the United States with almost 250,000 members. The book Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1853) by Harriet Beecher Stowe depicted the evils of slavery and stirred the public conscience of the North.
William Lloyd Garrison and other abolitionists, including former slaves Harriet Tubmann and Frederick Douglass, published anti-slavery writings and delivered speeches throughout the North. They were also active in the “Underground Railroad,” which helped many fugitive slaves to escape to Canada.
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879)
William Lloyd Garrison was a prominent abolitionist who started his own newspaper, The Liberator, in 1831. The passage below appeared in Vol. 1, No. 1:
“I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject [abolition of slavery] I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation. No! No! Tell a man whose house is on fire, to give a moderate alarm; tell the mother to gradually [pull] her baby from the fire into which it has fallen; — but urge me not to use moderation in this cause. I will not [hesitate] — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD. The apathy of the people is enough to make every statue leap from its pedestal, and to hasten the resurrection of the dead....”

Escaping along the Underground Railroad.
The Underground Railroad. Some slaves escaped from the South with the help of the Underground Railroad — a vast network of people who helped fugitive slaves escape to the North or Canada (where slavery had been abolished). People allowed the escaping fugitives to rest in their bams, cellars, or houses.
These safe places were called “stations.”
The fugitive slaves usually moved by foot at night, helped on their journey by a “conductor.” They took advantage of the protection offered by nature, by hiding in swamps, bayous, forests, and waterways. They would
generally travel 10 to 20 miles, until they reached the next station. There they would rest and eat, hiding in bams and other out-of-the-way places until they moved on to the next station. Some runaways sought refuge in cities such as Baltimore and New Orleans, where they tried to blend in with free blacks living there.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR.
HISTORIAN____________________________t This passage by Frederick Douglass was taken from his book, My Escape from Slavery. Douglass was a gifted writer and speaker. In this passage, he describes his escape from slavery and how dehumanizing slavery was:
“Though I was not a murderer fleeing from justice, I felt perhaps quite as miserable as such a criminal. The train was moving at a very high rate of speed for that [period] of railroad travel, but to my anxious mind it was moving far too slowly. Minutes were hours, and hours were days during this part of my flight. After Maryland, I was to pass through Delaware — another slave state, where slave-catchers awaited their prey, for it was not in the interior of the state, but its borders, that these human hounds were most vigilant and active. The border lines between slavery and freedom were the dangerous ones for the fugitives....”
Why did Douglass fear when he came to a border crossing?

Founding of the Republican Party (1854). Critics of the Kansas-Nebraska Act formed a new political party, the Republican Party. Republicans agreed to let slavery continue in the South, but they opposed any further extension of slavery into any of the new territories.
Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857). A Southern slave, Dred Scott, was taken by his owner to the North and then back into slavery in the South. Scott sued for his freedom. Having been on free soil, he argued that he could not be taken back into slavery.
Decision/Significance. In 1857, Chief Justice Roger Taney read the Supreme Court’s decision As a “descendant of African bom slaves,” Dred Scott was declared to be a non-citizen, and therefore was not entitled to bring a lawsuit before the court. Taney further asserted that Africans could never become U.S. citizens since Africans were not included when the Constitution was written. Taney then ruled that slaves were property, and that Congress had no right to take away a slaveholder’s property. This meant that Congress could not lawfully prohibit slavery in new territories: since slavery was still legal, the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was unconstitutional. Chief Justice Taney’s ruling meant that slavery could spread.
Dred Scott
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR.
HISTORIAN_________________________________t In 1857, 80-year-old Chief Justice Taney was a Southern supporter of slavery who was intent on protecting Southerners from attacks by abolitionists. In delivering the Court’s majority opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford, he said:
“[African Americans] had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit. He was bought and sold and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise, whenever profit could be made by it. [Referring to language in the Declaration of Independence] it is too clear for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed and adopted this declaration....”
Most abolitionists were enraged at this decision, but Frederick Douglass found a bright side, believing that the decision would bring slavery to the attention of the nation and would be a step toward its ultimate destruction. Was Douglass justified in his optimism about the case?
Lincoln-Douglas Debates. The Dred Scott decision questioned the power of Congress to control the spread of slavery. In 1858, Lincoln challenged Senator Stephen Douglas, author of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, to a series of formal debates. Douglas had introduced the doctrine of popular sovereignty to the slavery question.
