Questions
What differences existed between the main regions of the thirteen colonies? What was life like in Colonial America?
What factors contributed to religious freedom in the thirteen colonies?
How did the economic system of mercantilism affect the thirteen colonies?
A.
Different patterns of life developed in three regions of the colonies, based on differences in geography, climate, settler origins, and economic activities. B.
In New England, a short growing season, cooler climates, rocky soil, and an influx of Puritan settlers encouraged the development of small farms and the growth of fishing, shipping, and handicraft trades. C.
In the Southern Colonies, a long growing season and warmer climate, as well as the arrival of mainly Anglican settlers seeking to make their fortune, encouraged the development of larger farms that often grew cash crops for sale to England. Along main water routes, large plantations developed. D.
Part of the Southern Colonies’ economy was based on slave labor. Slaves grew cotton, tobacco, rice and indigo. They were taken by force from Africa and faced a horrific “Middle Passage” journey across the Atlantic. Most Southerners, however, did not own slaves. E.
The Middle Atlantic Colonies had greater ethnic and religious diversity than either New England or the Southern Colonies. Some of these colonies had once been under Dutch rule and were conquered by the English in 1664. The Middle Atlantic Colonies had fertile soil and grew food crops. Name

NEW ENGLAND
The colonies of New England —
Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Connecticut, and Rhode Island — had rocky soil and less fertile land. Since the New England Colonies were the farthest north, they had longer winters and a colder climate than the other colonies. Many New Englanders had small farms where they grew crops for their own use.
Others used the forests in the region for lumber and building ships. These colonies were located near the ocean where there was an abundance of whales and fish. Large numbers of New Englanders became sailors, fishermen, and merchants. The practice of religion, especially Puritanism, also remained important in New England.
New Englanders frequently owned and manned ships. They carried sugar from the West Indies to New England, where it was turned into rum. The rum was carried to
Africa, where it was traded for slaves. New England merchants also carried sugar from the West Indies to England. Their ships were then loaded with manufactured goods and sailed back to New England. You will learn more about these “triangular trades” later in this chapter.

THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC COLONIES
The Middle Atlantic Colonies —
New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania— were located between New England and the Southern Colonies. Winters were not as harsh as in New England and summers were longer. Uncleared forests and fertile soils attracted many colonists to this area.
Most of the settlers came from the Netherlands (Holland), Germany, Swe-
den, France, and Scotland. Settlers first	The first job of the colonial farmer was to clear the land.
focused on cutting down the trees and removing stones and stumps from the soil so that it could be prepared for planting. The forests of the Middle Atlantic Colonies gave birth to an active lumbering and shipbuilding industry.

CHAPTER 6: Life in Colonial America 67
The main crops planted on a plantation were very labor intensive. A successful harvest depended on slaves working from sunrise to sunset. Women usually worked the same hours as the men. Women were expected to return to the fields not long after giving birth to children. The mortality (death) rate among slaves was high. Slave women were encouraged to have large numbers of children to replace slave losses. The great majority of whites did not live on plantations. They often farmed their land on a smaller scale.

CHAPTER 6: Life in Colonial America 69
The colonists enjoyed several institutions of representative government based on both English political traditions and new practices that emerged in the colonies.
During the Middle Ages, England had developed traditions of liberty and limited self-government that were unique in Europe.
MAGNA CARTA
In 1215, the English king was forced by his barons to promise not to take away any free man’s property or to imprison any free man without following procedures established by the laws of the land. The “Great Charter” guaranteed individuals the right to a fair trial by their peers and forced the king to obtain the consent of a council of nobles before imposing any new taxes.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR.
HISTORIAN__________________________t “Clause 29. No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or [have] his Freehold, or Liberties [taken away], or be outlawed, or [sent away], or any other wise destroyed; nor will We pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers [equals], or by the Law of the land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.”
How did Clause 29 of the Magna Carta help to guarantee the rights of individuals living in England?
Why did this become an important feature of political life in the colonies?
THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT
In the Middle Ages, the English king summoned his nobles and representatives from counties and towns to show support for the crown. Parliament developed into a national legislature consisting of nobles and elected representatives. New taxes had to be approved by Parliament. After two revolutions in the 1600s, Parliament achieved supremacy over the king.
BILL OF RIGHTS OF
1689 After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the rights of English subjects were confirmed by the Bill of Rights of 1689. England’s rulers agreed not to have a standing army or to impose new taxes without the permission of Parliament. The English Bill of Rights also guaranteed trial by jury, the right to petition Parliament, and other personal freedoms, as well as freedom of speech and debate in Parliament.

New York’s Governor put Zenger on trial. Zenger won his case when his lawyer, Andrew Hamilton, showed that his statements were true. The case established the right of the press to criticize those in power, so long as the writer told the truth.
What important individual rights and beliefs about government did the colonists bring from England?
What additional representative institutions did the American colonists create?
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN_____________________
Select one of the thirteen colonies and conduct research on the Internet or at school or your local library on how that colony’s government operated. Include information on who ran the colony, how laws were made, and if the colony had its own court system.
The colonies also saw the growth of religious freedom. The first two English colonies had people of very different religious backgrounds. Virginia was mainly founded by Anglicans — those who belonged to the Church of England. Massachusetts was founded by Pilgrims and Puritans — members of Protestant groups who came to the Americas to worship God in their own way.
In Massachusetts Bay Colony, Puritans originally set high standards for Church membership. They wanted to promote virtue (goodness). Puritans thought the members of their Church were chosen by God, and that only those “Elected” would go to Heaven. Each Sunday was a day of rest in which the whole community went to church. The minister often gave a sermon threatening sinners with the punishment of damnation after death.
Puritans wore simple, plain clothing. Observe the woman carrying a Bible.
The Puritans believed that a state-endorsed religion would insure a bond between members of society, helping to maintain order and stability. They felt that having more than one religion might threaten social stability. Although they came to America to worship God in their own way, they did not support religious toleration for others.

CHAPTER 6: Life in Colonial America 73

The importance of religion to the colonists was illustrated by the Great Awakening of the 1740s. Ministers emphasized the importance of religious feelings. During the Great Awakening, preachers like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield often addressed large crowds in open fields. They told listeners that God was merciful and that people could save themselves from damnation by repenting for their sins. Colonists were told to study the Bible for themselves and many became more emotionally engaged in religion. The Great Awakening emphasized people’s equality in the eyes of God. The preachers of the Great Awakening were also strong supporters of religious free-
dom and toleration. They wanted their listeners to accept Christianity as an act of free will.
Whitefield, preaching.

Conduct research on the Internet or in your local library about the development of religious toleration in the American colonies. Select one colony and summarize how it treated religious differences and beliefs in a written report.
MERCANTILISM
The economy of the British colonies was based on mercantilism. Under this economic system, Parliament passed laws controlling the trade of the colonies in order to benefit the “Mother Country.” The aim was to get more gold and silver. Under mercantilism, colonists were expected to sell their raw materials, such as tobacco, rice, fur, and fish, at low prices to Britain.
In exchange, the colonists were supposed to buy British manufactured products, such as glass, paper, and tea, which were more expensive. Mercantilists believed
this unequal trade would increase the wealth of the “Mother Country.”

CHAPTER 6: Life in Colonial America 75
COLONIAL SOCIETY
Colonial society was divided into several social groups. A handful of wealthy landowners and merchants stood at the top of colonial society; then came independent farmers who worked their own land; tradesmen, shopkeepers, and craftsmen working in towns and villages came next; apprentices or servants were below them; and at the very bottom of the colonial social ladder were unskilled laborers and slaves.
SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE TRADE
One of the areas of greatest hardship and profit in colonial society was the slave trade. No concern was given to the feelings or comfort of the victims of this trade. “Slavers” usually bought captured Africans on the West Coast of Africa and put them on slave ships for the voyage to the Americas. Enslaved Africans were treated so harshly that many failed to survive the voyage. Traders were so greedy they sought to carry as many slaves as possible on their ships. Slaves were chained and crammed together below the deck, where sitting or standing room was limited. The air below deck was so stifling that some suffocated. Others tried to starve themselves or to jump over board. When the slaves reached the Americas, they were sold off in auctions. Families were broken up.
Captured Africans experienced horrific conditions on the “Middle Passage.”
Enslaved people made up a significant part of the population of Colonial America. The number of Africans in New England grew from under 1,000 in 1700 to about 16,000 in the 1770s. The number of slaves in the South was far greater, reaching 125,000 by 1740. Enslaved men and women were owned by plantation owners, farmers, ministers, doctors, and merchants. They were used to perform household chores and skilled jobs as well as field labor.

HISTORIAN__________________________t Cotton Mather was instrumental in influencing American religion and in starting the First Great Awakening. His writings gave advice to young ministers on a wide range of topics such as performing virtuous acts, poetry, music, and writing style. This passage deals with educating young people:
“Where [Godly] schools are not vigorously encouraged, whole colonies will sink into a degenerate and contemptible condition, and become horribly barbarous. You will therefore pardon my freedom with you, if I address you in the words of Luther: 'If ever there be any considerable blow given to the Devil’s Kingdom, it must be by youth excellently educated. It is a serious thing, a weighty thing, and a thing that hath much of the interest of Christianity in it, that youth be well-trained, and that schools, and school-masters be maintained. Learning is an unwelcome guest to the Devil, and therefore he would fain starve it out.”’ What did Mather think might happen if colonists failed to educate their youth? Why did Mather choose to quote the words of Martin Luther?
Some of the earliest colonial writers were women, like Anne Bradstreet (1612-1672), who wrote poems. Her poetry eloquently expressed the concerns of a Puritan wife and mother. She is considered by many to be the first American poet. Her collection of poems was the first book written by a woman to be published in the United States. She helped lay the groundwork for other female writers in an era when most women tended to family and domestic matters.
Benjamin Franklin (1706 -1790) was a printer, publisher, and scientist who became popular with the stories and sayings in Poor Richard’s Almanac, begun in 1733, and in his Autobiography (1777). Franklin openly admitted that many of the sayings in Poor Richard were borrowed, rather than coined by himself. Franklin once stated: “Why give my readers bad lines of my own, when good ones of other people’s are so plentiful?” Nevertheless, these sayings, taken from “many Ages and Nations,” became one of the bases for
Franklin’s international fame.
Phillis Wheatley (1753-1784), was an African who was kidnapped and brought to the colonies as a slave at the age of seven. She soon learned to speak and write English, taught by the daughter of her owner; within 16 months she could read difficult passages in the Bible. She became a sensation in the 1760s when her poem on the death of the preacher George Whitefield made her famous. A constant theme running through her poetry was that of Christian salvation.
