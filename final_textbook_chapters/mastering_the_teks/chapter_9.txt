CHAPTER 9: The Rights and Responsibilities of American Citizens 143
A.
Anti-Federalists criticized the Constitution for the absence of a “Bill of Rights.” The first Congress proposed ten amendments. These amendments were added to the Constitution in 1791 as the Bill of Rights. B.
The First Amendment guarantees freedom of religion, free speech, freedom of the press, the right to assemble, and the right to petition the government. It also states that the Congress shall not establish any religion. C.
These First Amendment rights are crucial to our democracy. They allow us to criticize government officials and debate issues without fear of government reprisals. Few of these rights, however, are absolute. Government can place reasonable limits on these freedoms. For example we cannot scream fire in a crowded theatre as a joke. D.
The Second Amendment guarantees our right to “bear arms.” This allows citizens to own guns. The Third Amendment prohibits government from quartering troops in our homes without consent. These rights arose out of circumstances that developed during the American Revolutionary War. E.
The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments protect individuals accused of a crime from unjust accusations and government abuse. F.
The Fourth Amendment prevents the police from conducting “unreasonable searches and seizures.” Unless a specific exception applies, the police need a search warrant before they can conduct a search. G.
The Fifth Amendment states that individuals cannot be tried twice for the same crime, or be forced to incriminate themselves. H.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees those accused of a crime a fair and public trial by a jury and the assistance of a lawyer. J.
The Eighth Amendment prevents judges from setting bail that is too high, or inflicting “cruel and unusual” punishments. K.
The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not granted to the federal government to the state governments and the people. L.
The Bill of Rights protected individuals from abuse by the federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals from actions carried out by state governments. It grants citizens “due process” and “equal protection” of the law. M.
Anyone bom in the United States or with U.S. citizens as parents is a citizen of the United States. A foreigner can become a naturalized citizen. To become naturalized, a person must be 18 years old, live in the United States for 5 years, be of good moral character, pass a test on U.S. history and government, and take an oath of allegiance to the U.S. Constitution. N. U.S.
citizens had additional rights and responsibilities beyond those specified in the Bill of Rights. They are able to vote, to serve on juries, and to hold public office. They should try to remain informed on public issues and to participate actively in public life. Name______________________________________________________________
CHAPTER 9: The Rights and Responsibilities of American Citizens 145

One of the most important amendments in the Bill of Rights was the First Amendment:
The First Amendment actually covers several rights at the same time:
Let’s look at each of these rights more closely.
FREEDOM OF RELIGION
It is no mistake that a guarantee of religious freedom is stated at the start of the First Amendment. From the very beginning, many people had migrated to the American colonies for the freedom to practice their own religious beliefs.
The First Amendment guarantees individuals the right to freely engage in any religious practices that do not directly harm other individuals. In many countries in Europe at that time, there was an established religion supported by the government. The First Amendment
states that Congress will not “establish a religion.” This is sometimes called the establishment clause. While the ban on government involvement in religion seems clear, there have been instances in which the proper role of government has been debated. For example, it is clear that Congress cannot pass a law saying that a particular religion is the established religion of the United States. Nor can Congress vote to give money to a particular church or religious group. But can public schools have prayers in school? The Supreme Court, which has the role of interpreting these amendments, has said no.
Some limited government activity concerned with religion has been declared “constitutional” by the Supreme Court. For example, the Supreme Court has said that a state can pay for bus transportation to students who choose to go to a full-time religious school. This is to support the expenses of these students’ general education. However, because government cannot “establish” a religion, there can be no religious activities, such as prayers, in public schools.

CHAPTER 9: The Rights and Responsibilities of American Citizens 147
THE RIGHT OF ASSEMBLY
In some countries, people cannot peacefully gather to protest against government policies without fear of punishment. If they gather or demonstrate, they fear they might be beaten, arrested, imprisoned, or even killed. The First Amendment states that Congress cannot deny individuals the right to “peacefully assemble.” This means that people have a right to gather peaceably with others without fear that the government will use force against them. In a democracy, many groups and organizations often use the right to “peacefully assemble” as a way to get the word out. They gather in parades and demonstrations to show their support for certain ideas and beliefs.
THE RIGHT TO PETITION
Congress also cannot deny individuals the right to write to government representatives or officials, seeking a change in the law. This is known as the right to petition. This right is based on the belief that citizens have a right to complain to their representatives about things that they do not like and would like to see changed.
If there is a law or policy that citizens dislike, they gather people’s signatures on petitions. These petitions are then sent to government officials.
The right to gather signatures on a petition is protected by the First Amendment.
Rewrite the First Amendment in your own words. Which rights in the First Amendment do you think are the most important? Explain your reasons.
THE SECOND AMENDMENT
Americans recognized the important role played by the militia in winning the Revolutionary War. A militia is a “citizen’s army,” a force made up of ordinary citizens who take up arms. The Second Amendment states that “a well-regulated militia” is necessary for the security of a free state. For this reason, it says people should have the right to keep and bear arms {carry weapons). Because of the Second Amendment, Americans have the right to own guns. In other countries, citizens do not have this right. Some Americans question whether this right is still necessary today and whether it encourages violence.

149
THE FIFTH AMENDMENT
A citizen cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. This means that certain legal procedures must be carried out according to established rules before a person can be punished.
Eminent domain refers to the power of the government over property in its territory. Sometimes, the government needs to take over property — such as to build a public highway or construct a school. A person’s property cannot be taken away for public use without payment (“reasonable compensation”).
A person cannot be tried for a serious federal crime, that could lead to imprisonment or execution, without an indictment by a grand jury. An indictment is a formal accusation by a court before a person is arrested. A grand jury is a group of citizens that meet to review if there is enough evidence available to hold a trial.
No person can be subject to double jeopardy — being tried twice for the same crime. The government, with all its power and resources, should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for a suspected offense, subjecting him or her to embarrassment and great expense.
-It An accused person cannot be forced to say things that will be used against him or herself (seif-incrimination). A person’s confession of a crime is not valid if he or she was not first informed of the right to have a lawyer.
This amendment guarantees a fair and impartial trial to all persons accused of a crime. They must be told of the charges against them; they have the right to a trial by jury; and they have the right to be represented by a lawyer.
THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT
Federal courts cannot require unusually high bail. Bail is the money an accused pays to a court as security so that he or she need not remain in jail while awaiting trial. This amendment also states that no one can be punished in a cruel or unusual way. On this basis, the Supreme Court has ruled that a state cannot pass a law with a mandatory death sentence. Some critics say that capital punishment itself should be prohibited by the Eighth Amendment, but the Supreme Court has yet to agree.
The freedoms our citizens enjoy because of the Bill of Rights are important to the fabric of life in America. Design and create a poster that showcases these freedoms.

OTHER
AMENDMENTS_______i THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT
This amendment guarantees the right to a trial by a jury in many civil disputes — cases where one person sues another for injury or for breaking a contract.
THE NINTH AMENDMEN
This amendment says that just because the Constitution lists some specific individual rights, this does not mean that citizens do not also hold other rights.
HE TENTH AMENDMEN
"The powers not delegated to the United. Stales by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.'’
The system of federalism divides power between the states and federal government. This amendment states that all powers not specifically given to the federal government are reserved (left) for the states or the people. The federal government has powers only over things specifically given to it in the Constitution. All other powers are given to the states or the people.
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS
Some of the rights in the Bill of Rights, like some provisions in the original Constitution, were responses to the grievances in the Declaration of Independence:
IMPACT OF COLONIAL GRIEVANCES ON THE CONSTITUTION
Grievances listed in the Declaration of Independence	Where each was addressed in the Bill of Rights
The King refused colonists permission to petition for a redress of their grievances.	The First Amendment guarantees citizens the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
The King quartered his troops in the colonists' homes without their permission.	The Third Amendment prohibits the quartering of soldiers in people's homes.
The King deprived some colonists of a trial by jury.	The Sixth Amendment guarantees a trial by jury to all persons accused of a crime.

CHAPTER 9: The Rights and Responsibilities of American Citizens 153
THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT
After the Civil War, another series of important amendments was added to the Constitution. These abolished slavery and guaranteed the freed slaves and other citizens certain rights against the actions of state governments. The Fourteenth Amendment was especially important. The original Bill of Rights had only protected citizens against the actions of the federal government. The Fourteen Amendment now applied to actions by state governments. This amendment was mainly intended to help the freed slaves but actually applied to all citizens. The Supreme Court later reached the conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed all the rights in the Bill of Rights against the actions of state governments as well as by the federal government.
The Fourteenth Amendment protects individual citizens from abuses by state governments in two ways:
Due Process Rights. According to the Fourteenth Amendment, state governments must follow the same procedures as the federal government when arresting, searching, or convicting persons suspected of a crime. Everyone is guaranteed rights of “due process.”
Equal Protection Rights. The Fourteenth Amendment also guarantees each of us the “equal protection” of the laws. Neither the federal government nor a state government can treat members of different groups unequally, unless there is some compelling reason to do so, such as to protect national security. On the basis of this provision, the Supreme Court held in 1954 that states cannot send people to different public schools based on their racial or ethnic backgrounds.
fa Using the Internet or your school or public library, locate a copy of the Fourteenth Amendment. In your own words briefly describe what each of the five sections of the amendment are about.
fa The Southern state legislatures refused to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, with the exception of Tennessee. What parts of the amendment do you think the Southern state legislatures most objected to? Explain your answer.

What is a citizen? A citizen is a participating member of a community. It is not an accident that the term citizen sounds like “city.” The first citizens were participating members of the city-states of Greece, with rights and responsibilities. Later, the Roman Empire expanded the notion of citizenship. The empire allowed people in conquered states to become full citizens.
Surprisingly the term “citizenship” was not defined in the original U.S. Constitution. It was not until 1868, with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, that the requirements for American citizenship were stated in the Constitution. There are two paths to American citizenship — by birth or naturalization.
The Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment apply to all people living in the United States. They apply to permanent residents in this country and visitors as well as American citizens. However, there are some special rights that only U.S. citizens enjoy. These include the right to vote in elections and to participate in government by holding public office.
"BIRTHRIGHT" CITIZENSHIP
According to the Fourteenth Amendment, persons bom in the United States, or who have U.S. citizens as parents, are citizens.
NATURALIZATION
The second way for individuals to become American citizens is through the process of naturalization. This is a legal process by which someone from another country is made into a U.S. citizen. To become a U.S. citizen today, an individual must meet the following requirements:
Individuals being sworn in to become U.S. citizens.

Celebrating Freedom Week
During "Freedom Week," students in Texas study and celebrate the three founding documents of our system of democracy. You have learned about these three "Charters of Freedom" in the last three chapters — the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.
The Declaration of Independence (1776)
You learned that this document was shaped by English traditions and by new traditions established by colonial representative assemblies. In the opening lines of the Declaration, Thomas Jefferson restated John Locke's political philosophy — that all people have certain unalienable rights that cannot rightfully be taken from them: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
You should memorize the following lines and practice them with a classmate:
e holdthese truths to he self-evident, that a([ men are created equal, that they are endowed hy their Creator with certain Unalienable (Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of (Happiness. Lhat to secure these rights, (governments are instituted among (Men, deriving their just powers y from the consent of the governed._______________._________________
Your teacher may want to quiz you on these words. You should also try to write down what the paragraph means in your own words. You can check back on pages 95-96 to review the meaning of this passage. You should recall that the rest of the Declaration went on to explain why the colonists felt they had the right to rebel and to establish their own country. The colonists also listed their many grievances against the British king.
The U.S. Constitution (1787)
This document established the basic structure of our government. It established a I government based on popular sovereignty — "We the People" — in which power I rests with the people, who elect their representatives. The authors of the Constitution sought to create a national government strong enough to defend the nation's ] interests and to promote its general welfare. They gave the new national government many important powers, and made federal law supreme over state law. To ensure that j the new national government was not too strong, they divided its powers between ! the federal and state governments. Power was further divided at the national level ] through a separation of powers. The idea was to create an effective government, but ! one that would respect the rights of its citizens.	?
