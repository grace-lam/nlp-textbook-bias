CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788
115
A.
After declaring independence from Great Britain, each colony became an independent state and adopted its own state constitution. B.
The Second Continental Congress enacted the Articles of Confederation. This created a loose confederation of states. Each state had one vote in the Confederation Congress, and nine states were needed to pass a law. The Confederation Congress controlled foreign affairs but was unable to raise its own army or collect taxes. It depended on the state governments for support. C.
The Confederation Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, establishing principles for the orderly future expansion of the United States. Slavery was prohibited in the Northwest Territory. D.
During the “Critical Period,” (1781-1787), the new nation faced many problems under the Articles of Confederation. States taxed goods from other states, and each state printed its own money, making trade difficult. E.
In 1786, farmers in Massachusetts rose up in Shays’ Rebellion. Although it was put down by state militia, there was no national army if it had spread. F.
American leaders decided a stronger government was needed. At Annapolis, they decided to invite delegates to Philadelphia to revise the Articles. G.
The Constitutional Convention was held in Philadelphia in 1787. The delegates soon decided to abandon the Articles and write a new constitution. H.
The delegates agreed that the new government should be based on the principles of republicanism, popular sovereignty, and limited government. They also agreed on the need for a stronger national government. I.
Several important issues divided members of the Convention. Delegates from larger states wanted representation in Congress by size, while smaller states wanted each state to be equal. The “Great Compromise” settled the dispute. J. A
second issue divided the delegates over the issue of how slaves would be counted towards a state’s representation in Congress. The issue was settled with the “Three-fifths Compromise.” K.
The new constitution established the principles of federalism, popular sovereignty, limited government, separation of powers, and checks and balances to make sure the new central government would not become too strong. L.
The Preamble of the Constitution stated the purposes of the new government. The delegates also created a process to amend the Constitution. M.
After the Constitution was completed, the country debated whether to ratify (approve) it. Anti-Federalists believed the new government would be too strong and tyrannical. Federalists believed a stronger government was needed and that the principles of federalism and separation of powers were sufficient safeguards to protect individual liberties. N.
The Constitution was ratified after its supporters promised a Bill of Rights. Name___________________________________________________
CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788
117
The first governments of the new United States were actually established at the state, not the national level. After declaring independence, each former colony became an independent state. Colonial charters were rewritten as state constitutions.
Americans also recognized the need for some form of central, or national, government. The Continental Congress itself was inadequate to serve as a permanent form of national government. But because of their recent experiences with British rule, the former colonists were afraid of creating a central government that would be too powerful. The Constitutional Congress drafted the Articles of Confederation in 1776 and 1777 to solve this problem.
After the Articles of Confederation were written, the document had to be approved by each state before it could become official. Although the Articles were sent to the states in November 1777, it took almost four years, until March of 1781, for each state to approve them in full.
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The thirteen new states finally adopted the Articles of Confederation in 1781. Here are some of its major provisions:
II.
Each state retains its sovereignty [supreme power], freedom and every power, jurisdiction and right, which is not expressly delegated to the United States.... Article III. The States hereby enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other against all attacks upon them....
Article V. In determining questions in the United States in Congress assembled, each State shall have one vote.
Article VI. No State, without the consent of the Congress, shall enter into any conference, alliance or treaty with any king, prince or state.”
What were the goals of the new Confederation?
Identify one advantage and one disadvantage of one of the articles above.
STRUCTURE 01
Members of the Continental Congress feared that individual freedom might be threatened by the national government if it had too much power. Therefore, the Articles of Confederation deliberately placed more power in the hands of the individual states, making the new national government very weak. It was only a loose association — a “league of friendship,” with only one branch of government — the Congress.

ACHIEVEMENTS
Despite its shortcomings, the Articles of Confederation created a national government that had some important achievements. It successfully concluded the peace treaty with Britain, ending the American Revolution. It helped develop the concept of limited government — a system in which government has only certain powers and cannot act beyond the powers it was specifically given. The Articles of Confederation also developed the idea that American citizenship included both privileges and immunities {rights to take certain actions without penalty). State governments could not deny these privileges and immunities to citizens who came from other states.
The Confederation Congress also passed the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. These acts prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory, encouraged free public education, and guaranteed both religious freedom and trial by jury. Procedures were also established for governing the Northwest Territory, which was divided into smaller territories.
The Northwest Ordinance introduced a method for admitting these territories into the Union as new states once a population of60,000 people was achieved within each territory. The new states were admitted on terms of complete equality with the original thirteen states.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 spurred the westward expansion of the United States. Here is one of the most important provisions of this document:
“Article 5. There shall be formed in the territory, not less than
three nor more than five States; And when any of the said States shall have sixty thousand free inhabitants, such State shall be admitted into the Congress of the United States on an equal footing with the original States in all respects, and shall be at liberty to form a constitution and State government: Provided the constitution and government shall be republican, and in conformity to the principles contained in these articles....”
What requirements did the Northwest Ordinance have for the admission of a territory into the Union as a new state?

The rebels wanted to stop state courts from seizing their property and imprisoning them for unpaid debts. They also wanted the state to issue paper money. There was no national army to put down the uprising if it had spread to other states. Although the state militia was able to put it down, many property-owners across the country now felt the need for a stronger national government.
A meeting of representatives at Annapolis in 1786 called for a convention of delegates to revise the Articles of Confederation. Since only five of the 13 states were represented at Annapolis, they agreed to assemble again a few months later in Philadelphia.
In May 1787, representatives from the states met in Philadelphia to revise the Articles of Confederation. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and
The signing of the U.S. Constitution at Independence Hall
Alexander Hamilton were among the delegates. The representatives quickly agreed on discarding the Articles of Confederation. Instead, they decided that a new national constitution was needed.

Although it was agreed that the discussions of the Constitutional Convention were to be kept secret, James Madison wrote down every speech. Madison is known as the “Father of the U.S. Constitution.” If not for his notes, little of what took place at the
Constitutional Convention would be known. Below is a speech that Madison gave at the Convention:
“In time of war, great powers are given to the Executive. Constant [fear] of war has the same tendency to make the head too large for the body. A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not be a safe [protector] of liberty. The defense against foreign threats has been the instrument of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing truth to stir fear of a war, whenever a revolt was threatened. The armies were kept on under the [excuse] of defending [the people, but they] enslaved them.”

MAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL COMPROMISES
Issue: How should states be represented in the national legislature?
Issue: How should slaves be counted?
]
—

-

The "Great Compromise:" Larger states felt they should have a greater say in the national government. Smaller states felt each state should have an equal voice. In this compromise, a two "house" (bicameral) legislature was created — Congress. In the House of Representatives, states were represented according to their population size. This allowed states with a larger population to have a greater number of representatives. In the Senate, each state, no matter what its size, would be represented by two Senators. Senators were elected indirectly. All laws needed the approval of both houses of Congress.
The "Three-Fifths Compromise:" Southern states wanted slaves counted as part of their population, to have more members in the House of Representatives. The states compromised by agreeing to count every five slaves as three free persons for both taxation and representation.

The "Commerce Compromise." Another dispute involved the taxing of trade. Southern landowners, who sold cash crops to England, feared taxes on exports of their tobacco and other crops. In the “Commerce Compromise,” the delegates agreed to prohibit all taxes on exports (goods sold to foreign countries). Only imported goods could be taxed. The delegates also agreed that Congress could not regulate or limit the slave trade for at least the next twenty years — until 1808.

CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788	125
Because the delegates to the Convention did not entirely trust the common people, they arranged for the President to be chosen by an indirect election. Voters would first choose members of the Electoral College. Once selected, these electors would then vote to choose the President. Each state is free to choose its electors as it wishes. In the late 1700s, America was largely rural. Most people were farmers who knew little about politics. In this environment, a direct election of the President would probably have been difficult.
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The new national legislature was called Congress. Based on the “Great Compromise,” it consisted of two houses: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Congress had the power to make laws, declare war, borrow and issue money, pay for military forces, and regulate commerce (trade) between different states or with foreign countries.

THE JUDICIAL BRANCH
Anew national judiciary was created, consisting of the Supreme Court and any lower courts later created by Congress. The Supreme Court could rule on cases involving either the new Constitution or laws passed by Congress. Its Justices (judges) were to be appointed for life by the President, with the approval of the Senate. Life tenure meant that the Justices would not have to run for election and could be completely independent.

CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788
127
The basic challenge faced by the authors of the Constitution was to create a national government that would be strong, but not so strong that it might undermine individual liberties identified in the Declaration of Independence. To achieve this goal, the new Constitution adopted a number of important principles:
LIMITED GOVERNMENT
One of the most important principles of the U.S. Constitution is the belief that the powers of government should be limited. A self-governing people gives their government leaders only certain specific powers. These are the “just powers” of government mentioned in the Declaration of Independence. Under our system of limited government, our national government has no duties or powers, other than those powers specifically granted to it in the Constitution.
REPUBLICANISM
Americans created a republican form of government — a democratic government chosen by the people. A republic describes a government in which decisions are made by elected representatives, not handed down by a king.
POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY
Another key principle of the U.S. Constitution is that the people are sovereign — they hold supreme power. The “just” powers of the government come from the consent of the governed. The people exercise their sovereignty by electing representatives to Congress, and by indirectly electing the President.
FEDERALISM
The authors of the U.S. Constitution created a “federal republic.” Government powers were divided between the national government and the states. To accomplish this, the writers of the Constitution created a system in which power was shared between the national (or federal} and state governments. The federal government treats issues facing the entire nation, while state governments handle local affairs. Because power was divided between the national and state governments, the
authors of the Constitution believed the national government would not become too strong.

INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS

chapter.
PROVISIONS FOR CHANGE: THE AMENDMENT PROCESS
The Constitution included provisions for change. The way the U.S. Constitution keeps pace is through the amendment process, which allows changes and additions to the text of the Constitution. To prevent changes for unimportant reasons, the amending process was made more difficult than passing an ordinary law. Although over 200 years old, our Constitution has thus kept up with the changing needs of our nation.
A special “elastic clause” in the U.S. Constitution further provided Congress with the power to enact any laws they deemed “necessary” to carry out its other powers. These provisions have made our Constitution into a “living document.” The “elastic clause” has allowed the powers of Congress to increase dramatically since the early 1800s, due in large part to the decisions of the Supreme Court.

CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788	131
The Declaration of Independence (1776) had listed a series of grievances committed by King George III of England against the colonists. A number of those grievances addressed violations by the King of his duties under the English Bill of Rights. Many of the provisions of the U.S. Constitution were included to prevent a repetition of such abuses:
IMPACT OF COLONIAL GRIEVANCES ON THE CONSTITUTION
UCUdldIIUII U! 11 lUt?UCIIUdlUC r	
The King imposed taxes without the consent of the colonists.	U.S. Constitution provides that all taxes must be approved by the House of Representatives.
The King made the military superior to the civil government.	U.S. Constitution provides that the Com-mander-in-Chief is a civilian — the President.
The King kept a large standing army among the colonists.	Congress has the right to raise and support an army. It determines its size through its control of funds.
The King made judges dependent on his will.	All federal judges are appointed for life.
Members of the Constitutional Convention knew they could not adopt their new plan on their own authority. They decided that before the Constitution could become law, nine states should ratify {approve) it. Special conventions were held in each state for this purpose.
FEDERALISTS AND ANTI-FEDERALISTS
Opponents of the new Constitution were known as Anti-Federalists. They included such patriots as Patrick Henry and George Mason.
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In this address to the Virginia legislature in June 1788, Patrick Henry objects to scrapping the Articles of Confederation:
“The Confederation, this same despised government, merits, in my opinion, the highest [praise]: it carried us through a long and
dangerous war; it rendered us victorious in that bloody conflict with a powerful nation; it has secured us a territory greater than any European monarch possesses: and should a government which has been that strong and vigorous, be accused of imbecility, and abandoned for want of energy? Consider what you are about to do before you part with this government.... Before you abandon the present system, I hope you will consider not only its defects, but likewise those that of which you are about to substitute for it.”
What arguments does Henry raise against abandoning the Articles of Confederation?

CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788
The Federalist Papers helped to persuade Americans to approve the new constitution. Thomas Jefferson called them the best explanation ever written about the principles of government. Some have even called these essays the most significant public-relations campaign in history. To obtain the necessary votes for ratification, supporters promised to add a bill of rights. With this assurance, by the end of 1788, eleven states had voted to ratify {approve) the U.S. Constitution.

Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay —authors of the Federalist Papers.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Many Americans believed, as Baron de Montesquieu had written, that liberty was only safe in small societies governed either by direct democracy or by legislatures with small districts. James Madison, in Federalist No. 51, argued the opposite. In a large republic, different interests would have to come together to form a coalition (alliance)
in order to govern the nation. Government was created to prevent politicians or small groups from using government for their own unjust purposes
“In republican government, the legislative authority dominates. The remedy for this is to divide the legislature into different branches; and to [make] them, by different [methods] of election and different principles of action, as little connected with each other as their common functions will [allow].... In a single republic, all the power surrendered by the people is submitted to ... a single government; and [misuse of that power] is guarded against by dividing the government into separate departments. In America, the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two distinct governments, and then the power of each is subdivided among separate departments.
Hence a double security arises to protect the rights of the people. Different governments will control each other, at the same time that each will be controlled by itself. If a majority is united by a common interest, the rights of the minority might be
threatened. There are two ways of providing against this evil: by creating a will in the community independent of the majority of the society; the other, by comprehending in the society so many separate descriptions of citizens as will render an unjust combination of a majority of the whole improbable, if not impractical.”
What arguments does Madison make to calm fears of some that the new government could threaten people’s liberties?

EXAMINE the question. This question tests your ability to understand a political cartoon. Recall what you know. The cartoonist has drawn a large ship representing the Articles of Confederation. It is sailing through rough waters. The waves are high, threatening to sink the ship. These waves symbolize different shortcomings of the Arti-
cles — no national army, no power to enforce treaties, and no power to raise an army. The caption raises the question whether the government under the Articles is in danger of sinking. Apply what you know. You should realize that Choices A, C, and D do not really define the main idea of the cartoon. The best answer is Choice S5, since the cartoonist implies the Articles of Confederation had many shortcomings.
