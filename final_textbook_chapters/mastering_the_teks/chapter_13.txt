THE ELECTION OF
1860 By the late 1850s, deep divisions existed among Americans over the future of the nation, and especially over the institution of slavery. In the Presidential election of 1860, the Republican Party nominated the former U.S. Representative from Illinois, Abraham Lincoln. “Honest Abe” ran on a platform that opposed the extension of slavery in the territories but not the system of slavery in the South.
Democrats could not agree on a candidate. Northern and Southern Democrats chose separate candidates. The split in their party allowed Lincoln to win the election with only 39% of the popular vote. Lincoln did not campaign in the South, and not surprisingly, did not win a single Southern state.
Lincoln as he looked after winning the 1860 election.
CHAPTER 13: The Civil War, 1861-1865	261
Three weeks after Davis spoke, Lincoln responded to the challenge posed by the secession in his First Inaugural Address.
Lincoln reassured Southerners that he would not interfere with slavery in the South. But he warned that the Constitution was based on the idea that “the Union of these states is perpetual” and that “no state can lawfully get out of the Union.”
Thus, he would do his utmost to preserve the Union, by force if necessary. He denied Jefferson Davis’ claim that Southern states had a lawful right to leave it. He further stated that even if the Constitution were
taken to be a simple contract, it could not be legally cancelled without an agreement between all the states, both North and South. He saw the Union as a union of people, not states.
March 1861, Lincoln delivers his First Inaugural Address.
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
When Lincoln delivered his Inaugural Address, thousands came, not just to see the new President, but to hear what he had to say about the crisis facing the nation. Part of his address was a direct appeal to the seceding Southern states:
“... In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you. You can have no conflict, without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to ‘preserve, protect and defend’ it.... We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”
What message was Lincoln giving to Southern states in his address? -fc How did his views on the Union differ from those of Jefferson Davis?
FIRING ON FORT SUMTER
Fort Sumter was a federal fort in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. The garrison of federal troops stationed there was running out of food and supplies and had no way of obtaining these onshore after South Carolina seceded.

Could the Civil War have been avoided, or was it inevitable? Explain.
Imagine that you are President Lincoln in 1861. Write a short speech to the Southern states to convince them not to secede from the Union.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Look at the following four viewpoints on the causes of the Civil War. Three of them are from primary sources from the time of the Civil War. The fourth one provides the views of a modem historian.

Stephens Confederate Vice-President		Sumner's Speech
"Thomas Jefferson's ideas rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error.... Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are Laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery — subordination to the superior race — is his natural and normal condition." — Alexander Stephens, Confederate Vice-President March 1861.		"[T]here are two [causes] to this war. One is slavery and the other is state rights. If slavery were out of the way, there would be no trouble from state rights. The war is for slavery, nothing else. [The South] seeks to install this barbarism as the truest civilization. Slavery is declared to be the 'corner-stone' of their new [structure]." — Republican Senator Charles Sumner, in a speech delivered in July 1863.
		
Lincoln's Speech		A Modern Historian
"My object in this struggle is to save the Union, .... If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and Leaving others alone I would also do that.... I here state my purpose ... and I intend no modification of my often expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free." — President Abraham Lincoln in a speech delivered in August 1862		"If the North fought to uphold the justice, power and authority of the federal government, the opposite, many assume, must be that the South fought for the power of the states. But the equation did not balance in that way: the North did not fight at first to end slavery, but the South did fight to protect slavery. It is vital that we grasp this truth ... before it fades even further from view." — Edward Ayers, Professor of History, University of Richmond, April 2011

CHAPTER 13: The Civil War, 1861-1865	265
For the next four years, Americans were engaged in the bloodiest conflict in their history. Southerners were fighting to defend their independence and preserve their way of life, even though this included denying independence to others — the slaves. Northerners fought to maintain national unity. Later, they also fought to end the system of slavery.
When the war began, the North enjoyed several important advantages over the South:
Transportation. The North had a superior transportation system with more railroads, canals, ports, and roads.
Population. The North's population was 22 million in 1860, compared to only six million free citizens in the South.
Resources. The North had more factories and grew more food. The South was primarily rural and agricultural. It produced mainly cotton and cash crops to be sold to others. The South lacked manufacturing centers.
Leadership. Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, lacked the political skills of President Lincoln. However, the South appeared to have superior military leadership in the early years of the war, with commanders such as General Lee.
Naval Power. The South had few war ships, while the North had a powerful navy, which blockaded Southern ports and helped in the Mississippi campaign. This naval power would prove decisive.
..............................
____
Although the North had superior wealth and resources, Southerners thought they had one very important advantage: they were fighting to defend their own way of life.
Categorize the advantages and disadvantages of the North and the South during the war as either political, economic, or social.
WARTIME STRATEGIES
Northerners adopted a long-term strategy, first suggested by General Winfield Scott, that was aimed at strangling the South. Because the North hoped to surround and strangle the South like a giant anaconda snake, this plan became known as the “Anaconda Plan.” President Lincoln ordered a naval blockade of the Confederacy that was practically unchallenged. His objectives were to prevent Southerners from receiving supplies from Europe, to block Southern states from exporting cotton, to prohibit the South from importing war materials, and to thwart the creation of a Confederate navy.
u PROJECT WITHOUT PERMISSION j
In July 1861, a Union army of 30,000 soldiers marched towards Richmond but was defeated at the Battle of Manassas (also called the Battle of Bull Run). General “Stonewall” Jackson and other Confederate leaders, commanding 22,000 soldiers, forced the Union army to retreat. Jackson displayed remarkable skill on the battlefield, which inspired his soldiers. He is widely regarded as one of the best Confederate commanders. Later, he was accidentally shot by Confederate troops returning from battle.
CHAPTER 13: The Civil War, 1861-1865	267
“Stonewall” Jackson (1824-1863)
Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee decided that the best way to end the war was to invade the North. In late 1862, Lee’s forces crossed into Maryland. Confederate and Union forces fought a major battle at Antietam Creek. At the Battle of Antietam (also known as the Battle of Sharpsburg), six thousand soldiers were killed in just one day — the bloodiest single day of the war. Lee retreated to Virginia, but to Lincoln’s disappointment, Union leaders did not pursue his forces.

Julia Ward Howe
By the start of the Civil War, “John Brown’s Body” had become a popular marching song of the Union Army. One day, Julia Ward Howe watched as Union soldiers marched off to war singing “John Brown’s Body.” Howe believed
the tune needed better words. In 1861, she “scrawled the verses almost without looking at the paper.” “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” first appeared in a magazine as a battle song for the republic. Before long, the entire nation was inspired by her hymn and singing her words based on the old tune. Below are the first and fifth stanzas of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic”:
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord:
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword:
His truth is marching on.
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat: Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet! Our God is marching on.
Explain the meaning of these two stanzas in your own words.
Research the “Battle Hymn of the Republic” on the Internet. Read how these words have been interpreted by historians and see how your interpretation matches those.
EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION
(1862) President Lincoln did not originally believe he had the power to end slavery. However, as the war progressed, he believed he should do so if it would help save the Union. Lincoln used the victory at Antietam as the occasion for announcing the Emancipation Proclamation. The death toll was now so great that Lincoln wanted to give the war effort a greater moral purpose. Lincoln also wanted to prevent Britain and France, which opposed slavery, from taking sides with the South. Finally, he wanted to prevent Southern States from using black troops for combat and to keep border states, such as Missouri, from deserting the North for the South.
The Emancipation Proclamation only freed the slaves in rebelling states, not in the loyal border states. It was the most controversial document of Lincoln’s Presidency. The announcement of the Proclamation met with both hostility and jubilation in the North. On approving it, Lincoln remarked, “I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.”

THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS
Lincoln was invited to the battlefield of Gettysburg in 1863 to dedicate a cemetery to the Union soldiers who had died there. He spoke for only two minutes. Simply and eloquently, Lincoln explained the meaning of the Civil War to the 20,000 people who had come to see him.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
By the third year of bloodshed, Lincoln began to feel that the war was being fought not just to preserve the Union but to test the system of democracy itself. The purpose of the war was to see if the American experiment in democracy, launched in 1776, could survive. Lincoln told his listeners that those who had sacrificed their lives had already made holy the ground
where they were buried. The best that those still living could do was to continue with the terrible task that the fallen soldiers had died for:
Lincoln stands to deliver the Gettysburg Address.
“The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they [the soldiers who died] did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the ... great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devo-
tion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”
What did Lincoln see as the “great task remaining”?
Why do you think this speech is one of the most famous in American history?
The Battle of Vicksburg. Meanwhile, Union forces had captured New Orleans and were slowly working their way up the Mississippi River in order to divide the South in two. Vicksburg was located on top of a 200-foot bluff, allowing the Confederacy to control movement along the Mississippi River. In the spring of 1863, General Ulysses S. Grant’s armies focused on taking Vicksburg to trap the Confederate army. The day after the Battle of Gettysburg, Vicksburg surrendered after a 47-day siege.

CHAPTER 13: The Civil War, 1861-1865	275
The devastation caused by Union armies in the South caused many Confederates to lose hope. General Lee’s army slowly dwindled. By late 1864, half of his soldiers had deserted to return home to protect their families.
In April 1865, Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy, fell to Union armies. A few days later, Lee met Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. Under the terms of the agreement, the officers and men of Lee’s army surrendered and were pardoned. All Confederate arms were collected by Union troops as captured property. Both generals signed the document of surrender. The war was finally over.
Richmond, Virginia lay in ruins in 1865.
Lincoln's Assassination. Just weeks after the surrender, President Lincoln was assassinated on April 15, 1865, in Washington, D.C., exactly four years after his call to put down the rebellion.
Lincoln was shot in the back of the head by the actor John Wilkes Booth, who thought Lincoln was a tyrant. Lincoln died the next day. Had Lincoln lived, he was prepared to forgive the South and to work together as Americans dedicated to a system of government based on liberty,
equality, and unity. Lincoln’s greatest achievement was his ability to energize and mobilize the nation by appealing to its highest ideals, while acting “with malice towards none.”
