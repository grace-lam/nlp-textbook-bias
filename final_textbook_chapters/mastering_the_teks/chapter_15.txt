A.
Americans won their independence during the American Revolution. Jonathan Trumbull was the only colonial governor to side with the colonists. John Peter Muhlenberg was a Protestant minister who recruited soldiers and rose to the rank of general. B.
The Declaration of Independence stated the colonists’ decision to separate from Britain. The Declaration listed colonial grievances against Britain and provided a theory of government: government’s purpose is to protect individuals’ unalienable rights to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” When a government oppresses citizens’ rights, they have a right to overthrow it. C.
Signers of the Declaration included John Hancock, Benjamin Rush, Charles Carroll, and John Witherspoon. D.
The first national government established by the new United States was a weak association. Americans created a stronger federal government when they ratified the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution created a national executive, a two-house legislature known as Congress, and a national judiciary. John Jay was the nation’s first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. To ensure the national government would not challenge citizens’ rights, the Constitution rested on certain key principles — limited government, the separation of power, federalism, checks and balances, and popular sovereignty. E.
The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution in the form of the first ten amendments to further protect individual rights from government abuse. F.
The First Amendment protects freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly and the right of citizens to petition their government. G.
The Second Amendment protects the right of citizens to bear arms. H.
The Third Amendment says government cannot “quarter” soldiers in private homes without their consent. I.
The Fourth Amendment protects people from “unreasonable searches.” J.
The Fifth Amendment protects individuals from double jeopardy, and from being forced to incriminate themselves, and further guarantees citizens “just compensation” for property taken by government’s right of eminent domain. K.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees those accused of a crime a fair and public trial by a jury and the assistance of a lawyer. L.
The Seventh Amendment guarantees jury trials in some civil cases. M.
The Eighth Amendment prevents judges from setting bail that is too high, or from inflicting “cruel and unusual” punishments. N.
The Nihth Amendment lists certain rights and does not deny other rights. O.
The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not granted to the federal government to the state governments and the people. P.
Alexis de Tocqueville observed five American values: liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, populism, and laissez-faire. Name
CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History
Strong support for independence came from several colonial religious leaders. In colonial times, these religious leaders held great influence. Many colonists attended church on Sundays, where ministers made their views known in weekly sermons. John Peter Muhlenberg was bom in Pennsylvania, studied In Germany and America, and became a Protestant minister.
At one of his sermons, Muhlenberg pulled off his clerical robe to reveal a uniform underneath. Then he enlisted more than a hundred men into the Continental Army. Rev. Muhlenberg became part of a group known as the “Black Regiment” — ministers who wore black clerical robes while preaching and who worked to recruit large
numbers of volunteers for the Revolutionary cause. During the war, Muhlenberg rose to the rank of general under Washington. Later, he served as a U.S. Senator and Congressman.

John Peter Muhlenberg (1746-1807)
Representatives at the Second Continental Congress began discussing the issue of American independence early in 1776. After much debate, the delegates decided to go ahead and declare their independence from Britain. A “Committee of Five” was charged with the task of writing a draft for the Declaration of Independence. The members of the Committee decided that Thomas Jefferson should write most of the document.
The final Declaration of Independence, issued on July 4,
1776, explained the reasons why the colonists sought independence from Great Britain. The Declaration not only freed the colonists from Britain, but also put forward a theory of government. Many of its ideas were borrowed from John Locke. The Declaration explained that the purpose of government should be to protect citizens’ unalienable rights.
These were rights that cannot be taken away, such as the rights to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”
The Declaration further argued that ordinary citizens had the right to overthrow an oppressive government that failed to protect these unalienable rights. The Declaration of Inde-
pendence then went on to list the grievances of the colo-	The De(daratl°n w®s read

They signed by state from North to South, starting with New Hampshire. They acted courageously since the British viewed the Declaration as an act of treason, punishable by hanging. Who were some of these signers of the Declaration?
John Hancock. The most recognizable signature on the Declaration of Independence was that of John Hancock, a prosperous merchant from Boston and the President of the Continental Congress. Hancock made his signature so large so that King George III could read it without his glasses. When the first version of the Declaration was printed and sent to each colony, it carried only John Hancock’s signature, since the official document had not yet been drawn up for others to sign. Hancock’s name quickly became second only to that of George Washington as a symbol of freedom in the colonies.
Benjamin Rush. Another signer of the Declaration, Rush was a physician, educator, and humanitarian. Dr. Rush is sometimes known as the “Father of American Medicine.” He was a pioneer in the fields of physiology and psychiatry. Rush is also known for his proposal to establish a national public university to train public servants. He favored the education of women, and helped to establish and finance the oldest African-American church in the country (the African Methodist Episcopal Church) in Philadelphia. His son later became U.S. Ambassador to England.
Charles Carroll of Carrollton. One of the wealthiest men in the colonies, Carroll helped finance the Revolution with his own money. Carroll was one of the first to recognize the necessity for independence from Britain and strongly argued for armed resistance to Britain. From Maryland, Carroll was a Catholic. At that time, Catholics made up less than two percent of the colonial population and lacked political rights. Carroll helped in the struggle for the acceptance of the Roman Catholic religion in America.

John Hancock (1737-1793)
John Witherspoon. A Scottish immigrant, Witherspoon became a leading member of the Continental Congress and took part in more than a hundred of its committees. Shortly after signing the Declaration of Independence, he responded to a person who argued that the colonies were not ready for independence. Witherspoon commented that it “was not only ripe for independence, but in danger of rotting for the want of it.” He was a Presbyterian clergyman, and he became President of the College of New Jersey, later known as Princeton University. Under his leadership, the college rose to become a leading institution of learning in America.

CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History

The Declaration of Independence only set up a series of aspirations, or goals, for Americans. It promised a system of government that promoted liberty, equality, and individual rights, and that was based on the will of the people. The U.S. Constitution actually turned these goals into a concrete system of government with a series of specific, fundamental laws.
The Constitution was not the first central government that the colonies established after independence. The colonies originally set up a very weak national association under an agreement known as the Articles of Confederation. This association was an experiment in government that failed. In 1786, American leaders met at Annapolis, Maryland, and decided that a stronger government was needed.
They decided to meet again and invited delegates to Philadelphia to revise the Articles. The Constitutional Convention, meeting in Philadelphia in 1787, quickly decided to abandon the Articles altogether and to write an entirely new constitution.
The Articles of Confederation
PRINCIPLES OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION
The U.S. Constitution, written by the Constitutional Convention, established the basic structure of our national government. It established a government in which power rested with the people, who elect their own representatives. The framers of the Constitution sought to create a national government strong enough to defend the nation’s interests and to promote its general welfare. They gave the new national government many important powers, and made federal law supreme over state law.
The signing of the U.S. Constitution at Independence Hall
The new Constitution created an elected President, a Congress with two houses, and a Supreme Court. To ensure that this new national government was not too strong, the new Constitution also adopted a number of important principles:
Name_________________________________________________
CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History
45
THE BILL OF RIGHTS
The original Constitution contained few specific guarantees of individual rights. Ratification of the Constitution was only obtained when its supporters promised to add a Bill of Rights to protect individual liberties. As soon as the first Congress assembled in 1789, it began deciding which rights to include in the “Bill of Rights.” A list of possible rights was reduced to ten, which were approved by the members of Congress. They were then sent to the states for approval. Two-thirds of the state legislatures approved these amendments by 1791, when they came into effect.
The First Amendment actually covers five separate rights at the same time. Let’s look at each of these rights more closely.
FREEDOM OF RELIGION
The First Amendment guarantees freedom of worship.
It also prohibits Congress from establishing an official, or “state” religion. This is sometimes called the separation of church and state.
FREEDOM OF SPEECH
The First Amendment protects our freedom to say or write most things in public. Americans cannot be put in jail just for criticizing the government or for expressing unpopular beliefs. This does not mean, however,
that we can say whatever we want. In some circumstances, our speech can be limited. For example, a person cannot yell “fire” in a crowded movie theater as a joke, since this might threaten other people’s lives. The Supreme Court has ruled that government can limit speech when that speech creates a “clear and present danger.”
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
The First Amendment allows newspapers, radio, and television to write or announce what they want without fear of punishment. This freedom is essential in a democratic society since people need to be well-informed to vote.
THE RIGHT OF ASSEMBLY
The First Amendment states that Congress cannot deny individuals the right to “peacefully assemble.”

CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History

In colonial times, people protested against British customs officers randomly entering their homes. The Fourth Amendment was added to protect individuals from “unreasonable” searches and seizures by government officials.
If there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, a judge must sign a “search warrant,” presented by a police officer, before the search can be conducted. Our laws provide that only in exceptional circumstances can the police make a search without a warrant.
The police must follow certain procedures before they can enter a persons home.
A citizen cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property without “due process of law.” This means that certain legal procedures must be carried out according to established rules before a person can be punished.
A person cannot be tried for a serious federal crime, which could lead to imprisonment or execution, without an indictment by a grand jury — a formal accusation before a person is arrested. A grand jury is a group of citizens that meet to review if there is enough evidence available to even hold a trial.
No person can be subject to double jeopardy — being tried twice for the same crime.
An accused person cannot be forced to say things that will be used against him or herself (self-incrimination). Under the Supreme Court decision of Miranda v.
Arizona (1966), a person’s confession of a crime is not valid if he or she was not first informed of the right to have a lawyer present during police questioning.
Eminent domain refers to the power of a government over property in its territory.
Sometimes the government needs to take Persons cannot be made to testify against themselves. over private property for public use. For
example, the government may need to build a highway or construct a school where private homes are located. The government has the right to do so under the power of eminent domain. According to the Fifth Amendment, “private property [shall not] be taken for public use without just compensation.” In other words, before the government can exercise Its power of eminent domain, it must provide the owner with “just compensation.”

CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History

The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to a trial by a jury in many civil disputes — cases where one person sues another for injury or for breaking a contract.
The Ninth Amendment states that just because the Constitution lists some specific rights, this does not mean that citizens do not also hold other rights.
The Tenth Amendment states that the federal government has only those powers specifically given to it in the Constitution. All other powers are reserved to the states or the people.

CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History
51
At the time of the American Revolution, some writers began noticing that America was a very different place from Europe. At that time, most of Europe was still divided into hereditary social classes. Nobles enjoyed special privileges, while in many countries, there were still serfs with no rights at all. Throughout most of Europe, land was owned by a few wealthy families: there was very little free land available for people to settle or buy.
One of the first attempts to describe the new American culture was by a French immigrant, Hector St John de Crevecoeur. In 1755, he moved to New France in North America and in 1759, he moved to New York. He was very intrigued by what he found in America. He tried to define what it meant to be an American in 1782. He was greatly impressed by the mixing of peoples of different nationalities, the rich resources of North America, the absence of kings and nobles demanding a share of the worker’s labor, and the willingness of Americans to work hard out of their own self-interest:
ACTINS AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In his Letters to an American Farmer, Crevecoeur (1735-1813) wrote about how this mixture of different peoples was being transformed by the American environment to create a new American society and culture:
“What then is the American, this new man? He is either a European, or the descendant of an European, hence that strange mixture of blood, which you will find in no other country.
He is an American, who, leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the new rank he holds.... Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men, whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in
the world.... Here the rewards of his industry follow with	____
equal steps the progress of his labor; his labor is founded on the basis of nature, self-interest', can it want a stronger allurement? Wives and children gladly help their father to clear those abundant fields where crops grow to feed and clothe them all; without any part being claimed, either by a despotic prince, a rich abbot, or a mighty lord.”
According to Crevecoeur, what were the chief differences between Europeans and Americans?
What do you think surprised him most about Americans?

CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History 53
Tocqueville also found, however, that the system of democracy did not always place the best people in positions of leadership in government: “On my arrival in the United States, I was surprised to find so much distinguished talent among the citizens and so little among the heads of the government. It is a constant fact that at the present day the ablest men in the United States are rarely placed at the head of affairs.” Indeed, Tocqueville came to the conclusion that by guaranteeing general prosperity and well-being, America did not necessarily promote the cultivation of excellence, as he believed Europe did.
Historians studying Tocqueville have identified five values that he found crucial to America’s success as a constitutional republic:
EGALITARIANISM (EQUALITY)
Egalitarianism refers to a society of equals. In Europe, society was built around hereditary distinctions separating the nobles, middle classes, and peasants. In America, there were differences in wealth, power, and intelligence, but everyone was equal socially. The availability of free land also promoted equality. Owning land allowed Americans to view themselves as equal to their neighbors and further contributed to their feeling of equality. Tocqueville believed that the primary concern of the nation should be to safeguard liberty, since it created the conditions for Americans to become economically prosperous. Two exceptions to this were slavery and the treatment of Native Americans, which Tocqueville also wrote about.
POPULISM (POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY)
Tocqueville wrote that democratic government, — “a government where the people more or less participate in their government,” — is closely bound up with the idea of “political liberty.” Populism refers to the participation of the common people in political life — another distinguishing characteristic that Tocqueville found in American society in the early nineteenth century. Since everyone in society was equal, everyone had the same right to participate in government. The goal of such a society was peace and prosperity for all.
LIBERTY
By “liberty,” Tocqueville meant protection against tyrannical government. The great danger in democratic government was the tyranny of the majority. He noted that Americans were devoted to the rule of law, and that America’s federal system helped prevent the rise of an over-powerful government. Most important of all, American customs and manners were devoted to the spirit of liberty. In America, Tocqueville wrote, religious faith helped strengthen the belief in individual liberty.
INDIVIDUALISM
In American society, the government did not direct individual activity to the same extent as Tocqueville had seen in Europe. People in America were free to flourish without hereditary distinctions, and individuals believed they could rise in society. Individuals even organized themselves into their own private, voluntary associations, such as charities.

CHAPTER 5: Industrialization and the "Gilded Age"
63
American industrialization proceeded at a rapid pace in the decades after the Civil War. Some historians consider this period America’s “Second Industrial Revolution.”
New inventions and technologies helped fuel the great economic expansion of the late nineteenth century. In the decades after the Civil War, steam and electricity replaced human and animal strength. Iron replaced wood, and steel replaced iron. The Bessemer process made the production of steel more economical. Before the Bessemer process, it took an entire day to produce 5 tons of steel; afterwards, the same quantity of steel could be made in a mere 15 minutes.
In 1855, Henry Bessemer developed a new and more efficient method of making steel.
The power of steam now drove textile mill spindles, sewing machines and other equipment. This steam generally came from the burning of coal to heat water. New pneumatic drills were able to cut deeper into the Earth than ever before to mine this resource. In 1860, 14 million tons of coal were mined in the United States; by 1884, the amount was 100 million tons. The center of the coal mining industry was western Pennsylvania. The first oil well was also drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859. Improvements in refining allowed petroleum products to be used in lighting and machine lubrication. The internal combustion engine, developed at from oil to run cars and the first airplanes.
One of the earliest oil wells in Pennsylvania.
end of the nineteenth century, used gasoline
The Commercial Use of Electricity. The application of electricity was another of the period’s most significant developments. For its first commercial use, electricity was used as a means of communication along telegraph wires. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell, (1847-1922) an educator of the deaf, invented the telephone. The telephone and telegraph allowed people to communicate across great distances.

Major Transcontinental Railroads,
H-W-W- MAIN RAILROADS
DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL MARKET
In the late nineteenth century, a truly national market emerged for the first time. Railroads, canals, telegraphs and telephones linked together different parts of the country. Shipping raw materials and finished goods became less expensive. National producers could make and ship goods more cheaply than local producers, since they could take advantage of more machinery and greater economies of scale. The high investment costs of mass-production manufacturing required a large market to be profitable. New methods of selling were developed, such as department stores, chain stores, and mail-order houses, including Sears and Roebuck. Manufacturers could advertise in magazines and newspapers, and sell the same goods throughout the country.
THE IMPACT OF POPULATION GROWTH
In the late nineteenth century, the United States experienced continuous population growth in nearly every part of the nation. Between 1850 and 1900, the population more than tripled. In 1850, there were 23 million Americans; by 1900, there were 76 million. This large population increase was fueled by a high birthrate and a constant stream of European immigrants. Population growth created favorable conditions for business expansion. There was a steadily rising demand for goods, and a plentiful supply of cheap labor to make them. But the growing population also made Increasing demands on the natural environment, using up resources.
NEW TYPES OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
Before the Civil War, most American businesses were owned by individuals or by a group of partners. After the war, the corporate form of business became much more common. A corporation is a company chartered by a state and recognized in law as a separate “person.”

Create a chart or Venn diagram listing the advantages and disadvantages of the corporate form of business organization.
An entrepreneur is a person (or small group) who starts a business in the hope of making a profit. In the 1870s, entrepreneurs began to exercise a dominant influence on American economic life. Through the efficiencies of large-scale production, these industrial entrepreneurs lowered the prices of goods, making them more affordable, while also improving their quality. These entrepreneurs were also able to reap huge profits for themselves, creating immense wealth. Because of their lavish lifestyles, the period from 1865 to 1900 became known as the “Gilded Age.”
Some observers considered these entrepreneurs “Captains of Industry” because they forged the modem industrial economy. Their critics called them “robber barons” because of the ruthless tactics they used to destroy competition and to keep their workers’ wages low. Two of the most successful entrepreneurs in this era were Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller.
ANDREW CARNEGIE
Andrew Carnegie worked his way up from a penniless Scottish immigrant to one of America’s richest and most powerful men.
He first worked as a boy in a cotton mill. Later, he was a telegraph operator for a railroad. Carnegie became friends with the president of the railroad, who promoted him and advised him on investments.
After the Civil War, Carnegie invested in ironworks and built a steel mill in Pittsburgh, selling iron and steel to railroad companies for tracks. With his profits, he bought other steel mills and founded the Carnegie Steel Corporation in 1892. His steel mills undercut the competition. He bought iron ore fields, coal mines and ships so he could mine his own iron ore and ship it to his steel
mills In Pennsylvania. Carnegie paid his workers low wages and forced them to work 12-hour long shifts, while he crushed attempts by his workers to form labor unions. Carnegie spent his later life In acts of philanthropy, giving away $350 million to build libraries and endow universities.
Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919)
CHAPTER 5: Industrialization and the "Gilded Age"
69
In 1873, America experienced a depression (an economic downturn in business). Large producers like Carnegie and Rockefeller began driving smaller companies out of business or purchasing them. In some cases, rival companies reached agreements to consolidate (join together). Many producers hoped to eliminate competition by establishing a monopoly. Monopoly power allowed a manufacturer to dictate prices to consumers.
THE PROS AND CONS OF BIG BUSINESS
PROS
•	Large business are more efficient, leading to lower prices.
•	They can hire large numbers of workers.
•	They can produce goods in large quantities.
•	They have the resources to support expensive research and invent new items.
CONS
•	They have an unfair competitive advantage against smalLer businesses.
•	They sometimes exploit workers.
•	They are less concerned with where they do business and pollute the area.
•	They have an unfair influence over government policies affecting them.
LAWS AGAINST ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES
At first, the government did little to regulate big business. Government leaders believed in laissez-faire — the theory that the government should not interfere in the operation of the free market. Of course, even under a laissez-faire system, government had a role in the economy: it provides laws to protect property and enforce contracts. It establishes a system of patents to promote inventions, and enacts tariffs to help manufacturers. Many believed that the economy worked best when it was not burdened by government regulations. Government leaders also doubted that the Constitution gave them the right to regulate business. However, some of the anti-competitive practices of business were so glaring that reformers called for legislation to remedy them, giving government an even greater role.
Interstate Commerce Act (1887). Railroads sometimes charged local farmers more to haul their crops over short distances than they charged for large companies to ship goods longer distances on more competitive national routes. Some states passed laws prohibiting this practice, but the U.S. Supreme Court held these laws to be unconstitutional. The Court ruled that only Congress had the power to regulate interstate commerce. In response, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act. This federal law prohibited unfair practices by railroads, such as charging higher rates for shorter routes. A special regulatory commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, was established to enforce the act. This was a landmark measure, since it was the first time that Congress stepped In to regulate business in America.
Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890). The purpose of this federal law was to stop monopolies engaging in unfair practices that prevented fair competition. The act marked a significant change in the attitude of Congress toward the abuses of big business.

One Important factor behind America’s astonishing economic growth in the late nineteenth century was the increasing exploitation of its industrial workers.
LONG HOURS AND LOW WAGES
The average workday and work week were long by today’s standards: 10 to 14 hours a day for six days a week. Employers hired the least expensive laborers. Pay averaged from $3 to $12 weekly, but immigrants were often willing to work for far less. Women and children were also frequently employed as low-paid workers.
POOR CONDITIONS, BORING AND REPETITIVE TASKS
As factories and work places grew larger, workers lost all personal contact with their employers. Jobs were offered on a “take-it or leave-it” basis. As industrialists sought to achieve greater speed and efficiency, each worker became nothing more than a human cog in a vast machine. Work became less skilled, more repetitive, monotonous and boring. Industrial working conditions in the late nineteenth century were also often extremely hazardous. Safeguards around machinery were inadequate. Thousands of workers were injured or killed in industrial accidents each year.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
This poem, “The Sweatshop,” was written by Morris Rosenfeld, a Russian-Polish immigrant who found work in the garment industry in New York City. A “sweatshop” was a workshop, like a small factory, often in a city. Rosenfeld wrote this poem about how he felt at work:
“The machines are so wildly noisy in the shop That I often forget who I am.
I get lost in the frightful tumult —
My self is destroyed, I become a machine.
I work and work and work endlessly —
I create and create and create
Why? For whom? I don’t know and I don’t ask.
What business has a machine thinking?”
How would you summarize Rosenfeld’s feelings about his work?
Suppose you were going to interview Morris Rosenfeld. Prepare two questions you would ask him.

CHAPTER 5: Industrialization and the "Gilded Age"
Gompers limited his goals to winning economic improvements for workers, higher pay, an 8-hour work day, and better working conditions. Gompers fought hard to improve members’ job security by seeking closed shops {places where only union members could be hired). The AFL quickly emerged as the principal voice of organized labor. However, the AFL was weakened by its continuing exclusion of unskilled workers, who made up the bulk of the labor force. As late as 1910, less than 5% of American Workers were unionized.	Samuel Gompers
(1850-1924).
73
Government leaders were critical of the early labor movement. In the late nineteenth century, most government leaders favored business and opposed unions for a number of reasons:
THE GREATER INFLUENCE OF BUSINESS
Business leaders often contributed heavily to political campaign funds. Moreover, many politicians shared the same outlook as business leaders. They believed that successful businesses were responsible for American prosperity, and saw worker demands as greedy.
PROTECTOR OF THE ECONOMY
More than 20,000 strikes involving more than 6 million workers took place between 1880 and 1900. Government leaders feared the disruptive effect of these strikes on the American economy. In 1895, the U.S. Supreme Court even applied the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890) against unions. The Court ruled that unions were illegal combinations in restraint of trade. This ruling encouraged government leaders to use troops to put down strikes and to restore order.
PUBLIC OPINION
Public opinion also supported laissez-faire policies. Many Americans believed that businesses should have the right to hire and fire employees as they pleased. Many were hostile to unions because they feared workers’ wage demands would lead to higher prices. Union activities were often associated with violence and radical ideas. In the Haymarket Affair of 1886, labor leaders were blamed when a bomb exploded during a demonstration of striking workers at Haymarket Square in Chicago. Seven policemen were killed and 67 others were severely wounded.

In this chapter, you will leam how industrialization affected American society in the late nineteenth century. You will leam how people migrated from the countryside to cities, and people from other countries came to the United States. You will also leam how technological change made it possible to transform the physical geography of the Great Plains. Finally, you will explore how Native American Indians were forced onto reservations, the buffalo were killed, and new settlers built ranches and farms.

■
A.
In the 19th century, Americans moved from the countryside to cities as the nation became more urbanized. The use of farm machinery meant fewer workers were needed on farms, while demand for labor in factories and cities expanded. B.
Urbanization brought many problems. Cities often lacked adequate public services for their growing populations. Streets were noisy, dirty, and congested. Many newcomers lived in crowded tenement housing. C.
Political “bosses” ran “political machines.” They provided basic services for immigrants and the poor, in exchange for their votes; they used their control of city government to make personal fortunes on overpriced city contracts. D.
Immigration escalated in the late nineteenth century. A variety of “push” and “pull” factors brought more immigrants to the United States seeking a better life. E.
The “New Immigrants” came from Southern and Eastern Europe — Russia, Italy, Poland, and Greece. Most were Catholic or Jewish, spoke no English and were often poor. They tended to settle in large Eastern cities. They lived in ethnic communities in ghettos, where they could speak their native language. F.
The children of the immigrants were often “Americanized” in the public schools. G.
Nativists opposed immigration. The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first federal law restricting immigration. It prohibited Chinese immigration for 10 years. H.
The frontier was the line between areas of settlement and those areas dominated by nature and Native American Indians. The last frontier consisted of the Great Plains and mountains, deserts, and basins of the Far West. The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad and the defeat of the Indians during the Indian Wars closed the final frontier and opened the region to settlement. I.
Miners were attracted to the Far West by discoveries of precious metals such as during the California Gold Rush of 1849 and the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896. J.
Ranchers came to drive their cattle herds across the open range to rail lines. Farmers occupied land under the Homestead Act and built homes and farms. To overcome the lack of rain and trees, they built homes of sod, dug water wells, and used steel plows and barbed wire. K.
Government policy drove the Indians onto government reservations in the West. L.
The Dawes Act, although intended to help Indians, had the opposite effect. It gave tribal lands to individual Indians, who often sold them. The American Indian Citizenship Act (1924) made all Indians into U.S. citizens. Name

•	What activities did people pursue in that city for relaxation and amusement?
Urbanization led to physical changes in the landscape. Trees and fields were replaced by wood and brick buildings and by paved roads. American cities mushroomed so quickly that municipal (city) authorities were often unable to deal adequately with all of their problems.
OVERCROWDING AND CONGESTION
Cities grew haphazardly. Streets were often not wide enough to bear the increased traffic. Horse-drawn cars crowded the streets, making movement almost impossible. Factories and trains polluted the air, while sewage sometimes contaminated drinking water and spread disease. Cities lacked the ability to deliver essential services — like clean water, garbage collection, and public schools — to so many residents. As cities grew, whole families crowded into tenements — single-room apartments often without heat or lighting. Frequently many families shared a single toilet.
Inadequate Public Services. Cities lacked the ability to deliver increased public services — hospitals, police forces, schools, fire departments, street cleaning, and garbage collection.			Transportation. Horse-drawn coaches and later electric trolleys were needed to transport workers to their jobs. To eliminate the pollution created by coaches and trolleys, New York City built a subway in 1900. By 1930, New York City had the world's largest subway system.
	' b THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY GROWING CITIES |		
			:,
Overcrowding. Families were crowded into tenements (small apartment buildings). These tenements often lacked daylight, heat, fresh air, and adequate plumbing.
Social Tensions. In cities, rich people lived next door to the poor. Seeing the luxuries of the wealthy distressed poor people and increased social tensions and crimes.
CHAPTER 6: American Society in Transition 85
While the political machines were corrupt, they did play a useful role. They helped immigrants settle into their new homeland, find housing, and obtain jobs. They also helped immigrants become naturalized citizens and even provided money to help them through hard times. The political machines were often the ones to get a street paved, extend a water pipe, or approve construction. But these services came at a very high price.

In the late nineteenth century, European immigrants flooded American cities in search of work and places to live. In many of the largest American cities, European immigrants even came to outnumber native-born Americans.
WHY IMMIGRANTS CAME
Immigrants have always come to the United States for a variety of reasons. Historians often divide these into “push” and “pull” factors. A desire to escape oppression, poverty, religious discrimination or ethnic persecution “pushed” immigrants out of their homelands. A belief that America offered freedom and economic opportunity as well as ties to relatives already living here generally “pulled” immigrants to these shores. They saw the United States as a land of unbounded opportunities. Immigrants who fled oppressive regimes in Europe yearned to live in a democratic society like the United States.

Before 1880, most immigrants to America came from parts of Northern Europe, especially Great Britain, Ireland, and Germany. In general, these immigrants were Protestants, except for large numbers of Irish Catholics. Most of these early immigrants spoke English.
Name______________________________________________________
CHAPTER 6: American Society in Transition 87
In their own communities, immigrants could speak their native language, attend their own churches and synagogues, and be among relatives and friends from the “Old Country.” Some of these communities even published newspapers in their own native language. However, living In these ethnic ghettos also isolated Immigrants from mainstream American life, making it harder for them to adopt new customs.
THE PROCESS OF AMERICANIZATION
While some adult immigrants attended night school to leam English, most were too busy working and caring for their families to spend time learning a new language or culture. It was left to their children to leam English and become “Americanized” — learning to dress, speak, and act like other Americans.
These immigrant children eventually became “assimilated” — similar to other Americans. America was seen as a “melting pot” in which immigrants were “melted” down and reshaped. America’s public schools greatly assisted in this process. Often Americanization was accompanied by conflict. For example, immigrant parents might desire an arranged marriage for their children, while their children insisted on finding their own marriage partners according to the American custom.
Immigrant children learn to speak English in a New York City public school.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
The following passage is from a letter that former President Theodore Roosevelt wrote to the President of the American Defense Society in January 1919:
“We should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good
faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else. It is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin .... There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn’t an American. We have room for but one language, and that is the English language, and we have room for but one loyalty and that is loyalty to the American people. We can have no ‘50-50’ allegiance in this country. Either a man is an American and nothing else, or he is not an American at all.”

THE INDIAN WARS
After the Civil War, Union troops were stationed in forts along the frontier. They defeated several of the tribes on the Great Plains and Southwest during the Indian Wars and moved them onto reservations. Typical was the contest with the Sioux Indians. After the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of Dakota in 1875, the Sioux were asked to move from their sacred grounds. The following year, Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse defeated General George Custer and killed 264 soldiers at Little Big Hom. Within two years, Crazy Horse was captured and killed and most of the Sioux were forced onto reservations. However, unrest among the Sioux in 1890 led to the slaughter of 300 unarmed Sioux men, women and children by machine gun fire at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.
THE IMPACT OF THE RAILROADS
As you learned in the last chapter, the Transcontinental Railroad, completed in 1869, reduced the journey from New York to San Francisco from six months to just ten days. Rail travel increased dramatically with its completion. Soon the United States led the world, with more railroad track mileage than England and France combined. The railroads attracted an increasing number of settlers to the west. Settlers could now ship their crops by rail to distant Eastern markets.
Railroad tracks also often ran through Native American territories, leading to new conflicts. From 1870 to 1890, the herds of buffalo on the Great Plains were destroyed by sharpshooters traveling by train. This development affected the ability of the Plains Indians to remain on the Plains.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
When the Texas legislature was considering a bill to protect the buffalo from sharpshooters, General Philip Sheridan spoke out against the bill:
“These men have done more in the last two years, and will do more in the next year, to settle the Indian question, than the entire regular army has done in the last forty years.
They are destroying the Indians’ [food supply] . And it is a well known fact that an army losing its base of supplies is placed at a great disadvantage. Send them powder and lead, if you will; but for a lasting peace, let them kill, skin, and sell until all of the buffaloes are exterminated. Then your prairies can be covered with speckled cattle.”

How did Sheridan feel about the slaughter of buffalo on the Great Plains? What effect did he predict if the slaughter continued?
Name_____________________________________
CHAPTER 6: American Society in Transition
93
In the late 1870s and 1880s, the herds were driven farther north a year before they were ready for slaughter. They fattened themselves by grazing on the plains of Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. However, by 1886, overgrazing had destroyed much of the grass.
Sheepherders and farmers had bought up much of the open range and enclosed it with barbed wire fences. Two severe winters and very hot summers killed millions of cattle in 1886-1887, finally ending the long drive.
But cattle ranchers remained, breeding cattle on the “closed range,” and sending their cattle eastwards by train each year to be fattened by eastern farmers.
FARMING ON THE GREAT PLAINS
The railroads also led farmers to occupy the Great Plains. The Homestead Act and the sale of railroad land-grants stimulated the movement of farmers westwards. The railroads made it possible for farmers on the Great Plains to ship their crops to the East. About half of the settlers were immigrants from Europe; the other half were the children of farmers from the East and Midwest.
At first, these farmers faced the hostility of both Indians and cattlemen. The Indians were defeated by federal troops in the “Indian Wars.” The cattlemen formed associations and hired men to commit acts of violence against the early homesteaders. Eventually, the farmers won this conflict because they came in greater numbers and were able to enclose their lands with barbed wire.
The farmers faced many natural obstacles on the Great Plains. From railroad advertisements, they had expected to find well-watered, wooded lands. Instead, when they arrived, they found little rainfall, few trees, tough soil, extreme temperatures, plagues of grasshoppers, and personal isolation. Some starved or returned to the East. Families that stayed were forced to do endless hours of heavy work. During the winter months, families might be snowed in for months on end. With technological ingenuity, they were able to overcome many obstacles. To make up for the lack of trees, they built sod-houses from clumps of grass and soil; they used barbed wire to keep cattle and other animals off their farms. They used steel plows to turn the soil, drilling equipment to dig deep water wells and windmills to haul water. They used harvesters and threshers to farm more acres with fewer workers.

Native American Indians once occupied all of the present United States. They were composed of many different groups, speaking hundreds of different languages. The advancing line of settlement and diseases from Eurasia like smallpox severely reduced Native American populations and pushed them westwards.
GOVERNMENT POLICY
From 1830 to 1890, the U.S. government systematically followed a policy of pushing Native Americans from their traditional lands onto government reservations in the West.
Forced Removal. In 1830, Congress ordered the removal of all Native American Indians to west of the Mississippi. Nearly one-quarter of the Cherokees perished on the journey westward, known as the Trail of Tears.		Flood of Settlers. Large numbers of settlers overwhelmed the Native Americans. In 1869, the Transcontinental Railroad was completed. Along with the Homestead Act, the continuation of railroad lines made Native American lands even more desirable.
		
FACTORS ERODING NATIVE AMERICAN CONTROL OF THE WEST

Warfare. The technological superiority of the U.S. government made resistance futile. The Indian Wars, which pitted settlers and federal troops against Native American Indians, lasted from 1860 to 1890.		Destruction of Natural Environment. Competition between settlers, miners, and farmers for the land led to the destruction of the natural environment on which Native Americans depended for their livelihood.
THE RESERVATION
Once a particular Native American tribe submitted to federal authority, its members were settled on a reservation. Reservation lands were usually smaller than the lands from which the tribe was removed and often consisted of undesirable land. The federal government promised food, blankets, and seed but this policy clashed with tribal customs, since Native Americans were traditionally hunters, not farmers.
Under the new act, Indians did not need to give up tribal lands or customs to become citizens, as they did under the Dawes Act. Some historians see the act as a reward for Native American enlistment as soldiers in World War I. Since Native American Indians had served the nation in wartime, they deserved to be given American citizenship. Ten years later, the Dawes Act was replaced by an act guaranteeing tribal self-government.

Immigration
Urbanization. Movement of people from the countryside to cities.
Urbanization brought many problems:
•	Crowded tenements: one-room apartments that lacked daylight, adequate plumbing.
•	Pollution, sewage contamination of water.
•	Inability to supply essential public services — hospitals, police, schools, and clean streets.
•	Political corruption: "Political machines" run by political "bosses" helped immigrants but stole from city governments through overpriced contracts.

A.
Farmers faced problems in the late 19th century. New farm machinery and the opening of the Great Plains led to overproduction. Food prices fell, as farmers’ expenses remained the same. Farmers fell into debt, while they were also charged excessive rates by railroads and grain storage operators. B.
Farmers organized in the Grange Movement to fight for their special interests. They passed laws regulating railroad rates. When the law was overturned by the Supreme Court, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act (1887). C.
Farmers next combined with industrial workers and miners into the Populist Party. They advocated many reforms that were later adopted by the major political parties and enacted by Congress. Populists believed the shortage of currency was responsible for falling prices. In 1896 and 1900, William Jennings Bryan was the candidate for the Populists and Democrats. Bryan lost both elections. D.
The Progressive Movement flourished in 1900-1920. Like the Populists, Progressives sought reform. They were mainly educated members of the middle class. They sought to correct abuses of big business, such as exploiting workers. They also sought to reform the corrupt practices of government. The roots of the movement were with the Populists, muckrackers, and Social Gospel Movement. Muckrakers, like Upton Sinclair, were investigative reporters. E.
States passed political reforms and social legislation. F.
On the eve of the Progressive Era, the federal government was reformed by the Pendleton Act, which reduced the number of political appointments and replaced them with candidates who had passed a competitive examination. G.
Progressive reforms were introduced at the national level by Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. H.
Theodore Roosevelt believed in a strong Presidency, and used his powers to safeguard the public interest. He used the anti-trust laws to curb the unfair practices of business. His Square Deal program passed laws protecting consumers. J.
William Howard Taft continued most of Roosevelt’s policies. When Roosevelt decided to run as the Bull Moose candidate in 1912, he split the Republican Party, helping Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic candidate, to win the election. K.
Woodrow Wilson furthered Progressive reforms with his New Freedom program. He lowered tariff duties and introduced a graduated income tax, made possible by the 16th Amendment. He created the Federal Reserve System to control the nation’s money supply. To control the unfair practices of big business, he passed the Clayton Anti-trust Act, creating the Federal Trade Commission.
L.
In art and literature, realism was popular in the late 19th century. Realism attempted to show things as they were, and gave writers and artists a way to depict the hardships and abuses of the new industrial workers. Some of the greatest writers included Horatio Alger, Mark Twain, and Kate Chopin. Noted artists included James McNeil Whistler, Winslow Homer, and Thomas Eakins. PROJECT WITHOUT PERMISSION
CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 107
GRANGER COOPERATIVES
Grangers tried to eliminate middlemen by forming farmers’ cooperatives to buy machinery, fertilizers, and manufactured goods in large numbers at a discount. The cooperatives also sold their crops directly to city markets. Because of a lack of business experience, many of the Granger cooperatives failed.
THE GRANGER LAWS
Farmers mainly blamed the railroads for their difficulties. They felt they were being overcharged by railroads and by grain storage operators. In several Midwestern states, Grangers elected candidates to state legislatures who promised reforms. These states passed laws regulating railroad and grain storage rates. In Munn v. Illinois (1877), the Supreme Court upheld the right of a state to regulate businesses that affected the public interest within the state.
However, in 1886 the Supreme Court reversed itself in a case involving the state regulation of railroad rates. The Court ruled that only Congress could regulate rates on interstate commerce. This decision ended the state regulation of railroads. The Grangers then turned their attention to Congress for help. As you learned in the previous chapter, Congress then passed the Interstate Commerce Act (1887). This act prohibited railroads from charging more for short hauls than for long hauls over the same route. The Interstate Commerce Commission, created to investigate complaints and to enforce the act, was the first federal government agency to regulate unfair business practices. These new regulations marked a change from the laissez-faire economy of the past.
Create a graphic organizer showing the costs and benefits of the Interstate Commerce Act (1887).
In 1892, farmers gave their support to the Populist Party, a new national political party representing the “common man” — farmers, industrial workers, and miners — in the battle against banking and railroad interests. Women played a prominent role in the Populist Movement as speakers and organizers.
THE POPULIST PLATFORM
Populists were convinced that rich industrialists and bankers had a stranglehold on government. Like the Grangers before them, the Populists wanted government to take a larger role, ending oppression, injustice, and poverty. In 1892, the Populists held a national convention at Omaha, Nebraska, where they chose a Presidential candidate. They also drew up a party platform that had several innovative proposals:
CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 109
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In 1896, the Democratic Party held its National Convention to pick their Presidential candidate. William Jennings Bryan’s “Cross of Gold” Speech was so powerful that he won the nomination:
“My friends, the question we are to decide is: upon which side will the Democratic Party fight; upon the side of 4the idle holders of idle capital’ or upon the side of 4the struggling masses’? That question the party must answer. You tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard; we reply that the great cities rest upon our broad and fertile prairies. Bum down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic. But destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.”
Bryan delivering his speech.
Which groups did Bryan appeal to in his speech to the Democratic Convention? How did he try to show that farmers were superior?
Election of 1900. Four years later, Bryan ran against McKinley again. When McKinley won a second time, this virtually brought an end to the Populist Party. New gold discoveries, higher farm prices, and rural migration to the cities weakened national interest in a separate farmer’s party in later years.

THE LEGACY OF POPULISM:
The Role of Third Parties
The Populist Party appeared suddenly in the 1890s and disappeared just as fast. Yet it left its mark on American history. Third parties often have an impact on the political process. They provide an outlet for minorities to voice grievances and generate new Ideas.
CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 111
The Progressive Movement flourished between 1900 and the start of World War I. Progressives took their name from their belief in “progress.” Although the Progressives borrowed ideas from the Populists and the labor movement, they differed in important ways. Progressives were mainly middle-class city dwellers, rather than farmers and workers. Their activities reflected the rising influence of the middle class. Writers, lawyers, ministers, and college professors provided their leadership.
The primary goal of the Progressives was to correct the political and economic injustices that had resulted from America’s industrialization. Progressives were appalled at the increasing inequalities between the wealthy and the poor. They did not oppose industrialization, but they wanted to use the power of government to correct its evils so that all
Americans, not just the wealthy, could enjoy better lives. To achieve this, the Progressives felt they also had to reform government itself — which had become corrupted by big business and political machines.
A poster from the Progressive Era alludes to class warfare.
Progressivism arose out of a combination of Protestant Evangelicalism, the activities of journalists, Populism, and the reaction of the educated middle class to abuses in industry and government. Progressives often felt threatened by the rise of big business, large labor unions, and corrupt political bosses. They acted out of a sense of moral responsibility, often based on their religious beliefs. Progressives exalted science and placed great confidence in the ability of using a scientific approach to solve social problems. Rather than accept corruption and poverty, they believed the government should take positive steps to identify problems and promote progress.
THE SOCIAL GOSPEL MOVEMENT
In the late nineteenth century, a new social movement emerged that was spearheaded by Protestant clergymen. Protestant ministers in the Social Gospel Movement called for social reforms — including the abolition of child labor and safer working conditions. They objected to the harsh realities of unregulated free enterprise and emphasized the ancient idea that each man was his brother’s keeper. Instead of accepting the existence of social problems as God’s will, groups like the Salvation Army emphasized the Christian duty to help those who were less fortunate.
CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 113
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Upton Sinclair’s book The Jungle portrayed the new industrial economy as inhumane, destructive, and uncaring. One scene in the book described piles of rat-infested, rotting meat being used to make sausages:
“[T]he meat would be shoveled into carts, and _________________
the man who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he saw one—there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.
There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner, and so they made a practice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage.
How might a reader in 1906 have reacted to this passage? Explain your answer.


The early Progressives identified political and social problems and made individual or local efforts to remedy them. The Progressives provide one of the best examples of Americans attempting to overcome problems through reform. The demand for reform has been a continuing theme throughout American history. Reform movements are usually based on the belief that society can be made better.
THE SOCIAL REFORMERS
Progressives were so shaken by the abuses of industrial society that some even made individual efforts at social reform. Settlement houses were started in slum neighborhoods by Progressives like
Jane Addams.
A settlement house was an all-purpose community center for poor people living in crowded city neighborhoods. The settlement house provided child care, nursing services, and English lessons to immigrants. Most of the settlement houses were staffed by volunteers. Jane Addams and her volunteers actually lived at Hull House among the people they were trying to help. Addams once described the main purpose of a settlement house as being to “help the foreign-bom conserve the value of their past life and to bring them into contact with a better class of Americans.”
Jane Addams (1860-1935)

CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 115
They also expanded city services to deal with urban overcrowding, fire hazards, and the lack of public services. Municipal governments often took direct ownership of utilities, such as water, electricity and gas. Some called this “gas and water” socialism. In some cities, Progressives even introduced new forms of municipal government to discourage corruption, such as governance by a city-manager or commission.
THE REFORM OF STATE GOVERNMENT
At the state level, Progressive governors like Robert LaFollette in Wisconsin and Theodore Roosevelt in New York similarly took steps to free their state governments from corruption and the influence of big business. LaFollette, for example, challenged political bosses and reduced the influence of railroad owners.
Progressives also introduced important political reforms to many states, such as the initiative, referendum, and recall. The purpose of these reforms was to end corruption and to make state government more directly accountable to the people. These reforms sought to raise the level of public participation in the political process and to give citizens more of a direct voice in state government by by-passing politicians. Many of these measures were borrowed from the Populists:
							
	Secret Ballot. Voters were less subject to pressure and intimidation when they could vote in secret.			Initiative. Voters could directly introduce bills in the state legislature and could vote on whether they wanted a bill passed.		Referendum. Voters could compel legislators to place a bill on the ballot for approval.

ROOSEVELT'S SQUARE DEAL
Before the Progressive Era, manufacturers could make wild and unsupported claims for medicines. There were no government agencies to check the purity and safety of food products. In the laissez-faire economy, consumers were supposed to look out for themselves. Roosevelt promised Americans a “Square Deal.” He launched new laws to protect consumer health and prevent false advertising. This Progressive legislation limited the operation of the laissez-faire economy. Roosevelt also worked to preserve the nation’s natural resources.

Although Roosevelt was young and popular, no President had ever run for more than two terms. In 1908, Roosevelt refused to break with tradition to run again. Instead, he helped his friend William Howard Taft win the Republican nomination.
A conservative Progressive, Taft was elected President with Roosevelt’s endorsement. Taft continued many of Roosevelt’s policies, such as trust-busting. However, Taft was not a skilled politician and alienated Progressives. He promised a lower tariff but was unable to get it passed. He returned to public sale some of the federal lands Roosevelt had withdrawn to protect the environment.
LABOR
During the Progressive Era, public attitudes towards unions began to change. One event that contributed to this change was the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in 1911, which killed 146 garment workers. Public sympathy for the workers grew when it was learned that the factory doors had been bolted shut from the outside, that the building lacked a sprinkler system, and that it had only one inadequate fire escape. Soon after this tragedy, Congress passed legislation sympathetic to unions.
CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 121
Witnesses thought owners were tossing fabric out of windows, but soon realized it was workers jumping to their deaths.
Department of Labor (1913). Congress created a separate Cabinet post to study the problems of labor, collect statistics and enforce federal labor laws. The Department of Labor was the direct result of a campaign by organized labor for a “Voice in the Cabinet,” and a goal of the Progressive Movement. The purpose of the department was “to promote and develop the welfare of working people, and to improve their working conditions.”
Clayton Anti-Trust Act (1914). A provision of this act prevented courts from applying anti-trust laws to restrict unions. The act also banned the use of federal injunctions (court orders) to prohibit strikes in labor disputes.
Child Labor Act (1916). Wilson passed a law prohibiting the sale of goods created by child labor in interstate commerce. However, this law was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court two years later.

The Federal Reserve Act created the Federal Reserve Board, a government agency that controls monetary policy. The Federal Reserve sets the interest rates at which it lends money to banks. It also decides how much of their money banks can lend, and buys government bonds to affect the amount of money in circulation.

CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 123
The Progressive Movement was accompanied by significant gains in women’s rights, for which women had been fighting for nearly a century.
In the early nineteenth century, the United States was a patriarchal society — men held positions of authority and women were considered to be inferior. Women lacked the right to vote, to serve on juries, or to hold public office. They were excluded from public life and were left in charge of the home and children. In most states, once a woman married, she lost control of her property and wages to her husband.
By the mid-nineteenth century, some women began to organize. In 1848, they held a convention in Seneca Falls, New York. The convention passed a resolution paraphrasing the Declaration of Independence. It proclaimed that women were equal to men and deserved the right to vote.
After the Civil War, women reformers hoped that freed slaves and women would be enfranchised at the same time. Women reformers were bitterly disappointed when the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments gave citizenship and the right to vote, or suffrage, to male freedmen, but not to women.
SUSAN B. ANTHONY
In 1872, Susan B. Anthony, a prominent reformer, attempted to vote in Rochester, New York, on the grounds that she was citizen and had that right under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, a judge refused to grant her the right to vote. In 1874, the Supreme Court then ruled that although women were citizens, they could not vote. Voting, according to the court, was not necessarily a “privilege” of citizenship.
Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906)
The fact that women did not have suffrage continued to be seen as a symbol of their inferior status and a violation of basic democratic principles. Anthony and other women reformers were able to obtain suffrage in a number of Western states, but they could not succeed in introducing a constitutional amendment requiring all states to give women the vote.
By 1890, the failure to achieve women’s suffrage led several women’s groups to merge together into the National American Woman Suffrage Association, under the leadership of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.
Name______________________________________________
CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 125
THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT COMES TO AN END
The passage of women’s suffrage was the last notable reform of the Progressive Era. By 1920, the force of the Progressive Movement had spent itself. Americans had met many of the challenges posed by industrialization and were once again poised for economic growth.
The late nineteenth century was one of the most fertile periods of American literature. As the nation grew, the increasing rates of literacy, the rapid growth in urbanization, a rising population, and an increase in middle-class affluence provided a fertile environment for readers interested in understanding these rapid shifts in culture. The prevalence of newspapers and magazines, as well as cheap “dime novels,” created a market for literary works. Improvements in transportation and communications made it easier to travel and to share experiences. American writers were also deeply influenced by European novelists.
During these years, realism — defined as “nothing more or less than the truthful treatment of material” — was the leading literary fashion. Realists described life with as much detail as they could. Realism provided an opportunity to show the impact of industrialization and social change on people.
Just after the Civil War, the novels of Horatio Alger (1834-1899) praised hard work and discipline, and saw wealth as a sign of divine favor. His first novel, Ragged Dick (1868), was his most popular, and remained in print for the next forty years. The story of each novel was simple — a poor boy with few prospects significantly improves his position in life due to hard work and help from adults.
The novels of Mark Twain (1835-1910) reflected the differences between pre-Civil War society and afterwards. Twain associated the Old South with romanticism and the present with realism. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) described his childhood adventures in fictional form. The Gilded Age (1873) depicted the boom times after the Civil War, and gave a name to a historical period. His greatest work, Huckleberry Finn, treated the moral conflicts created by slavery. Twain’s use of regional accents gave his works a sense of realism.
William Dean Howells (1837-1920) was an important magazine editor who promoted realism. His novel, The Rise of Silas Lapham, described the struggles of the new rich to find acceptance in established society.

Ess| iiAL Questions
How did the Spanish-American War mark a "turning point" in American history? What strategic and political factors led America to become an imperial power? What were the main consequences of American imperialism?
J


This chapter looks at American foreign policy. Foreign policy refers to a country's policies towards other countries. Social scientists believe there are certain characteristics that make foreign policy special.
International Anarchy. Each independent, sovereign nation has its own laws that citizens must obey. If citizens fail to obey these laws, they can be punished. Sovereign countries, however, are not subject to such higher laws. For this reason, social scientists say that sovereign nations exist in a system of international anarchy. Each nation must depend on its own military and economic power to survive. On the other hand, countries usually follow some rules and customs to get along with one another.
Balance of Power. When one country becomes too powerful, other countries sometimes band together in an alliance or coalition to protect themselves and make sure the threatening power does not become any stronger. This tendency is known as maintaining the balance of power.
Control of U.S. Foreign Policy. In the United States, the Constitution places control of foreign policy in the hands of both the President and Congress. While the President and Secretary of State handle day-to-day diplomacy, they need Congress to vote funds to support their policies, or to declare war.
Traditional Foreign Policy. For much of their early history, Americans felt safe behind their two oceans. These oceans protected Americans from attack. President Washington had warned Americans to avoid entanglements with European nations, who were frequently at war with each other. Instead, he advised Americans to focus on the Western Hemisphere. For the first 150 years after independence, Americans largely followed Washington's advice.
National Interests. In the conduct of foreign policy, each nation is usually guided by its national interests. For the United States, these include security from attack, protecting American investments, and promoting American democracy and its way of life. To evaluate a particular foreign policy, you must determine how well it promotes these goals.

CHAPTER 8: America Builds an Empire 139
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In this climate of public opinion, President McKinley felt he had no choice but to ask Congress for permission to intervene in Cuba:
“[O]ur acts hitherto have been an unselfish desire for peace and prosperity in Cuba. The forced intervention of the United States as a neutral to stop the war may be briefly summarized as follows
First, in the cause of humanity to put an end to the barbarities, bloodshed, and miseries now existing there .... It is our duty, for it is right at our door. Second, we owe it to our citizens in Cuba ... to terminate the conditions that deprive them of legal protection. Third, the right to intervene may be justified by the serious injury to the commerce, trade, and business of our people .... Fourth, the present condition of affairs in Cuba is a constant menace to our peace — all these and others that I need not mention, with the resulting strained relations, are a constant menace to our peace and compel us to keep a semi-war footing with a nation with which we were at peace.”
Explain how would you have voted as a member of Congress in 1898.
Teddy Roosevelt (center) with his Rough Riders after taking San Juan Hill.
The Spanish-American War was fought on two fronts — in the Pacific and the Caribbean. Shortly after the start of the war, the U.S. Pacific fleet sailed to the Philippines to aid Filipino rebels already in revolt against Spain. The navy defeated a squadron of Spanish ships in Manila Bay.
Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt raised a volunteer force, known as the “Rough Riders.”
Acting with other army regiments, they defeated Spanish forces at San Juan Hill in Cuba. The U.S. Navy also took Guantanamo Bay. Nevertheless, some U.S. Army troops had to withdraw from Cuba because they were contracting Yellow Fever. Other forces occupied Guam and Puerto Rico. Within four months, Spain was defeated. American forces were left in occupation of the Philippines, Cuba,
Puerto Rico, and Guam.
THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR AS A TURNING POINT
The Spanish-American War marked the end of Spain’s colonial empire and the emergence of the United States as a world power. The war had let the United States demonstrate its naval strength to the world. It also raised a critical issue for Americans: What should the United States do with the former Spanish colonies it was now occupying? Many historians see the war as a turning point because the United States had awakened to its potential as a world power.
CHAPTER 8: America BuiLds an Empire 141
By the war’s end, the United States was occupying four of Spain’s former colonies. Many Americans believed they should annex them. These American “imperialists” saw this as a unique opportunity, pointing out how European powers had recently acquired colonies in Africa and Asia. They believed the United States should take its own colonies before there was nothing else left to grab.
The imperialists gave these arguments on behalf of U.S. colonial expansion:
Need For Raw Materials and Markets. The United States was now an industrial power. Colonies could provide needed raw materials for factories, a guaranteed market for manufacturers, and a place for farmers to sell their surplus crops.			Strategic Reasons. Some Americans believed colonies would promote American naval strength. With naval bases throughout the world, America would be able to maintain a powerful navy to protect its interests.
			
REASONS FOR COLONIAL EXPANSION
it ———1 			
Nationalism. Some saw colonial expansion as a means of showing that the United States was a great and powerful nation. They argued that the European powers were gathering colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, and that the United States should grab its own colonies before nothing was left.			Attitudes towards other Peoples. Many Americans believed in Anglo-Saxon superiority — that Americans were a "superior race" that should rule others. Progressives believed that by spreading American institutions, they could help other, less fortunate peoples. Missionaries wanted to convert native peoples to Christianity.
Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan, President of the Naval War College, was America’s leading advocate for imperial expansion. Theodore Roosevelt was one of Mahan’s followers. In his The Influence of Sea Power upon History (1890), Mahan focused on the harsh political realities of expansion. Mahan argued that to achieve world power, a country needed a powerful navy. For this, a country also needed a large merchant marine to supply its sailors. Finally, a world power required colonies and naval bases to provide coaling stations for its steamships, and to create the trade needed to support its merchant ships.
Because other powers were also competing for naval supremacy Alfred Thayer Mahan and world markets, Mahan believed it was essential for Americans	7
to seize control of Pacific trade routes, to construct a canal through Central America, and to dominate the Caribbean region. Geographically, Americans would then control the sea lanes from the Caribbean Sea across the Pacific Ocean all the way to China and Japan.
CHAPTER 8: America Builds an Empire 143
In the end, the Imperialists won the argument. After the Spanish-American War, the United States acquired a colonial empire consisting of the Philippines, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Samoa, and Midway. One U.S. Senator and Anti-Imperialist League member mourned “the danger that we are to be transformed from a Republic, founded on the Declaration of Independence, into a vulgar, common empire, founded on force.” A Congressional resolution, passed just before the war, had guaranteed the independence of Cuba, but even this island came under the informal control of the United States. Cubans were forced to agree to the Platt Amendment, which gave the United States the right to intervene in Cuban affairs at any time.

CHAPTER 8: America BuiLds an Empire 145
Geography placed Americans in an advantageous position for trade with East Asia: they were separated from this region only by the Pacific Ocean. Clipper ships brought Chinese tea and other goods from East Asia to the United States. After 1898, control of several Pacific islands gave the United States greater influence in the Pacific. These colonial acquisitions also increased American opportunities for trade with both China and Japan.
CHINA
In China, European powers had already established exclusive “spheres of influence” (areas where they enjoyed special privileges) in the 1850s. The United States did not have a sphere of influence there, but had long carried on active trade in China. If other nations were permitted to partition China, the United States would likely be blocked from future economic activities. U.S. Secretary of State John Hay was anxious to protect American businessmen and investors there. He worried that American trade
would be shut out of China by these European powers. Hay saw China as a vital market for America’s new industrial economy.
In 1899, Hay announced the “Open Door” Policy, giving equal trading rights to all foreign nations in China. Hay sent notes to the other major powers and declared his policy to be in effect.
Only a few months later, in 1900, a rebellion erupted in China.
It was led by the Boxers, a group opposing Western influence in China. The Boxer Rebellion threatened the lives of foreigners living in China. An international army, with U.S. participation, was sent to China where it crushed the rebellion. Hay announced that the United States would oppose any attempt by other nations to use the rebellion as an excuse to dismember China.
JAPAN
The United States opened an isolationist Japan to Western trade and influence when Commodore Matthew Perry landed there with American gun ships in 1853. By the 1890s, Japan had adopted Western ways and had become the first Asian industrial power. Japan also adopted imperialist policies, defeating China in 1894. In 1905, Japan surprised the West by defeating Russia in the Russo-Japanese War. President Roosevelt brought the Russians and Japanese together and negotiated a peaceful settlement in the Treaty of Portsmouth (1905). He won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.

CHAPTER 8: America Builds an Empire 147
CUBA
Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean. As you learned earlier, Congress had passed a resolution before the Spanish-American War not to annex Cuba. Nevertheless, after the war, Cuba became a “protectorate” under American control. U.S. forces remained on the island, and American businesses invested heavily in Cuba. Cubans were forced to agree to the Platt Amendment, which gave the United States the right to intervene in Cuban affairs at any time. The Platt Amendment was not repealed until the 1930s.
PANAMA CANAL
During the Spanish-American War, warships in the Pacific fleet had to sail 16,000 miles around the tip of South America to reach the Caribbean. This highlighted the need for a canal to send ships back and forth between the two oceans instead of having two separate naval fleets. The Isthmus of Panama, the narrowest point in Central America, was the best place to build the canal.
At this time, Panama was a part of Colombia. The United States and the government of Colombia entered into negotiations but could not agree on terms. While President Roosevelt was waiting to hear from Colombia, he struck a
deal with Panamanian rebels who wished to obtain their independence. Roosevelt sent a U.S. warship to Panama to protect the rebels when they took action. Immediately afterwards, Roosevelt recognized Panama as a new country. In return, the new government of Panama gave the United States complete control of a 10-mile strip of rainforest through the center of Panama, known as the Panama Canal Zone.
The Challenges of Building the Canal. President Roosevelt ordered the building of the canal almost at once. The construction of the canal presented as many problems as the political obstacles. Construction of its 51-mile length took 10 years (1903-1914) to complete, at a cost of thousands of lives and $400 million.
Because the canal crossed landforms at different elevations, engineers had to design a series of six giant locks. Panama’s tropical climate posed special challenges: workers labored in intense heat as they cut through mountains and dense rainforests. Heavy rains caused frequent mudslides. Dr. Walter Reed had just discovered that yellow fever was spread by mosquitoes. To reduce the threat of yellow fever, Dr. William Gorgas of the U.S. Army, ordered all swamps drained, vegetation cut down, and all standing water sprayed with oil to prevent further breeding of mosquito larvae.

Wilson quickly followed the pattern of Presidents Roosevelt and Taft by sending troops to Haiti, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic to protect American interests. President Wilson also expanded America’s colonial empire by purchasing the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917.
Mexico was already undergoing a violent revolution when Woodrow Wilson became President. Wilson refused to recognize its new government, which had seized power through violence. Instead, he adopted a policy of “watchful waiting.” When troops of the rebel leader Pancho Villa murdered Americans in New Mexico and retreated across the border,
Wilson reacted. He sent an American Expeditionary Force into Mexico under General John J. Pershing to apprehend him. Nevertheless, Pancho Villa eluded capture. Wilson
finally withdrew these troops in 1917, when America entered World War I in Europe.

CHAPTER 9: America in World War I 155
IMPORTANT IDEAS
■ill
A.
Nationalism, economic rivalry, the alliance system, and militarism contributed to the outbreak of World War I in Europe. In 1914, Europe was divided Into two alliances. The spark that began the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Slav nationalists with Serbian help. B.
German troops marched through neutral Belgium and invaded France, but were halted before they could take Paris. New and improved weapons, like the machine gun, created a new form of warfare. Each side dug trenches, set up machine guns, and put land mines in the “no-man’s land” between the trenches. C.
Germany tried to use its U-boats {submarines) to break the British naval blockade that sought to starve Germany and Austria-Hungary into submission. D.
By 1918, the war had become deadlocked. Neither side was strong enough to overcome the other. E.
President Woodrow Wilson tried to follow America’s traditional policy of neutrality, by not taking sides in the early years of the war. However, the United States shared its language, political system, and many traditions with Great Britain and France. Americans were shocked by Germany’s invasion of Belgium, which was sensationalized in the press. Germany sent a message offering to help Mexico regain the American Southwest if it joined the war on Germany’s side. F.
German submarines sank ships with American passengers, such as the Lusitania and the Sussex. Germany attempted to avoid such incidents, but Americans were supplying Britain with war materials while Germany was suffering from a British blockade. In 1917, Germany announced it would resume unrestricted submarine warfare and sank more ships. Wilson asked Congress to declare war. G.
The United States prepared the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), under the command of General John Pershing. When the AEF arrived in Europe, it broke the deadlock in the war. Men like Alvin York showed great bravery in the war. H.	| President Wilson announced America’s war aims in the Fourteen Points before
the war’s end. The Fourteen Points demanded the reorganization of Europe based on nationalism. Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey would be divided into smaller national states. Poland would be restored as an independent country. Economic barriers like tariffs would be lowered. Finally, Wilson envisioned a League of Nations — an international peace-keeping organization.
I.
Germany surrendered in 1918. President Wilson traveled to Europe to participate in the Paris Peace Conference. To get his allies to agree to the League of Nations, Wilson made many concessions. Against Wilson’s wishes, the Versailles Treaty treated Germany harshly. Germany was made to accept responsibility for starting the war and had to pay reparations to the victorious allies. J.
When Wilson returned home, the U.S. Senate, led by Henry Cabot Lodge, rejected the treaty. The United States never joined the League of Nations. CHAPTER 9: America in World War I 157
Austria gave an ultimatum to Serbia and then invaded Serbia to avenge the assassination. They were encouraged by their ally, Germany. Existing alliances quickly brought the other major powers into the war. Russia was allied to Serbia; Germany was allied to Austria-Hungary; and Britain and France were allied to Russia. What might have been a minor regional crisis quickly escalated into a major European war. The generals on each side hoped for a quick victory before their enemies could get their forces into action.

Military leaders on both sides predicted the war would be over quickly. To avoid a two-front war, German war plans called for their army to march through neutral Belgium to take Paris before Russia could enter the war. The Germans advanced across Belgium into France, but they were stopped before reaching Paris.
New and improved weapons were used to fight the war, including the machine gun, poison gas, submarines, and airplanes. These weapons made it easier to defend positions than to attack. Soldiers dug deep, fortified trenches. Soon trenches extended hundreds of miles along eastern France, on Germany’s “Western Front.”
“Trench warfare” was a new and strange form of warfare that the world had never seen. These trenches were separated by fields of barbed wire and mines known as
“no man’s land.” Anyone who climbed out of the trenches faced instant death from enemy machine gun fire. Soldiers spent years in the trenches, facing shelling from artillery fire for hours each day. Since neither side could advance, fighting lines became stationary.

CHAPTER 9: America in World War I 159
Freedom of the Seas. The main reason for American entry into World War I was German unrestricted submarine warfare:
The British Blockade. A British naval blockade prevented food and arms from being shipped to Germany. Meanwhile, the United States became the main source for Allied arms, supplies and food. The German navy was too weak to break through the British blockade. By using submarines, Germany was able to retaliate by sinking merchant ships delivering goods to Great Britain. However, unlike battleships, submarines had no room to pick up survivors.
+ Sinking of the Lusitania. The Lusitania was a British passenger ship. In 1915, the Lusitania left New York City for Liverpool. Unknown to her passengers, much of the cargo below deck was made up of munitions for the British war effort. A German submarine sank this British passenger ship, killing more than 1,000 passengers, including 128 Americans. The sinking of the Lusitania enraged opinion in the United States.
A
U-boat sank the Lusitania, killing 1,198 passengers Sussex Pledge. The Sussex was a French ship that provided ferry service on the English Channel. After a German submarine attacked the ship in 1916, killing more than 50 passengers, President Wilson threatened to break off relations with Germany. Germany pledged not to sink any more ocean liners without prior warning or providing help to passengers.
Germany Announces Unrestricted Submarine Warfare. Suffering from near-starvation by the British blockade, desperate German leaders announced finally that they would sink all ships in the blockaded areas. This declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare violated the principle of “freedom of the seas” — the right of neutral nations like the United States to ship non-military goods to nations at war. When German submarines then actually attacked American merchant vessels, President Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany.

CHAPTER 9: America in World War I 161
Alvin York (1887-1964) was a devoted Bible reader, and almost avoided military service as a conscientious objector. He was drafted into the army at age 29. In many respects, he was typical of the draftees — underprivileged and undereducated — who were sent to France to make the world “safe for democracy.” In the Battle of the Argonne Forest, with nothing more than his rifle and pistol, he reportedly killed 25 Germans and captured 132 prisoners.
Alvin York
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The passage below is from The Diary of Alvin York. York was bom in a two-room log cabin in the hills of Tennessee:
“My little old mother and Pastor Pile wanted to get me out [of the army]. Pastor Pile put in a plea to the government that it
was against the religion of our church to fight. He filled the papers out and sent them to me to sign. The army told me all I had to do was to sign them. I refused. My mother, too, put in a plea to get me out as her sole support. My father was dead and I was supporting my family. I had brothers [in Tennessee] that could look after my mother. So I never asked for an exemption from service. I never was a conscientious objector. I didn’t want to fight and kill. But I had to answer the call of my country.”
Imagine you are Sergeant York or some other soldier in the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front during World War I. Write a letter to your family at home describing your experiences.
To fight the war, President Wilson was given sweeping powers by Congress. He established several agencies to regulate the economy during the war. Railroads were placed under direct government control. Congress passed the Selective Service Act (1917) and millions of Americans registered for the draft. Almost two million American troops eventually reached Europe, while women and African Americans filled many of their jobs at home. The cost of the war, about $30 billion, was paid for by higher taxes and war bonds. The war greatly benefited the American economy, since exports to the Allied powers greatly increased.
During the war, civil liberties were curtailed to meet wartime needs. The Espionage Act of 1917 made it a crime to criticize the war effort.

THE U.S. SENATE REJECTS THE TREATY
President Wilson hoped that the League of Nations would prevent future wars, but his opponents in Congress argued that it would drag the country into unnecessary military commitments. Wilson needed two-thirds of the U.S. Senate to ratify the Versailles Treaty, but he rejected any compromise with the Senate.
Henry Cabot Lodge (1850-1924) had studied history and political science at Harvard University. He was a friend of Theodore Roosevelt’s and a strong supporter of imperialism. Lodge had been in charge of the Congressional committee that had investigated the conduct of the U.S. Army in suppressing rebels in the Philippines. He was a strong opponent of the League of Nations. He believed that if the United States joined the League, it would lose its freedom of action.
Henry Cabot Lodge
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Below is a speech by Henry Cabot Lodge, Senate Majority Leader in 1919, He sets forth his objections to the League of Nations:
“The independence of the United States is not only more precious to ourselves but to the world than any single possession.
Is there any country today on the face of the earth which can compare with our liberty, our peace, and our freedom? I will go as far as anyone in world service, but the first step to world service is the maintenance of the United States. I have always loved one flag and I cannot share that devotion [with] a mongrel banner created for a League of Nations. I have never had but one allegiance, and I cannot divide it now. The United States is the world’s best hope, but if you tie her to the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the [troubles] of Europe, you will destroy her power for good and endanger her very existence.”
What reasons does Lodge give for opposing membership in the League of Nations?
To overcome the Senate’s objections, President Wilson decided to appeal directly to American voters for support, He went on a national speaking tour, but he had failed to gauge the feelings of most Americans. During his tour, Wilson suffered a stroke. Later, the Senate refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. Despite Wilson’s grand vision, the United States never joined the League of Nations.
AMERICA RETREATS INTO ISOLATIONISM
By 1919, most Americans were disillusioned with world affairs. The small gains they seemed to have made in World War I came at a terrible cost. Americans once again heeded George Washington’s advice to avoid European entanglements, and they turned their attention towards their material well-being at home.

The weather was gloomy and the air chilled one to the bones. Yet it was with that [methodical] care that is characteristic of worn-out men, that we prepared our foxholes, carrying boards and iron sheets from abandoned machine-gunners’ dugouts to make our “houses” as comfortable as possible, even if only for one night.”

IMPORTANT IDEAS
A.
The 1920s were a period of economic prosperity and of new cultural values. B.
Immediately after the war, Americans experienced a temporary recession as businesses adjusted from a wartime to a peacetime economy. Americans, frightened by the triumph of Communism in Russia, experienced a “Red Scare.” Attorney General Palmer arrested thousands of suspects and deported them. C.
Nativism and racism were also on the rise, and Americans retreated to a more traditional isolationist foreign policy. D.
Three Republican Presidents pursued pro-business policies with low taxes and high tariff rates. Warren Harding proposed a “return to normalcy,” but his administration was beset by corruption as later revealed by the Teapot Dome Scandal and other scandals. Calvin Coolidge believed the “business of America is business,” while Herbert Hoover saw “rugged individualism” as the spirit that had made America into a great nation. E.
Several factors contributed to the economic prosperity of the 1920s. The most important one was the spread of the automobile. Henry Ford used assembly-line production to lower car prices, bringing ownership in reach of most Americans. F.
Electricity and electrical appliances also greatly helped to stimulate the economy. G.
Corporate profits led stock prices to rise. Many Americans became involved in speculation in the stock market and real estate, in the hopes of getting rich. H.
The 1920s saw a clash of cultural values. The Eighteenth Amendment banned the sale of alcoholic beverages. Tennessee passed a law banning the teaching of evolution. This law came to national attention in the Scopes “Monkey Trial.” A teacher broke the law and was defended by Clarence Darrow. William Jennings Bryan helped the prosecution. I.
There was also a rise of Nativist feeling and the introduction of restrictions on immigration, establishing quotas for the first time. Eugenics attempted to promote what were considered to be superior genetic characteristics. J.
Women gained the right to vote with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. The 1920s saw greater freedom for women as they wore less restrictive clothing, entered the work force in greater numbers, and began gaining college educations. K.
Millions of African-Americans began moving from the rural South to cities in the North and Midwest during and after World War I In the Great Migration. L.
The vibrant African-American community in Harlem in New York City became the cultural center of the Harlem Renaissance. Writers like Alaine Locke and Langston Hughes celebrated their heritage. Marcus Garvey attempted to organize African Americans in a Back-to-Africa Movement. M.
Writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald depicted the lifestyles of the young and materialistic rich in the 1920s, while Sinclair Lewis ridiculed American hypocrisy. CHAPTER 10: The "Roaring Twenties" 175
The end of World War I brought new fears to many Americans of Communists, anarchists, and immigrants. Russia had been ill-prepared for the war. In 1917, strikes in cities and soldiers’ mutinies had led to the overthrow of the Tsar. Later in the year, Communist revolutionaries, led by Vladimir Lenin, had seized power.
Communists threatened to spread their revolution to other countries in Europe, like Germany and Hungary. When a wave of strikes also hit the United States in 1919, many Americans feared this was the start of their own Communist revolution. This “Red Scare” created an atmosphere of panic.
Palmer Raids. In January 1919, an Italian anarchist set off a bomb outside the home of Attorney General Mitchell Palmer. The bombing was one in a series of attacks that day on judges, politicians, and law enforcement officials in eight American cities, including Cleveland and New York. The nation demanded that action be taken. This convinced Palmer that a radical plot to overthrow the U.S. government was underway. In January 1920, Palmer ordered the round-up of 4,000 suspects in several cities without warrants. His assistant, J. Edgar Hoover, directed the raids. Palmer arrested men he accused of plotting to overthrow the government. Most were later released, but 600 were eventually deported.
The Sacco and Vanzetti Case. The anti-Communist hysteria affected immigrants as well. Two Italian immigrants, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, were convicted of committing murder during a robbery. The robbery was allegedly committed to obtain funds for an anarchist revolution. Pressure for their release came from around the world. Many Americans feared looking weak to the rest of the world if they let them go. Although the evidence was insufficient to convict them, the judge was extremely partial in his conduct of the trial. Both Sacco and Vanzetti were found guilty and executed in 1927. Supporters of Sacco and Vanzetti’s innocence believed their conviction was due to their anarchist views, despite jurors who insisted that anarchism had played no part in their decision.
Sacco (left) and Vanzetti.
THE RISE OF NATIVISM AND RACISM
The Red Scare, anarchist bombings, and the Sacco and Vanzetti trial contributed to the rise of nativism — a dislike of foreigners. Nativists believed white Protestant Americans were superior to other people. As you will leam later in this chapter, these attitudes led to new restrictions on immigration. The migration of African Americans from the South to Northern cities also led to Increased racial tensions after the war. The Ku Klux Kian, dead for decades, found new life in 1915. Kian members were hostile to immigrants, Catholics, Jews, and African Americans. Major race riots broke out just after the war in many American cities. The worst riot occurred in Chicago, where 38 people were killed. The lynching of African Americans also continued, as well as segregation In the South.

Harding also resisted anti-Semitism. His campaign manager was a Jewish-American from Texas, Albert Lasker, also known as the “Father of Modern Advertising.” Harding signed an act creating child health care centers. He also pursued arms reduction by sponsoring the Washington Naval Conference and supporting U.S. membership in the World Court.
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The message below was delivered by President Harding as part of his Inaugural Address in 1921:
“We must seek the readjustment with care and courage. [W]e must strive for normalcy to reach stability .... The forward course of the business cycle is unmistakable. Peoples are turning from destruction to production. Industry has sensed the changed order and [is] turning to resume their normal, onward way. The call is for productive America to go on. I speak for administrative efficiency, for lightened tax burdens, for sound commercial practices, for adequate credit facilities, for sympathetic concern for all agricultural problems, for the omission of unnecessary interference of government with business, for an end to government’s experiment in business, and for more efficient business in government administration.”
How did Harding intend to return Americans “to normalcy”?
One of Harding’s most serious weaknesses was that he appointed personal friends — the Ohio Gang — who turned out to be dishonest. One Cabinet member, the Secretary of the Interior, leased oil-rich government lands at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, to two business friends in exchange for personal bribes. The Teapot Dome Scandal, uncovered just after Harding’s death in 1923, was one of the worst scandals in U.S. history.
Additional scandals emerged in other departments. Another of Harding’s appointments, Charles Forbes, stole millions from the construction of hospitals for returning war veterans. Because of Harding’s poor choices for Cabinet positions, these scandals have left a lasting stain on his reputation.
As Governor of Massachusetts, Calvin Coolidge had come to national attention during the Boston police strike of 1919. In a telegram to Samuel Gompers, President of the AFL, he wrote, “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anyone, anywhere, any time.” Based on his record as Governor, Coolidge was selected as Harding’s Vice-President. He became President when Harding died suddenly in 1923. Coolidge was then elected for another term in 1924.

Ford’s new assembly line production was so efficient he was able to double wages overnight while slashing prices, Ford wanted to give workers enough buying power to purchase the cars and other goods they were mass-producing.
THE RISE OF OTHER NEW INDUSTRIES
The 1920s saw new discoveries and inventions in almost every field, laying the framework for many new businesses. These inventions included improvements in transmitting electrical power, improved motors, and a new trans-Atlantic telephone service. New household appliances, like the vacuum cleaner, refrigerator and toaster, were also introduced. Radio and motion pictures became widespread. The American chemical industry expanded and the use of oil and natural gas increased. These new industries created new jobs, and changed the ways Americans lived.
Glenn Curtiss. The first airplane, using an engine similar to that in a car, was flown by the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1902. Glenn Curtiss was an early aviation pioneer. In 1908, he turned his attention to designing a seaplane that could take off and land on water. Three years later, he successfully flew his “hydroeroplane” in San Diego Bay, landing on a naval ship. His landing marked the birth of U.S. naval aviation, and convinced the Secretary of the Navy to buy the navy’s first aircraft. In 1912, Curtiss developed a larger “flying boat.” In 1919, he constructed the first airplane to cross the Atlantic Ocean for the U.S. Navy.

Ford Motors was the first to master the assembly line.
The 1920s saw remarkable improvements in manufacturing efficiency.
As you know, Ford had introduced electric conveyor belts to his assembly lines. Each car moved along the belt to different groups of workers who completed one small part of the assembly. With this method, production was suddenly six times faster.
Use of the conveyer belt and other new techniques spread, making industry generally more productive.
When manufacturers first adopted the assembly line to their production process, they often achieved
dramatic gains in productivity, and consumers benefited from lower prices. However, one unforeseen consequence was a radical change in the nature of factory work. Skilled workers were no longer needed, even in complex manufacturing operations like car assembly.

By 1933, most Americans saw this “experiment” in morals as a failure. Many people had simply refused to accept the ban on alcohol. Although illegal, alcoholic drinks were widely available at “speakeasies” and other underground drinking establishments. Even President Harding drank alcohol in the White House. Fewer than fourteen years after the ban on alcoholic drinks went into effect, Prohibition was repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment (1933). The experience of Prohibition demonstrated that unpopular laws are sometimes unenforceable.
THE SCOPES "MONKEY TRIAL" OF
1925 An even greater clash between traditionalists and modernists took place in the 1920s in Tennessee, the first state to pass a law against the teaching of Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. State legislators believed that Darwin had contradicted the Biblical account of Creation. In 1925, John Scopes, a biology teacher, was arrested for teaching his class about the theory of evolution. Scopes was arrested and put on trial.
The Scopes “Monkey Trial” drew nationwide attention for pitting older religious beliefs against new scientific theories.
The state was represented by William Jennings Bryan as special prosecutor, while the famed attorney Clarence Darrow defended Scopes. Bryan and Darrow were considered to be the greatest orators of their day, and the Scopes trial became the first in American history to be broadcast over national radio. Darrow cross-examined Bryan as an expert on the Bible, pointing to seeming contradictions in the Biblical text. In the end, Scopes was convicted for teaching evolution, but his $1 fine was later set aside.
Clarence Darrow argues one of this points during the Scopes “Monkey Trial.”
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Journalist H.L. Mencken wrote the following just before the trial:
“No principle is at stake ... save the principle that school teachers, like plumbers, should stick to the job that is set before them, and not go roving around the house, breaking windows, raiding
the cellar, and demoralizing children. When a [teacher] takes his oath of office, he renounces his right to free speech quite as certainly as a bishop does, or a colonel in the army, or an editorial writer of a newspaper. He becomes a paid propagandist of certain definite doctrines, and every time he departs from them deliberately, he deliberately swindles his employers.”

In opposition to these traditional values were the newer, modem values of the period, which encouraged greater openness and self-expression.
WOMEN
The decade opened with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, giving women the right to vote. New household appliances reduced housework, and greater numbers of women now went to college. As more women worked, they demonstrated a new economic independence and became more assertive. This brought about changes in manners and morals. Young women began to smoke and drink in public. They rejected restrictive clothing and instead adopted the new look of the “flapper.” Flappers wore short dresses that revealed their body shapes as well as their legs and arms. Their hair was short and choppy, and they also wore a lot of make up. Young women went out on dates or to dances without a chaperone. Flappers enjoyed energetic popular dances like the Charleston. People began reading Sigmund Freud and treating sexuality more openly.
The “flapper” look.
TIN PAN ALLEY
After the Civil War, thousands of pianos were sold to individuals. As a result, the demand for sheet music exploded. Around 1910, New York City began to emerge as the capital of popular music publishing. Tin Pan Alley, a section of New York City, was the area where song-writing and musical ideas mixed together to form American popular music. Various styles, such as blues, jazz, and ragtime, were melded together.
Publishers were surprised to discover that sheet music for popular tunes was being bought up by ordinary people who just wanted to play these songs at home. During this same period, vaudeville became the most popular form of stage entertainment. Vaudeville shows had a great need for music and the publishing houses of Tin Pan Alley were glad to provide them since a great deal of money was made by selling the songs they popularized.

CHAPTER 10: The "Roaring Twenties" 189
In the first two decades of the twentieth century, Chicago’s African-American population more than doubled; Cleveland’s grew by three times; and Detroit’s increased sixfold. African Americans were still greeted by racism, housing shortages and crime, even in the North, but they also found organizations such as the National Urban League and the NAACP, which were dedicated to helping them adjust to their new lives. Confined to allblack neighborhoods, African Americans created cities-within-cities. The largest of these was Harlem, in upper Manhattan of New York City. About 200,000 African Americans lived together there in one of the most vibrant communities of the 1920s.
THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE
The 1920s is often referred to as the Jazz Age, reflecting the great importance of this new form of African-American music. The general awakening of African-American culture in these years has become known as the Harlem Renaissance.
The Harlem Renaissance was begun by a rising middle class of African Americans. It was more than simply about music. It reached into other forms of art such as dance and visual arts. It sought to bring recognition to the African-American community. It was an era in which many African Americans felt as though they
Famous hot spots included the Cotton Club and the Apollo Theater.
Langston Hughes (1902-1962)
had liberated themselves from a past marked by self-doubt and uncertainty. They shared an unprecedented level of optimism, a pride in all things black, and a confidence in their own future that reached beyond Harlem to other African-American communities.
Poets and writers like Langston Hughes (1902-1967) and Alain Locke expressed this new pride in their heritage, while attacking racism. They felt their accomplishments in literature and art demonstrated their value as a people. Hughes is recognized as one of America’s best poets. Bom in Missouri, he was drawn to Harlem like other African-American artists and writers.
Hughes drew on his personal experiences in writing about what it was like to be an African American growing up in America. His poems, novels, plays and newspaper columns made him one of the most popular writers of the Harlem Renaissance. His writings expressed the new mood of rugged determination to overcome racial prejudice. Countee Cullen was another leading poet, who won more major literary prizes than any other African-American writer of the 1920s. Zora Neale Hurston became one the first
successful African-American women authors. In 1937, she published what is considered her greatest novel, Their Eyes Watching God.

Lindbergh’s flight served as a bridge between tradition and modernity. John Ward wrote an essay, The Meaning of Lindbergh’s Flight, in which he looked at the impact of his flight on history:
“Lindbergh, in every remark about his flight and in his writings,
resisted the tendency to exploit the flight as the achievement of an individual. He never said ‘I,’ he always said ‘We.’ But there was always the fact that his exploit was a victory of the machine over nature. There was another aspect, one in which the public celebrated the machine and the society of which it was a product. By calling Lindbergh a pioneer, people could read into history the need [for] turning back to the frontier past. Yet people could also read history in terms of progress into the future. They did this by emphasizing the machine involved in Lindbergh’s flight.”

Ess :al Questions
OWhat were the causes of the Great Depression?
O/z Why was Herbert Hoover unable to cope with the Great Depression?
O— what were the effects of the Great Depression?
O" " How did the New Deal offer a new approach to confronting the Depression?
Economies historically pass through good and bad periods that regularly repeat themselves. These up-and-down periods of business activity are referred to as the business cycle. The bad times are called depressions — characterized by business failures, high unemployment, and falling prices. The Great Depression was the worst depression in our nation’s history.
A variety of factors caused the economy to move from the prosperity of the 1920s to the severe depression of the 1930s.
OVERPRODUCTION
The 1920s had witnessed rapid economic expansion as manufacturers made and sold new products like cars, radios, and refrigerators. Many consumers, however, lacked the money to buy these goods. Manufacturers were soon producing more goods than they could sell.
SPECULATION
In the 1920s, stocks soared in value. As you learned in Chapter 10, many people bought stocks hoping to “get rich quick.” This drove stock prices ever higher. Each day the speculative boom on the stock market saw more people investing in Wall Street. By 1929, stock prices had tripled since 1920.
Buying on Margin. In the 1920s, stocks could be purchased for a 10% down-payment, called a margin. The
rest of the price was financed by a loan from the stock broker. It was similar to making a purchase on the installment plan. The buyer paid only 10% of the stock’s value and promised to pay the rest when the stock was sold.

CHAPTER 11: The Great Depression and the New Deal
FROM WALL STREET TO MAIN STREET
After the stock market crash, corporations could no longer raise funds. People who lost their money in the stock market could not repay their loans or rents, leading to bank failures. Thousands of people lost their life savings.
In this new economic climate, the demand for goods decreased. As prices fell, factories closed, and workers lost their jobs. Demand was reduced still further, causing prices to fall even more. Other factories closed, and the country became caught in the grips of a vicious downward spiral. People could not pay their rents or mortgages, and people lost their homes. There was no one to buy the foreclosed houses and home prices plummeted downward. Without any kind of “safety net,” such as unemployment insurance, hundreds of thousands of American workers found themselves living on the street or in makeshift shacks.
203
Many Americans lost their homes in the Depression.
THE HUMAN IMPACT OF THE DEPRESSION
The Great Depression was a national nightmare. During the 1920s, many Americans had started to equate their self-worth with their material possessions. When the Great Depression struck, people felt worthless. The reality of economic chaos and confusion replaced the nation’s traditional optimistic outlook. People waited for events to turn, spinning in circles as they fought for their daily survival. Businesses failed, farmers lost their farms, banks failed, and millions of people were out of work. There was no unemployment insurance or bank deposit insurance. Private charities were overwhelmed. People were homeless and went hungry. Millions depended on soup kitchens for their food.
Writers like John Steinbeck and photographers like Dorothea Lange recorded the misery of the Great Depression.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In 1932, a young lyricist named E.Y. Harburg wrote the song that became the anthem of the Great Depression, “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?”:
“They used to tell me I was building a dream, and so I followed the mob,
When there was earth to plow, or guns to bear, I was always there right on the job. They used to tell me I was building a dream, with peace and glory ahead,
Why should I be standing in line, just waiting for bread?
Once I built a railroad, I made it run, made it race against time.
Once I built a railroad; now it’s done. Brother, can you spare a dime? Once I built a tower, up to the sun, brick, and rivet, and lime;
Once I built a tower, now it’s done. Brother, can you spare a dime?”
-fc The song lists several accomplishments of the singer: “I built a railroad,” “I built a tower.” What point was the songwriter trying to make?
One key phrase seems to summarize Harburg’s message: “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime.” Why does that phrase continue to “speak” to listeners even today?
A farm buried under a sea of dust.
THE DUST BOWL
During the 1930s, farmers on the Great Plains faced a natural disaster as well as financial disaster. Since the 1870s, farmers had been tilling the Great Plains, cutting the grasses covering the topsoil, and tapping underground water supplies. A series of droughts {long periods without rain) in the early 1930s dried up crops and topsoil, turning the soil to dust. The ground cover that had held the soil in place was now gone.
Lasting for a decade, heavy winds carried topsoil across hundreds of miles, burying homes and destroying harvests. Unable to
grow enough to pay their bills, farmers were forced to abandon their farms. Many farmers moved west to California. Over one million farmers were driven from their lands by the “dust bowl.”
John Steinbeck wrote a series of articles on these Oakies — farmers from Oklahoma who moved to migrant worker camps in California. In 1936, Steinbeck published The Harvest Gypsies, a series of articles first printed in the San Francisco News, based on his own research on migrant workers living In California during the Great Depression. This research later provided the background for his famous novel, The Grapes of Wrath.

“Employers pushed repatriation efforts as private charities and government agencies provided railroad transportation for tens of thousands of Mexicans to their ‘homeland.’ ‘[Immigration officials] put all the people in the boxcars instead of inside the trains,’ a witness recalled. They were in here illegally but the
moral part of It, the separation and putting them in boxcars, I’ll never forget it as long as I live. ’
Many of the ‘repatriates’ were children bom in the United States. The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce estimated that 60 percent of the ‘repatriated’ children were American citizens without much hope of ever coming back to the United States.
Repatriation was an employment program for whites — a way to remove surplus Mexican laborers and preserve the few remaining jobs for white workers. Even as they supported repatriation, however, employers viewed the action as temporary .... The border existed only when Mexican labor was not needed.”
— Professor Ronald Takaki, A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America (1993).
What are this historian’s feelings about the Mexican Repatriation program? Explain your answer.
-It Suppose you were a lawyer who had to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court either for or against the Mexican Repatriation program. Write a brief (a short written argument) for either side.



In the months leading up to the Presidential election of 1928, Herbert Hoover had conducted a study of American society. He had hoped to use this information to promote national economic development and to relieve poverty. But by 1932, the leader who had once been one of the most respected men in the nation had become one of the most despised. Hoover’s name became identified with the Great Depression. Despite the spiraling economic catastrophe, President Hoover had remained true to his conviction in laissez-faire capitalism.
HOOVER'S PHILOSOPHY
Despite rising unemployment, Hoover had rejected demands for the federal government to provide direct payments to the unemployed and needy. He believed that this would reduce the incentive to work, undermining Americans’ “rugged individualism.” Instead, Hoover believed that voluntary private organizations should provide such emergency relief. Hoover believed it was not the role of government to step in for voluntary philanthropy.

WOMEN IN THE GREAT DEPRESSION
Women often experienced the Depression as mothers and homemakers. While men tried to find new jobs, women had the quiet but demanding task of making ends meet — cooking, cleaning, and caring for children.
In 1933, Eleanor Roosevelt rallied women with her book, It’s Up to the Women. She called on them to pull their families through the crisis: “The women know that life must go on and the needs of life must be met and it Is their courage which, time and again, have pulled us through worse crises than the present one.”
Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962)
Another prominent woman reformer, Frances Perkins, became the first female member of the U.S. Cabinet when she was appointed Secretary of Labor in 1933. Perkins remained at this post for 12 years, overseeing the Civil Conservation Corps and the Public Works Administration. She played a key role in the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Social Security Act.
In his First Inaugural Address, President Roosevelt attempted to calm the American people, reassuring them that the “only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” He also blamed the selfishness of bankers and financiers for the current crisis. As soon as Roosevelt took office, he called Congress into special session. Roosevelt then pushed through legislation that would have been difficult to pass in less critical times. The President immediately began to submit a flood of measures for Congressional approval. Virtually all of the important bills he submitted in these First Hundred Days were enacted by Congress. Roosevelt explained these New Deal measures in terms of the three R’s — Relief, Recovery, and Reform.
RELIEF
Relief measures were short-term actions designed to tide people over until the economy recovered. They were especially important in the first years of the New Deal.
The Banking Crisis. If depositors feared a bank was unsound, they would remove their funds. Often, this news would spread to others, causing bank customers to also withdraw their money before It was too late. These runs on banks were widespread during the early days of the Depression. Ten thousand banks had failed during the Great Depression. To stabilize the banking situation and restore consumer confidence, Roosevelt immediately declared a Bank Holiday, closing all of the nation’s banks. Each bank was permitted to reopen only after government inspectors found the bank to be financially sound.
Name________________________________________________
CHAPTER 11: The Great Depression and the New Deal
213
REFORM
Reform measures were aimed at remedying defects in the structure of the American economy in order to ensure that such a severe Depression would never strike again. Many reform measures were based on the belief that government should protect individuals against risks they could not handle on their own.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (1933) insured bank deposits so that people would not lose their savings in the event of a bank failure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEGISLATION DURING THE NEW DEAL |
Tennessee Valley Authority (1933) built 21 government-owned dams along the Tennessee River, controlling floods and producing electricity. Some feared the "TVA" as a form of socialism.		Securities and Exchange Commission (1934) was I created to watch over the stock market, prevent J fraud and guard against another stock market | collapse.	!
		
National Labor Relations Act (1935), often called the Wagner Act, gave workers the right to form unions, to bargain collectively, and to submit grievances to a National Labor Relations Board.		Social Security Act (1935) was probably the most important measure of the New Deal. It provided workers with unemployment insurance, old age pensions, and insurance if they died early. Workers and their employers each paid new contributions to fund these benefits.
••••••••••••••••ft

ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In 1935, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins delivered a radio broadcast to explain Social Security to the American people:
“The process of recovery is not simple. We cannot be satisfied merely with arrangements which will tide us over the present emergencies. We must devise plans that will not merely [lessen] the ills of today, but prevent, as far as it is possible, their recurrence in the future. The task of recovery is inseparable from the task of social reconstruction. Among the objectives of that reconstruction, President Roosevelt in his message to Congress placed “the security of the men, women and children of the nation first.” He went on to suggest that social insurances ... will provide safeguards against ‘misfortunes which cannot be wholly eliminated in this man-made world of ours.’
Social Security, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) still affect us today. Choose one of these programs and explain how it continues to affect us.

The greatest growth in union membership in American history took place in the 1930s as a result of the New Deal. Roosevelt sought to raise the wages of labor to help fight the Depression.
					
	Norris-LaGuardia Act (1932) prohibited the use of injunctions against peaceful strikes.				
					
NEW DEAL LEGISLATION FAVORABLE TO LABOR
1 			■		
	National Industrial Recovery Act (1933) guaranteed workers the right to form unions. Employers could not refuse to hire union members. This act was declared unconstitutional in 1935, but was replaced by the Wagner Act.			Wagner Act (1935) greatly stimulated the unionization of American workers by protecting the right of unions to bargain collectively with their employers. Union membership grew rapidly with this new law.	
					
Although the New Deal was generally popular, Roosevelt did face criticism. Some of his critics proposed alternative approaches to dealing with the Depression. Conservative critics like the Liberty League, charged Roosevelt with being a “traitor to his class,” and attempting to establish a popular dictatorship.
Radical critics felt that Roosevelt did not go far enough in reforming the American economy. Dr. Francis Townsend wanted to give citizens over 65 years old a pension of $200 a month, to be spent within the month. Townsend believed these pensioners would soon spend the money and this would create new jobs, bringing an end to the Depression.
U.S.
Senator and former Governor of Louisiana, Huey Long, promised to give each American family an income of $5,000 a year, to be paid for by taxing the rich. Long was assassinated before he was able to mount his campaign against FDR. Huey Long was a fiery speaker who riled up crowds.
Father Coughlin gave radio addresses to millions, calling for the nationalization of banks and utilities. Coughlin was also violently anti-Semitic {prejudiced against Jewish people). Coughlin found an audience among nativists and those who distrusted Wall Street bankers. Eventually, the Catholic Church ordered an end to Coughlin’s broadcasts.

A.
Conditions in Europe after World War I were favorable to the rise of dictatorships. The Russian Revolution led to the world’s first Communist state in the Soviet Union. The dissolution of the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires led to the creation of fragile new democracies in other parts of Europe. B.
Benito Mussolini formed the Fascist Party, which took power in Italy in 1922. Adolf Hitler took power in Germany in 1933 after the high unemployment caused by the Great Depression. These new dictatorships glorified violence, obedience to leaders, and extreme nationalism. They arrested, imprisoned and often killed their opponents. Hitler’s Nazi Party condemned Jews and others. C.
Hitler had an expansionist foreign policy. He re-armed Germany, helped Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, annexed Austria, and demanded the Sudentenland in Czechoslovakia in 1938. The League of Nations failed to stop aggressors. British and French leaders gave in to Hitler’s demands in an attempt at appeasement. Hitler took the rest of Czechoslovakia, and then demanded part of Poland in 1939. This time, British and French leaders refused to give in. After signing a non-aggression pact with Stalin, Hitler attacked Poland, starting World War II in Europe. In Asia, Japanese military leaders had already occupied Manchuria in 1931 and had invaded eastern China in 1937. D.
The German army developed a new form of offensive warfare — the Blitzkrieg. Rapid coordinated movements of airplanes, tanks, mechanized troop carriers and infantry made it possible to advance at rapid speed. Germany quickly conquered Poland, defeated France, and controlled most of Europe by 1940. In 1941, Germany violated its non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union. E.
Americans at first tried to stay neutral in the war. After World War I, there had been a return to Isolationism. Congress passed the Neutrality Acts, prohibiting Americans from traveling on ships of nations at war, or selling arms to nations at war. They could only sell non-military goods on a “cash-and-carry” basis. F.
President Roosevelt was concerned at the rise of totalitarian states and the threat it presented to democracy. When Japan attacked China in 1937, he proposed that peaceful states quarantine aggressive nations. American volunteers also formed the Flying Tigers, a squadron of airplanes that helped keep supply lines to China open. After Germany occupied France, Congress passed the first peace-time draft. In 1941, Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act in order to sell, rent or lend wartime equipment to Britain, which stood alone in facing the terror of Nazi Germany. In 1941, Roosevelt secretly met Churchill and they agreed to the Atlantic Charter, laying the foundation for the future United Nations. G.
Surprisingly, events in Asia rather than Europe brought the United States into the war. Roosevelt threatened an embargo to force Japan to give up some of Its conquests. Japanese leaders wanted to seize Indonesia for its oil. On December 7, 1941, Japanese planes launched a surprise attack on the U.S fleet at Pearl Harbor. The next day Roosevelt asked for a declaration of war against Japan. CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 227

EssdENT)iAL Questions CJ z What factors led to the outbreak of World War II?
O " How were the United States and its Allies able to win victory in World War II? What were the major effects of World War II on America and the world?
After World War I, Americans had returned to their traditional policy of isolation. They were more concerned with events at home than abroad. They felt safe behind the oceans separating them from Europe and Asia. They raised tariffs, restricted immigration, and even insisted that their wartime allies, France and Britain, pay back the war debts owed to Americans.
There were notable exceptions to this trend towards isolationism. In 1921, President Harding hosted the Washington Naval Conference, in which leading world powers agreed to limit the size of their navies. In 1928, the United States also promoted the Kellog-Briand Peace Pact, signed by 62 nations, renouncing the use of war.
Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt both also tried to improve U.S. relations with Latin America. Under the “Good Neighbor Policy,” the United States agreed not to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American nations, and relations between the United States and the countries of Latin America began to improve.

THE ORIGINS OF WORIO WAR B
World War I and the Great Depression had profound effects on Europe, just as they did on the United States. Within two decades, Europe was again at war.
CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 229
APPLYING WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED
Use the Internet or your library to research American attitudes in the 1930s to the rise of dictators like Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, and the military leaders of Japan.
In 1939, Hitler made new territorial demands in Poland. Fearing Hitler Intended to dominate Europe, Britain and France refused to give in. Hitler responded by signing a nonaggression pact with Stalin, in which the two secretly agreed to invade and divide Poland. When Germany invaded Poland In September 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany. World War II had begun.
In Poland, the German army unveiled a new type of warfare — the Blitzkreig — which consisted of rapid, coordinated movements by airplanes, tanks, troop carriers, and infantry. The Germans quickly defeated the Poles, and before long they had also defeated the French and taken over much of Europe. While the main advantage in battle in World War I had been with the defense, the use of airplanes, tanks and mechanized transport brought the advantage in warfare back to the offense during World War IL The Germans, and later the Allies, also bombed civilians in cities to increase the terrors of war.

AMERICA PRESERVES A CAUTIOUS NEUTRALITY
In the early 1930s, Americans were too absorbed with recovering from the Great Depression to be very involved in affairs overseas. As tensions in Europe rose, Congress passed a series of laws to keep the country out of war. Americans had been drawn into World War I when German submarines had attacked American ships. To avoid similar events, the Neutrality Acts (1935-1937) prohibited Americans from traveling on the ships of nations at war. Americans were also prohibited from selling
arms to countries at war. Americans could sell nonmilitary goods to Britain and other nations opposed to aggression, but only on a “cash-and-carry” basis.
When Japan invaded China In 1937, President Roosevelt delivered his “Quarantine” Speech. He warned Americans of the growing unrest In the world and told them that peaceful nations had to act together to quarantine (isolate) aggressive nations.	FDR delivering his “Quarantine Speech.

President Roosevelt believed that U.S. entry into the war was inevitable. If Hitler defeated Britain, many feared he would later attack the United States. In 1941, armed American merchant ships were authorized to carry supplies directly to Britain. It seemed that U.S. Involvement in the war was only a matter of time.
INCREASING UNITED STATES-JAPANESE TENSIONS
Surprisingly, events in Asia, not Europe, finally brought the United States into the war. Just as German ambitions had triggered the war in Europe, Japan’s aggressive designs led to war In Asia.
Japan’s late 19th century industrialization had been remarkably successful. But Japanese leaders needed raw materials and markets for their industries. They also wished to replace European imperialism in Asia with the imperialism of an Asian power. Japan’s military began to influence Japanese national policy. In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria. In 1937, Japan attacked the rest of China. When Japan occupied southern Indochina in 1941, Roosevelt reacted by freezing Japanese assets in the United States and cutting off all trade with Japan. Roosevelt offered to resume trade only if Japan withdrew from China and Indochina. Japanese leaders refused.
JAPAN PREPARES A SURPRISE ATTACK
Japanese military leaders decided to attack Indonesia to obtain oil for their war effort. Realizing such a move would bring America into the war, they decided to attack first. Japanese leaders believed a surprise attack would catch the Americans unprepared, temporarily eliminate U.S. naval power from the Pacific, and allow Japan to fortify its positions in the Pacific. The Japanese assumed that before the United States could recover from this surprise blow, Japan would be able to achieve all of its objectives In East Asia and the Pacific.

THE OFFICE OF WAR INFORMATION
A primary focus of the federal government during the war was control of the content and imagery of war messages. In 1942, the President created the Office of War Information (OWI). Among its wide-ranging responsibilities was the production of pro-Allied, anti-Axis propaganda, such as movies and posters, to make citizens aware of how they could help in the war effort. The OWI produced its own radio programs, released its own newsreels, and required that all movies produced during the war contribute in some way to the war effort. OWI messages asked citizens to contribute time and money, to create products, to conserve resources, and to donate to the war effort in personal ways. The OWI also started the Voice of America during the war, sending messages overseas. The OWI tried to stir up distrust of German, Italian, and Japanese leaders, to lower the morale of enemy troops and populations, and to encourage their surrender.

WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE
For many women in America, World War II brought not only sacrifices, but also new jobs, new skills, and new opportunities. Although prevented from enlisting in the regular armed forces, women joined the new Women’s Army Corps, or WACS, in large numbers. After basic training, most of these women took clerical jobs in the military.
In civilian life, many women replaced jobs formerly held by men, such as in shipbuilding and aircraft production. The idea was to have women fill jobs formerly held by men so that more men could be sent into combat. Songs like Rosie the Riveter celebrated women’s new roles,
although some private contractors still refused to hire women. Between 1941 and 1945. more than 6.5 million women entered the work force.
Millions of women entered the workforce when men were drafted into the military.
ETHNIC MINORITIES:
Opportunities and Obstacles African Americans. Like women, members of minorities filled the workforce to replace men sent overseas. Many worked in war industries and government agencies. African-American soldiers also played a significant role in World War II. More than two and a half million registered for the draft, of whom one million eventually served, even though they were forced to serve in segregated units. African Americans had to battle on two fronts: the enemy overseas and prejudice at home.

Executive Order 9066 by President Roosevelt resulted in the internment of 110,000 Japanese Americans in camps for the duration of World War II:
“[A]s President and Commander In Chief of the Army and Navy, I hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of War, and the Military Commanders, whenever he or any designated Commander deems such action to be necessary or desirable, to [order] military areas in such places and of such extent as he or the appropriate Commander may determine, from which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any persons to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever restriction the Secretary of War or the appropriate Military Commander may Impose in his discretion ...”

What arguments would you have used either in support of or against this order?
The relocation raised constitutional issues in wartime. Roosevelt justified the measures as a military necessity. The Supreme Court upheld the relocations in Korematsu v. U.S. Korematsu was a Japanese American convicted of continuing to remain in a restricted area. He believed his constitutional rights had been violated. The Supreme Court upheld Roosevelt’s order on the grounds that constitutional liberties may be limited in wartime. Fifty years later, Congress apologized to the interned Japanese Americans and voted to pay compensation to the families involved.
During the war, a small number of German and Italian resident aliens were also interned. About 2,000 German alien residents were forcibly sent back to Germany. Germans were also sent from Latin America to the United States to be used in prisoner exchanges with Germany.

CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 239
THE WAR IN EUROPE
Although the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt decided to focus American energies on defeating Germany first. By the time the Americans entered the war, Hitler was in control of most of Europe and North Africa. Hitler made his greatest mistake when he invaded the Soviet Union In June 1941 and declared war on the United States before defeating Britain. By late 1941, the rapid German advance into the Soviet Union was stopped just short of Moscow. Roosevelt and Churchill promised Stalin they would open a second front against Germany in the West, to relieve pressure on the Soviet army.
AXIS EXPANSION AT ITS HEIGHT:
1942 The Americans and British now began one of the greatest collaborations in military history. Churchill advised delay before invading Europe. In 1942, Allied troops landed in North Africa.
After defeating German forces, they crossed the Mediterranean and advanced into Sicily and Italy in 1943.
George Patton was one of the commanders of the forces that invaded North Africa and Sicily. He came from a military family, had participated in the expedition against Pancho Villa, and served under Pershing in World War I. He played an important role in the use of tanks. Patton told American soldiers they must have a “killer instinct” to succeed. An uncon-
ventional military leader, Patton was given command of the General George Patton American Third Army. He was popular among his troops because he had high survival rates, but he could also be harsh In his treatment of those under his command. Under Patton’s leadership, the Third Army would quickly move through Europe, capturing large numbers of enemy soldiers, and freeing a vast territory.

CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 241
Genocide is an effort to murder an entire people or nationality. Part of Hitler’s Nazi philosophy was his intense hatred of Jewish people, on whom he blamed all of Germany’s problems. The Holocaust refers to the attempted genocide of the Jews during World War II. After the outbreak of the war, Hitler and other Nazi leaders decided to murder all European Jews. He called his plan the “Final Solution.” At first, Jews were machine gunned
next to open trenches they had been forced to
When this method of extermination proved too slow for the Nazis, large concentration camps were built across Europe. Jews from Nazi-controlled countries were sent in cramped railroad cattle cars to these camps. When they arrived in the camps, most were killed with poison gas and their bodies were burned in large ovens. Some were spared to do the work of running the camp. These inmates were half-starved and subjected to Inhumane conditions. About six million Jews — two-thirds of those living in Europe — were killed during the Holocaust. Six million gypsies, Slavs, political prisoners, elderly, mentally-disabled, and others also died in Nazi concentration camps.

Liberation of the Concentration Camps. During the last months of the war, the Allies advanced into Germany, where the true horror of Nazi brutality was revealed. American army units were the first to liberate concentration camps. They were shocked to see the half-starved, dehydrated, disease-ridden prisoners.

The following account is from Woman Prisoner #T-917 at Lenzing Concentration Camp:
“Now began a frightful time of waiting. We were locked in the camp without food. I was asleep when my sister wakened me.
She reported that in front of the camp were two young men .... They told us that they would get help from the American soldiers who were nearby but had no idea our camp was there .... It took a few hours until they arrived. It was General Patton’s 3rd Army. The soldiers broke open the gate. It must have been a shock for the soldiers when they saw us, emaciated or swollen, pale and dirty creatures. They first provided us with their food rations and soap ....”
Who do you think was more surprised at the meeting: the concentration camp inmates or the American soldiers? Explain your answer.
CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 243
THE WAR IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC
In these same years, Americans remained at war with Japan. Geography played a critical role in the Pacific campaign during World War IL The United States and Japan were separated by the vast Pacific Ocean. After its attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese achieved quick victories in overrunning Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and the Western Pacific Islands. They soon
threatened Australia, India, Midway, and Hawaii.
THE BATAAN DEATH MARCH,
1942 The Philippines faced an invasion by the Japanese army on the day Pearl Harbor was attacked. A month later, U.S. and Filipino forces surrendered to the Japanese. The Japanese forced their prisoners to undertake a 60-mile march through the jungle, which became known as the Bataan Death March. These prisoners of war faced starvation, disease, exposure to the sun, and no water. About 5,000 of the Americans, almost half, died along the way. Some were bayoneted, shot, beheaded or just left to die along the side of the road.
American soldiers along the Bataan Death March.
In 1943, the tide began to turn against Japan. The United States regained naval superiority in the Pacific and American forces by “island-hopping” — liberating Pacific islands from Japanese control, one at a time.
THE NAVAJO CODE TALKERS
One group of Americans who played a key role in the Pacific campaign were the Navajo code talkers. The American military needed an undecipherable code to communicate that could not be broken by the Japanese. The Navajo language is unwritten and extremely complex. By using this language, American forces could transmit messages by telephone and radio in a code that the Japanese were unable to break.
THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY
The Battle of Midway was the turning point of the war in the Pacific. The Japanese were using their control of the Western Pacific to protect their home islands and vast new empire. The Japanese Pacific fleet commander had devised a plan to lure the U.S. Pacific fleet into a battle near Midway, a tiny mid-Pacific island, where he believed he could destroy them. However, the U.S. Navy could decipher Japanese secret codes and knew that a surprise attack by the Japanese fleet was at hand.
CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 245
His successor, President Harry Truman, feared that an invasion of Japan might lead to a million American casualties. Truman preferred to use the atomic bomb against Japan rather than to sustain such high losses. He selected centers of Japanese military production as targets.
On August 6, an atomic bomb was exploded over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, a second bomb was exploded over Nagasaki. About 230,000 people were killed in both explosions combined. Critics argued that Truman could have exploded bombs on unoccupied islands in the Pacific as demonstrations, instead of on heavily populated cities. Japan surrendered shortly after the second explosion, once American leaders agreed to allow the Japanese Emperor to remain on his throne.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Presidents Roosevelt and Truman had different leadership styles.
President Roosevelt came from wealth, had an elite education and had an abundance of self-confidence. A life-long politician, he excelled at communicating with the public. This was sharply different from President Truman, who spent his early years running a small clothing business and served as a local judge before being elected as U.S. Senator. He was chosen by Roosevelt as his Vice President in 1944. Truman was Vice President only 82 days when he suddenly found himself as President. Roosevelt rarely consulted with him, and Truman knew nothing at all about the development of the atomic bomb until after Roosevelt’s death. With limited foreign policy experience, one might think that Truman simply allowed his advisers to make decisions. In fact, nothing better describes his leadership style than the sign on his
desk in the White House: “The Buck Stops Here!” Truman chaired morning staff meetings, issued directions and assignments to his advisers, and made all major policy decisions himself. He tended to look at things as they were presented to him, examined both sides of the issue, and then made his decision — much as during his earlier years as a judge.
Select one of these Presidents and evaluate his domestic and international leadership during World War II. Conduct research on the Internet or in your library for information. You might consider how FDR forged a close relationship with Churchill and mobilized Americans for war. Or you might select how Truman reached his decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan.
Then prepare a short report, poster, or oral presentation to communicate your conclusions about the leadership style of the President you researched.
CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 247
THE NUREMBERG TRIALS,
1945-1946 The liberation of concentration camps in Europe revealed millions of dead, along with half-starved survivors. With the full extent of Nazi brutality revealed, the Allies put surviving Nazi leaders on trial for “crimes against humanity” in Nuremberg, Germany. Those on trial defended themselves by claiming they had only been following orders. Many were found guilty of committing atrocities and were hanged or imprisoned. The Nuremberg Trials demonstrated that individuals are responsible for their actions, even in times of war.

ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Read this statement by one of the U.S. prosecutors at the military trials at Nuremberg.
“Germany became one vast torture chamber. Cries of its victims were heard round the world and brought shudders to civilized
people. I am one who received most atrocity tales with suspicion and [doubt]. But the proof here will be so overwhelming that I predict these defendants will only deny personal responsibility. The elements of the German population which were both decent and courageous were [reduced to nothing]. Those which were decent but weak were Intimidated. The Nazis not only silenced discordant voices, they practiced the [leadership principle] which centralized control of the Party over the lives and thoughts of the German people. This German State is incomprehensible to my people [the United States public] ....
The prosecutor says these Nazi leaders did not deserve mercy. Would you have agreed? Explain your answer.
AND THE DIVISION OF GERMANY
After the war, Germany was divided into four zones by the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Each occupied one zone. The occupying powers introduced programs explaining the evils of Nazi beliefs to the German people. Hitler’s attempts to put his racist doctrines into practical effect also played a large role in discrediting racism, anti-Semitism, Social Darwinism, eugenics, and similar ideas worldwide. The Nazi nightmare showed where these ideas could lead. This contributed to the later Civil Rights Movement in the United States.
THE OCCUPATION OF JAPAN
General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, was assigned the task of rebuilding and reforming post-war Japan. Under his leadership, important changes were introduced to make Japan less aggressive. Japan’s overseas empire was taken away, and her military leaders were put on trial and punished. Japan renounced the use of nuclear weapons and the waging of war.

Ess^ENTIal Questions
Why did the United States and Soviet Union enter into the Cold War? Why did the Cold War last so Long?
How did Civil Rights leaders change American society?
r
Although the United States and the Soviet Union had been allies during World War II, these two Superpowers soon became rivals in the Cold War. This war was “cold” only in the sense that, because of nuclear weapons, the two Superpowers never confronted each other directly in open warfare. However, their global competition led to frequent conflicts on every continent.

THE COLD WAR BEGINS
After the war, the Soviets saw a growing threat from capitalist governments.
Stalin wanted to insure the safety of the Soviet Union and greatly distrusted the West, which had delayed invading France until 1944. He decided to create a wall of satellite countries as a buffer against any future invasions. As a result,
Stalin refused to allow free elections in Poland. He had no intention of losing control over the country through which Germany had invaded Russia twice in the previous 30 years. The United States also refused to share the secrets behind the atomic bomb. The Cold War now began in earnest. Soviet troops continued to occupy Eastern Europe. They placed local Communists in power in
all the governments of Eastern Europe. Trade and contact between Eastern and Western Europe was cut off. An Iron Curtain fell over Eastern Europe, closing it off from the West. Over the next forty years, travel and communication between the East and West remained limited. Eastern European nations became “satellites” of the Soviet Union.

Speaking on a visit to Missouri, Winston Churchill told Americans in 1946 that “from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.” What did Churchill mean by the phrase “iron curtain”?
American leaders responded to the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe by developing a policy of containment. Under this policy, they did not attempt to overturn Communism where it already existed, but they resolved to prevent it from spreading further.
When Communist rebels threatened Greece and Stalin pressured Turkey, Truman decided to offer these countries military aid. He felt it was important not to make the same mistake as the appeasers in Munich who failed to stand up to Hitler in 1938.

A DIVIDED GERMANY AND THE BERLIN AIRLIFT,
1948 In 1948, the French, British and Americans decided to merge their zones of occupation into a single state, West Germany. Berlin, the old capital of Germany, was located in the Soviet zone. It had also been divided into four sectors, each occupied by a different power. The Soviets reacted to the merging of the Western zones by announcing a blockade of West Berlin, closing all highway and railroad links to the West.
The Western Allies refused to abandon West Berlin. They began a massive airlift to feed and supply the city. Within a year, Stalin lifted the Soviet blockade. The United States had met another test of the
Cold War. The United States and its allies had shown that they would not retreat when faced with aggressive behavior by the Soviet Union.

THE FORMATION OF NATO AND THE WARSAW PACT
In response to Cold War tensions, the United States, Canada, and ten Western European countries formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949. NATO was based on the concept of collective security — each NATO member pledged to defend every other member if attacked.
Through NATO, the United States extended its umbrella of protection from nuclear weapons to Western Europe. The
Soviet Union responded by creating the Warsaw Pact with its Eastern European satellites in 1955.

When President Truman refused his ideas, MacArthur criticized Truman to a Congressman, who reported this to the news media. Faced with public criticism from a commander in the field, Truman relieved MacArthur from his command. Truman believed this step was necessary to reassert civilian control over the military, although the step was unpopular at the time.

CHAPTER 13: America in the Cold War and Civil Rights Years 269

As the Cold War grew more intense, Americans became more concerned with their own internal security.
THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE
Following World War II, Americans feared a possible Communist menace inside the United States. President Truman ordered the establishment of Loyalty Review Boards to investigate individual “un-American” activities, such as participation in the American Communist Party. Many Americans were accused of “un-American” actions on very little evidence. These victims were often unable to defend themselves or even to know who had accused them. The process violated their constitutional rights.
Congress decided to conduct its own loyalty checks through its special House Un-American Activities Committee. This committee questioned actors, directors, writers, and others about their possible Communist sympathies. Those identified as present or former members of the Communist Party were frequently “blacklisted” and lost their jobs. Some, like Alger Hiss, were later prosecuted for perjury. Those who cooperated with the committee were often asked to inform on others.
THE ROSENBERG TRIALS
In 1950, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were charged with selling national secrets to the Soviet Union about making the atomic bomb. The Rosenbergs were found guilty and executed for spying. Like the Sacco and Vanzetti case in the 1920s, many Americans doubted the Rosenbergs’ guilt. However, in 1997, the National Security Agency released the Venona Papers. This was a secret effort by the United States to gather and decode messages sent In the 1940s by Soviet military intelligence agents. The Venona Papers revealed the identities of several Americans who had spied for the Soviet Union, including Julius Rosenberg. It showed that some Soviet agents had in fact penetrated American government, science and industry during the Cold War.
the McCarthy hearings
The fall of China increased fears of internal subversion. In 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy shocked Americans by claiming that he knew the names of hundreds of Communists who had infiltrated the U.S. State Department and other government agencies. Like the Red Scare of the 1920s, McCarthy’s allegations created fears of a Communist conspiracy. After three years of hearings, McCarthy never provided any real proof for his charges. He was censured {formally criticized) by the Senate. Although McCarthy never proved any of his claims, his witchhunt frightened many Americans. The term “McCarthyism” has become Identified with making harsh accusations without evidence.

President Eisenhower gave control of foreign policy to his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, a devoted anticommunist. Dulles sought to contain the spread of Communism by preventing the Soviets from gaining additional influence.
In 1957, Eisenhower announced he would send U.S. forces to any Middle Eastern nation that requested help in defending against Communism. This extension of the containment policy became known as the Eisenhower Doctrine. The United States also signed a series of treaties around the world to contain Communism.
President Dwight Eisenhower
The 1950s were a period of recovery and economic growth. Millions of veterans returned home from World War II. They benefited from special benefits for war veterans, including low mortgage rates and educational grants. People whose lives had been disrupted by the Great Depression and the war could now turn their attentions to work and raising families.
As in the 1920s, products for consumers, such as automobiles, refrigerators, washing machines, and televisions, helped stimulate economic growth. Eisenhower signed the Interstate Highway Act (1956), which created a system of federal highways. Americans were not just producing for themselves, but also for the rest of the world, which was still recovering from wartime destruction. Because of the Cold War, defense spending remained high. One result of this increased spending was a wave of prosperity and the growth of the middle class.
Housing Boom. This was a time of high birth rates, known as the "baby boom." This boom and the 6.1. Bill (Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944) helping veterans led developers to build cheaper, mass-produced housing. Home ownership increased by 50%. The movement of middle-income families to the suburbs led to a declining urban tax base and decaying inner cities.
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE EISENHOWER PRESIDENCY
Economic Prosperity. The demand for consumer goods reached all-time highs. Millions of autos and TV sets were sold. The use of refrigerators and other appliances became widespread. The gross domestic product doubled between 1945 and 1960. America dominated world trade.
Conformity. In the 1950s, there was a greater emphasis on conformity. Unusualideas were regarded with suspicion. Fear of Communism strengthened the dislike of non-conformist attitudes.

CHAPTER 13: America in the Cold War and Civil Rights Years 273

At the end of the Civil War, the United States had held out the promise of equality to Americans of all races, but this promise was cut short in the aftermath of Reconstruction. Many Americans felt that the treatment received by African Americans was inconsistent with the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Indeed, it seemed ironic for America to pose as the defender of freedom and democracy around the world, while denying equality to many of its citizens at home.
THE TRUMAN YEARS,
1945-1953 In 1947, Jackie Robinson became the first African-American baseball player to cross the “color line” and join the major leagues. The same year, the Truman administration issued a report, To Secure These Rights, calling for civil rights laws. The following year, Truman proposed civil rights legislation to Congress that did not pass. When he was re-elected, Truman demanded his inauguration be integrated. In 1948, he also issued executive orders to desegregate the armed forces and end discriminatory hiring practices in the federal government. These orders set precedents for later civil rights legislation.
Jackie Robinson
Civil rights were won in large part through litigation — resolving disputes in court. The Supreme Court’s decision in Brown r. Board ofEducaton was central to the success of the Civil Rights Movement.
BACKGROUND
After Reconstruction, Southern states passed laws requiring the segregation of races in public places, including public schools. In Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), the U.S. Supreme Court had upheld the constitutionality of these state segregation laws. The Court had ruled that the “separate-but-equal” standard was constitutional. States could provide segregated facilities to different races, so long as they were equal in quality. Although schools were supposed to be equal, most schools in the South were greatly inferior to white ones. Starting in the 1930s, NAACP lawyers began challenging this “separate-but-equal” doctrine through the American court system.
In Sweatt v. Painter (1950), the NAACP won a case involving the right of Herman Sweatt, an African American, to attend the Law School at the University of Texas at Austin. Texas argued that its constitution prohibited integrated education. Texas even created a separate law school for African Americans, just to keep Sweatt out. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that this separate school failed to qualify as “separate but equal” since differences in its facilities, such as the isolation of its students from future lawyers being trained in Austin, with whom its students would later interact.
Name__________________________________________________
CHAPTER 13: America in the Cold War and Civil Rights Years 275
In a subsequent ruling, the Court held that desegregation in public schools should be conducted “with all deliberate speed.” Enforcement of the decision was left to the lower federal courts, which were to oversee that local school districts complied with the order. Because the phrase “with all deliberate speed” was vague, many states were able to delay the Court’s order to desegregate their schools. It would take many more years before the Brown decision was fully implemented.
The Supreme Court had overturned legal racial segregation in the public schools, but this still left other segregation laws — known as “Jim Crow” laws —In place throughout the South. These laws prevented African Americans from sharing beaches, theaters, restaurants, water fountains, or public buses with whites.
THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT,
1955-1956 In December 1955, Rosa Parks, an African-American seamstress and local NAACP member, refused to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger in Montgomery, Alabama. When Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat, local African-American leaders began a boycott of the city’s public buses. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
(1929-1968), a pastor in Montgomery, was the leader of the boycott. The boycott lasted 13 months and brought Rosa Parks, Dr. King, and their cause before the attention of the world. King rallied the boycotters at meetings In his church. They car-pooled to take each other to work. King himself
was arrested and his home was bombed, but the boycott lasted and the case was eventually taken to federal court. The court ruled that segregation on the buses operated by the city of Montgomery violated the “equal protection” clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The boycott had shown that African Americans could unite successfully to oppose segregation.
Rosa Parks rides in the front of the bus in defiance of segregation laws.
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF
1957 In 1957, the Eisenhower administration passed the Civil Rights Act to increase African-American voting in the South. The act created the Civil Rights Commission and established a Civil Rights Division in the U.S. Justice Department. The law gave federal courts the power to register African-American voters. Registration procedures were so complex the act proved ineffective, but it helped set the pattern for later civil rights legislation.
LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS,
1957 Most Southern states delayed putting the Brown decision into effect. Governor Orval Faubus of Arkansas was a World War II veteran and a liberal Democrat, who favored segregation.

CONGRESSIONAL BLOC OF SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Southern Democrats in Congress banded together to obstruct attempts to pass federal civil rights legislation. Many of these Southern legislators held important committee chairmanships, which gave them the power to prevent such legislation from even coming to the floor of Congress for a vote.
SIT-INS AND FREEDOM RIDES IN THE SOUTH,
1960-1961 In 1960, African-American students held a sit-in at a “Whites Only” lunch counter in North Carolina. The tactic was soon copied by other students throughout the South. In 1961, interracial groups rode buses in Freedom Rides in the South. As a result of these protests, downtown stores finally agreed to desegregate lunch coun-
ters and hire African-American workers. The African-American college students sitting down Freedom Riders sought to overturn racial seg-	at the “whites only” lunch counter.
regation on public transportation. They created
confrontations so that the federal government would be forced to intervene. These riders often faced the risk of violence and even death from those who opposed integration.
KING'S LETTER FROM A BIRMINGHAM JAIL,
1963 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. emerged in the late 1950s as the leader of the Civil Rights Movement. Like Thoreau and Gandhi before him, King believed in non-violence — that passive resistance to unjust laws could change the attitudes of oppressors. During the 1950s and 1960s, King achieved international fame for carrying out resistance to injustice through civil disobedience. King believed that if the government passed an unjust law, people should oppose it with non-violent tactics such as peaceful marches, boycotts, picketing, and demonstrations.
When Dr. Martin Luther King led a march in Birmingham, Alabama, he was arrested. Television then revealed to the nation the brutal tactics often used by the police to break up peaceful demonstrations. Dr. King wrote a “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” explaining the reasons why African Americans could no longer patiently wait for their constitutional rights. His critics felt that the fight against racial segregation should take place in the courts and not in the street. King argued that civil disobedience was justified not only because it
was effective, but because “everyone has a moral	Dr. King in the Birmingham City jail.
responsibility to disobey unjust laws.”

CHAPTER 13: America in the Cold War and Civil Rights Years 279
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF
1964 On the plane ride back to Washington, D.C., Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was immediately sworn in as President. A Texan, Johnson had been the Democratic leader in the Senate in 1957, and had helped to steer the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through Congress. With the lobbying efforts of Civil Rights supporters, President Johnson was now able to push an even more important bill through Congress. The Southern Democratic bloc tried to stop the bill with ceaseless speeches, but they were prevented by a vote of two-thirds of the Senate.
The resulting Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, or ethnic origin in hotels, restaurants, and all places of employment doing business with the federal government or engaged in interstate commerce. The act cut off federal aid to school districts with segregated schools. Finally, the act gave the federal government the power to register voters and to establish the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to enforce the act’s provisions. What this meant was that all businesses involved in interstate commerce could no longer discriminate.
THE STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE VOTING RIGHTS
After passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Civil Rights leaders turned their energies to registering African-American voters and encouraging them to vote.
Twenty-Fourth Amendment (1964) eliminated poll taxes in federal elections.

This act ended poll taxes, suspended literacy tests where they were used to prevent African Americans from voting, and led to a substantial increase in the number of African-American voters.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION,
1965 In 1965, President Johnson signed an Executive Order requiring employers with federal contracts to take positive steps to raise the number of their minority employees to correct past imbalances. Later, women were added. This went beyond not discriminating: companies and institutions were now required to actively recruit minority candidates.
Affirmative action programs increased minority representation in colleges, the professions, and many businesses. The act had some unintended consequences. Some critics challenged these programs as a form of reverse discrimination. In Regents of University of California v. Bakke, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld affirmative action, but not the use of racial quotas. Many affirmative action programs have been phased out over time as America has become a more pluralistic society.

IMPORTANT IDEAS
(continued) — G.
Mexican Americans also struggled for equal rights. Chicano Wall murals celebrated their culture. Organizers like Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta fought for the rights of migrant farm workers, most of whom were Mexican Americans. Hector Perez Garcia fought discrimination against Mexican Americans. H. A
series of various court cases ended the segregation of Mexican-American children in public schools and the exclusion of Mexican Americans from juries. I.
American Indians organized the American Indian Movement, or AIM. J.
Young people in the sixties sought greater personal freedom. The right to vote to all citizens over 18 years old was given by the Twenty-sixth Amendment. K.
In 1954, Vietnam in Southeast Asia was divided in two: North Vietnam came under Communist control, while South Vietnam had the support of the West. When South Vietnamese leaders decided to oppose elections to re-unify the country, the Vietcong launched a guerilla war to win control of the country. L.
After Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (1964), President Johnson sent in thousands of U.S. ground troops. Even so, the Vietcong were able to launch attacks on South Vietnamese cities during the Tet Offensive (1968). M.
In the U.S., the war became very divisive. The Anti-war Movement staged demonstrations throughout the country. President Richard Nixon, elected in 1968, escalated the war. He bombed the North and began a policy of Vietnamization to give the South Vietnamese a larger stake in the war. The U.S. signed an agreement with North Vietnam, withdrawing its forces from Vietnam. Fighting continued until the fall of Saigon in 1975, when Vietnam was re-united under Communist rule. N.
In the 1960s, American youths challenged the conforming behavior of their parents. The Beat poets and writers, like Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, were forerunners of this new counter-culture.

Space exploration has led to advances in technology that have improved the quality of our lives. For example, as a result of space exploration we now have satellites with improved television and radio signals. These satellites help us communicate faster, predict the weather, and forecast impending tsunamis, cyclones, hurricanes and tornadoes. They also allow us to make telephone calls overseas and to use GPS (global positioning systems).
The space program also has led to the invention of high-performance solar cells, new lubricants, infrared ear thermometers, enriched baby food, cordless power tools, and tempur-pedic foam for mattresses and pillows
Like Truman and Eisenhower, President Kennedy staunchly opposed Communism and pledged to contain it. One of the greatest challenges Kennedy faced was in Cuba, only 90 miles from Florida. In 1959, while Eisenhower was President, Fidel Castro led an uprising to overthrow the brutal Cuban dictator General Batista. At first, Americans looked at Castro’s revolution as an attempt to introduce democracy into Cuba. However, shortly after taking power, Castro made new agreements with the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower reduced the amount of sugar Cuba could sell to the United States, and Castro nationalized American businesses in Cuba. Then he announced his plans to make Cuba a pro-Soviet Communist nation. Land-holding was limited and opponents were thrown in jail.
Fidel Castro
BAY OF PIGS INVASION
(1961) President Eisenhower approved a plan to overthrow Castro. This included secretly training a group of Cuban exiles in the United States and Guatemala to invade the island. When Kennedy became President, he let the plan continue, but he refused to provide air power, which would openly tie the invasion to the United States. The exiles landed in Cuba three months after Kennedy took office, but were quickly defeated by the Cuban military. This was an embarrassing foreign policy failure for President Kennedy.

If you had been President during the invasion at the Bay of Pigs, would you have used U.S. airpower to overthrow Castro? Explain your answer.
ALLIANCE FOR PROGRESS
(1961) To meet the Communist challenge, Kennedy created a program of grants and loans to Latin American nations to promote economic progress, land reform, and trade.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
On October 22, 1962, President Kennedy spoke to the nation:
“This secret and extraordinary buildup of Communist missiles — in an area known to have a special relationship to the United States and the nations of the Western Hemisphere, in violation of Soviet
assurances, and in defiance of American and hemispheric policy — this decision to station weapons for the first time outside of Soviet soil — is an unjustified change in the status quo which cannot be accepted by this country ....”
In your opinion, did President Kennedy choose the right course of action during the • Cuban Missile Crisis? Explain your answer.
President Kennedy reiterated his commitment to resisting Communism when he visited West Berlin in 1963. He told its citizens “Ich bin ein Berliner" (I am a Berliner), reassuring West Germans of the U.S. commitment to their safety and freedom.
The nation was shocked when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22,1963. Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson became the next President.
THE GREAT SOCIETY
Soon after becoming President, Johnson proposed the most far-ranging program of social legislation since the New Deal. Johnson proposed federal legislation designed to transform American society. Johnson’s goal was to turn the nation into a Great Society by opening up opportunities and improving the quality of life for all Americans. His Great Society programs included equality of opportunity, enrichment of urban life, restoration of natural beauty, expansion of education, ending poverty, health care for the elderly, and greater racial equality.
Civil Rights. As you Learned in Chapter 13, Johnson pushed through a broad program of Civil Rights legislation, including the Civil Rights Art (1964) and the Voting Rights Art (1965). He also introduced affirmative action.		War on Poverty. Johnson called for a "war on poverty." The Economic Opportunity Act (1964) created a new government office to administer programs established by the act. These included the Job Corps, to train underprivileged youths, and a domestic "Peace Corps" to help in depressed areas.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In her book, Friedan challenged the belief that all women were content leading lives as mothers and housewives:
“Each suburban wife struggles with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, [and] lay beside her husband at night — she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question — ‘Is this all?’”
Some criticized Betty Friedan for limiting her focus to middle-class, educated women. They claimed she ignored other women’s voices. Do you think this was a valid criticism? Explain your answer.
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE
WOMEN'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT
Feminist goals were far-reaching. Women sought greater freedom and a fuller social and economic life.
Education. As a result of affirmative action, universities receiving federal support could no longer discriminate on the basis of sex in their admissions policy. Most colleges became co-educational and hired women professors. In fact, they had to hire more women faculty quickly because most professors were males. Greater gender equality was also achieved in admissions to military academies, law schools, and medical schools.
Employment. Feminists sought to end discrimination in hiring, to establish equal job opportunities for women, and to place women in positions of greater responsibility. In 1963, Congress passed the Equal Pay Act, requiring companies to pay women the same wages as men for the same work.
New Attitudes. Feminists objected to beauty contests and introduced the title “Ms” to replace “Miss” and “Mrs.” They opposed sexist language (“policeman” and “fireman”), the use of women as sex objects in advertising, or the idea that men cannot do housework. Women’s leaders opposed sexual discrimination in textbooks that ignored women’s contributions. They lobbied for more funds to research women’s diseases, like breast cancer.

THE GHETTOS ERUPT,
1968 In the North, African Americans often faced segregation based on residential living patterns rather than on state laws. Homeowners in middle class white communities often refused to sell their homes to African Americans. Many African Americans were confined to ethnic communities, known as ghettos, in decaying inner cities. Landlords often failed to maintain their buildings and city officials cut back on inspections. African-American frustration erupted in a series of riots that shook Northern cities three summers in a row.
In April 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated by a white supremacist in Memphis, Tennessee. King’s assassination led to an outpouring of anger among young African Americans, as well as a period of national mourning. King’s death sparked race riots across the nation that cost dozens of lives, destroyed property, and led to hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. Rioters smashed windows, overturned cars, and started fires.
A commission investigating the causes of the unrest found that the lack of job opportunities for African Americans, urban poverty, and
Cities like Detroit erupted in riots following the assassination of Dr. King.
white racism were the chief factors behind the riots. The riots showed that there was still work to be done to eliminate racism and introduce equality of opportunity in America.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
Research the views of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and leaders of the Black Panthers such as Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. Then make your own chart comparing and contrasting these divergent points of view.
Psychologists have given various explanations for the political violence that followed King’s assassination. They have pointed to rising expectations (African Americans had expected more rapid change), economic deprivation, and general frustration. Do you think any of these reasons can explain the violence? If not, what do you think were the main causes of the rioting?
Like African Americans, Mexican Americans, also known as Chicanos, had often faced discrimination, racism and exploitation in the United States. In the 1960s, a Chicano Movement emerged: its main focus was on such issues as farm workers’ voting and political rights.

CHAPTER 14: The Sixties: A Decade of Protest and Change
Murals soon became an important artistic medium to support identity and justice in Mexican-American communities. Wall murals provided a visual presence to people who often lacked representation in public life, with few voices on city councils or school boards. In El Paso alone, more than a hundred Chicano wall murals were completed. These murals show Taiano legends and heroes like Cesar Chavez.
305
An example of a wall mural in El Paso, Texas.
American Indians also grew restless in the 1960s.
Back in 1953, the federal government had transferred its responsibility for those American Indians still living on reservations to state governments.
Lacking sufficient funds, many states were unable to provide the same level of services previously provided by the federal government. The new policy turned out to be largely a failure.
In 1963, the federal government reversed its policy and began encouraging tribal life on the reservations. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination against Native Americans. In 1970,
President Nixon announced the federal government would honor its treaty obligations. Nevertheless, many American Indians still felt they were being mistreated. Under the slogan “Red Power,” they formed the American Indian Movement to mobilize public opinion in their favor. American Indians
sought greater respect for their heritage. They introduced the term “Native American” and protested against textbooks, television shows and movies that showed anti-American Indian bias. They dramatized the plight of American Indians by temporarily occupying government monuments on Alcatraz Island and at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.

A,
Not only legislation (the passage of new laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964) but also litigation (disputes settled by courts) has played a key role in the expansion of civil rights for minority groups in the United States. This is clear not only from the Supreme Courts decision in Brown v. Board of Education (you can see this case in the last chapter), but also from a series of cases in which courts ruled on Mexican-American rights.
HOW DOES A COURT RULE ON A CASE?
It is important to recall just how courts in the United States work. A case involving a federal law or right can be brought before a federal district court. The court listens to the witnesses and arguments for each side. Then it applies the law to the facts of the case. The "law" consists of any laws passed by the state legislature or Congress, prior court precedents and requirements of the U.S. Constitution.
The room where cases are heard before the Supreme Court.
APPEALING A DECISION
The losing side may appeal the decision to a U.S. Court of Appeals. The twelve Courts of Appeal are organized by region, and each region is known as a "circuit." Finally, the side that loses in the U.S. Court of Appeals can appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a typical year, approximately 10,000 cases are appealed to the Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court only accepts about 100 cases each year. The cases the Supreme Court decides to hear usually involve important questions about the U.S. Constitution or federal law.

MENDEZ V. WESTMINSTER SCHOOL DISTRICT
(1947) In 1945, some places in California sent Mexican-American children to separate public schools. Several Mexican-American parents challenged this practice in U.S. district court. The district court ruled that this practice violated the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees citizens the right to the “equal protection” of the laws. Westminster School District appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The latter concluded that the case did not involve a constitutional question. California law at the time required the segregation of Chinese or Japanese children, but did not “include segregation of school children because of their Mexican blood.” The court held that separation within a race was not permitted if not required by a specific state law. The court thus did not need to rule on the Fourteenth Amendment. Later that year, California repealed its school segregation laws.

At the same time, South Vietnam was far from a democracy. Its President was a dictator who was opposed by Vietnam’s Buddhists. In 1963, he was overthrown and murdered in a coup.

President Elsenhower had suggested that the fall of French Indochina might create a “domino” effect. According to this Domino Theory, if South Vietnam fell to Communism, neighboring Southeast Asian countries would also fall to Communism like a row of dominos. After taking Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, Communists would threaten Thailand to the west and the Strait of Malacca to the south. Resisting the Communists in Vietnam might prevent this collapse.
The Domino Theory greatly affected President Kennedy’s thinking. Responding to requests from the South Vietnamese government for help, Kennedy sent aid and U.S. military advisers to assist South Vietnam in fighting the Vietcong. Kennedy also felt that a successful democracy in South Vietnam might serve as a model for other developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Under President Johnson, the United States became even more deeply involved in Vietnam.
GULF OF TONKIN RESOLUTION
(1964) In 1964, Johnson announced that the North Vietnamese had attacked U.S. ships in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin. Congress voted to give Johnson full military powers to stop North Vietnam’s aggression. Years later, it was revealed that the U.S. ships had actually been in North Vietnamese waters in cooperation with South Vietnamese warships that were bombing North Vietnam.
JOHNSON ESCALATES THE WAR
Although Congress had not officially declared war, President Johnson used the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution to escalate (increase) the war.

THE DIFFICULTIES OF GUERILLA WARFARE
Most American soldiers were unfamiliar with the Vietnamese language, people, or physical environment. American forces were unable to tell who was friendly and who was the enemy. The jungles of Vietnam provided an ideal cover for guerilla warfare and secret enemy movements. Vietnam’s location made it easy for Communists to send a steady flow of supplies through neighboring countries.
GROWING DISCONTENT: THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT
The media (newspapers, radio, television) had a great influence in shaping public opinion. It was the first time American audiences could watch the destructiveness of the war on their television sets while sitting at home. President Johnson told Americans they were winning the war, but journalists reported otherwise. This created a “credibility gap”: many Americans lost faith in their government’s reliability.
Nowhere was this discontent more evident than among young Americans who objected to the country’s involvement in
Protesters burn their draft cards to show their opposition to the war.
Vietnam. Mass anti-war movements occurred throughout the country from 1965 onwards. Young people burned their draft cards, marched on the Pentagon, held rallies, and staged demonstrations. By 1968, millions of young people were actively protesting the war.
The anti-war movement greatly influenced U.S. military policy. American “doves” wanted the United States to withdraw, since they saw the contest as a civil war between the North and South Vietnamese. They believed American leaders were acting immorally by bombing civilians and burning villages. The “hawks” supported the war, which they saw as an attempt to defend free Vietnamese from Communist repression.
Division among Democrats over the war, the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy (younger brother of President Kennedy), and violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968 led to the election of Republican Richard Nixon as President. During the campaign, Nixon, a staunch anti-Communist, promised Americans “peace with honor” in Vietnam. However, the war dragged on for five more years under Nixon.
During these years, Nixon, aided by Henry Kissinger, adopted a complex approach in Vietnam consisting of “Vietnamization,” increased bombing, and diplomacy.

By 1975, what remained of the South Vietnamese Army was incapable of preventing the advance of the North Vietnamese. In April 1975, Saigon finally fell to North Vietnamese forces. The fall of Saigon (today called Ho Chi Minh City) marked the end of the Vietnam War. South Vietnamese government officials, military officers, and soldiers who had supported the American presence in Vietnam were sent to Communist “re-education camps,” where they faced torture, disease and malnutrition.

Have your class stage a debate — Resolved: Americas leaders made a mistake in engaging in the war in Vietnam. Appoint teams for and against the resolution. Or pretend to be having a debate between Hawks and Doves in 1969.
The War in Vietnam had many Important effects:
Death and Destruction. Over 58,000 Americans died, and many others suffered physical and psychological injuries. Over a million Vietnamese were killed, while many more were left homeless.
Impact of the War on the U.S. and Abroad. Wartime expenses led to the end of some Great Society programs and brought rising Inflation. The war demonstrated that government actions can be greatly affected by public opinion. It also led to a crisis of American self-confidence. Next to the Civil War, the Vietnam War was the most divisive war in U.S. history. As a result, Americans became more aware of the limits of U.S. power and cautious about where they should act abroad.
Limits on Presidential Power. In both Korea and Vietnam, Presidents had sent American troops into extended combat without first obtaining a declaration of war from Congress. In 1973, Congress attempted to re-claim its constitutional powers by passing over Nixon’s veto, the War Powers Resolution. This set limits on Presidential power in a conflict without a formal declaration of war by Congress. The act requires the President to inform Congress within 48 hours of sending troops to fight overseas. If within 60 days the Congress does not approve of the use of these overseas forces, the President must withdraw them.

American literature has been marked by movements of varying styles and directions. Some of the best writing just after World War II dealt with the war experience itself, including such works as Norman Mailer’s The Naked and the Dead (1948), describing the capture of an island from the Japanese, and James Jones’ From Here to Eternity (1951), showing army life in Hawaii up to the Pearl Harbor attack.
Allen Ginsberg
In the 1950s, the Beat Generation rebelled against the conformity of their era. This movement began with a small and tightly connected group of young writers who were college students together in New York City and later most moved to San Francisco. They showed a care-free, often reckless and fresh approach to literature.
Two of the founders of the movement, Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, began giving public readings of their works in the mid-1950s.
They became even more well-known after Gins-
berg’s best known poem, Howl (1955), was seized for obscenity. The Beats opposed the conventions of the 1950s and saw the solution to the lifeless materialism of the fifties in the heightened sense of freedom and spirituality in their own works. Kerouac’s novel, On the Road, tells the story of the narrator’s adventures crossing the country in a car several times with a character named Dean Moriarty. Kerouac’s theme was the experience of life itself.
The Beats experimented with both sexuality and drugs. From the name “beat,” a newspaper columnist coined the term “beatnik,” which became associated with artistic lifestyles in the 1950s, in which young men wore beards, berets, and sandals, while young women dressed in leotards. They recited poetry and discussed European philosophy. The beatniks represented an early form of what would later become known as the counter-culture.
By the 1960s, the counter-culture was in full swing. Two late World War II novels, Joseph Heller’s Catch 22 (1961) and Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five (1969), challenged mainstream thinking by exposing the absurdity of armed conflict. Mailer became a critic of the Vietnam War, as shown in his novel, Why Are We in Vietnam? (1967), and also wrote books on anti-war protests, such as Armies of the Night (1968).
In the 1960s, literature also became much more open in its treatment of human consciousness and sexuality, as demonstrated by the novels and short stories of Philip Roth, including Goodbye Columbus (1959) and Portnoy’s Complaint (1969). In a much later work, American Pastoral (1997), Roth dealt with coming to terms with the middle class radicalism of the 1960s.

IMPORTANT IDEAS
(continued) J.
With the Reagan Doctrine, President Reagan announced he would not just contain Communism but try to roll it back. He sent U.S. forces to Grenada, and provided anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua and Afghanistan with funds. K.
Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars), a research program to protect America from nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. L.
Iran-Contra Affair: Officials sold weapons to Iran to free hostages; the proceeds helped to supply Contras in Nicaragua, despite a Congressional ban. M.
President George H.W. Bush continued Reagan’s policies. The Cold War ended during his Presidency. Bush sent troops into Panama, Kuwait and Somalia. N.
President Bill Clinton attempted to enact a comprehensive health care reform but failed to do so. Reduced defense spending after the Cold War coupled with a rise in the computer industry made the 1990s a time of general prosperity. ’ O.
Impeachment charges were brought against President Clinton for lying about an affair he had with a White House intern. Attempts to convict him of these charges failed in the Senate. Clinton was able to successfully push NAFTA through Congress and saw the creation of the World Trade Organization. P. A
talented and hard working group of diverse entrepreneurs — including Bill Gates, Sam Walton, Estee Lauder, Robert Johnson, and Lionel Sosa — helped the American economy.

CHAPTER 15: Crisis and Resurgence, 1969-2000	331
First Amendment Rights. During Nixon’s Presidency, the Supreme Court continued to protect First Amendment rights. In Tinker r Des Moines (1969), John Tinker and his sister were suspended from school for wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. The Supreme Court ruled that this violated the students’ First Amendment rights, and that students have the right to wear armbands to protest the war. In Wisconsin r Yoder (1972), the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Wisconsin state law that required Amish children to attend school beyond Grade 8. The Court found that this state law violated the parents’ freedom of religion since the state’s secondary education conflicted with Amish values and beliefs and was contrary to their way of life.
Inflation. The 1970s saw rising prices, a new trade deficit, and rising unemployment. To combat inflation, Nixon cut spending on social programs, and took America off the gold standard. When these measures did not work, he imposed the first peacetime wage and price controls. All of these attempts to control inflation proved unsuccessful.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)
President Nixon signed a law that created the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to protect the environment. The EPA sets air and water pollution standards for cities, and engages in monitoring and enforcement activities. New construction projects must pass through detailed environmental impact reviews before being approved. Private citizens can file lawsuits against polluters under the EPA.
Nixon also signed the Endangered Species Act (1973). This law requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to list species of plants and animals that are threatened with extinction, and then to take further steps to protect them.
THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT (ERA)
In 1923, Alice Paul, a suffragist leader and founder of the National Woman’s Party, proposed the Equal Rights Amendment: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” For almost fifty years, the amendment was introduced in each session of Congress, but it failed to pass.
In 1972, the amendment was finally approved by Congress and sent to the states with a seven-year time limit for ratification. The deadline was extended to 1982, but the amendments still fell three states short of the support needed for ratification. It has been reintroduced into every Congress since that time.
One outspoken critic of the Women’s Liberation Movement was Phyllis Schlafly. Her book attacking liberal Republicans was used by Goldwater supporters in his 1964 Presidential campaign.
Schlafly also campaigned against the Equal Rights Amendment, which she believed would reduce the rights of wives and harm family life. Schlafly further claimed it would deprive women of the “right” to be “supported and protected” by men. For example,
Schlafly believed the amendment might lead to unisex restrooms and require women to serve in combat roles.

Meanwhile, in 1972 a group of former CIA agents, working for Nixon’s re-election as President, were caught breaking into Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. This would soon lead to an even greater scandal than Agnew’s resignation.
THE COVER-UP
President Nixon tried to cover up an investigation of the Watergate break-in on the grounds that it involved national security. Two investigative reporters were the first to report possible links between the break-in and the White House. The Senate appointed a committee to investigate the incident. The Attorney General also appointed a Special Prosecutor to examine possible wrongdoing.
THE WATERGATE TAPES
In the Senate hearings, a Presidential aide stated that Nixon had participated in the cover-up. Next, it was revealed that Nixon had secretly recorded all of his own White House conversations.
When the Senate Committee asked to listen to the tapes, Nixon refused, claiming executive privilege. Nixon asserted that Congress had no authority to question members of the executive branch about internal communications advising the President without Presidential approval. In the case of United States v. Nixon (1974), Nixon
further contended that if he obeyed the district court order to turn over the tape-recordings, it would lead to judicial control of the Presidency, violating the separation of powers in the Constitution. When the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, it ruled that Nixon must turn over the tapes, reaffirming the principle that no one is above the law.
Woodward (r) and Bernstein won a Pulitzer for their investigative reporting in the case.
Instead of the tapes, Nixon offered up transcripts of the conversations.
NIXON RESIGNS
When the tapes were made public, they revealed that Nixon had in fact lied when he said he was not involved in the cover-up. Based on this and other allegations, the House of Representatives moved to impeach Nixon. Fearing removal from office by the U.S. Senate, Nixon became the first President to resign.
Nixon leaves the White House for the last time.
CHAPTER 15: Crisis and Resurgence, 1969-2000	335
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Ford later said he intended to spare Mr. Nixon and the nation from further turmoil as a result of the Watergate scandals. In his Autobiography he wrote:
“I simply was not convinced that the country wanted to see an
ex-President behind bars. We are not a vengeful people; forgiveness is one of the roots of the American tradition. And Nixon, in my opinion, had already suffered enormously .... But I wasn’t motivated by concern over the state of his health. It was the state of the country’s health at home and around the world that worried me .... ”
Do you think President Ford was truthful when said he was more concerned with the health of the country than that of Nixon? Explain your answer.
Do you think President Ford, in pardoning Nixon, did the right thing? Explain your answer.
CONTINUING STAGFLATION
Once in office, Ford’s main worries were economic ones. Economists had always believed that Inflation (rising prices) accompanied economic growth and full employment, not recession: this was because when most workers had jobs, they would ask to raise their wages; when consumers were actively buying goods, manufacturers would tend to raise their prices.
But now, Americans suffered from stagflation — high unemployment combined with inflation.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had been formed by oil-producing countries in 1960. Most OPEC members were Arab countries. In 1973, the Arab nations of OPEC used oil as a political weapon by imposing an oil embargo on the United States and Western European for siding with Israel in the 1973 war. Overnight, the price of oil shot up. Even when the war ended, the members of OPEC continued to push oil prices higher to enrich their own economies. The higher cost of energy had a significant impact on the American economy — from the cost of heating a home to the prices of food, electricity and gasoline.

Many banks excluded people in low-income neighborhoods from loans and other financial services. This practice was sometimes known as “redlining” because it was possible to draw a red line on a map clearly delineating these neighborhoods. The practice especially affected minorities. Carter pushed through Congress the Community Reinvestment Act (1977), which required banks to make credit available in poor communities, preventing the decay of low-income neighborhoods in inner cities.
FOREIGN POLICY
In foreign policy, Carter wanted the United States to set a moral example for other nations. Carter made human rights a high priority: he condemned apartheid in South Africa, pressured the Soviet Union to allow its Jews to emigrate, and cut aid to dictatorships that violated human rights.
THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY,
1977 Carter wanted to set an example by having the United States act fairly in its dealings with Panama. He signed a treaty returning control of all of the Canal Zone, except for the canal itself, to Panama. The United States further agreed to turn over the canal to Panama by the end of the century.
CAMP DAVID ACCORDS,
1977 Israel had been established as a homeland for the Jewish people by the United Nations in 1948 in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Many Jews had already been living in the area, but there were also many Palestinian Arabs. Truman had strongly supported the creation of Israel, and ever since 1948, U.S. policy had been generally supportive of Israel, a pro-Western democracy in the Middle East. U.S.-Israeli relations were also influenced by the strong support of American Jews for Israel. Israel relied on U.S. economic and military aid for its survival.
Egypt and Israel had fought one another in a series of wars ever since the creation of Israel back in 1948. In 1977, President Carter invited Anwar Sadat, the President of Egypt, and Menachem Begin, the Prime Minister of Israel, to the Presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland. After face-to-face negotiations, an agreement between the two leaders was reached. Under the Camp David Accords, Israel agreed to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, which Israel had taken in the Six-Day War in 1967. In exchange, Egypt offered a peace treaty and the establishment of normal diplomatic relations with Israel — ending thirty years of warfare.

Reagan supporter Charlton Heston later became President of the NRA.
After the problems faced by recent Presidents, conservative beliefs suddenly enjoyed an unexpected resurgence in the United States in the 1980s. In Great Britain, Margaret Thatcher had come into office in 1979 with similar ideas — combating unions, reducing taxes, cutting government spending, and reducing the amount of government regulations. In the 1980 Presidential election, Ronald Reagan received the support of a number of leading American conservative groups:
NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION
The NRA was begun to promote rifle shooting and marksmanship skills. After the assassinations of President Kennedy, his brother Robert, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Congress enacted the Gun Control Act of 1968. The NRA had traditionally steered clear of politics, but now it became more political. Most of its members tended to be politically conservative. In the 1980 election, the NRA endorsed Ronald Reagan, marking the first time in its history the NRA supported a Presidential candidate.
Jerry Falwell
THE MORAL MAJORITY
Another highly influential conservative group that helped elect Reagan was the Moral Majority, mainly composed of Fundamentalist Christians. Begun in 1979 by evangelist Rev. Jerry Falwell, the Moral Majority favored a strict interpretation of the Bible, and an agenda that was socially conservative and anti-Communist. The group also opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. The Moral Majority made telephone calls and held rallies to help get Ronald Reagan elected as President. The group was dissolved in 1989 when Falwell announced that "our mission is accomplished." HERITAGE FOUNDATION
Many of Reagan's policies were strongly influenced by the Heritage Foundation, a "think-tank" based in Washington, D.C. The Heritage Foundation seeks to promote conservative policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, values, and a strong national defense. It provides an example of a non-profit lobbying group that attempts to influence legislators on various bills.

Immigration Policy. President Reagan introduced new changes to our immigration laws. To deal with the problem of illegal immigration, the Mazzoli-Simpson Act (1986) “legalized” illegal aliens who had lived continuously in the United States since 1981.
Sandra Day O'Connor. In 1981, President Reagan nominated Sandra Day O’Connor as the first woman Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Bom in El Paso, Texas, she studied in California before moving to Arizona. O’Connor had served as Arizona’s Assistant Attorney General, State Senator, and a Superior Court Judge. During her early years on the U.S. Supreme Court she was a conservative who preferred “judicial restraint.” She emerged in the late 1990s as a swing vote between the conservative and liberal groups on the Court.
Projected Population Changes, 1980-2000
Until the 1970s, most Americans lived in the Northeast and Midwest, with its hot summers and cold winters. The Southeast was considered too hot and humid in summers, while the West was too dry and remote.
A number of technological developments altered this situation.
Government-built dams
made more water available to Western cities. With rising oil prices, more Americans preferred mild winters over frigid and snowy ones. Lastly, air conditioning and hydro-electric power made it possible to keep homes, offices, and factories cool in the summer.
HI POPULATION DECLINE
GROWTH OF 0-5% GROWTH OF
J® GROWTH OF 28%-50% @ GROWTH OVER 50%
As a result, the West and South, known as the "Sun Belt," saw a sharp rise in their populations. Since the 1960s, when air conditioning first came in wider use, the Northeast and Midwest have increased in population just 27%, while the South and West have grown more than four times as much. California and Texas have become the nation's largest states, while urban regions like Atlanta and Las Vegas are the nation's fastest growing urban centers. As the population density of cities in the Sun Belt grew, the environment of the area changed. Shopping malls and factories sprang up in place of grasslands, mountains, and deserts. Cities demanded more scarce supplies of water and energy, which sometimes had to be brought from great distances, placing a greater burden on the environment.

CHAPTER 15: Crisis and Resurgence, 1969-2000	345
THE IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR
The Iran-Contra Affair arose out of a secret foreign policy operation by officials in the Reagan White House. In 1986, officials in the Reagan Administration acted against the policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists by secretly selling arms to Iran as part of a deal in exchange for the release of American hostages in Lebanon. Profits from the sales of the arms to Iran were then diverted to support the anti-Communist “Contra” rebels fighting the Communist government of Nicaragua. This was done even though Congress had specifically prohibited any U.S. aid to the Contras.
When the affair was revealed, it shocked the nation since the Reagan administration had denounced Iran as a supporter of global terrorism. An investigation cleared the President of any direct wrong-doing, although he had failed to monitor the actions of some of his top officials. Several officials were convicted of lying to Congress and sent to prison.
The Iran-Contra Affair greatly tarnished America’s credibility in the world. After the Watergate Scandal, it led many citizens to seriously question their trust in their government officials. Nevertheless, President Reagan continued to enjoy strong support among many members of the American public.
Reagan’s second term witnessed the triumph of democracy in many parts of the world. In the Philippines and Latin America, dictatorships and military governments were suddenly replaced by democratically-elected civilian governments.
The final years of the Reagan Presidency saw the beginnings of the end of the Cold War. Early in his Presidency, Reagan had called the Soviet Union an “Evil Empire.” Mikhail Gorbachev became head of the Soviet Communist Party in 1985. The failure of the Soviet economic and political system forced Gorbachev to introduce reforms inside the Soviet Union. Gorbachev also agreed to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan and to allow peaceful changes to take place in Eastern Europe. Reagan and Gorbachev then held a series of conferences, and even signed an agreement dismantling thousands of nuclear missiles.
Historians hold conflicting views on Reagan’s role in winding down the Cold War. His critics contend that Reagan was an accidental beneficiary of Gorbachev’s reforms, and that he does not deserve credit for winning the Cold War. Reagan’s supporters believe he played an essential role in this process. They point to Reagan’s forthright defense of freedom and democracy, his policy of “roll-back,” and the threat of the Star Wars program, all of which placed so much economic and military pressure on Soviet leaders that they felt compelled to reform their system.
Reagan speaks at the Berlin Wall in Germany.
CHAPTER 15: Crisis and Resurgence, 1969-2000	347
The next President, George H.W. Bush, had served two terms as Reagan’s Vice President. Bush promised to continue Reagan’s policies, but with greater compassion in dealing with the homeless and the poor. He also promised to improve education and fight drug use.

Bush’s previous experience had mainly been in foreign policy, but he faced several important challenges at home. His greatest domestic challenge was to reduce the growing budget deficit.
Events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union permitted cuts in military spending. In late 1990, Bush agreed to increase income taxes on the wealthy, but he was never able to make a significant reduction in the budget deficit.
The Impact of Defense Spending on the U.S. Economy. Experts disagree on the impact that military spending can have on a country’s economy. It can provide a shortterm stimulus, pushing the nation through the business cycle from recession to prosperity. For example, military expenditures in World War II helped achieve full employment after the Great Depression. On the other hand, military spending can divert, or “crowd out,” resources from other more productive uses, and may thus slow long-term economic growth. Heavy military spending can mean less investment in peacetime projects, higher budget deficits, and more borrowing or higher taxes. Less money will be available, for example, for education. When President Johnson increased American involvement in Vietnam, he thus had to cut back on many Great Society programs.
Supreme Court Appointments. President Bush made several appointments to the Supreme Court, leading to a conservative majority on the Court. The new Supreme Court toughened the rules for criminal defendants, reduced the scope of abortion rights, and introduced other important changes.
The Recession. The United States gradually moved back into a recession by 1990. Economists blamed the economic downturn on reduced spending by consumers, corporations, and federal and state governments. In addition, greater foreign competition led to less demand for some American products. This resulted in lay-offs in several key industries.
While the 1970s and 1980s witnessed increases in population in the Sunbelt, the opposite was true of the “Rust Belt” — areas of the Northeast and Midwest with coal and iron resources, which had once been the center of American industry. With the collapse of the U.S. steel industry, cities such as Gary (Indiana), Detroit (Michigan), and Milwaukee (Wisconsin) have suffered a steady loss of manufacturing jobs to Mexico and overseas.

President Bush declared a cease-fire but refused to go further by removing Saddam Hussein from power. The crisis was significant as the first major challenge to world order after the end of the Cold War. American prestige in the Middle East was greatly enhanced by its success in the war. Bush used America’s new stature to initiate peace talks between Israel and Its Arab neighbors in late 1991.
Somalia. In 1992, President Bush began a humanitarian airlift of food and supplies to war-tom Somalia In northeast Africa, where millions of people faced starvation. When local warlords and bandits continued to steal and threaten food shipments, Bush sent in U.S. troops in the final month of his Presidency.
Select one incident or aspect of the domestic or foreign policy of President George H.W. Bush and create a graphic organizer describing it in greater detail.
Bill Clinton came from a poor Arkansas background. He studied as a Rhodes scholar in England and attended Yale Law School, where he met his wife Hillary Clinton. After law school, Clinton entered politics. He was elected Governor of Arkansas. The Presidential election of 1992 saw Clinton successfully unite different groups within the Democratic Party as well as attract independent voters. Many Americans believed Bush was not doing enough to fight the recession. The criticisms of a third-party candidate, Ross Perot, further weakened Bush’s authority. Perot received about 20% of the total vote, making him one of the most successful third-party candidates in history.
President Clinton addresses Congress.
Clinton promised Americans an ambitious agenda of reform. However, like many Presidents, he found difficulty in obtaining Congressional support for many of his proposals. Although Democrats controlled Congress during the first two years of his Presidency, Clinton had difficulty passing his early budgets. His first budget limited federal spending, increased income taxes to 40% on the richest Americans, cut taxes for low-income Americans, and introduced a federal gasoline tax.

ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The first Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives in 40 years, Newt Gingrich wrote about the Contract with America, that “there is no comparable Congressional document in our two-hundred-year history.”
“We intend to restore accountability to Congress. On the first meeting of Congress, the new Republican majority will immediately pass the following reforms, aimed at restoring the trust of the American people in their government: First, require all laws that apply to the country also apply equally to Congress; Second, select an independent auditing firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Congress for waste, fraud or abuse;
Third, cut the number of House committees, and cut committee staff by one-third; Fourth, limit the terms of all committee chairmen;
Fifth, require committee meetings to be open to the public.
Sixth, require a three-fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase;

A ticket to the Clinton impeachment trial.
1


President Clinton became the subject of a major scandal in his second term of office In 1999, for the second time in history, the Senate conducted an impeachment trial of a President.
An independent prosecutor had uncovered a sexual affair between Clinton and a White House intern. After finding that Clinton had lied about the affair under oath, the prosecutor recommended impeachment. Removing the
President from office requires a formal accusation, or impeachment, by the House of Representatives, and a trial and conviction by the Senate. Impeachment requires a majority vote of the House; conviction is more difficult, requiring a two-thirds vote in the Senate. Voting along party lines, the Republican House of Representatives impeached the President. In the Senate, the Republicans fell short of the required two-thirds votes needed to remove the President. Once again, Americans felt they could not trust their elected leaders.
Unlike Bush, Clinton came to the White House with little experience in foreign affairs. Nevertheless, some of his greatest successes were in foreign policy.
CHAPTER 15: Crisis and Resurgence, 1969-2000	353
BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
Global cooperation helps all countries improve their economies and security. It promotes peace in the nuclear age.	1	Participation provides the United States with a place to state its views.					r"''								"•	' Cooperation in organizations strengthens the relationship of the United States to other members.
					
International cooperation is required to tackle many global problems, such as the environment.			Participation helps Americans spread their brand of democracy around the world.		
COSTS/RISKS OF PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
Participation in international organizations may place voluntary limits on a nation's own sovereignty.
International organizations in-volve the United States in problems around the world.
International organizations cost the United States billions of dollars to support.
China. At first, President Clinton tried to protect human rights in China by proposing to link U.S. trade with China to the promotion of democracy and human rights. He abandoned this policy when it appeared to have no effect on China except hurting U.S. economic interests. Although Clinton continued to press China for human rights reform, he separated this demand from trade issues.
In 1999, U.S. missiles accidentally hit the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia. Chinese nationalists, suspicious that this incident was no accident, marched on the U.S. embassy in Beijing, throwing rocks and chanting anti-U.S. slogans. U.S.-Chinese relations suffered a setback, but there was no attempt to halt U.S.-Chinese trade. By the end of the year, U.S. officials even helped China join the World Trade Organization, further cementing economic ties.
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S OTHER FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES
Russia. Both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton followed a policy of maintaining friendly relations with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.		Israel.TheClinton Administration followed Bush's lead in working towards peace between Israel and its earlier opponents, the PLO and Jordan.				Somalia. American and United Nations forces were unable to end the fighting between rival war lords in Somalia. President Clinton withdrew U.S. troops when no further progress was in sight.
						
Haiti. Haitian military leaders threw out Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a priest who had won U.N.-supervised free elections in 1990. Clinton sent U.S. troops to Haiti, resulting in the return of Aristide to power in 1994.				Iraq. Clinton airlifted U.S. troops to the Middle East to pressure dictator Saddam Hussein to withdraw Iraqi troops from along the Kuwait border. Later he took steps to force Hussein to allow U.N. inspectors to enter Iraq to continue their inspections for nuclear and biological weapons.
