CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 199
A.
Andrew Jackson, a popular military hero, accused John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay of stealing the election of 1824 by a “corrupt bargain.” B.
Jackson was elected President in 1828. He saw himself as the representative of the “common man” and invited the public to attend his inauguration. C.
In these years, state governments ended property requirements for voting, allowing all adult white males to vote. Political parties adopted new tactics to reach more voters: popular rallies, parades, and nominating conventions. D.
Jackson favored the “spoils systems”— replacing government officials with his own supporters. This policy gave more citizens a role in government and prevented the creation of a permanent class of government officials. E.
Jackson proposed the Indian Removal Act in 1830. The act required the Indians to adopt Western ways or move West. The Cherokees refused to do so and appealed their case to the Supreme Court. John Marshall ruled in their favor. In Worcester r. Georgia, the Court again ruled in favor of the Cherokees. This could not prevent Jackson from removing the Cherokees. The delay in their move led to thousands of Cherokee deaths along the “Trail of Tears.” F.
Southerners opposed the Tariff of Abominations and the Tariff of 1832. John C. Calhoun wrote that a state had the right to nullify within its borders a federal law it believed was unconstitutional. In 1832, South Carolina threatened to secede but backed down when President Jackson threatened to use force. G.
Jackson opposed the Second National Bank, which he felt favored the rich in the North. He withdrew government funds and refused to renew its charter. H.
The American free enterprise system is based on respect for private property, minimal government interference in the economy, and the free interaction of producers and consumers. Prices are set by the interaction of consumer demand and the available supply from producers. I.
The Industrial Revolution started in the 1760s in Britain and spread to the United States. It began in the textile industry, but soon transferred to other industries. Work shifted from homes to factories, where workers could be supervised and where water and steam power could be used to run machines. J.
The Age of Jackson was a period of reform. Protestant preachers traveled the countryside and preached for days at camp meetings in the Second Great Awakening. Abolitionists sought to end slavery. Dorothea Dix campaigned to improve conditions in mental hospitals. Other reformers belonged to the Temperance Movement, which sought to ban the drinking of alcohol. K.
During this period, women met at the Seneca Falls Convention (1848) where they demanded equality with men, including the right to vote. L.
This period was also a golden age of literature and art, with such prominent writers as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and Edgar Alan Poe, and the painters of the Hudson River School, including Thomas Cole. Name_______________________________________________
CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 201
THE AGE OF JACKSON
A native of Tennessee, Andrew Jackson was not bom to wealth. He defeated British forces at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. Later, he spent several years fighting Native American Indians in Georgia and Florida. After his defeat in the election of 1824, Jackson and his supporters spent the next four years campaigning for the Presidency. They introduced new campaign tactics, like popular rallies, parades, and nominating conventions.
The Age of the "Common Man." Jackson was finally elected President in 1828. His supporters were the “common people” — laborers, farmers, and frontiersmen. Jackson saw himself as the spokesman of the “common man” — the average American.
The Inauguration. Jackson invited the public to visit the White House for his inauguration.
A crowd of 20,000 people, many in muddy boots, passed through the building. Some broke glassware and china dishes in their struggle to get refreshments.
The Expansion of Democracy.
Jackson’s two terms in office saw an expansion of American democracy. This was a time in which state governments were changing their requirements for voting.
When the republic was founded,
most states required white adult males to own some property in order to vote. Now, these property qualification were lifted.
DEMOCRATIC CHANGES UNDER JACKSON
Voting Rights.
In the 1820s, states eliminated the requirement that voters own property, so that most white males over 21 could vote.
Choosing a President.
Selection of Presidential candidates by party leaders was replaced by nominating conventions, where popularly elected members of each political party chose their candidates.
Campaign Methods.
With increased numbers of voters, new campaign methods emerged. Candidates held dinners, rallies, and public meetings. Jackson invited ordinary people to his inauguration.

The "Spoils System." Jackson believed the President should act as the voice of the common people. To make government more responsive to popular needs, Jackson favored the “spoils system. ’ Supporters who helped in his election campaign were appointed to government posts in place of existing officials.

CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 203
Based on their accomplishments, the Cherokees rejected Jackson’s proposal. When the State of Georgia tried to remove them, the Cherokees took their case to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, they claimed they were an “independent” nation, protected by treaty. John Marshall held that the tribe was a “dependent” nation subject to federal, not state, law. The Cherokees won their case, but Jackson was determined to remove them anyway. He concluded a treaty with some Cherokee tribe members, giving them two years to relocate to Oklahoma.
Worcester k Georgia, Meanwhile, Georgia passed a law in 1830, stating that any white person living among Indians without a license from the governor would be sent to prison. State legislators feared white missionaries were encouraging Indians to resist removal. Samuel Worcester, a missionary, was arrested and sentenced to prison for four years for living among the Cherokees. Worcester sued to obtain his freedom. His case came before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1832.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In Worcester v. Georgia, John Marshall freed Worcester and declared:
“The Cherokee Nation is a distinct community, occupying its own territory, with boundaries accurately described, in which
the laws of Georgia can have no force, and the citizens of Georgia have no right to enter without the [permission] of the Cherokees themselves. The whole [relationship] between the United States and this nation is, by our Constitution and laws, [placed] in the government of the United States. The act of Georgia under which the plaintiff was prosecuted is void.... The acts of Georgia are [against] the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States.”
Based on this excerpt, why did the U.S. Supreme Court free Worcester?
Cherokee leaders delayed moving. Ironically, because of this legal delay, the Cherokees were now forced to move in late fall and winter, when the weather had turned bitterly cold.
In 1837, federal troops were called in to escort 16,000 Cherokees to their new home in Indian Territory. One-fourth of them died from exposure, starvation, and fevers, during the march along the 800-mile journey, known as the “Trail of Tears.”
The “Trail of Tears” journey of the Cherokee.
CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 205
Webster also pointed out that the Constitution assigned the task of determining a law’s constitutionality to the Supreme Court, not to the states. He ended his speech with the stirring words: “Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.”
Several months later, the nation learned President Jackson’s views when he confronted his Vice President, John C. Calhoun, with a toast to “Our federal Union — it must be preserved.” Calhoun replied with a toast to “the Union — next to our liberty, most dear.”
South Carolina Threatens Secession. In 1832, a new tariff lowered duties by ten percent. South Carolina, believing the tariff was still too high, put Calhoun’s nullification theory into practice. A state convention passed a law, the Ordinance of Nullification, voiding the tariff, banning the collection of its duties in South Carolina, and threatening to secede from the Union if the federal government tried to enforce it.
President Jackson immediately spoke out against nullification, calling it nothing more than treason. He acted quickly by dispatching U.S. naval ships to Charleston harbor and ordered that federal fortifications there be strengthened. To bolster Jackson, Congress responded with the Force Bill, giving the President the power to use military force against South Carolina. Jackson also issued a warning in his “Proclamation to the People of South Carolina,” which called resistance to federal law a form of treason.
Henry Clay finally proposed a compromise through a reduction in tariffs over the next ten years. Faced with the use of federal troops, South Carolina withdrew its nullification law and averted a national crisis. Jackson showed that, despite his support for states’ rights, he would use force to preserve the Union.
JACKSON DECLARES WAR ON THE BANK
President Washington had introduced a National Bank as part of Hamilton’s financial plan. A Second National Bank had been chartered in 1816. Jackson greatly disliked the National Bank. He thought it gave an unfair monopoly to wealthy moneyed interests in the Northeast.
Although the Bank was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court in McCulloch v. Maryland, Jackson set out to eliminate it. When Jackson was reelected President in 1832, he ordered the removal of all federal deposits from the National Bank. This massive withdrawal of funds had the effect of crippling the National Bank. Jackson ordered these funds to be placed in state banks, which he felt were more agreeable to lending money to farmers. When it came up for renewal, Jackson refused to renew the National Bank’s charter. Although many Americans admired Jackson, others thought he was far too dictatorial in the way he handled the bank and other matters.

CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 209

Before the Industrial Revolution, weavers and craftsmen worked at home, spinning wool, cotton and linen by hand into finished cloth. This was known as the domestic system. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the 1760s. Britain already enjoyed many advantages, including a powerful middle class, a colonial empire to supply it with raw materials, plentiful coal to run its machines, and a prosperous agriculture in which fewer people were needed to work on farms.
NEW INVENTIONS PROPEL CHANGE
Two important British inventions helped trigger the Industrial Revolution. The spinning jenny (1764) allowed several threads to be spun at once, permitting many threads to be made quickly and inexpensively. James Watt’s improved steam engine (1769) made steam power available for mechanical purposes. Steam power could be used to drive many machines at once. The steam engine led in turn to the construction of large factories, the invention of the steamboat, and the development of railroad trains.
THE SHIFT FROM HOME TO FACTORY
You have already learned that in the 1790s, Samuel Slater had begun producing cotton thread by machine in a factory in New England. In Massachusetts, Francis Cabot Lowell (1775-1817), a successful merchant, and other investors built new factories during the War of 1812. In factories, workers could be supervised and could use machines driven by w.ater or steam power, resulting in increased production. As the production of textiles and other goods increased, their prices fell.

With lower prices, consumer demand rose for textiles. People could now afford factory-made clothes. Producers were able to produce for mass markets at home and internationally, not just for a few local customers. As demand grew, more and more factories were built, employing ever larger machines and greater numbers of workers. These changes set in motion the chain reaction known as the Industrial Revolution:
Rise of		Use of	I	Mass

system	llB	power	1	of goods 		
CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 211
THE NATURE OF WORK
The mass production of goods in factories required new work habits. Pre-industrial craftsmen had worked at home and performed a variety of tasks. They could divide their time between tasks as they wished. Factory work was tedious and monotonous: workers, including children, often performed the same simple task for 12 hours each day. Factory work was also highly disciplined: workers had to arrive at the factory on time and pay close attention to their work throughout the day. In 1820, there were only 350,000 factory workers in the United States; by 1860, there were already two million.
THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN
During these years, women were an important part of the workforce. Farm women had to work in the fields as well as cook, clean, make clothes, and care for their children. Other women worked outside the home as servants, laundresses, cooks, or factory workers. With the rise of industry, even more women found work outside the home. For example, the Lowell factories in New England employed young single women as workers.
Children were expected to respect and obey their parents. Often they worked on the farm, in addition to helping with household chores. With the rise of industry, some children worked long hours in mines and factories. Industrial society also required more educated leaders and managers. People became more aware of childhood as a distinct stage of life, with its own special needs.

The period from the 1820s to the Civil War witnessed the growth of several new reform movements. The spread of “Jacksonian Democracy,” as well as the new challenges of industrialization, helped stimulate these movements.
RELIGIOUS REVIVAL:
THE "SECOND GREAT AWAKENING"
There was a revival of strong religious feelings, sometimes called the “Second Great Awakening.” Methodists, Baptists and other Protestant groups held outdoor religious services and won new converts.
CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 213
Eliza Farnham was the warden of a women’s prison in New York State in the 1840s. She believed in treating prisoners fairly. She allowed prisoners to talk, opened a prison library, and established a school inside the prison to teach prisoners to read and write.
IMPROVED TREATMENT FOR MENTAL ILLNESS
In the 1800s, most people lacked the knowledge needed to care for those with mental illness. Many mentally ill patients were locked in unheated rooms, chained to their beds and beaten into obedience. Some were even sent to jail. Dorothea Dix (1802-1887) led the fight for better treatment of the mentally ill. Dix was distressed to learn that they were often housed with criminals or abused. Her report to the state legislature of Massachusetts revealed these shocking conditions. Dix toured other states to report on their treatment of the mentally ill. Dix also campaigned for general prison reform. Some states established separate buildings to house those with mental disorders. These patients were permitted to work outdoors and to enjoy recreation. Further improvements in treatment were delayed until mental illness was better understood in the next century.
Dorothea Dix
TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT
Many Americans worried that drinking alcoholic beverages ruined people’s health, disrupted family life, led to unemployment, and promoted “ungodly” behavior. Some Protestant preachers denounced drinking alcohol as a sin. In 1826, the American Temperance Society was founded. Its chief objective changed from moderation to total abstinence from alcoholic drinks. In
851, Maine became the first state to ban drinking of alcohol.
Excessive drinking was considered a serious social issue.
ICATION:
COMMON SCHOOL MOVEMENT
Industrial Revolution, most American children received little formal schooling, 'ldren were taught reading, writing, arithmetic, foreign languages, and prayers futor. Reformers like Horace Mann of Massachusetts fought to provide free "ary school to every child. He and other reformers insisted that elementary both free and compulsory. These reformers wanted American children of mix together in the same common schools. Mann also introduced the
teachers.

His Birds of America, containing life-sized portraits of 1,065 individual birds, is the most important work on birds ever published. Audubon’s works in pastel show what American wildlife and woodlands were like before the spread of human settlement. Audubon was also responsible for the discovery of many new species of North American birds and mammals. His influence on birds and natural history was far reaching. Most later works about birds were in some way inspired by his artistry. Despite a few errors in his observations, Audubon’s notes make up one of the most important contributions to our understanding of the anatomy and behavior of birds.
