 first half of the nineteenth century. This great wave of humanity was not always welcomed, however. Ethnic prejudices, ­anti-​­Catholicism, and language barriers made it difficult for many new immigrants, mostly from Ireland, Germany, and China, to be assimilated into American culture. In the Midwest, ­large-​­scale commercial agriculture emerged as big farms grew corn, wheat, pigs, and cattle to be sold in distant markets and across the Atlantic. In the South, cotton became so profitable that it increasingly dominated the region’s economy, luring farmers and planters (wealthy farmers with hundreds or even thousands of acres worked by large numbers of slaves) into the new states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas. In both Europe and the United States, cotton cloth was the first great consumer product of industrial capitalism; cotton from the American South provided most of the clothing for people around the world. As the cotton economy expanded, it required growing numbers of enslaved workers, many of whom were sold by professional slave traders and relocated from Virginia and the Carolinas to the Old ­Southwest—​­western Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and Arkansas. Meanwhile, the Northeast experienced a momentous surge of industrial development whose ­ labor-​­ saving machines and ­ water-​­and s­team-​ ­powered industries reshaped the region’s economic and social life. Mills and factories began to dot the landscape and transform the ways people labored, dressed, ate, and lived. With the rise of the factory system, more and more economic activity in the northeastern states occurred outside the home and off the farm. “The transition from m ­ other-​­daughter power [in the home] to water and steam power” in the mills and factories,” said a farmer, was producing a “complete revolution in social life and domestic manners.” An urban middle class began to emerge as Americans left farms and moved to towns and cities, drawn primarily by jobs in new mills, factories, stores, and banks. By 1850, the United States had become the world’s fastest growing commercial, manufacturing, agricultural, and mining nation. The industrial economy also generated changes in other areas, from politics to the legal system, from the family to social values. These developments in turn helped expand prosperity and freedom for whites and free blacks. They also sparked vigorous political debates over economic policies, transportation improvements, and the extension of slavery into the new territories. In the process, the nation began to divide into three powerful r­ egions—​­North, South, and ­West—​­whose shifting alliances and disputes would shape political life until the Civil War.

The Market Revolution  353


The Market Revolution
 During the first half of the nineteenth century, a market revolution that had begun before the war of independence accelerated the transformation of the American economy into a global powerhouse. In the eighteenth century, most Americans were isolated farmers focused on a subsistence or household economy. They produced just enough food, livestock, and clothing for their own family’s needs and perhaps a little more to barter (exchange) with their neighbors. Their lives revolved around a regular farmstead routine in a d ­ ay-​­long cycle that started with the rooster crowing at dawn to the sleep of the chickens at night, punctuated by the changing seasons and unpredictable weather. As the nineteenth century unfolded, however, more and more farm families began engaging in commercial rather than subsistence agriculture, producing surplus crops and livestock to sell for cash in distant regional and even international markets. In 1851, the president of the New York Agricultural Society noted that until the nineteenth century, “ ‘production for consumption’ was the leading purpose” of the farm economy. Now, however, “no farmer could find it profitable to do everything for himself. He now sells for money.” With the cash they earned, farm families were able to buy more land, better farm equipment, and the latest manufactured household goods. Such farming for sale rather than for consumption, often called a ­market-​ ­based economy, produced b ­ oom-​­and-​­bust cycles and was often built upon the backs of slave laborers, immigrant workers, and displaced Mexicans. Overall, however, the standard of living rose and Americans experienced unprecedented opportunities for economic gain and geographic mobility. The transition from a traditional household economy to a modern market economy involved massive changes in the way people lived, worked, traveled, and voted. What the market economy most needed in order to flourish was what were then called “internal improvements”—deepened harbors, lighthouses, and a national network of canals, bridges, roads, and r­ ailroads—​­all designed to improve the flow of goods to markets by liberating people from the constraints of distance. In 1817, for example, South Carolina congressman John C. ­Calhoun expressed his desire to “bind the Republic together with a perfect system of roads and canals.” As the world’s largest republic, the United States desperately needed a national transportation system. “Let us conquer space,” he told the House of Representatives. Calhoun’s proposal sparked a fierce debate over how to fund the improvements: should it be the responsibility of the federal government, the individual

 states, or private corporations? Since the Constitution said nothing about the federal government’s role in funding transportation improvements, many argued that such projects must be initiated by state and local governments. Others argued that the Constitution gave the federal government broad powers to promote the “general welfare,” which included enhancing transportation and communication. The fierce debate over how best to fund internal improvements would continue throughout the nineteenth century.

 Until the nineteenth century, travel in America had been slow, tedious, uncomfortable, and expensive. It took a stagecoach, for example, four days to go from New York City to Boston. Because of long travel times, many farm products could only be sold locally before they spoiled. That soon changed, as an array of i­ nnovations—​­larger ­horse-​­drawn wagons (called Conestogas), new roads, canals, steamboats, and ­railroads—​­knit together the expanding national market for goods and services and greatly accelerated the pace of life. As more settlers moved west, people expressed a “passion for improving roads.” In 1795, the Wilderness Road, along the trail first blazed by Daniel Boone, was opened to wagon and stagecoach traffic, thereby easing the ­over-​ ­the-​­mountains route from North Carolina into Kentucky and Tennessee.

 356  CHAPTER 8  The Emergence of a Market Economy 1815–1850

 In 1803, when Ohio became a state, Congress had ordered that 5 percent of the money from land sales in the state would go toward building a National Road from the Atlantic coast across Ohio and westward. Construction finally began in 1811. Originally called the Cumberland Road, it was the first interstate roadway financed by the federal government. By 1818, the road was open from Cumberland, Maryland, westward to Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), where it crossed the Ohio River. By 1838, the National Road extended 600 miles farther westward to Vandalia, Illinois. The National Road quickened the settlement of the West and the emergence of a truly national market economy by reducing transportation costs, opening up new markets, and stimulating the growth of towns. Farmers increasingly took their produce and livestock to sell in distant markets. But using federal money to finance “internal improvements” remained controversial. To the northeast, a movement for paved roads gathered momentum after the ­Philadelphia-​­Lancaster Turnpike was completed in 1794. (The term turnpike derives from a pole, or pike, at the tollgate, which was turned to admit the traffic in exchange for a small fee, or toll.) By 1821, some 4,000 miles of turnpikes had been built, and stagecoach and freight companies emerged to move more people and cargo at lower rates. As the quality of the roads improved, stagecoaches increased their speed. In addition, stagecoach lines began using continual relays, or “stages,” of fresh horses every 40 miles or so. This made travel faster, less expensive, and more accessible.

 waterways By the early 1820s, the turnpike boom was giving way to dramatic advances in water transportation. Steamboats, flatboats (barges driven by men using long poles), and canal barges carried people and goods far more cheaply than did ­horse-​­drawn wagons. Hundreds of flatboats floated goods, farm produce, livestock, and people from Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and other states down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Flatboats, however, went only in one direction: downstream. Once unloaded in Natchez, Mississippi, or New Orleans, Louisiana, they were sold and dismantled to provide lumber for construction. The difficulties of getting back upriver were solved when Robert Fulton and Robert R. Livingston sent the Clermont, the first commercial steamboat, up the Hudson River from New York City in 1807. Thereafter, the use of ­wood-​ fi ­ red steamboats spread rapidly, opening nearly half the continent to water traffic along the major rivers. By bringing t­wo-​­way travel to the Mississippi Valley, which included the areas drained by the Ohio and Missouri Rivers, steamboats created a ­transcontinental market and a commercial agricultural empire that produced

 much of the nation’s cotton, timber, wheat, corn, cattle, and hogs. By 1836, there were 750 steamboats operating on American rivers. As steamboat use increased, the price for shipping goods plunged, thus increasing profits and stimulating demand. The use of steamboats transformed St. Louis, Missouri, from a sleepy frontier village into a booming river port. New Orleans developed even faster. By 1840, it was perhaps the wealthiest American city, having developed a thriving trade with the Caribbean islands and the new Latin American republics that had overthrown Spanish rule. A thousand steamboats a year visited New Orleans. The annual amount of trade being shipped through the river city doubled that of New York City by 1843, in large part because of the explosion in cotton production. The ­wood-​­burning steamboats were crowded, dirty, and risky forms of transportation. Accidents, explosions, and fires were common, and sanitation was poor. Passengers crowded on board along with pigs and cattle. There were no toilets on steamboats until the 1850s, and all passengers shared the same two washbasins and towels. For all of the inconveniences, however, steamboats were the fastest and most convenient form of transportation in the first half of the nineteenth century. Canals also sped the market revolution. The Erie Canal in central New York connected the Great Lakes and the Midwest to the Hudson River and New York City. New York Governor DeWitt Clinton, former mayor of New York City and vice president under James Madison, took the lead in

 358  CHAPTER 8  The Emergence of a Market Economy 1815–1850

 ­ romoting the risky engineering project, which Thomas Jefferson dismissed as p “little short of madness.” Clinton, however, boasted that his state of New York had the opportunity to “create a new era in history, and to erect a work more stupendous, more magnificent, and more beneficial, than has hitherto been achieved by the human race.” It was not an idle boast. After the Erie Canal opened in 1825, having taken eight years to build, it drew eastward much of the midwestern trade (furs, lumber, textiles) that earlier had been forced to go to Canada or to make the long journey down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. Thanks to the Erie Canal, the backwoods village of Chicago developed into a bustling city because of its commercial connection via the Great Lakes to New York City, and eventually across the Atlantic to Europe. The Erie Canal was a triumph of engineering audacity. Forty feet wide and four feet deep, it was the longest canal in the world, extending 363 miles across New York from Albany in the east to Buffalo and Lake Erie in the west and rising some 675 feet in elevation. Additional branches soon put most of the state within its reach. The canal was built by tens of thousands of manual laborers, mostly German and Irish immigrants who were paid less than a dollar a day to drain

 swamps, clear forests, build stone bridges and aqueducts, and blast through solid rock. It brought a “river of gold” to New York City in the form of an unending stream of lumber, grain, flour, and other goods from western New York and the Midwest, and it unlocked the floodgates of western settlement. The canal also reduced the cost of moving a ton of freight from $100 to $5. It was so profitable that it paid off its construction costs in just seven years. The Erie Canal had enormous economic and political consequences, as it tied together the regional economies of the Midwest and the East while further isolating the Deep South. The Genesee Valley in western New York became one of the most productive g­ rain-​­growing regions in the world, and Rochester became a boom town, processing wheat and corn into flour and meal. The writer Nathaniel Hawthorne said “the town had sprung up like a mushroom.” Syracuse, Albany, and Buffalo experienced similarly dramatic growth because of the Erie Canal. The business of moving goods and people along the canal involved some 4,000 boats and over 25,000 workers. Canal boats, slender and shallow, usually eleven feet wide and seventy feet long, were pulled by teams of horses or mules walking along a towpath. The teams hauling the boats needed to be changed every ten to twelve miles. Painted in bright colors and given colorful names, the “packet” boats carrying passengers traveled seven days a week at between two and four miles an hour. Much time was lost waiting at one of the e­ ighty-​­eight locks, where boats would enter one at a time to be raised or lowered to match the changing water level of the canal. Often, the boat captains took their families with them. Most boatmen, however, were ­single—​­and rough. One traveler called them “a coarse and untaught set of vagabonds whose chief delight is to carouse and fight.” The success of the Erie and the entire New York canal system inspired other states to build some 3,000 miles of waterways by 1837, not all of which were successful. By 1834, canals connected Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, a distance of 395 miles. Canals boosted the economy by enabling speedier and less expensive transport of goods and people. They also boosted real estate prices for the lands bordering the canals and transformed sleepy rural villages like Rochester, New York, into booming cities.

 railroads

 For a brief period, canals were essential to the nation’s economic growth. The canal era was ­short-​­lived, however. During the second quarter of the nineteenth century a much less expensive but much more powerful, efficient, and versatile form of transportation emerged: the railroad. In 1825, the year the Erie Canal was completed, the world’s first s­team-​ ­powered railway began operating in England. Soon thereafter, a r­ ailroad-​­building

 360  CHAPTER 8  The Emergence of a Market Economy 1815–1850

 “epidemic” infected the United States. In 1830, the nation had only 23 miles of railroad track. Over the next twenty years, railroad coverage grew to 30,626 miles. The railroad was a truly transformational technology. It surpassed other forms of transportation because of its speed, carrying capacity, and reliability. Railroads could move more people and freight faster, farther, and cheaper than wagons or boats. The early trains averaged ten miles per hour, more than twice the speed of stagecoaches and four times that of boats and barges. That locomotives were able to operate ­year-​­round gave rail travel a huge advantage over canals that froze in winter and dirt roads that became rivers of mud during rainstorms. Railroads also provided indirect benefits by encouraging new western settlement and the expansion of commercial agriculture. The power of the railroad could be seen everywhere, from rural areas to big cities. A westerner reported that the opening of a new rail line resulted in three new villages emerging along the line while “adding new life to the city.” The depot or rail station became the central building in every town, a public place where people from all walks of life and places converged. Building railroads stimulated the national economy not only by improving transportation but also by creating a huge demand for iron, wooden crossties, bridges, locomotives, freight cars, and other equipment. Railroads also became the nation’s largest corporations and employers. Perhaps most important, railroads enabled towns and cities not served by canals or turnpikes to compete economically. In other words, the railroads eventually changed what had once been a cluster of mostly local markets near rivers and the coast into an interconnected national marketplace for goods and services. Railroads expanded the geography of American capitalism, making possible larger industrial and commercial enterprises and shrinking distances for passengers. But the railroad mania had negative effects as well. Its quick and shady profits frequently led to political corruption. Railroad titans often bribed legislators. By facilitating access to the t­rans-​­Appalachian West, the railroads also accelerated the decline of Native American culture. In addition, they dramatically quickened the tempo, mobility, and noise of everyday life. Writer Nathaniel Hawthorne spoke for many when he said that the locomotive, with its startling whistle, brought “the noisy world into the midst of our slumberous space.”

 ocean transportation

 The year 1845 brought a great innovation in ocean transport with the launch of the first clipper ship, the Rainbow. ­ ineteenth-​­century equivalent of Built for speed, the clipper ships were the n

 the supersonic jetliner. They were twice as fast as the older merchant ships. Long and lean, with taller masts and larger sails than conventional ships, they cut dashing figures during their brief but colorful career, which lasted less than two decades. The American thirst for Chinese tea prompted the clipper boom. Asian tea leaves had to reach markets quickly after harvest, and the fast clipper ships made this possible. The discovery of gold in California in 1848 lured thousands of prospectors and entrepreneurs. When the w ­ ould-​­be miners generated an urgent demand for goods on the West Coast, the clippers met it. In 1854, the Flying Cloud took ­eighty-​­nine days and eight hours to travel from New York to San Francisco, around South America, less than half as long as the trip would have taken in a conventional ship. But clippers, while fast, lacked ample space for cargo or passengers. After the Civil War, the clippers would give way to the steamship.

 communications Innovations in transportation also helped spark improvements in communications, which knit the nation even closer together. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, traveling any distance was slow and difficult. It took d ­ ays—​­often ­weeks—​­for news to travel along the Atlantic Seaboard. For example, after George Washington died in 1798 in Virginia, word of his death did not appear in New York City newspapers until a week

 later. By 1829, however, it was possible to deliver Andrew Jackson’s inaugural address from Washington, D.C., to New York City by relay horse riders in less than twenty hours. Mail deliveries also improved. The number of U.S. post offices soared from 75 in 1790 to 28,498 in 1860. In addition, new ­steam-​­powered printing presses enabled the mass production of newspapers by reducing their cost from six cents to a penny each, enabling virtually everyone to benefit from the news contained in the “penny press.” But the most important advance in communications was the national electromagnetic telegraph system, invented by Samuel F. B. Morse. In May 1844, Morse sent the first intercity telegraph message from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Maryland. It read: “What Hath God Wrought?” By the end of the decade, most major cities were connected by telegraph lines that enabled people, companies, and governments to communicate faster and more reliably. The electrical telegraph system also helped railroad operators schedule trains more precisely and thus avoid collisions. A New Orleans newspaper claimed that, with the invention of the telegraph, “scarcely anything now will appear to be impossible.”

 the role of government Steamboats, canals, and railroads connected the western areas of the country with the East, boosted trade, helped open the Far West for settlement, and spurred dramatic growth in cities. Between 1800 and 1860, an undeveloped nation of scattered farms, primitive roads, and modest local markets was transformed into an engine of capitalist expansion, urban energy, and global reach. The transportation improvements were financed by both state governments and private investors. The federal government helped, too, despite intense political debates over whether it was constitutional to use federal funds to finance such “internal improvements.” The national government also bought stock in turnpike and canal companies and, after the success of the Erie Canal, awarded land grants to several western states to support canal and railroad projects. In 1850, Stephen A. Douglas, a powerful Democratic senator from Illinois, convinced Congress to provide a major land grant to support a ­north–​­south rail line connecting Chicago and Mobile, Alabama. Regarded at the time as a special case, the 1850 Congressional land grant set a precedent for other bounties that totaled about 20 million acres by 1860. However, this would prove to be a small amount when compared to the land grants that Congress would award transcontinental railroads during the 1860s and after. The national government also sent federal cavalry troops to “pacify” the Indians along the route of the railroads.

Industrial Development  365


Industrial Development
 The concentration of huge numbers of people in commercial and factory cities, coupled with the transportation and communication revolutions, greatly increased the number of potential customers for given products. Such expanding market demand in turn gave rise to a system of mass production, whereby companies used new technologies (­labor-​­saving machines) to produce greater quantities of products that could be sold at lower prices to more people, thus generating higher profits. The introduction of steam engines, as well as the application of new technologies to make manufacturing more efficient, sparked a wave of unrelenting industrialization in Europe and America from the ­mid-​­eighteenth century to the late nineteenth century. Mechanized factories, mills, and mines emerged to supplement the agricultural economy. “It is an extraordinary era in which we live,” reported Daniel Webster in 1847. “It is altogether new. The world has seen nothing like it before.” New machines and improvements in agricultural and industrial efficiency led to a remarkable increase in productivity. By 1860, one farmer, miner, or mill worker could produce twice as much wheat, twice as much iron, and more than four times as much cotton cloth as in 1800.

 american technology Such improvements in productivity were enabled by the “practical” inventiveness of Americans. Between 1790 and 1811, the U.S. Patent Office approved an annual average of 77 new patents certifying new inventions; by the 1850s, the Patent Office was approving more than 28,000 new inventions each year. Many of the industrial inventions generated dramatic changes. In 1844, for example, Charles Goodyear patented a process for “vulcanizing” rubber, which made the product stronger, more elastic, waterproof, and ­winter-​­proof. Vulcanized rubber was soon being used for a variety of products, from shoes and boots to seals, gaskets, hoses and, eventually, tires. In 1846, Elias Howe patented his design of the sewing machine. It was soon improved upon by Isaac Merritt Singer, who founded the Singer Sewing Machine Company, which initially produced only industrial sewing machines for use in textile mills but eventually offered machines for home use. The availability of sewing machines helped revolutionize “women’s work” by dramatically reducing the time needed to make clothes at home, thus freeing up more leisure time for many women. Technological advances improved living conditions; houses could be larger, better heated, and better illuminated. The first sewer systems helped clean up cities by ridding their streets of human and animal waste. Mechanization of

 366  CHAPTER 8  The Emergence of a Market Economy 1815–1850

 factories meant that more goods could be produced faster and with less labor, and machines helped industries produce “standardized parts” that could be assembled by unskilled wage workers. ­Machine-​­made clothes using standardized forms fit better and were less expensive than those sewn by hand; ­machine-​­made newspapers and magazines were more abundant and affordable, as were clocks, watches, guns, and plows.

 the impact of the cotton gin

 In 1792 Eli Whitney, a recent Yale graduate from New England, visited Mulberry Grove plantation on the Georgia coast, where he “heard much said of the difficulty of ginning cotton”— that is, separating the fibers from the seeds. Cotton had been used for clothing and bedding from ancient times, but until the nineteenth century, cotton cloth was rare and expensive because it took so long to separate the lint (fibers) from tenacious cotton seeds. One person working all day could separate barely one pound by hand. At Mulberry Grove, Eli Whitney learned that the person who could invent a “machine” to gin cotton would become wealthy overnight. Within a few days, he had devised a simple mechanism (he called it “an absurdly simple contrivance”), using nails attached to a roller, to remove the seeds from cotton bolls. The cotton gin (short for engine) proved to be fifty times more productive than a hand Whitney’s cotton gin Eli Whitney’s laborer. Almost overnight, it made drawing, which accompanied his 1794 the white fiber America’s most profitfederal patent application, shows the able cash crop. In the process, it transside and top of the machine as well as formed southern agriculture, northern the sawteeth that separated the seeds industry, ­race-​­based slavery, national from the fiber. politics, and international trade.

 During the first half of the nineteenth century, s­ outhern-​ g­ rown cotton became the dominant force driving both the national economy and the controversial efforts to expand slavery into the western territories. Cotton was called “white gold”; it brought enormous wealth to southern p ­ lanters

 and merchants as well as New England textile mill owners and New York shipowners. By 1812, because of the widespread use of cotton gins, the cost of producing cotton yarn had plunged by 90 percent, and the spread of textile mills in Britain and Europe had created a rapidly growing global market for southern cotton. By the m ­ id-​­nineteenth century, people worldwide were wearing m ­ ore-​­comfortable and ­easier-​­to-​­clean cotton clothing. When British textile manufacturers chose the less brittle American cotton over the varieties grown in the Caribbean, Brazil, and India, the demand for southern cotton skyrocketed, as did its price. Cotton became America’s largest export and the primary driver of the nation’s extraordinary economic growth during the first half of the nineteenth century. By 1860, British textile mills were processing a billion pounds of cotton a year, 92 percent of which came from the American South. Cotton growing first engulfed the Piedmont region of the Carolinas and Georgia. After the War of 1812, it migrated into the contested Indian lands to the ­west—​­Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas. New Orleans became a bustling p ­ ort—​­and active slave ­market—​ ­because of the cotton grown throughout the region and shipped down the Mississippi River. From the ­mid-​­1830s to 1860, cotton accounted for more than half of American exports. Planter capitalists in the South harvested raw cotton, and northern buyers and shipowners carried it to New England, Great Britain, and France, where textile mills spun the fiber into thread and fabric. Bankers in New York City and London financed the growth of global cotton capitalism.

 the expansion of slavery

 Because cotton is a ­labor-​­intensive crop, growers were convinced that only slaves could make their farms and plantations profitable. As a result, the price of slaves soared with the price of cotton. When farmland in Maryland and Virginia lost its fertility after years of relentless tobacco planting, many whites shifted to growing corn and wheat, since the climate in Maryland and Virginia was too cold for cotton. Many Virginia and Maryland planters sold their surplus slaves to work in the new c­ otton-​ ­growing areas in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Between 1790 and 1860, some 835,000 slaves were “sold south.” In 1790, planters in Virginia and Maryland had owned 56 percent of all the slaves in the United States; by 1860, they owned only 15 percent. Cotton created boom times in the new region called the Old Southwest (southwest Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and the panhandle of Florida). A cotton farmer in Mississippi urged a friend in Kentucky to sell his farm and join him: “If you could reconcile it to yourself to bring your negroes to the Mississippi Territory, they would certainly make you a handsome fortune in

 ten years by the cultivation of Cotton.” Slaves became so valuable that stealing slaves became a common problem in the southern states, especially Alabama and Mississippi.

 farming the midwest By 1860, more than half the nation’s population lived west of the Appalachian Mountains. The flat, fertile farmlands in the M ­ idwest—​­Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and I­owa—​­drew farmers from the rocky hillsides of New England and the exhausted soils of Virginia. By 1860, 30 to 40 percent of Americans born in New England had moved west, first to upstate New York and then to Ohio and the Midwest. People traveled on foot, on horseback, and in jarring wagons, all in an effort to make a fresh start on their own land made available by the government. The process of settling new lands followed the old pattern of clearing underbrush and felling trees, burning the debris, grubbing out the roots by hand and using horses and oxen to dislodge stumps, removing rocks and boulders, and then plowing and planting fields. Corn was typically the first crop grown. Women and children often planted the seeds in small mounds about three feet apart. Once the corn sprouted, pumpkin, squash, or bean seeds would be planted around the seedlings. The strong corn stalk provided a pole for the bean vines to climb, the beans and squash or pumpkins added prized nitrogen to the soil, and the squash and pumpkin plants grew and spread over the ground, smothering weeds around the corn stalks. Once the corn was harvested, the kernels could be boiled to make porridge or ground up to make flour and cornmeal that was baked into a bread called johnnycake. Corn stalks were stored to provide winter feed for the cattle and hogs. Over time, technological advances led to greater agricultural productivity. The development of durable iron plows (replacing wooden ones) eased the backbreaking job of tilling the soil. In 1819, Jethro Wood of New York introduced an iron plow with separate parts that were easily replaced when needed. Further improvements would follow, including Vermonter John Deere’s steel plow (1837), whose sharp edges could cut through the tough prairie grass in the Midwest and the Great Plains. By 1845, Massachusetts alone had s­ eventy-​ ­three plants making more than 60,000 plows per year. Most were sold to farmers in the western states and territories, illustrating the emergence of a national marketplace for goods and services made possible by the transportation revolution. Other technological improvements quickened the growth of commercial agriculture. By the 1840s, new mechanical seeders had replaced the process of sowing seed by hand. Even more important, in 1831 ­twenty-​­two-​­year-​­old

 McCormick’s Reaping Machine This illustration appeared in the catalog of the Great Exhibition, held at the Crystal Palace in London in 1851. The steel plow eased the transformation of the tough grass on the plains and prairies into fertile farmland, and the reaping machine greatly accelerated farm production.

 ­ irginian Cyrus Hall McCormick invented a mechanical reaper to harvest V wheat, a development as significant to the agricultural economy of the Midwest, Old Northwest, and Great Plains as the cotton gin was to the South. In 1847 the McCormick reapers began selling so fast that he moved to Chicago and built a manufacturing plant. Within a few years McCormick had sold thousands of the giant farm machines, transforming the scale of commercial agriculture. Using a handheld sickle, a farmer could harvest a half acre of wheat a day; with a McCormick reaper, two people could work twelve acres a day.

 early textile manufacturers While technological breakthroughs such as the cotton gin, mechanical harvester, and railroads quickened agricultural development and created a national and international marketplace, other advances altered the economic landscape even more profoundly by giving rise to the factory system. Industrial capitalists who financed and built the first factories were the revolutionaries of the nineteenth century. Mills and factories were initially powered by water wheels, then ­coal-​­fired steam engines. The shift from water power to coal as a source of energy is what enabled the dramatic growth of the textile industry (and industries of all types), initiating a w ­ orld-​­wide industrial era destined to end Britain’s domination of the world economy. In the eighteenth century, Great Britain enjoyed a long head start in industrial production. The foundations of Britain’s advantage were the invention of the steam engine in 1705, its improvement by James Watt in 1765, and a series of additional inventions that mechanized the production of textiles (thread,

 370  CHAPTER 8  The Emergence of a Market Economy 1815–1850

 fabric, bedding, and clothing). Britain carefully guarded its h ­ ard-​­won industrial secrets, forbidding the export of machines or the publication of descriptions of them, even restricting the emigration of skilled mechanics. But the secrets could not be kept forever. In 1789, Samuel Slater arrived in America from England with a detailed plan in his head of a ­water-​­powered spinning machine. He contracted with an enterprising ­merchant-​­manufacturer in Rhode Island to build a mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and in that little mill, completed in 1790, nine children turned out a satisfactory cotton yarn, which was then worked up by the “­putting-​­out system,” whereby women would weave the yarn into cloth in their homes. In 1800, the output of America’s mills and factories amounted to only ­one-​ ­sixth of Great Britain’s production, and the growth rate was slow and faltering until Thomas Jefferson’s embargo in 1807 stimulated the domestic production of cloth. By 1815, hundreds of textile mills in New England, New York, and Pennsylvania were producing thread, cloth, and clothing. By 1860, the output of America’s factories would be a third and by 1880 t­ wo ​­thirds that of British industry. After the War of 1812, however, British textile companies blunted America’s industrial growth by flooding the United States with cheap cotton cloth in an effort to regain their customers who had been shut off by the war. Such postwar “dumping” nearly killed the infant American textile industry. A d ­ elegation

 of New England mill owners traveled to Washington, D.C., to demand a federal tariff (tax) on imported British cloth to make American textile mills more competitive. The efforts of the mill owners to gain political assistance created a culture of industrial lobbying for congressional tariff protection against imported products that continues to this day. What the mill owners neglected to admit was that import tariffs hurt consumers by forcing them to pay higher prices. Over time, as Scotsman Adam Smith explained in his classic book on capitalism, The Wealth of Nations (1776), consumers not only pay higher prices for foreign goods as a result of tariffs, but they also pay higher prices for domestic goods, since businesses invariably seize opportunities to raise the prices charged for their products. Tariffs helped protect American industries from foreign competition, but competition is the engine of innovation and efficiency in a capitalist economy. New England shipping companies opposed higher tariffs because they would reduce the amount of goods being carried in their vessels across the Atlantic from Britain and Europe. Many southern planters opposed tariffs because of fears that Britain and France would retaliate by imposing tariffs on American cotton and tobacco shipped to their ports. In the end, the New England mill owners won the tariff war. Congress passed the Tariff Bill of 1816, which placed a tax of ­twenty-​­five cents on every yard of imported cloth. Such tariffs were a major factor in promoting industrialization. By impeding foreign competition, they enabled American manufacturers to dominate the national marketplace.

 the lowell system

 The factory system centered on ­wage-​­earning workers sprang f­ull-​­blown upon the American scene at Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1813, when a group known as the Boston Associates constructed the first textile mill in which the mechanized processes of spinning yarn and weaving cloth were brought together under one roof. In 1822, the Boston Associates, led by Francis Cabot Lowell, developed another cotton mill at a village along the Merrimack River ­twenty-​­eight miles north of Boston, which they renamed Lowell. It soon became the model for textile mill towns throughout New England. The founders of the Lowell system sought not just to improve industrial efficiency through the use of l­ abor-​­saving machinery, but to develop model industrial communities designed to increase efficiency and profitability. They located their ­four-​­and ­five-​­story ­brick-​­built mills along rivers in the countryside. Women were the first factory workers in the nation, as the mill owners at Waltham and Lowell hired mostly young women aged fifteen to thirty from farm families. The owners preferred women because of their skill in operating textile machines and their willingness to endure the ­mind-​­numbing boredom of operating spinning machines and looms for wages lower than those paid to men (even though their wages, $2.50 per week, were the highest in the world for women). Moreover, by the 1820s, New England had a surplus of women because so many men had migrated westward. In the early 1820s, a steady stream of single women began flocking toward Lowell. To reassure worried parents, mill owners promised to provide the “Lowell girls” with tolerable work, prepared meals, comfortable boardinghouses (four girls to a room), moral discipline, and educational and cultural opportunities. Initially the “Lowell idea” worked pretty much according to plan. VisiMill girls Massachusetts mill workers tors commented on the ­well-​­designed of the ­mid-​­nineteenth century, red brick mills with their lecture halls photographed holding shuttles used in and libraries.

 dormitories staffed by housemothers who enforced church attendance and evening curfews. Despite ­thirteen-​­hour work days and ­five-​­and-​­a-​­half day workweeks (longer hours than those imposed upon prison inmates), some of the women found the time and energy to form study groups, publish a literary magazine, and attend lectures. By 1840, there were ­thirty-​­two mills and factories in Lowell. As Lowell rapidly grew, however, the industrial village lost much of its innocence and cohesion as the mill owners accumulated “unbelievable profits.” The once rural village had become a grimy industrial city. Mill owners produced too much cloth, which depressed prices. To maintain their profits, the owners cut wages and quickened the pace of work. As a worker said, “We go in at five o’clock [in the morning]; at seven we come out to breakfast; at h ­ alf-​ ­past seven we return to our work, and stay until half past twelve. At one . . . ​we return to our work, and stay until seven at night.”

 In 1834, the unexpected happened when about a sixth of the ­native-​­born Lowell women mill workers went on strike to protest the deteriorating working and living conditions. The angry mill owners labeled the 1,500 striking women “ungrateful” and “unfeminine”—and tried to get rid of the strike’s leaders. One mill manager reported that “we have paid off several of these Amazons & presume that they will leave town on Monday.” Two years later, the Lowell workers again walked out, this time in protest of the owners raising the rents in the ­company-​­owned boarding houses. This time the owners backed down. Over time, however, the owners began hiring Irish immigrants who were so desperate for jobs that they rarely complained about the working conditions. By 1850, some 40 percent of the mill workers were Irish. The economic success of the New England textile mills raises an obvious question: why didn’t the South build its own mills close to the cotton fields to keep its profits in the region?

 industrialization, cities, and the environment

 The rapid growth of commerce and industry drove the expansion of cities and mill villages. Lowell’s population in 1820 was 200. By 1830, it was 6,500, and ten years later it had soared to 21,000. Other factory centers sprouted up across New England, displacing forests, farms, and villages while filling the air with smoke, noise, and stench. In addition, the profusion of d ­ ams—​­built to harness water to turn the mill ­wheels—​­flooded pastures and decimated fish populations, spawned rapid urban growth that polluted the rivers and aroused intense local resentment.

 376  CHAPTER 8  The Emergence of a Market Economy 1815–1850

 Broadway and Canal Street, New York City (1836) New York’s economy and industry, like those of many other cities, grew rapidly in the early nineteenth century.

 In 1859, farmers far upstream of the big Massachusetts textile factories tried to destroy a massive dam in Lake Village, New Hampshire, but their axes and crowbars caused little damage. By then, the process of industrialization could not be stopped. The textile mill system was not only transforming lives and ­property—​­it was reshaping nature as well. Between 1820 and 1840, the number of Americans engaged in manufacturing increased 800 percent, and the number of city dwellers more than doubled. As Thomas Jefferson and other agrarians feared, the United States was rapidly becoming a global industrial power producing its own clothing and shoes, iron and engines. Between 1790 and 1860, the proportion of urban to rural populations grew from 3 percent to 16 percent. Because of their strategic locations along rivers flowing into the ocean, the Atlantic seaports of New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston remained the largest cities. New Orleans became the nation’s fi ­ fth-​­largest city because of its role in shipping goods that were floated down the Mississippi River for shipment to the East Coast and to Europe. New York eventually outpaced all its competitors in growth. By 1860, it was the first city to surpass a population of 1 million, largely because of its superior harbor and its unique access to commerce along the Erie Canal and the Atlantic Ocean.

Popular Culture  377


Popular Culture
 During the colonial era, ­working-​­class Americans had little time for play or amusement. Most adults worked from dawn to dusk six days a week. In rural areas, free time was often spent in communal activities, such as barn raisings and c­orn-​ ­husking parties, shooting matches and footraces, while residents of the seacoast sailed and fished. In colonial cities, people attended dances, went on sleigh rides and picnics, and played “parlor games” at home such as billiards, cards, and chess. By the early nineteenth century, however, a more urban society enjoyed more diverse forms of recreation. As people moved to cities, they developed a distinctive urban culture, and laborers and shopkeepers sought new forms of leisure and entertainment as pleasant diversions from their long workdays.

 urban recreation Social drinking was pervasive during the first half of the nineteenth century. In 1829, the secretary of war estimated that three quarters of the nation’s laborers drank at least four ounces of “hard liquor” daily. Taverns and social or sporting clubs in the burgeoning cities served as the center of recreation and leisure. ­So-​­called blood sports were also a popular form of amusement, especially among the working poor. For a time, cockfighting and dogfighting at saloons attracted excited crowds and frenzied betting, but prizefighting ­(boxing), ­eventually displaced the animal contests. Imported from Britain,

 Bare Knuckles Blood sports emerged as popular urban entertainment for men of all social classes, but especially among the working poor.

 378  CHAPTER 8  The Emergence of a Market Economy 1815–1850

 boxing proved popular with all social classes. The early contestants tended to be Irish or English immigrants, often sponsored by a neighborhood fire company, fraternal association, or street gang. In the antebellum era, boxers fought with bare knuckles, and the results were brutal. A match ended only when a ­contestant could not continue. A bout in 1842 lasted 119 rounds and ended when a fighter died in his corner. Such deaths prompted several cities to outlaw the practice, only to see it reappear as an underground activity.

 the performing arts

 Theaters became the most popular form of indoor entertainment. People from all walks of life flocked to opera houses, playhouses, and music halls to watch a wide spectrum of performances: Shakespeare’s tragedies, “blood and thunder” melodramas, comedies, minstrel shows, operas, performances by acrobatic troupes, and local pageants. Audiences were predominantly men. “Respectable” women rarely attended; the prevailing “cult of domesticity” kept women in the home. Raucous audiences cheered the heroes and heroines and hissed at the villains. If an actor did not meet expectations, spectators hurled curses, nuts, eggs, fruit, shoes, or chairs. The 1830s witnessed the emergence of the first uniquely American form of mass entertainment: blackface minstrel shows, featuring white performers made up as blacks. “Minstrelsy” drew upon African American folklore and reinforced prevailing racial stereotypes. It featured banjo and fiddle music, “shuffle” dances, and lowbrow humor. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, minstrel shows were immensely popular, especially among northern ­working-​­class ethnic groups and southern whites. The most popular minstrel songs were written by a young white composer named Stephen Foster. In 1846, he composed “Oh! Susanna,” which

 i­ mmediately became a national favorite. Its popularity catapulted Foster into the national limelight, and he responded with equally ­well-​­received tunes such as “Old Folks at Home” (popularly known as “Way Down upon the Swanee River”), “Massa’s in de Cold, Cold Ground,” “My Old Kentucky Home,” and “Old Black Joe,” all of which perpetuated the sentimental myth of contented slaves.

Immigration
 More than ever before, the United States during the nineteenth century continued to be a nation of immigrants. Warfare in Europe at the start of the century restricted travel to America. After 1815, however, when Napoléon was finally defeated and forced into exile, new U.S. territories and states in the West actively recruited immigrants from Europe, often offering special incentives such as voting rights after only ­six-​­months’ residency. Why did people risk their lives and abandon their homelands to come to the United States? America offered jobs, higher wages, lower taxes, cheap and fertile land, no entrenched aristocracy, religious freedom, and voting rights. After 1837, a worldwide financial panic and economic slump accelerated the pace of immigration to the United States. American employers aggressively recruited foreigners, in large part because they were often willing to work for lower wages than ­native-​­born Americans. The Chicago Daily Tribute observed that the tide of German immigrants was perfect for the “cheap and ingenious labor of the country.” A German laborer was willing “to live as cheaply and work infinitely more intelligently than the negro.” The years from 1845 to 1854 marked the greatest proportional influx of immigrants in U.S. history, 2.4 million, or about 14.5 percent of the total population in 1845. By far, the largest number of immigrants between 1840 and 1860 came from Ireland and Germany.

 the irish

 No nation proportionately sent more of its people to America than Ireland. A prolonged agricultural crisis that brought immense social hardships caused many Irish to flee their homeland in the ­mid-​­nineteenth century. Irish farmers primarily grew potatoes; in fact, fully a third of them were dependent on the potato harvest for survival. The average adult male in Ireland ate five pounds of potatoes a day. In 1845, a fungus destroyed the potato crop and triggered what came to be called the Irish Potato Famine. More than a million people died, and almost 2 million more left Ireland, a country whose total population was only 8 million. Most traveled to Canada and the United States. As one group of exiles explained, “All we want to do is get out of Ireland; we must be better anywhere but here.” America, they knew, had plenty of paying jobs and “plenty to eat.”

 By the 1850s, the Irish made up more than half the population of Boston and New York City and were almost as dominant in Philadelphia. Most of them were crowded into filthy, poorly ventilated tenement houses in which “the ­low-​­paid and p ­ overty-​­smitten . . . ​crowd by the dozens.” Irish neighborhoods were plagued by high crime rates, deadly diseases, prostitution, and alcoholism. The archbishop of New York described the Irish as “the poorest and most wretched population that can be found in the world.” It was the Irish who often took on the nation’s hardest and most dangerous jobs. A visiting Irish journalist, commenting on the industrial transformation in America, wrote that there were “several sorts of power working at the fabric of the Republic: ­water-​­power, ­steam-​­power, ­horse-​­power, and Irish power. The last works hardest of them all.” It was mostly Irish men who built the canals and railroads, and mostly Irish women who worked in the textile mills of New England and cleaned the houses of thousands of ­upper-​­middle-​­class ­Americans. One Irishman groaned that he worked like “a slave for the Americans.”

 Irish immigrants were stereotyped as filthy, b ­ ad-​­tempered, and heavy drinkers. They also encountered intense ­anti-​­Catholic prejudice among n ­ ative-​­born Protestants. Many employers posted taunting signs reading “No Irish Need Apply.” Irish Americans, however, could be equally ­mean-​­spirited toward other groups, such as free African Americans, who competed with them for ­low-​ ­wage, mostly unskilled jobs. In 1850, the New York Tribune expressed concern that the Irish, having escaped from “a galling, degrading bondage” in their homeland, opposed equal rights for blacks and frequently arrived at the polls shouting, “Down with the Nagurs! Let them go back to Africa, where they belong.” Irish freedom fighter Daniel O’Connell scolded the immigrants for their racism: “It was not in Ireland you learned this cruelty.” Many African Americans viewed the Irish with equal contempt. In 1850, a slave expressed a common sentiment when he noted that his “master” was “a great tyrant, he treats me badly as if I were a common Irishman.” Irish immigrants often took jobs as waiters, dockworkers, and deliverymen that had long

 382  CHAPTER 8  The Emergence of a Market Economy 1815–1850

 been held by African Americans. A free black frustrated by the Irish insurgents voiced a criticism of immigrants that is still being made in the ­twenty-​­first century. The Irish, he said, were “crowding themselves into every place of business and labor, and driving the poor colored American citizen out.” Enterprising Irish immigrants did forge remarkable careers in America, however. Twenty years after arriving in New York, Alexander T. Stewart became the owner of the nation’s largest department store and vast real estate holdings. Michael Cudahy, who began working at age fourteen in a MilIrish immigration In 1847, nearly 214,000 waukee meatpacking business, became Irish immigrated to the United States head of the Cudahy Packing Company and Canada aboard the ships of the and developed a process for the curing White Star Line and other companies.

By the start of the Civil War, the Irish in America had energized trade unions, become the most important ethnic group supporting the Democratic party, and made the Roman Catholic Church the nation’s largest religious denomination. Years of persecution had instilled in Irish Catholics a fierce loyalty to the church as “the supreme authority over all the affairs of the world.” Such passion for Catholicism generated unity among Irish Americans and fear among American Protestants. The Irish loved to stick together. Most of them settled in Irish neighborhoods in the nation’s largest cities and formed powerful local Democratic political organizations, such as Tammany Hall in New York City, that would dominate political life during the second half of the nineteenth century.

 the germans

 German immigrants were almost as numerous as the Irish. Unlike the Irish newcomers, however, the German arrivals included a large number of skilled craftsmen and w ­ ell-​­educated professional p ­ eople—​ ­doctors, lawyers, teachers, ­engineers—​­some of whom were refugees from the failed German revolution of 1848.

Immigration  383


 German Beer Garden, New York (1825) German immigrants established their own communities, where they maintained the traditions of their homeland.

 In addition to an array of political opinions, the Germans brought with them a variety of religious preferences. Most were Protestants (usually Lutherans), a third were Roman Catholics, and a significant number were Jews. Among the German immigrants who prospered in the New World were Heinrich Steinweg, a piano maker who in America changed his name to Steinway and became famous for the quality of his instruments, and Levi Strauss, a Jewish tailor who followed the gold rush to California and began making work pants, later dubbed “Levi’s.” Germans settled more often in rural areas than in cities. Many were independent farmers, skilled workers, and shopkeepers who were able to establish themselves immediately. More so than the Irish, they migrated in families and groups. This clannish quality helped them better sustain elements of their language and culture in the United States. More of them also tended to return to their native country. About 14 percent of the Germans eventually went back to their homeland, compared with just 9 percent of the Irish.

 the british, scandinavians, and chinese

 Immigrants from Great Britain and Canada continued to arrive in large numbers during the first half of the nineteenth century. They included professionals, independent farmers, and skilled workers. Two other large groups of immigrants were from Scandinavia and China. Norwegians and Swedes, mostly farmworkers, gravitated to Illinois, Wisconsin, and the Minnesota Territory, where the cold climate and dense forests reminded them of home. By the 1850s, the rapid development of California was attracting a growing number of Chinese,

 who, like the Irish in the East, did the heavy work of construction, especially on railroad tracks and bridges.

 nativism Not all Americans welcomed the flood of immigrants. A growing number of “nativists,” people born in the United States who resented the newcomers, sought to restrict or stop immigration altogether. The flood of Irish and German Catholics especially aroused hostility among Protestants. A Boston minister described Catholicism as “the ally of tyranny, the opponent of material prosperity, the foe of thrift, the enemy of the railroad, the caucus, and the school.” Nativists eventually launched organized political efforts to stop the tide of immigrants. The Order of the ­Star-​­Spangled Banner, founded in New York City in 1849, grew into a powerful political group known as the American party. Members pledged never to vote for any f­oreign-​­born or Catholic candidates. When asked about the secretive organization, they were told to say, “I know nothing,” a phrase which gave rise to the informal name for the party: the ­Know-​­Nothings. For a while, the K ­ now-​­Nothings appeared to be on the brink of m ­ ajor-​ ­party status, especially during the 1850s, when the number of immigrants was five times as large as it had been during the 1840s. In the state and local cam-

 paigns of 1854, they swept the Massachusetts legislature, winning all but two seats in the lower house, and that fall they elected more than forty congressmen. Forty percent of the Pennsylvania state legislators were K ­ now-​­Nothings. The ­Know-​­Nothings demanded that immigrants and Roman Catholics be excluded from public office and that the waiting period for naturalization (earning citizenship) be extended from five to ­twenty-​­one years. The party, however, was never strong enough to enact such legislation. Nor did Congress restrict immigration during that period. For a while, the K ­ now-​­Nothings threatened to control New England, New York, and Maryland, but the ­anti-​ ­Catholic movement subsided when slavery became the focal issue of the 1850s.

Organized Labor and New Professions
 While most Americans continued to work as farmers during the nineteenth century, a growing number found employment in new or expanding enterprises: textile mills, shoe factories, banks, railroads, publishing, retail stores, teaching, preaching, medicine, law, construction, and engineering. Technological innovations (steam power, power tools, and new modes of transportation) and their social applications (mass communication, turnpikes, the postal service, banks, and corporations) fostered an array of new industries and businesses that transformed the nature of work for many Americans, both men and women.

 early unions In 1800, only 12 percent of Americans worked for wages; by 1860, wage earners had grown to 40 percent of the nation’s workforce. Proud apprentices, journeymen, and master craftsmen, who controlled their labor and invested their work with an emphasis on quality rather than quantity, resented the spread of mills and factories populated by “­half-​­trained” workers dependent upon an hourly wage and subject to the sharp fluctuations of the larger economy. The rapid growth of wage workers often came at the expense of skilled s­ elf-​ ­employed artisans and craftsmen who owned their own small shops where they made or repaired carriages, shoes, hats, saddles, silverware, jewelry, glass, ropes, furniture, boats, and a broad array of other products. Other skilled craftsmen were blacksmiths, printers, or barrel makers. Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, the number of s­ elf-​­employed master craftsmen steadily declined as the number of factories and mills increased. Artisans who emphasized quality and craftsmanship in their c­ ustom-​­made products found it increasingly hard to compete with the low prices for similar products made in much larger numbers in the factories and ­mass-​­production workshops.

 The production of shoes, for example, was transformed by the shift to mass production. Until the nineteenth century, boots and shoes were made by hand by shoemakers for local customers. Working in their own home or small shop, shoemakers might also employ one or two journeymen (assistants) as well as an apprentice, a young man learning the skilled trade. That changed during the early nineteenth century, as the number and size of shoe shops increased in New England, largely driven by the demand for inexpensive shoes, many of which were shipped south for the rapidly growing slave population. Shoe shops were displaced by shoe factories, and the master shoemaker became a manager rather than an artisan. Instead of creating a shoe from start to finish, workers were given specific tasks such as cutting the leather or stitching the “uppers” onto the soles. The skilled workers forced to make the transition to mass production and a strict division of labor often resented the change. A Massachusetts shoe worker complained that the factory owners were “little stuck up, s­ elf-​­conceited individuals” who forced workers to follow their orders or be fired. In 1850, the Board of Health in Lynn, Massachusetts, reported that the life expectancy of a shoe worker was almost twenty years shorter than a farmer.

 The shoe factory When Philadelphia shoemakers went on strike in 1806, a court found them guilty of a “conspiracy to raise wages.” Here, shoemakers work at a Massachusetts shoe factory.

 The growing fear among artisans that they were losing status led many of them to become involved in politics and unions. Philadelphia furniture craftsmen, for example, called for a “union” to protect “their mutual independence.” At first, these workers organized into interest groups representing their individual skills or trades. During the early nineteenth century, a growing fear that they were losing status led artisans in the major cities to become involved in politics and unions. Philadelphia furniture craftsmen, for example, called for their peers to form a “union” to protect “their mutual independence.” At first, these workers organized themselves into interest groups representing their individual skills or trades. Such “trade associations” were the first type of labor unions. They pressured politicians for tariffs to protect their industries from foreign imports, provided insurance benefits, and drafted regulations to improve working conditions. In addition, they sought to control the number of tradesmen in their profession so as to maintain wage levels. Early labor unions faced major legal ­obstacles—​­in fact, they were prosecuted as unlawful conspiracies. In 1806, for instance, Philadelphia shoemakers were found guilty of conspiring “to raise their wages.” The court’s decision broke the union. In 1842, though, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court issued a landmark ruling in Commonwealth v. Hunt declaring that forming a trade union was not in itself illegal, nor was a demand that employers hire only members of the union. The court also said that union workers could strike if an employer hired laborers who refused to join the union. Until the 1820s, labor organizations took the form of local trade unions, each confined to one city and one craft or skill. From 1827 to 1837, however, organization on a larger scale began to take hold. In 1834, the National Trades’ Union was formed to organize local trade unions into a stronger national association. At the same time, shoemakers, printers, carpenters, and weavers established national craft unions representing their particular skills. Women also formed trade unions. Sarah Monroe, who helped organize the New York Tailoresses’ Society, explained that it was intended to defend “our rights.” If it was “unfashionable for men to bear [workplace] oppression in silence, why should it not also become unfashionable with the women?” In 1831, the women tailors went out on Symbols of organized labor strike demanding a “just price for labor.” A pocket watch with an International Skilled workers also formed political organi- Typographical Union insignia. zations to represent their interests.

 newspaper reported that people across the nation were organizing Workingmen’s political parties to protect “those principles of liberty and equality unfolded in the Declaration of our Independence.” Workingmen’s parties called for laws to regulate banks and abolish the common practice of imprisoning people who could not pay their debts.

The Rise of the Professions
 The dramatic social changes opened up an array of new professions. Bustling new towns required new ­services—​­retail stores, printing shops, post offices, newspapers, schools, banks, law firms, medical practices. By definition, professional workers have specialized knowledge and training. In 1849, Henry Day delivered a lecture titled “The Professions” at the Western Reserve School of Medicine. He declared that the most important social functions in modern life were the professional skills and claimed that society had become utterly dependent upon “professional services.”

 teaching

 Teaching was one of the f­astest-​­growing professions in the first half of the nineteenth century. Horace Mann of Massachusetts was instrumental in promoting the idea of free public education as the best way to transform children into disciplined, judicious citizens. Many states, especially in the North, agreed, and the number of schools exploded. New schools required teachers, and Mann helped create “normal schools” around the nation to train future teachers. Public schools initially preferred men as teachers, usually hiring them at age seventeen or eighteen. The pay was so low that few stayed in the profession their entire career, but for many educated, restless young adults, teaching offered independence and social status, as well as an alternative to the rural isolation of farming. Church groups and civic leaders started private academies, or seminaries, for girls.

 law, medicine, and engineering

 Teaching was a common s­ tepping-​­stone for men who became lawyers. In the decades after the American Revolution, young men would teach for a year or two before joining an experienced attorney as an apprentice (what today would be called an intern). They would learn the practice of law in exchange for their labors. (There were no law schools yet.) Like attorneys, physicians in the early nineteenth century often had little formal academic training. Healers of every stripe assumed the title of doctor and established medical practices. Most were ­self-​­taught or had learned their profession by assisting a physician for several years, occasionally supplementing their internships with a few classes at the handful of medical schools. By

 1860, there were 60,000 ­self-​­styled physicians, many of whom were “quacks” or frauds. As a result, the medical profession lost the public’s confidence until the emergence of formal medical schools. The industrial expansion of the United States also spurred the profession of engineering, a field that would eventually become the nation’s largest professional occupation for men. Specialized expertise was required for the building of canals and railroads, the development of machine tools and steam engines, and the construction of roads, bridges, and factories.

 “women’s work”

 Meanwhile, most women still worked primarily in the home or on a farm. The only professions readily available to them were nursing (often midwifery, the delivery of babies) and teaching. Many ­middle-​ ­class women spent their time outside the home doing religious and s­ocial-​ ­service work. Then as now, women were the backbone of most churches. A few women, however, courageously pursued careers in m ­ ale-​­dominated professions. Elizabeth Blackwell of Ohio managed to gain admission to Geneva Medical College (now Hobart and William Smith College) in western New York despite the disapproval of the faculty. When she arrived at her first class, a hush fell upon the students “as if each member had been struck with paralysis.” Blackwell had the last laugh when she finished first in her class in 1849, but thereafter the medical school refused to admit more women. The first American woman to earn a medical degree, Blackwell went on to start the New York Infirmary for Women and Children and later had a long career as a professor of gynecology at the London School of Medicine for Women.

Equal Opportunities
 The dynamic ­market-​­based economy that emerged during the first half of the nineteenth century helped spread the idea that individuals should have an equal opportunity to better themselves through their abilities and hard work. Equality of opportunity, however, did not assume equal outcomes. Americans wanted an equal chance to earn unequal amounts of wealth. In America, observed a journalist in 1844, “one has as good a chance as another according to his talents, prudence, and personal exertions.” The same ideals that prompted so many white immigrants to come to the United States, however, were equally appealing to African Americans and women. By the 1830s, they, too, began to demand their right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Such desires among “common people” would quickly spill over into the political arena. The great theme of American political life in the first half of the nineteenth century would be the continuing democratization of opportunities for white men, regardless of income or background, to vote and hold office.

CHAPTER REVIEW
Summary • 
 Transportation and Communication Revolutions Canals and other improvements in transportation, such as the steamboat, allowed goods to reach markets more quickly and cheaply and transformed the more isolated “household economy” of the eighteenth century into a ­market-​­based economy in which people bought and sold goods for profit in sometimes distant markets. Clipper ships shortened the amount of time to transport goods across the oceans. The railroads (which expanded rapidly during the 1850s) and the telegraph system diminished the isolation of the West and united the country economically and socially. The Erie Canal contributed to New York City’s emerging status as the nation’s economic center even as it promoted the growth of Chicago and other midwestern cities. Improvements in transportation and communication linked rural communities to a worldwide marketplace.

 Industrialization Inventions in machine tools and technology as well as innovations in business organization spurred a wave of industrialization during the nineteenth century. The cotton gin dramatically increased cotton production and a rapidly spreading cotton culture boomed in the South, with a resultant increase in slavery. Other inventions, such as John Deere’s steel plow and the mechanized McCormick reaper, helped Americans, especially westerners, farm more efficiently and more profitably. In the North, mills and factories, powered first by water and eventually by ­coal-​­fired steam engines, spread rapidly. Mills initially produced textiles for clothing and bedding from southern cotton, as well as iron, shoes, and other products. The federal government’s tariff policy encouraged the growth of domestic manufacturing, especially cotton textiles, by reducing imports of British cloth. Between 1820 and 1840, the number of Americans engaged in manufacturing increased 800 percent. Many mill workers, such as the women employed in the Lowell system of New England textile factory communities, worked long hours for low wages in unhealthy conditions. Industrialization, along with increased commerce, helped spur the growth of cities. By 1860, 16 percent of the population lived in an urban area.

•


 Immigration The promise of cheap land and good wages drew millions of immigrants to America. By 1844, about 14.5 percent of the population was foreign born. The devastating potato famine led to an influx of destitute Irish Catholic families. By the 1850s, they represented a significant portion of the urban population in the United States, constituting a majority in New York and Boston; German migrants, many of them Catholics and Jews, migrated during this same time. Not all n ­ ative-​­born Americans welcomed the immigrants. Nativists became a powerful political force in the 1850s, with the ­Know-​­Nothing party nearly achieving ­major-​­party status with its message of excluding immigrants and Catholics from the nation’s political community.

•


 Workers, Professionals, and Women Skilled workers (artisans) formed trade associations to protect their members and to lobby for their interests. As



 i­ ndustrialization spread, some workers expanded these organizations nationally, forming the National Trades’ Union. The growth of the market economy also expanded opportunities for those with formal education to serve in new or expanding professions. The number of physicians, teachers, engineers, and lawyers grew rapidly. By the ­mid-​­nineteenth century, women, African Americans, and immigrants began to agitate for equal social, economic, and political opportunities.

Nationalism and
Sectionalism
1815–1828


 Parade of the Victuallers (1821) On a beautiful day in March 1821, Philadelphia butcher William White organized a parade celebrating America’s own ­high-​­quality meats. Many townspeople watched from their windows and balconies, while the spectators below could also enjoy the foods of various street vendors, such as the African American oyster peddler (bottom left). This watercolor by John Lewis Krimmel captures the vibrant nationalism that emerged in America after the War of 1812.

A


 fter the War of 1812, the British stopped interfering with American shipping. The United States could now develop new industries and exploit new markets around the globe. It was not simply Alexander Hamilton’s financial initiatives and the capitalistic energies of wealthy investors and entrepreneurs that sparked America’s dramatic economic growth in the early nineteenth century. Prosperity also resulted from the efforts of ordinary men and women who were willing to take risks, uproot families, use unstable paper money issued by unregulated local banks, and tinker with new machines, tools, and inventions. By 1828, the young agrarian republic was poised to become a sprawling commercial nation connected by networks of roads and canals as well as regional economic ­relationships—​­all enlivened by a restless spirit of enterprise, experimentation, and expansion. For all of the energy and optimism exhibited by Americans after the war, however, the fundamental tension between nationalism and sectionalism remained: how to balance the national interest with the particular economic and social needs of the nation’s three growing ­regions—​­North, South, and West? Americans who identified themselves as nationalists promoted the interests of the country as a whole. This required each region to recognize that no single section could get all it wanted without threatening the survival of the nation. Many sectionalists, however, were ­single-​­mindedly focused on promoting their region’s priorities: shipping, manufacturing, and commerce in the Northeast; s­lave-​­based agriculture in the South; low land prices and
