 ministers and mistresses. Fatefully for North America, Louis XIV also took a deep interest in overseas colonies. After rocky beginnings, success ﬁ nally rewarded the exertions of France in the New World. In 1608, the year after the founding of Jamestown, the permanent beginnings of a vast empire (see Map 6.1) were established at Québec, a granite sentinel commanding the St. Lawrence River. The leading ﬁgure was Samuel de Champlain, an intrepid soldier and explorer whose energy and leadership fairly earned him the title “Father of New France.” Champlain entered into friendly relations—a fateful friendship—with the nearby Huron Indian tribes. At their request, he joined them in battle against their foes, the federated Iroquois tribes of the upper New York area. Two volleys from the “lightning sticks” of the whites routed the terriﬁed Iroquois, who left behind three dead and one wounded. France, to its sorrow,

 thus earned the lasting enmity of the Iroquois tribes. They thereafter hampered French penetration of the Ohio Valley, sometimes ravaging French settlements and frequently serving as allies of the British in the prolonged struggle for supremacy on the continent. The government of New France (Canada) ﬁnally fell under the direct control of the king after various commercial companies had faltered or failed. This royal regime was almost completely autocratic. The people elected no representative assemblies, nor did they enjoy the right to trial by jury, as in the Eng lish colonies. The population of Catholic New France grew at a listless pace. As late as 1750, only sixty thousand or so whites inhabited New France. Landowning French peasants, unlike the dispossessed Eng lish tenant farmers who embarked for the British colonies, had little economic motive to move. Protestant Huguenots, who might have had a religious motive to migrate, were denied a refuge in this raw colony. The French government, in any case, favored its Caribbean island colonies, rich in sugar and rum, over the snow-cloaked wilderness of Canada.

 Map 6.2 Fur-Trading Posts To serve the needs of European fashion, fur-traders pursued the beaver for more than two centuries over the entire continent of North America. They brought many Indians for the ﬁrst time into contact with white culture.

New France Fans Out
 New France did contain one valuable resource: the beaver. European fashion-setters valued beaver-pelt hats for their warmth and opulent appearance. To adorn the heads of Europeans, French fur-trappers ranged over the woods and waterways of North America in pursuit of beaver. These colorful coureurs de bois(“runners of the woods”) were also runners of risks—two-ﬁsted drinkers, free spenders, free livers and lovers. They littered the land with scores of place names, including Baton Rouge (red stick), Terre Haute (high land), Des Moines (some monks), and Grand Teton (big breast). Singing, paddle-swinging French voyageurs also recruited Indians into the fur business. The Indian fur

 ﬂotilla arriving in Montréal in 1693 numbered four hundred canoes. But the fur trade had some disastrous drawbacks. Indians recruited into the fur business were decimated by the white man’s diseases and debauched by his alcohol. Slaughtering beaver by the boatload also violated many Indians’ religious beliefs and sadly demonstrated the shattering effect that contact with Europeans wreaked on traditional Indian ways of life. Pursuing the sharp-toothed beaver ever deeper into the heart of the continent, the French trappers and their Indian partners hiked, rode, snowshoed, sailed, and paddled across amazing distances. They trekked in a huge arc across the Great Lakes, into present-day Saskatchewan and Manitoba; along the valleys of the Platte, the Arkansas, and the Missouri; west to the Rockies; and south to the border of Spanish Texas (see Map 6.2).



Chapter 6 The Duel for North America, 1608–1763


 In the process they all but extinguished the beaver population in many areas, inﬂ icting incalculable ecological damage. French Catholic missionaries, notably the Jesuits, labored zealously to save the Indians for Christ and from the fur-trappers. Some of the Jesuit missionaries, their efforts scorned, suffered unspeakable tortures at the hands of the Indians. But though they made few permanent converts, the Jesuits played a vital role as explorers and geographers. Other explorers sought neither souls nor fur, but empire. To thwart Eng lish settlers pushing into the Ohio Valley, Antoine Cadillac founded Detroit, “the City of Straits,” in 1701. To check Spanish penetration into the region of the Gulf of Mexico, ambitious Robert de La Salle ﬂoated down the Mississippi in 1682 to the point where it mingles with the Gulf. He named the great interior basin “Louisiana,” in honor of his sovereign, Louis XIV. Dreaming of empire, he returned to the Gulf three years later with a colonizing expedition of four ships. But he failed to ﬁ nd the Mississippi delta, landed in Spanish Texas, and in 1687 was murdered by his mutinous men.

 Undismayed, French ofﬁcials persisted in their efforts to block Spain on the Gulf of Mexico. They planted several fortiﬁed posts in what is now Mississippi and Louisiana, the most important of which was New Orleans (1718). Commanding the mouth of the Mississippi River, this strategic semitropical outpost also tapped the fur trade of the huge interior valley. The fertile Illinois country—where the French established forts and trading posts at Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes—became the garden of France’s North American empire. Surprising amounts of grain were ﬂoated down the Mississippi for transshipment to the West Indies and to Europe.

The Clash of Empires
 The earliest contests among the European powers for control of North America, known to the British colonists as King William’s War (1689–1697) and Queen Anne’s War (1702–1713) (see Table 6.1), mostly pitted British colonists against the French coureurs de bois, with both sides recruiting whatever Indian allies they

 could. Neither France nor Britain at this stage considered America worth the commitment of large detachments of regular troops, so the combatants waged a kind of primitive guerrilla warfare. Indian allies of the French ravaged with torch and tomahawk the British colonial frontiers, visiting especially bloody violence on the villages of Schenectady, New York, and Deerﬁeld, Massachusetts (see Map 6.3). Spain, eventually allied with France, probed from its Florida base at outlying South Carolina settlements. For their part the British colonists failed miserably in sallies against Québec and Montréal but scored a signal victory when they temporarily seized the stronghold of Port Royal in Acadia (present-day Nova Scotia). Peace terms, signed at Utrecht in 1713, revealed how badly France and its Spanish ally had been beaten (see Map 6.4). Britain was rewarded with French-populated

At Deerﬁeld, site of one of the New England frontier’s bloodiest confrontations, invaders killed ﬁfty inhabitants and sent more than a hundred others ﬂeeing for their lives into the winter wilderness. The Indian attackers also took over one hundred Deerﬁeld residents captive, including the child Titus King. He later wrote, “Captivity is an awful school for children, when we see how quick they will fall in with the Indian ways. Nothing seems to be more taking [appealing]. In six months’ time they forsake father and mother, forget their own land, refuse to speak their own tongue, and seemingly be wholly swallowed up with the Indians.” Interactive Map

 Acadia (which the British renamed Nova Scotia, or New Scotland) and the wintry wastes of Newfoundland and Hudson Bay. These immense tracts pinched the St. Lawrence settlements of France, foreshadowing their ultimate doom. A generation of peace ensued, during which Britain provided its American colonies with decades of “salutary neglect”—fertile soil for the roots of independence. By the treaty of 1713, the British also won limited trading rights in Spanish America, but these later involved much friction over smuggling. Ill feeling ﬂared up when the British captain Robert Jenkins, encountering Spanish revenue authorities, had one ear sliced off by a sword. The Spanish commander reportedly sneered, “Carry this home to the King, your master, whom, if he were present, I would serve in like fashion.” The victim, with a tale of woe on his tongue and a shriveled ear in his hand, aroused furious resentment when he returned home to Britain. The War of Jenkins’s Ear, curiously but aptly named, broke out in 1739 between the British and the Spaniards. It was conﬁ ned to the Caribbean Sea and to the much-buffeted buffer colony of Georgia, where philanthropist-soldier James Oglethorpe fought his Spanish foe to a standstill. This small-scale scufﬂe with Spain in America soon merged with the large-scale War of Austrian Succession in Europe (see Table 6.2), and came to be called King George’s War in America. Once again, France allied itself with Spain. And once again, a rustic force of New Eng landers invaded New France. With help from a British ﬂeet and with a great deal of good luck, the raw and sometimes drunken recruits captured the reputedly impregnable French fortress of Louisbourg, which was on Cape Breton Island and commanded the approaches to the St. Lawrence River (see Map 6.3 on p. 113). When the peace treaty of 1748 handed Louisbourg back to their French foe, the victorious New Eng landers

 were outraged. The glory of their arms—never terribly lustrous in any event—seemed tarnished by the wiles of Old World diplomats. Worse, Louisbourg was still a cocked pistol pointed at the heart of the American continent. France, powerful and unappeased, still clung to its vast holdings in North America.

The French-Indian Showdown

George Washington
Inaugurates War
 with France As the dogﬁght intensiﬁed in the New World, the Ohio Valley became the chief bone of contention between the French and British. The Ohio Country was the critical area into which the westward-pushing British colonists would inevitably penetrate. For France it was also the key to the continent that the French had to retain, particularly if they were going to link their Canadian holdings with those of the lower Mississippi Valley. By the mid-1700s, the British colonists, painfully aware of these basic truths, were no longer so reluctant to bear the burdens of empire. Alarmed by French landgrabbing and cutthroat fur-trade competition in the Ohio Valley, they were determined to ﬁght for their economic security and for the supremacy of their way of life in North America. Rivalry for the lush lands of the upper Ohio Valley brought tensions to the snapping point. In 1749 a group

 of British colonial speculators, chieﬂy inﬂuential Virginians, including the Washington family, had secured shaky legal “rights” to some 500,000 acres in this region. In the same disputed wilderness, the French were in the process of erecting a chain of forts commanding the strategic Ohio River. Especially formidable was Fort Duquesne at the pivotal point where the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers join to form the Ohio—the later site of Pittsburgh. In 1754 the governor of Virginia ushered George Washington, a twenty-one-year-old surveyor and fellow Virginian, onto the stage of history. To secure the Virginians’ claims, Washington was sent to the Ohio Country as a lieutenant colonel in command of about 150 Virginia militiamen. Encountering a small detachment of French troops in the forest about forty miles from Fort Duquesne (see Map 6.5), the Virginians ﬁred the ﬁ rst shots of the globe-girdling new war. The French leader was killed, and his men retreated. An exultant Washington wrote, “I heard the bullets whistle, and believe me, there is something charming in the sound.” It soon lost its charm.



Chapter 6 The Duel for North America, 1608–1763


 The French promptly returned with reinforcements, who surrounded Washington in his hastily constructed breastworks, Fort Necessity. After a ten-hour siege, he was forced to surrender his entire command in July 1754—ironically the fourth of July. But he was permitted to march his men away with the full honors of war. With the shooting already started and in danger of spreading, the British authorities in Nova Scotia took vigorous action. Understandably fearing a stab in the back from the French Acadians, whom Britain had conquered in 1713, the British brutally uprooted some four thousand of them in 1755. These unhappy French deportees were scattered as far south as Louisiana, where the descendants of the French-speaking Aca-

 dians are now called “Cajuns” and number nearly a million.

Global War and
Colonial Disunity
 The ﬁ rst three Anglo-French colonial wars had all started in Europe, but the tables were now reversed. The fourth struggle, sometimes known as the French and Indian War, began in America. Touched off by George Washington in the wilds of the Ohio Valley in 1754, it rocked along on an undeclared basis for two years and then widened into the most far-ﬂung conﬂ ict the world had yet seen—the Seven Years’ War. It was fought not

The French and Indian War


 only in America but in Europe, in the West Indies, in the Philippines, in Africa, and on the ocean. The Seven Years’ War was a seven-seas war (see Map 6.6). In Europe the principal adversaries were Britain and Prussia on one side, arrayed against France, Spain, Austria, and Russia on the other. The bloodiest theater was in Germany, where Frederick the Great deservedly won the title of “Great” by repelling French, Austrian, and Russian armies, often with the opposing forces outnumbering his own three to one. The London government, unable to send him effective troop reinforcements, liberally subsidized him with gold. Luckily for the British colonists, the French wasted so much strength in this European bloodbath that they were unable to throw an adequate force into the New World. “America was conquered in Germany,” declared Britain’s great statesman William Pitt. In previous colonial clashes, the Americans had revealed an astonishing lack of unity. Colonists who were nearest the shooting had responded much more generously with volunteers and money than those enjoying the safety of remoteness. Even the Indians had laughed at the inability of the colonists to pull together. Now, with musketballs already splitting the air in Ohio, the crisis demanded concerted action. In 1754 the British government summoned an intercolonial congress to Albany, New York, near the Iroquois Indian country. Travel-weary delegates from only seven of the thirteen colonies showed up. The immediate purpose was to keep the scalping knives of the Iroquois tribes loyal to the British in the spreading war. The chiefs were harangued at length and then presented with thirty wagonloads of gifts, including guns. The longer-range purpose at Albany was to achieve greater colonial unity and thus bolster the common defense against France. A month before the congress assembled, ingenious Benjamin Franklin published in his Pennsylvania Gazette the most famous cartoon of the colonial era. Showing the separate colonies as parts of a disjointed snake, it broadcast the slogan “Join, or Die.” Franklin himself, a wise and witty counselor, was the leading spirit of the Albany Congress. His outstanding contribution was a well-devised but premature scheme for colonial home rule. The Albany delegates unanimously adopted the plan, but the individual colonies spurned it, as did the London regime. To the colonists, it did not seem to give enough independence; to the British ofﬁcials, it seemed to give too much. The disappointing result conﬁ rmed one of Franklin’s sage observations: all people agreed on the need for union,

 but their “weak noddles” were “perfectly distracted” when they attempted to agree on details.

 Braddock’s Blundering and Its Aftermath The opening clashes of the French and Indian War went badly for the British colonists. Haughty and bullheaded General Edward Braddock, a sixty-year-old ofﬁcer experienced in European warfare, was sent to Virginia with a strong detachment of British regulars. After foraging scanty supplies from the reluctant colonists, he set out in 1755 with some two thousand men to capture Fort Duquesne. A considerable part of his force consisted of ill-disciplined colonial militiamen (“buckskins”), whose behind-the-tree methods of ﬁghting Indians won “Bulldog” Braddock’s professional contempt. Braddock’s expedition, dragging heavy artillery, moved slowly. Axmen laboriously hacked a path through the dense forest, thus opening a road that was later to be an important artery to the West. A few miles from Fort Duquesne, Braddock encountered a much smaller French and Indian army. At ﬁ rst the enemy force was repulsed, but it quickly melted into the thickets and poured a murderous ﬁ re into the ranks of the redcoats. In the ensuing battle, George Washington, an energetic and fearless aide to Braddock, had two horses shot from under him, and four bullets pierced his coat. Braddock himself was mortally wounded. The entire British force was routed after appalling losses. Inﬂamed by this easy victory, the Indians took to a wider warpath. The whole frontier from Pennsylvania

 to North Carolina, left virtually naked by Braddock’s bloody defeat, felt their fury. Scalping forays occurred within eighty miles of Philadelphia, and in desperation the local authorities offered bounties for Indian scalps: $50 for a woman’s and $130 for a warrior’s. George Washington, with only three hundred men, tried desperately to defend the scorched frontier. The British launched a full-scale invasion of Canada in 1756, now that the undeclared war in America had at last merged into a world conﬂ ict. But they unwisely tried to attack a number of exposed wilderness posts simultaneously, instead of throwing all their strength at Québec and Montréal. If these strongholds had fallen, all the smaller outposts to the west would have withered for lack of riverborne supplies. But the British ignored such sound strategy, and defeat after defeat tarnished their arms, both in America and in Europe.

 Pitt’s Palms of Victory In the hour of crisis, Britain brought forth, as it repeatedly has, a superlative leader—William Pitt. A tall and



 imposing ﬁgure, whose ﬂashing eyes were set in a hawklike face, he was popularly known as the “Great Commoner.” Pitt drew much of his strength from the common people, who admired him so greatly that on occasion they kissed his horses. A splendid orator endowed with a majestic voice, he believed passionately in his cause, in his country, and in himself. In 1757 Pitt became a foremost leader in the London government. Throwing himself headlong into his task, he soon earned the title “Organizer of Victory.” He wisely decided to soft-pedal assaults on the French West Indies, which had been bleeding away much British strength, and to concentrate on the vitals of Canada— the Québec-Montréal area. He also picked young and energetic leaders, thus bypassing incompetent and cautious old generals. Pitt ﬁ rst dispatched a powerful expedition in 1758 against Louisbourg. The frowning fortress, though it had been greatly strengthened, fell after a blistering siege. Wild rejoicing swept Britain, for this was the ﬁ rst signiﬁcant British victory of the entire war. Québec was next on Pitt’s list. For this crucial expedition, he chose the thirty-two-year-old James Wolfe, who had been an ofﬁcer since the age of fourteen.

 View of the Taking of Québec, 1759 On the night of September 13, British forces scaled the rocky cliffs of Québec and defeated the French army defending the city. The following year, Montréal, France’s last bastion in North America, surrendered. Fighting continued in the Caribbean, Europe, and the Philippines for two more years, until the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1763, eliminating France as a colonial power in North America.

Chapter 6 The Duel for North America, 1608–1763


 Though slight and sickly, Wolfe combined a mixture of dash with painstaking attention to detail. The British attackers were making woeful progress when Wolfe, in a daring night move, sent a detachment up a poorly guarded part of the rocky eminence protecting Québec. This vanguard scaled the cliff, pulling itself upward by the bushes and showing the way for the others. In the morning the two armies faced each other on the Plains of Abraham on the outskirts of Québec, the British under Wolfe and the French under the Marquis de Montcalm. Both commanders fell, fatally wounded, but the French were defeated and the city surrendered. The Battle of Québec in 1759 ranks as one of the most signiﬁcant engagements in British and American history. When Montréal fell in 1760, the French ﬂag had ﬂuttered in Canada for the last time. By the peace settlement at Paris (1763), French power was thrown completely off the continent of North America, leaving behind a fertile French population that is to this day a strong minority in Canada. This bitter pill was sweet-

 ened somewhat when the French were allowed to retain several small but valuable sugar islands in the West Indies and two never-to-be-fortiﬁed islets in the Gulf of St. Lawrence for ﬁshing stations. A ﬁ nal blow came when the French, to compensate their luckless Spanish ally for its losses, ceded to Spain all transMississippi Louisiana, plus the outlet of New Orleans. Spain, for its part, turned Florida over to Britain in return for Cuba, where Havana had fallen to British arms (see Map 6.7). Great Britain thus emerged as the dominant power in North America, while taking its place as the leading naval power of the world.

Impact of the Global Struggle


 alongside the crack British regulars; and they had gained valuable experience, ofﬁcers and men alike. In the closing days of the conﬂ ict, some twenty thousand American recruits were under arms. The French and Indian War, while bolstering colonial self-esteem, simultaneously shattered the myth of British invincibility. On Braddock’s bloody ﬁeld, the “buckskin” militia had seen the demoralized regulars huddling helplessly together or ﬂeeing their unseen enemy. Ominously, friction had developed during the war between arrogant British ofﬁcers and the raw colonial “boors.” Displaying the contempt of the professional soldier for amateurs, the British refused to recognize any American militia commission above the rank of captain—a demotion humiliating to “Colonel” George Washington. They also showed the usual condescension of snobs from the civilized Old Country toward the “scum” who had confessed failure by ﬂeeing to the “outhouses of civilization.” General Wolfe referred to the colonial militia, with exaggeration, as “in general the dirtiest, most contemptible, cowardly dogs that you can conceive.” Energetic and hard-working American settlers, in contrast, believed themselves to be the cutting edge of British civilization. They felt that they deserved credit rather than contempt for risking their lives to secure a New World empire. British ofﬁcials were further distressed by the reluctance of the colonists to support the common cause wholeheartedly. American shippers, using fraudulent papers, developed a golden trafﬁc with the enemy ports of the Spanish and French West Indies. This treason-

 The Reverend Andrew Burnaby, an observant Church of England clergyman who visited the colonies in the closing months of the Seven Years’ War, scoffed at any possibility of uniﬁcation (1760):

“


 . . . for ﬁre and water are not more heterogeneous than the different colonies in North America. Nothing can exceed the jealousy and emulation which they possess in regard to each other. . . . In short . . . were they left to themselves there would soon be a civil war from one end of the continent to the other, while the Indians and Negros would . . . impatiently watch the opportunity of exterminating them all together.

”




 able trade in foodstuffs actually kept some of the hostile islands from starving at the very time when the British navy was trying to subdue them. In the ﬁ nal year of the war, the British authorities, forced to resort to drastic mea sures, forbade the export of all supplies from New Eng land and the middle colonies. Other colonists, self-centered and alienated by distance from the war, refused to provide troops and money for the conﬂ ict. They demanded the rights and privileges of Eng lishmen, without the duties and responsibilities of Eng lishmen. Not until Pitt had offered to reimburse the colonies for a substantial part of their expenditures—some £900,000—did they move with some enthusiasm. If the Americans had to be bribed to defend themselves against a relentless and savage foe, would they ever unite to strike the mother country? The curse of intercolonial disunity, present from early days, had continued throughout the recent hostilities. It had been caused mainly by enormous distances; by geographical barriers like rivers; by conﬂ icting religions, from Catholic to Quaker; by varied nationalities, from German to Irish; by differing types of colonial governments; by many boundary disputes; and by the resentment of the crude backcountry settlers against the aristocratic bigwigs. Yet unity received some encouragement during the French and Indian War. When soldiers and statesmen from widely separated colonies met around common campﬁ res and council tables, they were often agreeably surprised by what they found. Despite deep-seated jealousy and suspicion, they discovered that they were all fellow Americans who generally spoke the same language and shared common ideals. Barriers of disunity began to melt, although a long and rugged road lay ahead before a coherent nation would emerge.

 War’s Fateful Aftermath The removal of the French menace in Canada profoundly affected American attitudes. While the French hawk had been hovering in the North and West, the colonial chicks had been forced to cling close to the wings of their British mother hen. Now that the hawk was killed, they could range far aﬁeld with a new spirit of independence. The French, humiliated by the British and saddened by the fate of Canada, consoled themselves with one wishful thought. Perhaps the loss of their American empire would one day result in Britain’s loss of its American empire. In a sense the history of the United

 States began with the fall of Québec and Montréal; the infant Republic was cradled on the Plains of Abraham. The Spanish and Indian menaces were also now substantially reduced. Spain was (temporarily) eliminated from Florida, although entrenched in Louisiana and New Orleans, and was still securely in possession of much of western North America, including the vast territory from present-day Texas to Cal i fornia. As for the Indians, the Treaty of Paris that ended the Seven Years’ War dealt a harsh blow to the Iroquois, Creeks, and other interior tribes. The Spanish removal from Florida and the French removal from Canada deprived the Indians of their most powerful diplomatic weapon— the ability to play off the rival European powers against one another. In the future the Indians would have to negotiate exclusively with the British. Sensing the newly precarious position of the Indian peoples, the Ottawa chief Pontiac in 1763 led several tribes, aided by a handful of French traders who remained in the region, in a violent campaign to drive the British out of the Ohio Country. Pontiac’s uprising laid siege to Detroit in the spring of 1763 and eventually overran all but three British posts west of the Appalachians, kill ing some two thousand soldiers and settlers.

 The British retaliated swiftly and cruelly. Waging a primitive version of biological warfare, one British commander ordered blankets infected with smallpox to be distributed among the Indians. Such tactics crushed the uprising and brought an uneasy truce to the frontier. His bold plan frustrated, Pontiac himself perished in 1769 at the hands of a rival chieftain. As for the British, the bloody episode convinced them of the need to stabilize relations with the western Indians and to keep regular troops stationed along the restless frontier, a mea sure for which they soon asked the colonists to foot the bill. Land-hungry American colonists were now free to burst over the dam of the Appalachian Mountains and ﬂood out over the verdant western lands. A tiny rivulet of pioneers had already trickled into Tennessee and Kentucky; other courageous settlers made their preparations for the long, dangerous trek over the mountains. Then, out of a clear sky, the London government issued its Proclamation of 1763. It ﬂatly prohibited settlement in the area beyond the Appalachians, pending further adjustments (see Map 6.8). The truth is that this hastily drawn document was not designed to oppress the colonists at all, but to work out the Indian problem

 Detroit, 1794 A key French outpost from 1701 to 1760, Detroit fell to Britain during the Seven Years’ War. The British remained at Detroit even after the American War of Independence, exciting bitter resentment in the infant American Republic (see pp. 183–184).

 Map 6.8 British Colonies at End of the Seven Years’ War, 1763 This map, showing the colonies thirteen years before the Declaration of Independence, helps to explain why the British would be unable to conquer their offspring. The colonists were spreading rapidly into the backcountry, where the powerful British navy could not ﬂush them out. During the Revolutionary War, the British at one time or another captured the leading colonial cities—Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston—but the more remote interior remained a sanctuary for rebels.

 fairly and prevent another bloody eruption like Pontiac’s uprising. But countless Americans, especially land speculators, were dismayed and angered. Was not the land beyond the mountains their birthright? Had they not, in addition, purchased it with their blood in the recent war? In complete deﬁance of the proclamation, they clogged the westward trails. In 1765 an estimated one thousand wagons rolled through the town of Salisbury, North Carolina, on their way “up west.” This wholesale ﬂouting of royal authority boded ill for the longevity of British rule in America.

 The Seven Years’ War also caused the colonists to develop a new vision of their destiny. With the path cleared for the conquest of a continent, with their birthrate high and their energy boundless, they sensed that they were a potent people on the march. And they were in no mood to be restrained. Lordly Britons, whose suddenly swollen empire had tended to produce swollen heads, were in no mood for back talk. Puffed up over their recent victories, they were already annoyed with their unruly colonial subjects. The stage was set for a violent family quarrel.

The Road to
Revolution

 The Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. JOHN ADAMS, 1818

V


 ictory in the Seven Years’ War made Britain the master of a vastly enlarged imperial domain in North America. But victory—including the subsequent need to garrison ten thousand troops along the sprawling American frontier—was painfully costly. The London government therefore struggled after 1763 to compel the American colonists to shoulder some of the ﬁ nancial costs of empire. This change in British colonial policy reinforced an emerging sense of American political identity and helped to precipitate the American Revolution. The eventual conﬂ ict was by no means inevitable. Indeed, given the tightening commercial, military, and cultural bonds between colonies and mother country since the ﬁ rst crude settlements a century and a half earlier, it might be considered remarkable that the Revolution happened at all. The truth is that Americans were reluctant revolutionaries. Until late in the day, they sought only to claim the “rights of Eng lishmen,” not to separate from the mother country. But what began as a squabble about economic policies soon exposed irreconcilable differences between Americans

 and Britons over cherished political principles. The ensuing clash gave birth to a new nation.

The Deep Roots of Revolution
 In a broad sense, America was a revolutionary force from the day of its discovery by Europeans. The New World nurtured new ideas about the nature of society, citizen, and government. In the Old World, many humble folk had long lived in the shadow of graveyards that contained the bones of their ancestors for a thousand years past. Few people born into such changeless surroundings dared to question their social status. But European immigrants in the New World were not so easily subdued by the scowl of their superiors. In the American wilderness, they encountered a world that was theirs to make afresh. Two ideas in particular had taken root in the minds of the American colonists by the mid-eighteenth century: one was what historians call republicanism. Looking to the models of the ancient Greek and Roman

New Ideas in the New World


 republics, exponents of republicanism deﬁ ned a just society as one in which all citizens willingly subordinated their private, selﬁsh interests to the common good. Both the stability of society and the authority of government thus depended on the virtue of the citizenry—its capacity for selﬂessness, self-sufﬁciency, and courage, and especially its appetite for civic involvement. By its very nature, republicanism was opposed to hierarchical and authoritarian institutions such as aristocracy and monarchy. A second idea that fundamentally shaped American political thought derived from a group of British political commentators known as radical Whigs. Widely read by the colonists, the Whigs feared the threat to liberty posed by the arbitrary power of the monarch and his ministers relative to elected representatives in Parliament. The Whigs mounted withering attacks on the use of patronage and bribes by the king’s ministers—symptoms of a wider moral failure in society that they called “corruption,” in the sense of rot or decay. The Whigs warned citizens to be on guard against corruption and to be eternally vigilant against possible conspiracies to denude them of their hardwon liberties. Together, republican and Whig ideas predisposed the American colonists to be on hairtrigger alert against any threat to their rights. The circumstances of colonial life had done much to bolster those attitudes. Dukes and princes, barons and bishops were unknown in the colonies, while property ownership and political participation were relatively accessible. The Americans had also grown accustomed to running their own affairs, largely unmolested by remote ofﬁcials in London. Distance weakens authority; great distance weakens authority greatly. So it came as an especially jolting shock when Britain after 1763 tried to enclose its American colonists more snugly in its grip.

Mercantilism and Colonial
Grievances
 Britain’s empire was acquired in a “ﬁt of absentmindedness,” an old saying goes, and there is much truth in the jest. Not one of the original thirteen colonies except Georgia was formally planted by the British government. All the others were haphazardly founded by trading companies, religious groups, or land speculators. The British authorities nevertheless embraced a theory, called mercantilism, that justiﬁed their control over the colonies. Mercantilists believed that wealth

 was power and that a country’s economic wealth (and hence its military and political power) could be mea sured by the amount of gold or silver in its treasury. To amass gold or silver, a country needed to export more than it imported. Possessing colonies thus conferred distinct advantages, since the colonies could both supply raw materials to the mother country (thereby reducing the need for foreign imports) and provide a guaranteed market for exports. The London government looked on the American colonists more or less as tenants. They were expected to furnish products needed in the mother country, such as tobacco, sugar, and ships’ masts; to refrain from making for export certain products, such as woolen cloth or beaver hats; to buy imported manufactured goods exclusively from Britain; and not to indulge in bothersome dreams of economic self-sufﬁciency or, worse, self-government. From time to time, Parliament passed laws to regulate the mercantilist system. The ﬁ rst of these, the Navigation Law of 1650, was aimed at rival Dutch shippers
