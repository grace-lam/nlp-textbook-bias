 European adversaries had vanquished him—temporarily, as it turned out—in mid-1814 and had exiled the dangerous despot to the Mediterranean isle of Elba. The United States, which had so brashly provoked war behind the protective skirts of Napoleon, was now left to face the music alone. Thousands of Britain’s victori-

 ous veteran redcoats began to pour into Canada from the Continent. Assembling some ten thousand crack troops, the British prepared in 1814 for a crushing blow into New York along the familiar lake-river route. In the absence of roads, the invader was forced to bring supplies over

 the Lake Champlain waterway. A weaker American ﬂeet, commanded by the thirty-year-old Thomas Macdonough, challenged the British. The ensuing battle was desperately fought near Plattsburgh on September 11, 1814, on ﬂoating slaughterhouses. The American ﬂagship at one point was in grave trouble. But Macdonough, unexpectedly turning his ship about with cables, confronted the enemy with a fresh broadside and snatched victory from the fangs of defeat. The results of this heroic naval battle were momentous. The invading British army was forced to retreat. Macdonough thus saved at least upper New York from conquest, New Eng land from further disaffection, and the Union from possible dissolution. He also profoundly affected the concurrent negotiations of the Anglo-American peace treaty in Europe.

Washington Burned and
New Orleans Defended
 A second formidable British force, numbering about four thousand, landed in the Chesapeake Bay area in August 1814. Advancing rapidly on Washington, it easily dispersed some six thousand panicky militiamen at Bladensburg (“the Bladensburg races”). The invaders then entered the capital and set ﬁ re to most of the public buildings, including the Capitol and the White House.



 But while Washington burned, the Americans at Baltimore held ﬁ rm. The British ﬂeet hammered Fort McHenry with their cannon but could not capture the city. Francis Scott Key, a detained American anxiously watching the bombardment from a British ship, was inspired by the doughty defenders to write the words of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Set to the tune of a saucy English tavern refrain, the song quickly attained popularity. A third British blow of 1814, aimed at New Orleans, menaced the entire Mississippi Valley. Gaunt and hawk-faced Andrew Jackson, fresh from crushing the southwest Indians at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, was placed in command (see Map 12.5 on p. 266). His hodgepodge force consisted of seven thousand sailors, regulars, pirates, and Frenchmen, as well as militiamen from Louisiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Among the defenders were two Louisiana regiments of free black volunteers, numbering about four hundred men. The Americans threw up their entrenchment, and in the words of a popular song, Behind it stood our little force— None wished it to be greater; For ev’ry man was half a horse, And half an alligator. The overconﬁdent British, numbering some eight thousand battle-seasoned veterans, blundered badly. They made the mistake of launching a frontal assault,

Chapter 12 The Second War for Independence and the Upsurge of Nationalism, 1812–1824


 Andrew Jackson (1767–1845) appealed to the governor of Louisiana for help recruiting free blacks to defend New Orleans in 1814:

“


 The free men of colour in [your] city are inured to the Southern climate and would make excellent Soldiers. . . . They must be for or against us—distrust them, and you make them your enemies, place conﬁdence in them, and you engage them by every dear and honorable tie to the interest of the country, who extends to them equal rights and [privileges] with white men.

”


 on January 8, 1815, on the entrenched American riﬂemen and cannoneers. The attackers suffered the most devastating defeat of the entire war, losing over two thousand, killed and wounded, in half an hour, as compared with some seventy for the Americans. It was an astonishing victory for Jackson and his men. News of the American victory in the Battle of New Orleans struck the country “like a clap of thunder,” according to one contemporary. Andrew Jackson became a national hero as poets and politicians lined up to sing the praises of the defenders of New Orleans. It hardly mattered when word arrived that a peace treaty had been signed at Ghent, Belgium, ending the war two weeks before the battle. The United States had fought for honor as much as material gain. The Battle of New Orleans restored that honor, at least in American eyes, and unleashed a wave of nationalism and self-conﬁdence. Its wrath aroused, the Royal Navy had ﬁ nally retaliated by throwing a ruinous naval blockade along America’s coast and by landing raiding parties almost at will. American economic life, including ﬁshing, was crippled. Customs revenues were choked off, and near the end of the war, the bankrupt Treasury was unable to meet its maturing obligations.

The Treaty of Ghent
 Tsar Alexander I of Russia, feeling hard-pressed by Napoleon’s army and not wanting his British ally to fritter away its strength in America, had proposed mediation between the clashing Anglo-Saxon cousins as early as 1812. The tsar’s feeler eventually set in motion the

 machinery that brought ﬁve American peacemakers to the quaint Belgian city of Ghent in 1814. The bickering group was headed by early-rising, puritanical John Quincy Adams, son of John Adams, who deplored the late-hour card playing of his high-living colleague Henry Clay. Conﬁdent after their military successes, the British envoys made sweeping demands for a neutralized Indian buffer state in the Great Lakes region, control of the Great Lakes, and a substantial part of conquered Maine. The Americans ﬂatly rejected these terms, and the talks appeared stalemated. But news of British reverses in upper New York and at Baltimore, and increasing war-weariness in Britain, made London more willing to compromise. Preoccupied with redrafting Napoleon’s map of Europe at the Congress of Vienna (1814–1815) and eyeing still-dangerous France, the British lion resigned itself to licking its wounds. The Treaty of Ghent, signed on Christmas Eve, 1814, was essentially an armistice. Both sides simply agreed to stop ﬁghting and to restore conquered territory. No mention was made of those grievances for which America had ostensibly fought: the Indian menace, search and seizure, Orders in Council, impressment, and conﬁscations. These discreet omissions have often been cited as further evidence of the insincerity of the war hawks. Rather, they are proof that the Americans had not managed to defeat the British. With neither side able to impose its will, the treaty negotiations—like the war itself—ended as a virtual draw. Relieved Americans boasted “Not One Inch of Territory Ceded or Lost”—a phrase that contrasted strangely with the “On to Canada” rallying cry at the war’s outset.

Federalist Grievances and
 the Hartford Convention Deﬁant New Eng land remained a problem. It prospered during the conﬂ ict, owing largely to illicit trade with the enemy in Canada and to the absence of a British blockade until 1814. But the embittered opposition of the Federalists to the war continued unabated. As the war dragged on, New Eng land extremists became more vocal. A small minority of them proposed secession from the Union, or at least a separate peace with Britain. Ugly rumors were aﬂoat about “Blue Light” Federalists—treacherous New Eng landers who supposedly ﬂashed lanterns on the shore so that blockading British cruisers would be alerted to the attempted escape of American ships.

The Treaty of Ghent


 In a letter to her friend Mercy Otis Warren, Abigail Adams (1744–1818) fretted that the British were taking advantage of Americans’ disagreement over the War of 1812:

“


 We have our ﬁresides, our comfortable habitations, our cities, our churches and our country to defend, our rights, privileges and independence to preserve. And for these are we not justly contending? Thus it appears to me. Yet I hear from our pulpits, and read from our presses, that it is an unjust, a wicked, a ruinous, and unnecessary war. . . . A house divided upon itself—and upon that foundation do our enemies build their hopes of subduing us.

”


 The most spectacular manifestation of Federalist discontent was the ill-omened Hartford Convention. Late in 1814, when the capture of New Orleans seemed imminent, Massachusetts issued a call for a convention at Hartford, Connecticut. The states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island dispatched full



 delegations; neighboring New Hampshire and Vermont sent partial representation. This group of prominent men, twenty-six in all, met in complete secrecy for about three weeks—December 15, 1814, to January 5, 1815—to discuss their grievances and to seek redress for their wrongs. In truth, the Hartford Convention was actually less radical than the alarmists supposed. Though a minority of delegates gave vent to wild talk of secession, the convention’s ﬁ nal report was quite moderate. It demanded ﬁ nancial assistance from Washington to compensate for lost trade and proposed constitutional amendments requiring a two-thirds vote in Congress before an embargo could be imposed, new states admitted, or war declared. Most of the demands reﬂected Federalist fears that a once-proud New Eng land was falling subservient to an agrarian South and West. Delegates sought to abolish the three-ﬁ fths clause of the Constitution (which allowed the South to count a portion of its slaves in calculating proportional representation), to limit presidents to a single term, and to prohibit the election of two successive presidents from the same state. This last clause was aimed at the muchresented “Virginia dynasty”—by 1814 a Virginian had been president for all but four years in the Republic’s quarter-century of life.

 Three special envoys from Massachusetts carried these demands to the burned-out capital of Washington. The trio arrived just in time to be overwhelmed by the glorious news from New Orleans, followed by that from Ghent. As the rest of the nation congratulated itself on a glorious victory, New Eng land’s wartime complaints seemed petty at best and treasonous at worst. Pursued by the sneers and jeers of the press, the envoys sank away in disgrace and into obscurity. The Hartford resolutions, as it turned out, were the death dirge of the Federalist party. The Federalists were never again to mount a successful presidential campaign (see Map 12.2). Federalist doctrines of disunity, which long survived the party, blazed a portentous trail. Until 1815

The Second War for
American Independence
 The War of 1812 was a small war, involving about 6,000 Americans killed or wounded. It was but a footnote to the mighty European conﬂagration that had been ignited by the French Revolution and Napoleon’s imperial ambitions. In 1812, when Napoleon invaded Russia with about 500,000 men, Madison tried to invade Canada with about 5,000 men. But if the American conﬂ ict was globally unimportant, it had huge consequences for the United States. The Republic had shown that it would take sword in hand to resist what it regarded as grievous wrongs. Other nations developed a new respect for America’s ﬁghting prowess. Naval ofﬁcers like Perry and Macdonough were the most effective type of negotiators; the hot breath of their broadsides spoke the most eloquent diplomatic language. America’s emissaries abroad were henceforth treated with less scorn. In a diplomatic sense, if not in a military sense, the conﬂ ict could be called the Second War for American Independence. A new nation, moreover, was welded in the roaring furnace of armed conﬂict. Sectionalism, now identiﬁed with discredited New Eng land Federalists, was dealt a black eye. The painful events of the war glaringly revealed, as perhaps nothing else could have done, the

Legacies of the War of 1812


 folly of sectional disunity. In a sense the most conspicuous casualty of the war was the Federalist party. War heroes emerged, especially the two Indianﬁghters Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison. Both of them were to become president. Left in the lurch by their British friends at Ghent, the Indians were forced to make such terms as they could. They reluctantly consented, in a series of treaties, to relinquish vast areas of forested land north of the Ohio River. Manufacturing prospered behind the wooden wall of the British blockade. In both an economic and a diplomatic sense, the War of 1812 bred greater American independence. The industries that were thus stimulated by the ﬁghting rendered America less dependent on Europe’s workshops. Canadian patriotism and nationalism also received a powerful stimulus from the clash. Many Canadians felt betrayed by the Treaty of Ghent. They were especially aggrieved by the failure to secure an Indian buffer state or even mastery of the Great Lakes. Canadians fully expected the frustrated Yankees to return, and for a time the Americans and British engaged in a ﬂoating arms race on the Great Lakes. But in 1817 the RushBagot agreement between Britain and the United States severely limited naval armament on the lakes.



 Better relations brought the last border fortiﬁcations down in the 1870s, with the happy result that the United States and Canada came to share the world’s longest unfortiﬁed boundary—5,527 miles long. After Napoleon’s ﬁ nal defeat at Waterloo in June 1815, Europe slumped into a peace of exhaustion. Deposed monarchs returned to battered thrones, as the Old World took the rutted road back to conservatism, illiberalism, and reaction. But the American people were largely unaffected by these European developments. Turning their backs on the Old World, they faced resolutely toward the untamed West—and toward the task of building their democracy.

Nascent Nationalism
 The most impressive by-product of the War of 1812 was a heightened nationalism—the spirit of nationconsciousness or national oneness. America may not have fought the war as one nation, but it emerged as one nation. The changed mood even manifested itself in the birth of a distinctively national literature. Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper attained international recognition in the 1820s, signiﬁcantly as

A series of architects worked on the Capitol, following William Thornton’s original design along neoclassical, or “Greek Revival,” lines. After the British burned the building in 1814, Boston’s Charles Bulﬁnch oversaw the reconstruction of the Capitol, ﬁnally completed in 1830.



Chapter 12 The Second War for Independence and the Upsurge of Nationalism, 1812–1824


 the nation’s ﬁ rst writers of importance to use American scenes and themes. School textbooks, often British in an earlier era, were now being written by Americans for Americans. In the world of magazines, the highly intellectual North American Review began publication in 1815—the year of the triumph at New Orleans. Even American painters increasingly celebrated their native landscapes on their canvases. A fresh nationalistic spirit could be recognized in many other areas as well. The rising tide of nationconsciousness even touched ﬁ nance. A revived Bank of the United States was voted by Congress in 1816. A more handsome national capital began to rise from the ashes of Washington. The army was expanded to ten thousand men. The navy further covered itself with glory in 1815 when it administered a thorough beating to the piratical plunderers of North Africa. Stephen Decatur, naval hero of the War of 1812 and of the Barbary Coast expeditions, pungently captured the country’s nationalist mood in a famous toast made on his return from the Mediterranean campaigns: “Our country! In her intercourse with foreign nations may she always be in the right; but our country, right or wrong!”

“The American System”
 Nationalism likewise manifested itself in manufacturing. Patriotic Americans took pride in the factories that had recently mushroomed forth, largely as a result of the self-imposed embargoes and the war. When hostilities ended in 1815, British competitors undertook to recover lost ground. They began to dump the contents of their bulging warehouses on the United States, often cutting their prices below cost in an effort to strangle the American war-baby factories in the cradle. The infant industries bawled lustily for protection. To many red-blooded Americans, it seemed as though the British, having failed to crush Yankee ﬁghters on the battleﬁeld, were now seeking to crush Yankee factories in the marketplace. A nationalist Congress, out-Federalizing the old Federalists, responded by passing the path-breaking Tariff of 1816—the ﬁ rst tariff in American history instituted primarily for protection, not revenue. Its rates— roughly 20 to 25 percent on the value of dutiable imports—were not high enough to provide completely adequate safeguards, but the law was a bold beginning. A strongly protective trend was started that stimulated the appetites of the protected for more protection. Nationalism was further highlighted by a grandiose plan of Henry Clay for developing a proﬁtable home

 This painting hangs in the corridors of the House of Representatives, where Clay worked as a glamorous, eloquent, and ambitious congressman for many years.

 market. Still radiating the nationalism of war-hawk days, he threw himself behind an elaborate scheme known by 1824 as the American System. This system had three main parts. It began with a strong banking system, which would provide easy and abundant credit. Clay also advocated a protective tariff, behind which eastern manufacturing would ﬂourish. Revenues gushing from the tariff would provide funds for the third component of the American System—a network of roads and canals, especially in the burgeoning Ohio Valley. Through these new arteries of transportation would ﬂow foodstuffs and raw materials from the South and West to the North and East. In exchange, a stream

Legacies of the War of 1812


 of manufactured goods would ﬂow in the return direction, knitting the country together economically and politically. Persistent and eloquent demands by Henry Clay and others for better transportation struck a responsive chord with the public. The recent attempts to invade Canada had all failed partly because of oath-provoking roads—or no roads at all. People who have dug wagons out of hub-deep mud do not quickly forget their blisters and backaches. An outcry for better transportation, rising most noisily in the road-poor West, was one of the most striking aspects of the nationalism inspired by the War of 1812. But attempts to secure federal funding for roads and canals stumbled on Republican constitutional scruples. Congress voted in 1817 to distribute $1.5 million to the states for internal improvements, but President Madison sternly vetoed this handout mea sure as unconstitutional. The individual states were thus forced to venture ahead with construction programs of their own, including the Erie Canal, triumphantly completed by New York in 1825. Jeffersonian Republicans, who had gulped down Hamiltonian loose constructionism on other important problems, choked on the idea of direct federal support of intrastate internal improvements. New Eng land, in particular, strongly opposed federally constructed roads and canals, because such outlets would further drain away population and create competing states beyond the mountains.

The So-Called Era
 of Good Feelings James Monroe—six feet tall, somewhat stooped, courtly, and mild-mannered—was nominated for the presidency in 1816 by the Republicans. They thus undertook to continue the so-called Virginia dynasty of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison. The fading Federalists ran a candidate for the last time in their checkered history, and he was crushed by 183 electoral votes to 34. The vanquished Federalist party was gasping its dying breaths, leaving the ﬁeld to the triumphant Republicans and one-party rule. In James Monroe, the man and the times auspiciously met. As the last president to wear an old-style cocked hat, he straddled two generations: the bygone age of the Founding Fathers and the emergent age of nationalism. Never brilliant, and perhaps not great, the serene Virginian with gray-blue eyes was in intellect and personal force the least distinguished of the ﬁ rst eight presidents. But the times called for sober admin-

 istration, not dashing heroics. And Monroe was an experienced, levelheaded executive, with an ear-tothe-ground talent for interpreting popular rumblings. Emerging nationalism was further cemented by a goodwill tour Monroe undertook early in 1817, ostensibly to inspect military defenses. He pushed northward deep into New Eng land and then westward to Detroit, viewing en route Niagara Falls. Even in Federalist New Eng land, “the enemy’s country,” he received a heartwarming welcome; a Boston newspaper was so

 Boston’s Columbian Centinel was not the only newspaper to regard President Monroe’s early months as the Era of Good Feelings. Washington’s National Intelligencer observed in July 1817,

“


 Never before, perhaps, since the institution of civil government, did the same harmony, the same absence of party spirit, the same national feeling, pervade a community. The result is too consoling to dispute too nicely about the cause.

”




Chapter 12 The Second War for Independence and the Upsurge of Nationalism, 1812–1824


 far carried away as to announce that an “Era of Good Feelings” had been ushered in. This happy phrase has been commonly used since then to describe the administrations of Monroe. The Era of Good Feelings, unfortunately, was something of a misnomer. Considerable tranquility and prosperity did in fact smile upon the early years of Monroe, but the period was a troubled one. The acute issues of the tariff, the bank, internal improvements, and the sale of public lands were being hotly contested. Sectionalism was crystallizing, and the conﬂ ict over slavery was beginning to raise its hideous head.

The Panic of 1819 and the
Curse of Hard Times
 Much of the goodness went out of the good feelings in 1819, when a paralyzing economic panic descended. It brought deﬂation, depression, bankruptcies, bank failures, unemployment, soup kitchens, and overcrowded pesthouses known as debtors’ prisons. This was the ﬁ rst national ﬁ nancial panic since President Washington took ofﬁce. Many factors contributed to the catastrophe of 1819, but looming large was overspeculation in frontier lands. The Bank of the United States, through its western branches, had become deeply involved in this popular type of outdoor gambling. Financial paralysis from the panic, which lasted in some degree for several years, gave a rude setback to

 the nationalistic ardor. The West was especially hard hit. When the pinch came, the Bank of the United States forced the speculative (“wildcat”) western banks to the wall and foreclosed mortgages on countless farms. All this was technically legal but politically unwise. In the eyes of the western debtor, the nationalist Bank of the United States soon became a kind of ﬁ nancial devil. The panic of 1819 also created backwashes in the political and social world. The poorer classes—the onesuspender men and their families—were severely strapped, and in their troubles was sown the seed of Jacksonian democracy. Hard times also directed attention to the inhumanity of imprisoning debtors. In extreme cases, often overplayed, mothers were torn from their infants for owing a few dollars. Mounting agitation against imprisonment for debt bore fruit in remedial legislation in an increasing number of states.

Growing Pains of the West
 The onward march of the West continued; nine frontier states had joined the original thirteen between 1791 and 1819. With an eye to preserving the North-South sectional balance, most of these commonwealths had been admitted alternately, free or slave. (See Admission of States in the Appendix.) Why this explosive expansion? In part it was simply a continuation of the generations-old westward movement, which had been going on since early colonial days. In addition, the siren song of cheap land—“the

Fairview Inn or Three Mile House on Old Frederick Road, by Thomas Coke Ruckle, ca. 1829
 This busy scene on the Frederick Road, leading westward from Baltimore, was typical as pioneers ﬂooded into the newly secured West in the early 1800s.

Economic Strains


 Ohio fever”—had a special appeal to European immigrants. Eager newcomers from abroad were beginning to stream down the gangplanks in impressive numbers, especially after the war of boycotts and bullets. Land exhaustion in the older tobacco states, where the soil was “mined” rather than cultivated, likewise drove people westward. Glib speculators accepted small down payments, making it easier to buy new holdings. The western boom was stimulated by additional developments. Acute economic distress during the embargo years turned many pinched faces toward the setting sun. The crushing of the Indians in the Northwest and South by Generals Harrison and Jackson paciﬁed the frontier and opened up vast virgin tracts of land. The building of highways improved the land routes to the Ohio Valley. Noteworthy was the Cumberland Road, begun in 1811, which ran ultimately from western Maryland to Illinois. The use of the ﬁ rst steamboat on western waters, also in 1811, heralded a new era of upstream navigation. But the West, despite the inﬂow of settlers, was still weak in population and inﬂuence. Not potent enough politically to make its voice heard, it was forced to ally itself with other sections. Thus strengthened, it demanded cheap acreage and partially achieved its goal in the Land Act of 1820, which authorized a buyer to purchase eighty virgin acres at a minimum of $1.25 an acre in cash. The West also demanded cheap transportation and slowly got it, despite the constitutional qualms of the presidents and the hostility of easterners. Finally, the West demanded cheap money, issued by its own “wildcat” banks, and fought the powerful Bank of the United States to attain its goal (see “Makers of America: Settlers of the Old Northwest,” pp. 260–261).

Slavery and the
Sectional Balance
 Sectional tensions, involving rivalry between the slave South and the free North over control of the beckoning West, were stunningly revealed in 1819. In that year the territory of Missouri knocked on the doors of Congress for admission as a slave state. This fertile and wellwatered area contained sufﬁcient population to warrant statehood. But the House of Representatives stymied the plans of the Missourians by passing the incendiary Tallmadge amendment. It stipulated that no more slaves should be brought into Missouri and also provided for the gradual emancipation of children born to slave parents already there. A roar of anger burst

 from slaveholding southerners. They were joined by many depression-cursed pioneers who favored unhampered expansion of the West and by many northerners, especially diehard Federalists, who were eager to use the issue to break the back of the “Virginia dynasty.” Southerners saw in the Tallmadge amendment, which they eventually managed to defeat in the Senate, an ominous threat to sectional balance. When the Constitution was adopted in 1788, the North and South were running neck and neck in wealth and population. But with every passing decade, the North was becoming wealthier and also more thickly settled—an advantage reﬂected in an increasing northern majority in the House of Representatives. Yet in the Senate, each state had two votes, regardless of size. With eleven states free and eleven slave, the southerners had maintained equality. They were therefore in a good position to thwart any northern effort to interfere with the expansion of slavery, and they did not want to lose this veto. The future of the slave system caused southerners profound concern. Missouri was the ﬁ rst state entirely west of the Mississippi River to be carved out of the Louisiana Purchase, and the Missouri emancipation amendment might set a damaging precedent for all the

Then the transportation boom of the 1820s—steamboats on the Ohio, the National Highway stretching from Pennsylvania, the Erie Canal—opened broad arteries along which the westward movement ﬂowed. The ﬁ rst wave of newcomers came mainly from Kentucky, Tennessee, and the upland regions of Virginia and the Carolinas. Most migrants were roughhewn white farmers who had been pushed from good land to bad by an expanding plantation economy. Like Joseph Cress of North Carolina, they were relieved to relinquish “them old red ﬁ lds” where you “get nothing,” in return for acres of new soil that “is as black and rich you wold want it.” Some settlers acquired land for the ﬁ rst time. John Palmer, whose family left Kentucky for Illinois in 1831, recalled his father telling him “of land so cheap that we could all be landholders, where men were all equal.” Migrants from the South settled mainly in the southern portions of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.

Newcom Tavern, Dayton, Ohio
Built in 1796, Newcom Tavern
 was a typical way station for the pioneers ﬂowing into the newly secured Old Northwest in the early 1800s. Today it is Dayton’s oldest building.



 As Palmer testiﬁed, the Old Northwest offered southern farmers an escape from the lowly social position they had endured as nonslaveholders in a slave society. Not that they objected to slavery or sympathized with blacks. Far from it: by enacting Black Codes in their new territories, they tried to prevent blacks from following them to paradise. They wanted their own democratic community, free of rich planters and African Americans alike. If southern “Butternuts,” as these settlers were called, dominated settlement in the 1820s, the next decade brought Yankees from the Northeast. They were as land-starved as their southern counterparts. A growing population had gobbled up most of the good land east of the Appalachians. Yankee settlers came to the Old Northwest, especially to the northern parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, eager to make the region a proﬁtable breadbasket for the Atlantic seaboard. Unlike the Butternuts, who wanted to quit forever the imposing framework of southern society, northerners hoped to re-create the world they had left behind.

Building the Erie Canal
 A major engineering feat, the Erie Canal created an artiﬁcial waterway through upstate New York from the Hudson River to the Great Lakes, allowing people and goods to move to and from the Old Northwest more quickly and cheaply.

 Conﬂict soon emerged between Yankees and southerners. As self-sufﬁcient farmers with little interest in producing for the market, the southerners viewed the northern newcomers as inhospitable, greedy, and excessively ambitious. “Yankee” became a term of reproach; a person who was cheated was said to have been “Yankeed.” Northerners, in turn, viewed the southerners as uncivilized, a “coon dog and butcher knife tribe” with no interest in education, self-improvement, or agricultural innovation. Yankees, eager to tame both the land and its people, wanted to establish public schools and build roads, canals, and railroads—and they advocated taxes to fund such progress. Southerners opposed all these reforms, especially public schooling, which they regarded as an attempt to northernize their children. Religion divided settlers as well. Northerners, typically Congregationalists and Presbyterians, wanted their ministers to be educated in seminaries. Southerners embraced the more revivalist Baptist and Methodist denominations. They preferred poor, humble preacher-farmers to professionally trained preachers, whom they viewed as too distant from the Lord and the people. As the Baptist preacher Alexander Campbell put it, “The scheme of a learned priesthood . . . has long since proved itself to be a grand device to keep men in ignorance and bondage.” Not everyone, of course, ﬁtted neatly into these molds. Abraham Lincoln, with roots in Kentucky, came

 to adopt views more akin to those of the Yankees than the southerners, whereas his New Eng land–born archrival, Stephen Douglas, carefully cultivated the Butternut vote for the Illinois Democratic party. As the population swelled and the region acquired its own character, the stark contrasts between northerners and southerners started to fade. By the 1850s northerners dominated numerically, and they succeeded in establishing public schools and fashioning internal improvements. Railroads and Great Lakes shipping tied the region ever more tightly to the Northeast. Yankees and southerners sometimes allied as new kinds of cleavages emerged—between rich and poor, between city dwellers and farmers, and, once Irish and German immigrants started pouring into the region, between native Protestants and newcomer Catholics. Still, echoes of the clash between Yankees and Butternuts persisted. During the Civil War, the southern counties of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, where southerners had ﬁ rst settled, harbored sympathizers with the South and served as a key area for Confederate military inﬁ ltration into the North. Decades later these same counties became a stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan. The Old Northwest may have become ﬁ rmly anchored economically to the Northeast, but vestiges of its early dual personality persisted.

 line. In the 1780s Thomas Jefferson had written of slavery in America, “Indeed I tremble for my country when I reﬂect that God is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever; that . . . the Almighty has no attribute which can take side with us in such a contest.” Now, at the time of the Missouri Compromise, Jefferson feared that his worst forebodings were coming to pass. “I considered it at once,” he said of the Missouri question, “as the knell of the Union.”

 rest of the area. Even more disquieting was another possibility. If Congress could abolish the peculiar institution in Missouri, might it not attempt to do likewise in the older states of the South? The wounds of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 were once more ripped open. Burning moral questions also protruded, even though the main issue was political and economic balance. A small but growing group of antislavery agitators in the North seized the occasion to raise an outcry against the evils of slavery. They were determined that the plague of human bondage should not spread further into the untainted territories.

The Uneasy Missouri
Compromise
 Deadlock in Washington was at length broken in 1820 by the time-honored American solution of compromise—actually a bundle of three compromises. Courtly

 Henry Clay of Kentucky, gifted conciliator, played a leading role. Congress, despite abolitionist pleas, agreed to admit Missouri as a slave state. But at the same time, free-soil Maine, which until then had been a part of Massachusetts, was admitted as a separate state. The balance between North and South was thus kept at twelve states each and remained there for ﬁ fteen years. Although Missouri was permitted to retain slaves, all future bondage was prohibited in the remainder of the Louisiana Purchase north of the line of 36° 30'—the southern boundary of Missouri (see Map 12.3). This horse-trading adjustment was politically evenhanded, though denounced by extremists on each side as a “dirty bargain.” Both North and South yielded something; both gained something. The South won the prize of Missouri as an unrestricted slave state. The North won the concession that Congress could forbid slavery in the remaining territories. More gratifying to many northerners was the fact that the immense area north of 36° 30', except Missouri, was forever closed to the blight of slavery. Yet the restriction on future

The Missouri Compromise


 While the debate over Missouri was raging, Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) wrote to a correspondent,

“


 The Missouri question . . . is the most portentous one which ever yet threatened our Union. In the gloomiest moment of the revolutionary war I never had any apprehensions equal to what I feel from this source. . . . [The] question, like a ﬁrebell in the night, awakened and ﬁlled me with terror. . . . [With slavery] we have a wolf by the ears, and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go.

”


 John Quincy Adams (1767–1848) conﬁded to his diary,

“


 I take it for granted that the present question is a mere preamble—a title-page to a great, tragic volume.

”


 slavery in the territories was not unduly offensive to the slaveowners, partly because the northern prairie land did not seem suited to slave labor. Even so, a majority of southern congressmen still voted against the compromise. Neither North nor South was acutely displeased, although neither was completely happy. The Missouri Compromise lasted thirty-four years—a vital formative period in the life of the young Republic—and during that time it preserved the shaky compact of the states. Yet the embittered dispute over slavery heralded the future breakup of the Union. Ever after, the morality of the South’s “peculiar institution” was an issue that could not be swept under the rug. The Missouri Compromise only ducked the question—it did not resolve it. Sooner or later, Thomas Jefferson predicted, it will “burst on us as a tornado.” The Missouri Compromise and the concurrent panic of 1819 should have dimmed the political star of President Monroe. Certainly both unhappy events had a dampening effect on the Era of Good Feelings. But smooth-spoken James Monroe was so popular, and the Federalist opposition so weak, that in the presidential election of 1820, he received every electoral vote except one. Unanimity was an honor reserved for George Washington. Monroe, as it turned out, was the only president in American history to be reelected after a term in which a major ﬁ nancial panic began.



John Marshall and
Judicial Nationalism
 The upsurging nationalism of the post-Ghent years, despite the ominous setbacks concerning slavery, was further reﬂected and reinforced by the Supreme Court. The high tribunal continued to be dominated by the tall, thin, and aggressive Chief Justice John Marshall. One group of his decisions—perhaps the most famous—bolstered the power of the federal government at the expense of the states. A notable case in this category was McCulloch v. Maryland (1819). The suit involved an attempt by the State of Maryland to destroy a branch of the Bank of the United States by imposing a tax on its notes. John Marshall, speaking for the Court, declared the bank constitutional by invoking the Hamiltonian doctrine of implied powers (see p. 204). At the same time, he strengthened federal authority and slapped at state infringements when he denied the right of Maryland to tax the bank. With ringing emphasis, he afﬁ rmed “that the power to tax involves the power to destroy” and “that a power to create implies a power to preserve.” Marshall’s ruling in this case gave the doctrine of loose construction its most famous formulation. The Constitution, he said, derived from the consent of the people and thus permitted the government to act for their beneﬁt. He further argued that the Constitution was “intended to endure for ages to come and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.” Finally, he declared, “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.” Two years later (1821) the case of Cohens v. Virginia gave Marshall one of his greatest opportunities to defend the federal power. The Cohen brothers, found guilty by the Virginia courts of illegally selling lottery tickets, appealed to the highest tribunal. Virginia “won,” in the sense that the conviction of the Cohens was upheld. But in fact Virginia and all the individual states lost, because Marshall resoundingly asserted the right of the Supreme Court to review the decisions of the state supreme courts in all questions involving powers of the federal government. The states’ rights proponents were aghast. Hardly less signiﬁcant was the celebrated “steamboat case,” Gibbons v. Ogden (1824). The suit grew out of an attempt by the State of New York to grant to a



Chapter 12 The Second War for Independence and the Upsurge of Nationalism, 1812–1824


 private concern a monopoly of waterborne commerce between New York and New Jersey. Marshall sternly reminded the upstart state that the Constitution conferred on Congress alone the control of interstate commerce (see Art. I, Sec. VIII, para. 3). He thus struck with one hand another blow at states’ rights, while upholding with the other the sovereign powers of the federal government. Interstate streams were cleared of this judicial snag; the departed spirit of Hamilton may well have applauded.

Judicial Dikes Against
Democratic Excesses
 Another sheaf of Marshall’s decisions bolstered judicial barriers against democratic or demagogic attacks on property rights. The notorious case of Fletcher v. Peck (1810) arose when a Georgia legislature, swayed by bribery, granted 35 million acres in the Yazoo River country (Mississippi) to private speculators. The next legislature, yielding to an angry public outcry, canceled the crooked transaction. But the Supreme Court, with Marshall presiding, decreed that the legislative grant was a contract (even though fraudulently secured) and that the Constitution forbids state laws “impairing” contracts (Art. I, Sec. X, para. 1). The decision was perhaps most noteworthy as further protecting property rights against popular pressures. It was also one of the earliest clear assertions of the right of the Supreme Court to invalidate state laws conﬂ icting with the federal Constitution. A similar principle was upheld in the case of Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1819), perhaps the best remembered of Marshall’s decisions. The college had been granted a charter by King George III in 1769, but the democratic New Hampshire state legislature had seen ﬁt to change it. Dartmouth appealed the case, employing as counsel its most distinguished alumnus,

 When Supreme Court chief justice John Marshall died, a New York newspaper rejoiced:

“


 The chief place in the supreme tribunal of the Union will no longer be ﬁlled by a man whose political doctrines led him always . . . to strengthen government at the expense of the people.

”


 Daniel Webster (’01). The “Godlike Daniel” reportedly pulled out all the stops of his tear-inducing eloquence when he declaimed, “It is, sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.” Marshall needed no dramatics in the Dartmouth case. He put the states ﬁ rmly in their place when he ruled that the original charter must stand. It was a contract—and the Constitution protected contracts against state encroachments. The Dartmouth decision had the fortunate effect of safeguarding business enterprise from domination by the state governments. But it had the unfortunate effect of creating a precedent that enabled chartered corporations, in later years, to escape the handcuffs of needed public control. If John Marshall was a Molding Father of the Constitution, Daniel Webster was an Expounding Father. Time and again he left his seat in the Senate, stepped downstairs to the Supreme Court chamber (then located in the Capitol building), and there expounded his Federalistic and nationalistic philosophy before the

Daguerreotype of Daniel Webster (1782–1852), by
 Southworth and Hawes Premier orator and statesman, Webster served many years in both houses of Congress and also as secretary of state. Often regarded as presidential timber, he was somewhat handicapped by an overfondness for good food and drink and was frequently in ﬁnancial difﬁculties. His devotion to the Union was inﬂexible. “One country, one constitution, and one destiny,” he proclaimed in 1837.

 supreme bench. The eminent chief justice, so Webster reported, approvingly drank in the familiar arguments as a baby sucks in its mother’s milk. The two men dovetailed strikingly with each other. Webster’s classic speeches in the Senate, challenging states’ rights and nulliﬁcation, were largely repetitious of the arguments that he had earlier presented before a sympathetic Supreme Court. Marshall’s decisions are felt even today. In this sense his nationalism was the most tenaciously enduring of the era. He buttressed the federal Union and helped to create a stable, nationally uniform environment for business. At the same time, Marshall checked the excesses of popularly elected state legislatures. In an age when white manhood suffrage was ﬂowering and America was veering toward stronger popular control, Marshall almost single-handedly shaped the Constitution along conser vative, centralizing lines that ran somewhat counter to the dominant spirit of the new country. Through him the conser vative Hamiltonians partly triumphed from the tomb.

Sharing Oregon and
Acquiring Florida
 The robust nationalism of the years after the War of 1812 was likewise reﬂected in the shaping of foreign policy. To this end, the nationalistic President Monroe teamed with his nationalistic secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, the cold and scholarly son of the frosty and bookish ex-president. The younger Adams, a statesman of the ﬁ rst rank, happily rose above the ingrown Federalist sectionalism of his native New Eng land and proved to be one of the great secretaries of state. To its credit, the Monroe administration negotiated the much-underrated Anglo-American Convention of 1818 with Britain. This pact permitted Americans to share the coveted Newfoundland ﬁ sheries with their Canadian cousins. This multisided agreement also ﬁ xed the vague northern limits of Louisiana along the forty-ninth parallel from the Lake of the Woods (Minnesota) to the Rocky Mountains (see Map 12.4). The

 treaty further provided for a ten-year joint occupation of the untamed Oregon Country, without a surrender of the rights or claims of either America or Britain. To the south lay semitropical Spanish Florida, which many Americans believed geography and providence had destined to become part of the United States. Americans already claimed West Florida, where uninvited American settlers had torn down the hated Spanish ﬂag in 1810. Congress ratiﬁed this grab in 1812, and during the War of 1812 against Spain’s ally, Britain, a small American army seized the Mobile region. But the bulk of Florida remained, tauntingly, under Spanish rule (see Map 12.5). An epidemic of revolutions now broke out in South America, notably in Chile (1810), Venezuela (1811), and Argentina (1816), and Americans instinctively cheered the birth of these sister republics, though the checkered histories of the Latin democracies soon provided grounds for disappointment. But the upheavals in the southern continent forced Spain to denude Florida of troops in a vain effort to squelch the rebels. General Andrew Jackson, idol of the West and scourge of the Indians, saw opportunity in the undefended swamplands. On the pretext that hostile Seminole Indians and

 fugitive slaves were using Florida as a refuge, Jackson secured a commission to enter Spanish territory, punish the Indians, and recapture the runaways. But he was to respect all posts under the Spanish ﬂag. Early in 1818 Jackson swept across the Florida border with all the fury of an avenging angel. He hanged two Indian chiefs without ceremony and, after hasty military trials, executed two British subjects for assisting the Indians. He also seized the two most important Spanish posts in the area, St. Marks and then Pensacola, where he deposed the Spanish governor, who was lucky enough to escape Jackson’s jerking noose. Jackson had clearly exceeded his instructions from Washington. Alarmed, President Monroe consulted his cabinet. Its members were for disavowing or disciplining the overzealous Jackson—all except the lone wolf John Quincy Adams, who refused to howl with the pack.

Oregon and Florida


 Eng lander took the offensive and demanded huge concessions from Spain. In the mislabeled Florida Purchase Treaty of 1819 (also known as the Adams-Onís Treaty), Spain ceded Florida, as well as shadowy Spanish claims to Oregon, in exchange for America’s abandonment of equally murky claims to Texas, soon to become part of independent Mexico. The hitherto vague western boundary of Louisiana was made to zigzag northwesterly toward the Rockies to the forty-second parallel and then to turn due west to the Paciﬁc, dividing Oregon from Spanish holdings.

The Menace of Monarchy
 in America After the Napoleonic nightmare, the rethroned autocrats of Europe banded together in a kind of monarchical protective association. Determined to restore the good old days, they undertook to stamp out the democratic tendencies that had sprouted from soil they considered richly manured by the ideals of the French Revolution. The world must be made safe from democracy. The crowned despots acted promptly. With complete ruthlessness they smothered the embers of popular rebellions in Italy (1821) and in Spain (1823). According to the European rumor factory, they were also gazing across the Atlantic. Russia, Austria, Prussia, and France, acting in partnership, would presumably send powerful ﬂeets and armies to the revolted colonies of Spanish America and there restore the autocratic Spanish king to his ancestral domains. Many Americans were alarmed. Naturally sympathetic to democratic revolutions, they had cheered when the Latin American republics rose from the ruins of monarchy. Americans feared that if the European powers intervened in the New World, the cause of republicanism would suffer irreparable harm. The physical security of the United States—the mother lode of democracy—would be endangered by the proximity of powerful and unfriendly forces. The southward push of the Russian bear, from the chill region now known as Alaska, had already publicized the menace of monarchy to North America. In 1821 the tsar of Russia issued a decree extending Russian jurisdiction over one hundred miles of the open sea down to the line of 51°, an area that embraced most of the coast of present-day British Columbia. The energetic Russians had already established trading posts almost as far south as the entrance to San Francisco



 Bay. (Fort Ross—“Ross” is a corruption of “Russian”— still stands today on the coast of Sonoma County, Cal ifornia.) The fear prevailed in the United States that the Russians were planning to cut the Republic off from Cal i fornia, its prospective window on the Paciﬁc. Great Britain, still Ruler of the Seas, was now beginning to play a lone-hand role on the complicated international stage. In particular, it recoiled from joining hands with the continental European powers in crushing the newly won liberties of the Spanish Americans. These revolutionaries had thrown open their monopoly-bound ports to outside trade, and British shippers, as well as Americans, had found the proﬁts sweet. Accordingly, in August 1823 George Canning, the haughty British foreign secretary, approached the American minister in London with a startling proposition. Would the United States combine with Britain in a joint declaration renouncing any interest in acquiring Latin American territory, and speciﬁcally warning the European despots to keep their harsh hands off the Latin American republics? The American minister, lacking instructions, referred this fateful scheme to his superiors in Washington.

Monroe and His Doctrine
 The tenacious nationalist, Secretary Adams, was hardheaded enough to be wary of Britons bearing gifts. Why should the lordly British, with the mightiest navy aﬂoat, need America as an ally—an America that had neither naval nor military strength? Such a union, argued Adams, was undigniﬁed—like a tiny American “cockboat” sailing “in the wake of the British man-of-war.” Adams, ever alert, thought that he detected the joker in the Canning proposal. The British feared that the aggressive Yankees would one day seize Spanish territory in the Americas—perhaps Cuba—which would jeopardize Britain’s possessions in the Caribbean. If Canning could seduce the United States into joining with him in support of the territorial integrity of the New World, America’s own hands would be morally tied. A self-denying alliance with Britain would not only hamper American expansion, concluded Adams, but it was unnecessary. He suspected—correctly—that the European powers had not hatched any deﬁ nite plans for invading the Americas. In any event the British navy would prevent the approach of hostile ﬂeets because the South American markets had to be kept open at all costs for British merchants. It was presumably safe for

 President Monroe Thinking Globally Surrounded by his cabinet, the president is depicted explaining the Monroe Doctrine. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams is the ﬁrst on the left; Secretary of War John C. Calhoun is the third from the right.

 Uncle Sam, behind the protective wooden petticoats of the British navy, to blow a deﬁant, nationalistic blast at all of Europe. The distresses of the Old World set the stage once again for an American diplomatic coup. The Monroe Doctrine was born late in 1823, when the nationalistic Adams won the nationalistic Monroe over to his way of thinking. The president, in his regular annual message to Congress on December 2, 1823, incorporated a stern warning to the European powers. Its two basic features were (1) noncolonization and (2) nonintervention. Monroe ﬁ rst directed his verbal volley primarily at the lumbering Russian bear in the Northwest. He proclaimed, in effect, that the era of colonization in the Americas had ended and that henceforth the hunting season was permanently closed. What the great powers had they might keep, but neither they nor any other Old World governments could seize or otherwise acquire more. At the same time, Monroe trumpeted a warning against foreign intervention. He was clearly concerned

 with regions to the south, where fears were felt for the ﬂedgling Spanish American republics. Monroe bluntly directed the crowned heads of Europe to keep their hated monarchical systems out of this hemisphere. For its part the United States would not intervene in the war that the Greeks were then ﬁghting against the Turks for their independence.

 Monroe’s Doctrine Appraised The ermined monarchs of Europe were angered at Monroe’s doctrine. Having resented the incendiary American experiment from the beginning, they were now deeply offended by Monroe’s high-ﬂown declaration—all the more so because of the gulf between America’s pretentious pronouncements and its puny military strength. But though offended by the upstart Yankees, the European powers found their hands tied, and their frustration increased their annoyance. Even if they had worked out plans for invading the Americas,

 they would have been helpless before the booming broadsides of the British navy. Monroe’s solemn warning, when issued, made little splash in the newborn republics to the south. Anyone could see that Uncle Sam was only secondarily concerned about his neighbors, because he was primarily concerned about defending himself against future invasion. Only a relatively few educated Latin Americans knew of the message, and they generally recognized that the British navy—not the paper pronouncement of James Monroe—stood between them and a hostile Europe. In truth, Monroe’s message did not have much contemporary signiﬁcance. Americans applauded it and then forgot it. Not until 1845 did President Polk revive it, and not until midcentury did it become an important national dogma. Even before Monroe’s stiff message, the tsar had decided to retreat. This he formally did in the RussoAmerican Treaty of 1824, which ﬁ xed his southernmost

 limits at the line of 54° 40'—the present southern tip of the Alaska panhandle (see Map 12.6). The Monroe Doctrine might more accurately have been called the Self-Defense Doctrine. President Monroe was concerned basically with the security of his own country—not of Latin America. The United States has never willingly permitted a powerful foreign nation to secure a foothold near its strategic Caribbean vitals. Yet in the absence of the British navy or other allies, the strength of the Monroe Doctrine has never been greater than America’s power to eject the trespasser. The doctrine, as often noted, was just as big as the nation’s armed forces—and no bigger. The Monroe Doctrine has had a long career of ups and downs. It was never law—domestic or international. It was not, technically speaking, a pledge or an agreement. It was merely a simple, personalized statement of the policy of President Monroe. What one president says, another may unsay. And Monroe’s successors have ignored, revived, distorted, or expanded

 the original version, chieﬂy by adding interpretations. Like ivy on a tree, it has grown with America’s growth. But the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 was largely an expression of the post-1812 nationalism energizing the United States. Although directed at a speciﬁc menace in 1823, and hence a kind of period piece, the doctrine proved to be the most famous of all the long-lived off-

 spring of that nationalism. While giving voice to a spirit of patriotism, it simultaneously deepened the illusion of isolationism. Many Americans falsely concluded, then and later, that the Republic was in fact insulated from European dangers simply because it wanted to be and because, in a nationalistic outburst, Monroe had publicly warned the Old World powers to stay away.

The Rise of a
Mass Democracy





1824–1840
 In the full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry, economy, and virtue, every man is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the laws undertake to add to those natural and just advantages artiﬁcial distinctions . . . and exclusive privileges . . . the humble members of society— the farmers, mechanics, and laborers . . . have a right to complain of the injustice of their government.

T


 he so-called Era of Good Feelings was never entirely tranquil, but even the illusion of national consensus was shattered by the panic of 1819 and the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Economic distress and the slavery issue raised the political stakes in the 1820s and 1830s. Vigorous political conﬂ ict, once feared, came to be celebrated as necessary for the health of democracy. New political parties emerged. New styles of campaigning took hold. A new chapter opened in the history of American—and world—politics, as many European societies began haltingly to expand their electorates and broaden democratic practices. The American political landscape of 1824 was similar, in its broad outlines, to that of 1796. By 1840 it would be almost unrecognizable.

 The deference, apathy, and virtually nonexistent party orga ni zations of the Era of Good Feelings yielded to the boisterous democracy, frenzied vitality, and strong political parties of the Jacksonian era. The old suspicion of political parties as illegitimate disrupters of society’s natural harmony gave way to an acceptance, even a celebration, of the sometimes wild contentiousness of political life. In 1828 an energetic new party, the Democrats, captured the White House. By the 1830s the Democrats faced an equally vigorous opposition party, the Whigs. This two-party system institutionalized divisions that had vexed the Revolutionary generation and came to constitute an important part of the nation’s checks and balances on political power.

The Corrupt Bargain




Canvassing for a Vote, by
George Caleb Bingham, 1852
 This painting shows the “new politics” of the Jacksonian era. Politicians now had to take their message to the common man.

 New forms of politicking emerged in this era, as candidates used banners, badges, parades, barbecues, free drinks, and baby kissing to “get out the vote.” Voter turnout rose dramatically. Only about one-quarter of eligible voters cast a ballot in the presidential election of 1824, but that proportion doubled in 1828, and in the election of 1840 it reached 78 percent. Everywhere people ﬂexed their political muscles.

The “Corrupt Bargain” of 1824
 The last of the old-style elections was marked by the controversial corrupt bargain of 1824. The woods were full of presidential timber as James Monroe, last of the Virginia dynasty, completed his second term. Four candidates towered above the others: John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, highly intelligent, experienced, and aloof; Henry Clay of Kentucky, the gamy and gallant “Harry of the West”; William H. Crawford of Georgia, an able though ailing giant of a man; and Andrew Jackson of Tennessee, the gaunt and gutsy hero of New Orleans. All four rivals professed to be “Republicans.” Wellorga nized parties had not yet emerged; their identities

 were so fuzzy, in fact, that South Carolina’s John C. Calhoun appeared as the vice-presidential candidate on both the Adams and Jackson tickets. The results of the noisy campaign were interesting but confusing. Jackson, the war hero, clearly had the strongest personal appeal, especially in the West, where his campaign against the forces of corruption and privilege in government resonated deeply. He polled almost as many popular votes as his next two rivals combined, but he failed to win a majority of the electoral vote (see Table 13.1). In such a deadlock, the House of Representatives, as directed by the Twelfth Amendment (see the Appendix), must choose among the top three candidates. Clay was thus eliminated, yet as Speaker of the House, he presided over the very chamber that had to pick the winner. The inﬂuential Clay was in a position to throw the election to the candidate of his choice. He reached his decision by process of elimination. Crawford, recently felled by a paralytic stroke, was out of the picture. Clay hated the “military chieftain” Jackson, his archrival for the allegiance of the West. Jackson, in turn, bitterly resented Clay’s public denunciation of his Florida foray in 1818. The only candidate left was the puritanical Adams, with whom Clay—a free-living gambler
