No American president since Franklin Roosevelt has so dominated the nation's politics and, indeed, culture as Ronald Reagan, shown here at his inauguration in 1981.
The voters who gave Ronald Reagan his margin of victory over Jimmy Carter in 1980 were a diverse lot. Working-class whites, north and south, sometimes called “Reagan Democrats,” were alienated by the civil rights and protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Many feared crime, which they tended to see as a “black issue,” and wanted a champion of “law and order.” The coalition also included middle-class and upper-middle-class suburbanites in revolt over taxes, especially rising property taxes, and government regulations that they thought were intrusive. The antitax movement led to the passage of Proposition 13 in California in 1978, a law sponsored by a private citizen, Howard Jarvis, which significantly cut California’s property taxes and ultimately the states vaunted government services. Other states copied Proposition 13, reducing taxes and public services. A third group of Reagan supporters were social conservatives—Catholics and Protestants associated with the religious right—for whom the key issues were their opposition to abortion, sexual and reproductive freedoms, gay rights, and the teaching of evolution as well as their desire for prayer in the public schools. In seeking to limit abortion or gay rights, the social conservatives wanted a more activist government, even if they otherwise favored a smaller government and lower taxes.
These diverse groups also shared a staunch hostility to communism and believed that presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard Nixon had been too soft. They were united in their anger at those they considered elitist—celebrities in Hollywood, the media, universities, and the federal government. In Ronald Reagan, the former actor and two-term governor of California, they

Reagan Revolution
Major changes in American politics under the leadership of Ronald Reagan, including cuts in taxes and domestic spending and increased military spending.
Many federal government programs that dated from the New Deal changed drastically during what came to be known as the Reagan Revolution. By the end of the 8 years that Ronald Reagan was president, taxes took less of peoples incomes, the federal debt ballooned, and a 50-year period in which labor unions could rely on a friendly government came to an end. The Cold War, which had been the dominant element in U.S. foreign policy since the end of World War II, also ended. Both the Republican and Democratic parties emerged from the Reagan Revolution more conservative than they had been. Supporters and detractors all agreed that the presidency of Ronald Reagan was a significant turning point in the United States.
Ronald Reagan and the Reagan Coalition
When Ronald Reagan became president, he was only 1 month short of his 70th birthday, the oldest man ever elected to the office. Reagan was born in the small town of Tampico, Illinois, in 1911. His father was a shoe salesman and an alcoholic who was unsuccessful in his search for better jobs until he was hired by the New Deal’s WPA. His mother, who worked as a seamstress, was a religious woman who made sure that the young Ronald and his brother were brought up in church. He said of his childhood, “We didn’t live on the wrong side of the tracks, but we lived so close we could hear the whistle real loud.” Handsome and popular, Reagan was elected high school class president and then student body president at Eureka College in Illinois.
Soon after college, and after a brief stint as a sports announcer in Iowa, Reagan left the Midwest for Hollywood where he appeared in 53 films between 1937 and 1953. It was steady work and it paid well. Reagan later said that he generally made two pictures per year, earning $300,000 to $400,000 per film, and would have worked harder to make more pictures if not for the high tax bite. The film work took Reagan a long way from the marginal economic status of his childhood. He married and later divorced Jane Wyman, whose Hollywood career was more successful than his; he would be the first divorced person elected president. He was popular in Hollywood and was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1947 to 1952, a position he used to identify suspected Communists in the film industry. When he became U.S. president, he was the first former union president to do so. During his Hollywood years, Reagan remained a Democrat, voting for Harry Truman in 1948 and against Richard Nixon for the Senate in 1950.
In 1952 he married Nancy Davis and left a declining Hollywood career to become a spokesperson for the General Electric Company, serving as the TV host of the General Electric Theater program from 1954 to 1962. Working for GE, he also gave pep talks to workers at GE plants, touted GE products, and spoke about the corporation’s views on taxes and government regulation to business groups. In his GE career, as in Hollywood, Reagan mastered the art of connecting with audiences, especially, maintaining a relaxed and genial presence in the face of lights, crowds, and distractions as well as delivering content from a script. While at GE he also changed his party registration from Democrat to Republican.
By the time Reagan left GE in 1962, he was as well-known for his political views as his acting. He supported Barry Goldwater in 1964. In a standard stump speech that came to be known simply as “the speech,” Reagan said that the choice facing Americans was “whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant
Beginnings, 1980-To The Present
810 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New
capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.” Ihe speech did not elect Goldwater, but it did bring Reagan to the attention of a crucial audience-rich Republican conservatives who agreed to back him if he would run for governor of California in 1966. The incumbent governor, Democrat Edmund G. “Pat” Brown, a tough campaigner who had defeated Richard Nixon in 1962, was seeking a third term in 1966. Reagan defeated him in the fall election and won reelection as governor in 1970.
Reagan talked a more conservative line all through his presidency than he practiced while he was governor of California. While he was tough on student protests, raised tuition at California s public colleges and universities, and ousted Clark Kerr as the president of the University of California, he was willing to compromise with a Democratic legislature on other matters. He raised taxes to cover a budget shortfall as well as signed bills supporting liberalized abortion rights and bilingual education. Some of his conservative supporters were nervous about his positions but valued his skill as a campaigner. As a conservative governor of the nation’s largest state, Reagan quickly became a presidential contender. He almost defeated Gerald Ford for the 1976 Republican nomination and easily defeated George H.W. Bush to win the 1980 nomination and then the presidential election against Jimmy Carter. As president, he did not disappoint most of his supporters.

Reaganomics—Supply-Side Tax Cuts, Military Growth, and Electoral Politics
Reagan came to office with three priorities: increasing military spending to ensure that the United States was significantly stronger than the Soviet Union, cutting domestic spending and government-sponsored social programs, and cutting the federal income tax. He was willing to compromise on almost everything else.
The antitax crusade had helped elect Reagan, and he surrounded himself with advisors who developed new economic theories to defend a tax cut even as he sought increased military spending. Reagan justified the tax cut with an economic theory known as supply-side economics. As defined by Republican congressman Jack Kemp and Democratic senator Lloyd Bentsen, supply-side referred to stimulating the economy, not by means of federal spending—the traditional approach since the New Deal—but, rather, by means of supporting the supply side—cutting taxes to foster private investment that might then lead to the creation of new jobs.
Tax cut proponents also cited what is called the “Laffer curve.” Developed in the 1970s by Jude Wanniski, a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, and economist Arthur Laffer, the curve meant to show that higher taxes reduced government income by reducing the incentive to work and earn taxable wages. At the extreme ends, the curve made complete sense. Zero tax would not impact work and earning in any way, and a 100 percent tax would certainly stifle most work. But the point in between, where taxes really cut into the will to work and where decreased tax rates might actually increase government income, was hard to pinpoint.
When Reagan first called for a 30 percent tax cut and used Laffer and the supply-side arguments to justify his position, his main rival for the 1980 Republican nomination, George Bush, called it “voodoo economics, and Jimmy Carter called Reagan s tax plans, “rebates for the rich, deprivation for the poor, and fierce inflation for all of us.” But after he became president, Reagan dismissed criticism, saying of the economists who challenged his ideas, “They’re the sort of people who see something works in practice and wonder if it works in theory.” In spite of a lack of evidence in either practice or theory, the president made a tax cut his first priority, and in August, 48 congressional Democrats—their Democratic colleagues called them boll weevils joined the Republican minority to pass a cut in federal income taxes that reduced the top rate on individual income from 70 to 50 percent. The president won the first of his three goals for his Reagan Revolution—the implementation of “Reaganomics,” as his economic policy came to be called—in less than 100 days in office.

Chapter 28 The Reagan Revolution 811
28.1
The Reagan cuts in domestic programs, including health insurance benefits for the elderly through Medicare, were not done without protest, as shown here. But few protests had a major impact on the cuts themselves.
In addition to the tax cut, Congress passed a modified version of Reagan’s budget. He did not get all the cuts he wanted, but the new federal budget reduced domestic spending significantly. Reagan also used his administrative authority to cut a number of additional federal programs, including food stamps and other programs for the poor as well as Social Security benefits for people with disabilities. Some 500,000 people were removed from the Social Security disability list. Another 300,000 who had been employed through the Carter administration’s Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) lost their government-sponsored jobs. The cuts were not the wholesale abolition of welfare that Reagan advocated, but they represented a substantial cut in the federal safety net that had been growing since the 1930s. At the same time, some programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and federal tax credits for the poor actually expanded during the Reagan years.
While campaigning for the presidency, Reagan also promised to expand the military so the United States would, without question, be the most powerful nation on earth. As a candidate, he said, “You spend what you need.” As president, he got congressional approval to develop a new B-2 bomber as well as cruise and MX missiles and to expand the Navy. During his first term in office, from 1981 to 1985, the total defense spending of the United States rose by 34 percent, from $171 billion to $229 billion.
Within months of the new administration coming to office, Americans understood that the change in Washington was significant, indeed, that some federal policies that had been in place since the 1930s were no longer going to continue. In addition to the tax cuts and expanded military spending, the new administration showed its attitude when the members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers’ Organization (PATCO)—the people who guide airplanes on take-off and landing—went on strike. The president told the members of the union, who were federal employees, that they had 48 hours to go back to work or they would be fired. When almost two-thirds of PATCOs members stayed out on strike, Reagan fired all 11,000 of them. They permanently lost their jobs, and the union was destroyed. People worried about the safety of air travel with so many veteran controllers gone, but the signal that this administration was going to have a different view of unions was clear. Organized labor, used to having a friend in the White House, was demoralized. Other strikes were also defeated,
812 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980-To The Present
including an especially bitter one by the meatpackers at the Hormel plant in Minnesota in 1985-86. Union membership dropped from one-fourth of the U.S. workforce to one-sixth during Reagan s two terms. Organized labor, long a major force in American society, was on a long slow decline, something that delighted the president and his conservative backers.
In the short term, the Reagan initiatives did not improve the nation’s economy. The president strongly supported Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker, whom Carter had appointed. Both presidents told Volcker to curb inflation no matter what the cost. Volcker did, with tough policies that sent unemployment above 10 percent in 1982, the highest since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Many people lost jobs, and new jobs were often in low-paying service sectors of the economy. Homelessness doubled while Reagan was in office from an estimated 200,000 to 400,000. The recession of the early Reagan years hurt the president’s popularity, and the Republicans lost seats in Congress in the 1982 elections. Reagan, with his optimism and self-confidence, asked the nation to Stay the Course.” By 1983, the national economy started to improve and continued to do so through the last 5 years of Reagan’s tenure. Economists argued whether the improvement was due to the tax cuts or expanded military spending, but in either case, a strong economy made Reagan more popular.
One result of the Reagan economic agenda was rapid growth in the federal deficit. The tax cut did not bring in as much new revenue as estimated, while the expansion of military spending more than offset cuts in domestic programs. The total federal deficit nearly tripled during the Reagan years from $914 billion to $2.7 trillion. More than one supporter saw the deficit as Reagan’s greatest failure. The United States, which had been a major creditor nation since World War I, became the world’s largest debtor nation. The government kept borrowing money to cover the federal deficit while individuals borrowed money—often by running up credit card debt. If some complained that Americans were maintaining a living standard beyond their means, they quickly noted that the worst offender was the U.S. government. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, once an advisor to Richard Nixon and who was a Democratic Senator from New York throughout the Reagan years, warned that the huge deficits virtually guaranteed that new federal initiatives to improve the lives of average or poor citizens were now off the table.
Reagan faced the prospect of reelection in 1984 with some significant strengths and some formidable weaknesses. To challenge him, the Democrats had, after an intense primary battle with Colorado senator Gary Hart, selected former vice president Walter Mondale as the Democratic candidate for president. In an historic move, Mondale asked New York Representative, Geraldine Ferraro, to be his running mate, the first time a woman was on the ticket of a major political party. At 73, Reagan seemed old, especially when in one debate with Mondale he seemed to lose track of a story he was telling. Reagan dismissed the issue saying, “I will not make age an issue in this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent s youth and inexperience.”
Reagan could not so easily dismiss other issues, however. Labor unions almost unanimously supported Mondale, although because of Reagan s policies they had far less clout. Most African-Americans supported Mondale, continuing a move by black voters to the Democratic Party that was speeded by Reagan s inattention to their needs. Moreover, Reagan’s silence on the rising epidemic of AIDS, a new and deadly disease, created some of his toughest enemies. Even social and religious conservatives who had flocked to Reagan in 1980 were disappointed. He had done little more than talk about many of their issues such as school prayer during his first term. As president, he never gave a speech to an antiabortion audience. However, conservatives did not have another candidate.
Other developments helped Reagan in 1984. By 1983, the economy started to turn around. More Americans had jobs and people were buying more goods, often on credit, including personal computers, video cassette recorders (VCRs), and telephone answering machines that had not been available in the 1970s.

The campaign slogan of Ronald Reagan's reelection effort in 1984.

Reagan also benefited from an upsurge of popular patriotism that he had helped to foster. The space shuttle program had been years in the making since the days when Americans worried about Sputnik and Soviet leadership in space, but Reagan benefit-ted from the good will when the first space shuttle was successfully launched in April 1981. Reagan’s tough line with the Soviet Union pleased anti-Communists, and the fact that at the end of his first term he was the first president since Herbert Hoover never to have met with a Soviet leader did not worry them. In June 1984, Reagan traveled to France for the 40th anniversary of the D-Day landing that ended World War II. In a series of events carefully scripted by his communications director, Michael Deaver, he led a series of jubilant and patriotism-filled celebrations honoring veterans and American power. Later that summer, the Olympics were held in Los Angeles, and Reagan led the celebrations, emphasizing how far the country had come since the boycott of the games in Moscow only 4 years before. Reagan’s wealthy supporters also gave him a huge financial edge over Mondale.
Perhaps most of all, Reagan’s own sunny disposition made people like him. His TV ads reinforced Reagan’s message that it was “Morning Again in America. His optimism was on full display when on March 30, 1981, Reagan was shot while leaving a speaking event. His press secretary James Brady was severely wounded and permanently disabled. Few knew at the time how seriously the president had been wounded when a bullet lodged in his left lung and he bled heavily. But just before entering surgery, Reagan looked at his wife, Nancy, and said, “Honey, I forgot to duck,” and then asked the surgeons, “Please tell me you’re all Republicans.” That sort of pluck made him popular even with people who disagreed with his policies. In addition, his speaking style was extraordinary. His many years as an actor paid off. His friends called him, “The Great Communicator,” and even his toughest opponents admired him. The Democratic Speaker of the House, Tip O’Neill, who tangled with Reagan on many occasions, said of him, “He may not be much of a debater, but with a prepared text he’s the best public speaker I’ve ever seen... .I’m beginning to think that in this regard he dwarfs both Roosevelt and Kennedy.”
In the November 1984 vote, Reagan carried every state except Mondale’s home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia and won almost 60 percent of the popular vote. While Republicans continued to control the Senate 53 to 46, the Democrats controlled the House 252 to 182.
A year after the election, a group of Democrats, including Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas organized the Democratic Leadership Council. These “New Democrats” argued that there was more to the election than Reagan’s personal popularity and that the Democratic Party was not going to win elections until it moved closer to the conservative mainstream. The creation of the Democratic Leadership Council was high tribute to the conservative shift in American opinion that constituted the heart of the Reagan Revolution and signaled a move away from traditional New Deal Democratic values that included significant government services, especially for those in need, and support for labor unions.
As Reagan entered his second term, people expected a repeat of the first. Reagan’s top priority remained reducing taxes, and in the mid-1980s, many Democrats agreed. A bipartisan coalition passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that cut the number of tax brackets from 14 to two, with tax rates of 15 and 28 percent respectively, while closing many tax loopholes. Led by the president, who had begun his term cutting the tax rate for the wealthiest Americans from 70 to 50 percent, the government had now cut it to 28 percent.
After the 1986 tax bill passed, Reagan devoted more and more of his time to foreign policy. He continued to appoint conservative judges and to support deregulation and the shrinking of the federal government, but he did not present major domestic policy initiatives in his last 2 years in office. Reagan had come to office a devout Cold Warrior. But before he left office, he presided over the greatest change in U.S.-Soviet relationships since Franklin Roosevelt had granted official U.S. recognition to the Soviet Union in the 1930s.
814 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980-ToThe Present
Expanding the Cold War—From Star Wars to Iran Contra
When Ronald Reagan became president in January 1981, he had virtually no foreign policy experience. He was more sophisticated as a politician than many of his detractors (and some of his supporters) admitted. Nevertheless, he had not spent much time outside of the United States and did not know much about foreign policy. He was served by a series of weak national security advisors as well as two secretaries of state, two secretaries of defense, and a strong director of central intelligence, William Casey, all of whom disliked each other intensely, kept major developments secret from each other, and at times implemented contradictory policies. First Lady Nancy Reagan also took an active role in policy discussions, especially when she feared that conservative ideologues were taking her husband in an unnecessarily hard-line direction. It was not an administrative structure leading to crisp and clear decision making. However, in the midst of apparent chaos, Reagan himself appeared to have been a far stronger leader than perceived, one who determined the main aspects of his foreign policy even as he left the details of implementation to others.
28.1

EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE COMMUNISM
Reagan had several deeply held beliefs that would drive his foreign policy. His fierce anticommunism, which first developed when he battled with perceived Communists in the film industry in the 1940s, was reinforced by his religious faith, which was offended by Communist atheism. His ability to articulate that passionate stance against communism had been honed through his speaking career for GE and as governor. He saw communism, as he once said, as “the focus of evil in the modern world,” and the United States as the exceptional carrier of goodness—the “shining city on a hill.” He disliked the longstanding policy of containment that had been at the core of American foreign policy from Truman to Carter. He did not want merely to contain communism where it was. He wanted to undermine existing Communist governments. Despite that fierce anticommunism, however, Reagan had a far greater horror of nuclear war than some of his fellow conservatives. His firm belief was that a nuclear war could “never be won and must never be fought.” During his first term, he never trusted the Soviets enough to engage in serious negotiations, but he was determined to avoid nuclear war.
During his first term, Reagan was harshly critical of the Soviet Union. In a 1983 speech to Christian evangelicals, Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as “the evil empire.” A year later, in August 1984, thinking that the microphone was turned off, Reagan said, “My fellow Americans, I am pleased to tell you today that I’ve signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.” It was a joke, but the Soviets found it frightening. Reagan also ordered a massive arms buildup. Worried about U.S vulnerability and believing that any negotiations needed to be from a position of strength, Reagan supported annual increases in the military budget between 1981 and 1986. He arranged the deployment of new intermediate-range missiles in Europe in 1983 and resisted serious talks with Soviet leaders.
Reagan’s goal of undermining communism where it already existed led also to other steps. In 1981, as protest movements spread in Poland and the Polish Communist government instituted martial law, Reagan imposed sanctions on Poland and on the Soviet Union: an end to landing rights in the United States for the Russian airline Aeroflot, a ban on the sale of equipment for a Soviet natural gas pipeline, and at the petty level—termination of the special parking privileges of Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin in the State Department garage. The administration secretly fun-neled some $20 million to Solidarity, the Polish protest movement, through the Vatican Bank, with the approval of Polish Pope John Paul II.
In March 1983, Reagan, against the almost unanimous advice of his foreign policy team who seldom agreed on anything, announced that the United States was going to develop a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). As the president described it, SDI would use U.S. technological know-how to create a series of space stations armed with lasers

that would destroy any enemy missiles fired at the United States. He thought that the long-standing U.S. policy dating to the Eisenhower administration of mutually assured destruction, in which each superpower had the ability to retaliate after a nuclear attack, was essentially a commitment to mutual suicide. In 1979, E war e er, the lead scientist in the development of the hydrogen bomb, told Reagan that for all its ability to build and launch missiles, the United States had virtually no defense against incoming missiles. As president, Reagan was determined to create one, to make Soviet missiles “impotent and obsolete.” Reagan was convinced that the United States could do it.
Senior advisors worried that SDI would be expensive, impractical, and a needless escalation of the Cold War. Critics called the whole system Star Wars, and worried that it would militarize space, drain the treasury, and ultimately turn out to be ineffective. Military contractors, however, loved SDI. The president was committed, and throughout his two terms, research and development of the system continued.
Only long after Reagan left office did it become clear how deeply fearful Soviet leaders were of the Reagan rhetoric and arms buildup, especially SDI. The Soviets feared that SDI would make them vulnerable to a U.S attack, one they could not resist if they could not retaliate. In September 1983, a Soviet satellite mistook blips for incoming U.S. missiles and the country went on full military alert. Only the courage of a young Soviet officer, who believed that there was a computer error and who overrode the system, appears to have avoided a World War III with millions of deaths in both countries. The Cold War had never been so dangerous.
MANAGING RELATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
As the United States focused on the Soviet Union, the Reagan foreign policy advisors also viewed the rest of the world through the prism of the Cold War, sometimes with disastrous results. Regarding the Middle East, Reagan came to office with a generally pro-Israel point of view, a perspective that was supported by many Christian evangelicals in his political base. His team believed that Jimmy Carter s Camp David accords had tilted U.S. policy too closely toward Egypt and wanted to correct the balance. At the same time, they saw Israel, Egyph Jordan, and Saudi Arabia as U.S. allies and were prepared to sell military aircraft to the Saudis and to supply Israel with jet bombers and military hardware. Their goal was to create a strong buffer in the Middle East against Syria and Iraq, both of which were viewed as Soviet client states (see Map 28-1). 0	200	400 kilometers

In Afghanistan, Reagan expanded the Carter-era efforts to resist the Soviet occupation. In 1983 and 1984, the United States provided significant aid to the Mujahedeen opposition whom Reagan called “freedom fighters.” In 1985, when the Soviets escalated their involvement, Reagan ordered his military to do “what’s necessary to win,” and the United States began supplying the Afghan resistance with antiaircraft missiles and satellite-based intelligence on Soviet troop movements. Eventually, the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan, leaving the CIA-backed Taliban in control of the country. It was a short-term victory but one that came with significant long-term consequences not only for the people of Afghanistan but also for the United States.
In addition, the leader of Libya was cause for concern. Libya’s longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi had come to power in 1969, long before Reagan’s time. Most of his North African neighbors found him to be a troublemaker, but he especially liked to create trouble for the United States. Reagan was determined to respond. In 1981, the U.S. Navy conducted exercises off the Libyan coast, and when Libyan jets attacked, the Navy shot them down. As terrorism expanded across the Middle East, Reagan was sure Gaddafi was behind much of it. When a TWA flight was hijacked in June 1985 and a West German discotheque was bombed in December of that year, killing one U.S. soldier, Reagan retaliated. In April 1986, the United States bombed Gaddafi’s headquarters in Tripoli, destroying much of the Libyan air force and killing some 30 civilians including Gadaffi’s 15-month-old adopted daughter. For a time, Libya was quiet, but in December 1988, a Pan Am flight was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the plot was again traced to Libya. Nevertheless, Gadaffi maintained his hold on power until 2011.
Although the hostage crisis with Iran ended the day Reagan came to office in January 1981, the United States remained hostile to Iran because of the crisis. When Iran and Iraq went to war against each other in September 1980, the United States tended to wish both sides ill. However, as the war continued, members of Reagan’s National Security Council (NSC) became convinced that it might be possible to support moderates within the Iranian government and build a new U.S. relationship by supplying Iran with weapons. The United States also had good reason to believe that Iran had influence with forces in Lebanon that were holding seven U.S. citizens hostage. NSC staff, led by National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane, argued Iran might help free the hostages, which was a high priority for the president. Carrying forged Irish passports and traveling under assumed names, McFarlane and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, secretly visited Tehran. In spite of U.S. policy never to negotiate for the release of hostages and despite its official arms embargo of Iran, the United States sold over 2,000 missiles to Iran in 1985 and 1986. It was the beginning of the greatest foreign policy misadventure of the Reagan administration.
Reagan and his advisers were further pulled into Middle East conflicts when Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982. Israel’s goal was to attack the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) presence in Lebanon and create a buffer against Syria. Reagan did not object, though he tried to get Israel to limit its engagement. Later that year, the United States sent a detachment of Marines to join an international peace effort in Lebanon. In October 1983, a truck loaded with TNT drove into the U.S. barracks killing 241 Marines. Americans, including the president, were horrified at the loss of life. The purpose the Marines were supposed to serve was always vague, and after the tragedy, the administration announced that the Marines were to be “redeployed” to ships off the coast where they moved in 1984.
In response to the experience in Lebanon, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and his top military advisor and future chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, crafted what became known as the Powell Doctrine. Henceforth, they said, U.S. soldiers would be sent overseas only as a last resort and only if the mission was clearly defined, attainable, supported by the public, and included an exit strategy, none of which had been true in the case of the deployment in Lebanon. The new restrictions would be honored more clearly in some cases than others. Toward the end of the Reagan administration, when Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank territories under the control of Israel rose up in what they called the intifada (or “shaking off’), the United States did little beyond urge both sides to negotiate.

DEALING WITH PERCEIVED THREATS IN LATIN AMERICA U.S.
policy in Central America, especially in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, was also shaped by the Cold War. Since the 1920s, Democratic and Republican administrations depended on a series of Latin American dictators to create a safe climate for U.S. business and ensure that there was no Communist influence in the government of their countries. What they did to their own citizens was of less concern to American authorities. By the time Reagan had come to office, the longtime dictator in Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza, had been overthrown by a popular uprising, and the totalitarian regime in El Salvador was seriously threatened by similar opposition. Fearing Communist influence in such popular uprisings, the Reagan administration supported the besieged government of El Salvador and sought to overthrow the new government of Nicaragua (see Map 28-2). Jean Kirkpatrick, Reagan’s United Nations ambassador, said that Central America was “the most important place in the world for us.” Kirkpatrick also outlined a key Reagan policy of differentiating between authoritarian governments such as that of El Salvador, which Kirkpatrick said could in time be reformed into democracies, and totalitarian governments—particularly, the government of the Soviet Union and its client states—which she claimed would never change. Under the policy, the United States would provide support for the former and opposition to the latter.
The same month as the attack on the Marine barracks in Lebanon, October 1983, Reagan ordered U.S. troops into the small Caribbean island nation of Grenada, where a military coup had overthrown the previous government. Fearing growing Communist influence, and worried about U.S. medical students in Grenada, U.S. troops quickly defeated the coup leaders. Leaders in other countries and in the United Nations condemned the invasion as a violation of international law, but some, in and out of Grenada, were grateful for the U.S. role.
Even though a majority of the Congress wanted nothing to do with supporting Central American dictators or overthrowing governments, the administration was determined to see its will done. While rejecting a proposal to invade Cuba, made by

Alexander Haig during his short tenure as secretary of state, Reagan greatly expanded military aid and sent military advisers to El Salvador. That support was authorized even while government-sanctioned death squads assassinated critics, including the Archbishop of San Salvador, Oscar Romero, murdered while he was saying mass in 1980.
The United States also determined to intervene in Nicaragua, where the new socialist Sandinista government was committed to land reform. In December 1981, Reagan, at the urging of CIA director Casey, authorized $20 million for covert operations to support the Nicaraguan Contras” (or counterrevolutionaries) who sought to overthrow the new government. The core of the Contra movement was a group of some 500 followers of Somoza, but it grew to an army of perhaps 10,000 who were trained in U.S.-sponsored camps in Honduras and sent back to Nicaragua with U.S.-supplied weapons to disrupt the workings of the Sandinista government. By 1984, Reagan was calling the Contras our brothers,” and he remained steadfast in their support.
By 1984, however, Congress was unhappy with the administrations Central American policy. As early as 1982, Congress passed the Boland Amendment, prohibiting the United States from seeking to overthrow the Sandinista government. Since Reagan insisted he was simply trying to get them to negotiate, he ignored that stipulation. But in 1984, when it came to light that the CIA had mined Nicaraguan ports, members of Congress—not only liberals but also conservatives, including Barry Goldwater—were furious. In October 1984, Congress passed stricter legislation that cut off all aid to the Contras.
With what seemed like an iron-clad prohibition of aid to the Contras, U.S. adventures in Central America seemed to be at an end. But Reagan did not give up easily. The president encouraged efforts of a young National Security staffer, Oliver North, to find new sources of aid, though it was never clear how much Reagan knew of the details of North’s enterprise. Since Congress had banned government aid to the contras, North sought donations from friendly governments in Taiwan, Brunei, and Saudi Arabia and from wealthy private U.S. citizens like beer magnate Joseph Coors. At least $50 million in such aid was delivered to the Contras.
Seeking to expand the aid, North and his mentor Casey had what they termed a “neat idea.” The United States was secretly selling arms to Iran. What if, they thought, the United States could make a profit on the clandestine arms shipments to Iran, and then use the funds to support the Contras? Congress would not have to appropriate any money, and no one needed to know.
The complex arrangement did not remain secret for long. In October 1986, an American cargo plane loaded with military supplies for the Contras was shot down in Nicaragua. The Sandinista government let the world know that, in spite of the two Boland Amendments, the United States was still providing significant aid to the Contras. A month later a Beirut, Lebanon, newspaper published an account, based on Iranian sources, of U.S. arms sales to Iran and the link to hoped-for hostage releases. People soon connected the two, and the scandal quickly became known as the arms for hostages” deal or simply as “Iran-Contra.’ The matter was serious. In selling arms to Iran and in funding the Contras, U.S. laws had been broken, laws that the White House clearly knew existed. Some in Congress talked of impeachment. As with Nixon at Watergate, the question was “what did the president know and when did he know it.
As the details of U.S. activity began to emerge, the president insisted that the government, “did not, repeat, did not trade arms or anything else for hostages.” He also asked Attorney General Ed Meese to investigate. Oliver North immediately began to shred documents in his office. Meese reported to the president that North had, in fact, not only sold arms to Iran—presumably to free hostages—but also used the profits to aid the Contras. National Security advisor John Poindexter met with Reagan, confirmed that Meese was right, and resigned. Reagan asked former Texas Senator John Tower to lead an investiga tion. A special prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh, was appointed, and Congress held hearings.
Reagan eventually had to admit, “I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and best intentions still tell me that it is true, but the facts and evidence tell me it is not.” Many were shocked that an administration that talked so

In his testimony before Congress regarding the Iran-Contra investigation, Oliver North looked and sounded like a hero in spite of the fact that he had obviously broken the law.
much about law and order was doing so many illegal things. Reagan clearly knew about the illegal sale of arms to Iran and the arms-for-hostages deals. Many also suspected that he knew about the transfer of funds to the Contras, although that was never proved. Poindexter and North insisted that the decision rested with them alone. Not everyone was convinced, but no “smoking gun” was found. North managed to testify brilliantly before Congress, portraying himself as a well-meaning patriot, and though Reagan’s approval rating plummeted, talk of impeachment ended.
Walsh continued his investigation after Reagan left office and eventually secured the indictment of several officials, but Reagans successor George H.W. Bush pardoned them. In 1994, Walsh concluded that Reagan probably should have been impeached, but by then, he was retired and ill. Iran-Contra seriously damaged Reagans reputation. As Reagan entered his last 2 years in office, many considered his foreign policy efforts to be a failure. Between 1987 and 1989, however, the president accomplished his great foreign policy triumph.
Ending the Cold War
During his first term, as Reagan talked tough and launched the arms buildup, he also refused to meet with Soviet leaders, in part, because he saw no point in such conversations and didn’t trust the Soviets and, in part, because of changes in Soviet leadership. Leonid Brezhnev, who had led the Soviet Union since Nikita Khrushchev was deposed in 1964, died in 1982. His successor Yuri Andropov died 2 years later, and the next leader, Konstantin Cherenko, died a year after that. Reagan said, “How am I supposed to get anyplace with the Russians...if they keep dying on me?” Then in 1985, a new and very different leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power in the Soviet Union.
After a succession of hard-line Communists who were aging and ill, Gorbachev represented a new younger generation of reform-minded Soviet leaders who saw how desperately their country needed change. Top-down Soviet-style planning was strangling the economy. Matching the United States in military matters took a huge percentage of their nation’s limited wealth. The disastrous meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl just after Gorbachev came to office further convinced him of the need for change. Gorbachev could be as charming and optimistic as Reagan,
820 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980-To The Present
but he was also a devoted Communist and a very tough leader. He called for major changes, perestroika, reform of the Soviet economic system while maintaining communism, and glasnost, more openness and freedom for Soviet citizens. He quickly concluded that matching the U.S. arms buildup was going to bankrupt the Soviet Union, and he sought a way to avoid the arms race.
After his reelection in 1984, Reagan was also ready to talk. By 1985, he had achieved the military buildup that he wanted and could negotiate from a position of strength. U.S. allies, especially those in Europe who lived on the front line of any conflict, were tired of Cold War tensions and increased pressure on the United States for a different policy. Nancy Reagan nudged her husband away from the hard-liners in his administration. Reagan also knew that his Cold War credentials gave him room to maneuver that another leader might not have.
By 1985, Reagan and Gorbachev were ready to work together. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, known as the Iron Lady because of her ability to stand up to pressure, was a close ally and friend of Reagan. She assured him that Gorbachev was someone “with whom we can do business.” Reagan and Gorbachev began a private correspondence and then met for the first time in November 1985 at Geneva where they agreed in general to a reduction in nuclear arms. The following October, they met again at Reykjavik, Iceland. There, in a small house on the ocean, they got to know each other. They talked about their lives—Gorbachev had once wanted to be an actor—their grandchildren, and their hopes for the future. At one point, they frightened their respective staff when they reached a tentative agreement to abolish all nuclear weapons by 2000 and then moved the date back to 1995. That agreement floundered over Gorbachev’s insistence that they include SDI and Reagan’s refusal. The Reykjavik summit ended in anger over Star Wars and without any agreement, but the two men had established a personal bond.
In June 1987, Reagan traveled to Berlin, the flashpoint of the Cold War. Facing the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate he demanded, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” The speech, which sounded much more like Reagan’s old line anticommunism than the new thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations, seemed to have been as much an effort to reassure the president’s conservative critics as an actual demand. But in fact, the steps that Reagan and Gorbachev were taking would lead to the end of the wall within 2 years, just after Reagan left office.
Soon after Reykjavik, the Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov convinced Gorbachev that SDI would not work and could safely be ignored. The two leaders then authorized further negotiations on offensive weapons that led to a treaty dramatically reducing intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) and to onsite inspections so rigorous that they frightened the American CIA.
Critics in both countries thought the leaders were moving too fast. In the Senate, North Carolina’s Jesse Helms tried to stop any new treaty, and Howard Phillips of the Conservative Caucus called the president a “useful idiot for Soviet propaganda. Gorbachev, for his part, had to deal with military and civilian attacks for his capitulationist line” toward the United States. Even so, the momentum was not going to be stopped.
At their next summit in Washington, DC, in December 1987, Reagan signed the INF treaty in a well-publicized ceremony, and Gorbachev met and mingled with American crowds like a U.S. politician. The two seemed at ease with each

other. When Reagan included one of his favorite sayings, “trust, but verify,” in his remarks, Gorbachev interjected, “You repeat that at every meeting.” People celebrated “Gorby fever.” The Senate ratified the INF Treaty by a large vote in May 1988. The two countries also made significant progress in resolving the conflicts in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, plans for joint space missions, cultural and student exchanges, and emigration and human rights. They jointly sponsored a UN resolution calling for an end to the Iran-Iraq war. The same month that the Senate ratified the INF treaty, the two leaders met for a fourth time in Moscow. They walked through Red Square, called each other “old friends,” and talked with Russian citizens. When asked about his earlier Cold War speeches, Reagan said they were from “another time, another place.”

Before Reagan left Moscow, the United States and Soviet Union had essentially normalized their relationship. For all intents and purposes, the Cold War was over.
The Strained Election of 1988
As a candidate in the Republican primaries in 1980, George Bush had called Ronald Reagans economic plans, voodoo economics. While Democrats had a field day with the term once he became Reagans vice president, Bush was a loyal member of the Reagan team, so loyal that some thought he had disappeared, but those who thought that way underestimated him considerably.
George Herbert Walker Bush was a child of privilege. His father was a successful banker and Republican senator from Connecticut. Bush attended private schools and expected to attend Yale when World War II intervened. While Ronald Reagan made war movies in Hollywood for the government, Bush flew more than 50 combat missions in the South Pacific and was shot down twice. After the war, he married Barbara Pierce, attended Yale, and then moved to Texas to make his fortune in the oil business. He served two terms in the House of Representatives from Houston. He was defeated when he ran for the Senate in 1970 but was subsequently appointed head of the Republican Party, nominal U.S. Ambassador to China after the Nixon trip, and head of the CIA for Gerald Ford.
The conservative wing of the Republican Party never trusted Bush, especially after his “voodoo economic” remarks, but also because of his lack of enthusiasm for their social issues. Disappointed that Reagan had not done more to support the social issues that were near and dear to them, some conservatives thought that the 1988 election was their chance. And Democrats, convinced that Reagan was more personally popular than his programs, believed that the end of his second term would be their chance to retake the White House. Neither challenge succeeded.
In the Republican Party, the conservative but genial Kansas senator Robert Dole challenged the vice president. And Pat Robertson, the extremely conservative religious broadcaster and head of the Christian Broadcasting Network, who had strongly supported Ronald Reagan, now resigned his ordination as a Baptist minister and campaigned for the nomination. Robertson felt that it was time to take the religious right’s social and cultural issues into a presidential campaign. While Bush won the nomination on the first ballot, he embraced many of Dole’s and Robertson’s issues, invited a conservative, Indiana senator J. Danforth Quayle—whom many considered to be a lightweight—to be his running mate, and made a speech he would later regret, telling the Republican convention, “Read my lips. No new taxes.”
Sensing possible victory, many Democrats sought the nomination. Colorado senator Gary Hart, an initial front runner, was forced out of the race after he was photographed on the yacht Monkey Business with the model Donna Rice—not his wife—sitting on his lap. The nomination battle came down to a contest between the Reverend Jesse Jackson, a longtime civil rights leader, and Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis. Jackson was extremely popular in some circles and reviled in others. He was the first African-American candidate to win presidential primaries in southern states, winning five. But in the end, Dukakis won the Democratic nomination. He summed up his campaign when he told the Democratic convention, “This election is not about ideology, it’s about competence.”
Dukakis entered the fall campaign with a 17-point lead in the polls, a sign that people were ready for a change, but the lead quickly evaporated in what turned into a very nasty battle. Dukakis s focus on competence did not make for an inspiring campaign. 822 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980-To The Present

SHAPE AMERICAN POLITICS?
In the presidential election of 1980, Republican Ronald Reagan won a landslide victory over Jimmy Carter. Economic stagnation and foreign policy difficulties had marked the previous years, while Reagan promised smaller government at home and stronger government abroad. In 1984, Reagan won an even more impressive victory over Democratic candidate Walter Mondale. One reason for these landslide victories was that a group of traditionally Democratic voters— white, socially conservative, blue-collar workers—changed party affiliation during the Reagan years and voted Republican. Reagan's supply-side economic policy, which included limited government deregulation and tax breaks for middle class and wealthy Americans, brought economic prosperity, but did not change the duress many suffered as other market forces saw the country move from an Back!

Now, Democrats, we must build such a quilt. Farmers, you seek fair prices, and you are right—but you cannot stand alone. Your patch is not big enough. Workers, you fight for fair wages, you are right—but your patch, labor, is not big enough. Women, you seek comparable worth and pay equity... Head Start, and day care and prenatal care on the front side of life, relevant jail care and welfare on the back side of life, you are right— but your patch is not big enough. Students, you seek scholarships, you are right—but your patch is not big enough. Blacks and Hispanics, when we fight for civil rights, we are right—but our patch is not big enough. Gays and lesbians, when you fight against discrimination and a cure for AIDS, you are right—but your patch is not big enough.... But don't despair. Be as wise as my grandmamma. Pull the patches and the pieces together, bound by a common thread. When we form a great quilt of unity and common ground, we'll have the power to bring about health care and housing and jobs and education and hope to our Nation. We, the people, can win.	Four years ago the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention told us that America was a tale of two cities—the "haves" and the "have-nots." The rich and the poor. The upper class and the lower class... .The Democrats have given us a clear picture of their city. They offer unlimited government, massive transfers of wealth from the productive sector of society to the nonproductive, and ever-increasing regulation of the daily lives of the people and their children. In the city of the Democratic Party, the liberal mindset reigns supreme. Criminals are turned loose and the innocent are made victims. Disease carriers are protected and the healthy are placed at great risk. In the Democrat's city, welfare dependency flourishes and no one is held accountable for his or her behavior. Society is always to blame. In the Democrat's city, the rights of the majority must always take a back seat to the clamorous demands of the special interest minorities. And yet, in their city it is always the majority that must pay the bills, through higher and higher taxes.... Ladies and Gentlemen, the Republican Party wants to write a tale of another city. We are the children of those who tamed the wilderness, spanned a continent, and brought forth the greatest nation on the face of the earth....We see a city seton a hill. A shining light of freedom for all of the nations to see and admire. A city made great by the moral strength and self-reliance of her people.... We are Republicans, and we believe in government that is our servant, not our master.

THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY
Explain international economic developments that shaped the United States.
Presidential candidates, economists, and families who gathered around the dinner table or the TV trays in the living room all debated the nature of the economic changes that were taking place in the 1980s as “Reaganomics” led to tax cuts, a reduction in government services, and fewer government regulations. Late in his term, in July 1987, President Reagan proposed what he called an Economic Bill of Rights, which he restated on several occasions:
First is the freedom to work—to pursue one’s livelihood in one’s own way ... free from excessive government regulation and subsidized government competition;.. .freedom to enjoy the fruits of one’s labor.. .free from excessive government taxing, spending and borrowing by the government.. .the freedom to own and control one’s property....freedom to participate in a free market... and to achieve one’s full potential without government limits on opportunity.

It was a philosophy that Reagan seemed to embody in his own life story. Yet by 1987, when the president spoke, some Americans were beginning to have second thoughts.
Kevin Phillips, who helped Republican presidential campaigns from Nixon to Reagan, was among them. In his book, The Boiling Point, he described what he saw as Reagan’s term came to an end. Reagan had been elected in 1980, Phillips said, because government was “fairly in disrepute for its swollen size and record of aggravating rather than solving problems.” He continued that with the cuts in taxes and government programs, however, “[h]igh-income persons did not suffer, but middle-class voters usually worried when federal and state reductions went too far” (see Figure 28-1).
One of the striking features of the economy of the 1980s was the extraordinary fortunes made by a few individuals. In the 1980s, Ivan Boesky anticipated corporate takeovers and mergers, buying stock just before it increased in value with stunning regularity. In December 1986, Boesky was honored with a cover photo in Time magazine, and by 1987, he had earned a total of more than $200 million.
Michael Milken, an investor for the firm Drexel Burnham Lambert who specialized in so-called junk bonds, earned much more. Junk bonds were high-risk investments that could pay high yields. Milken arranged investments in gambling casinos and technology startups as well “leveraged buyouts” in which investors would buy a controlling share of a company—using loans arranged by Milken—and thereby take it over in spite of the will of its owners and managers. In 1987, his estimated income for that one year was $550 million.
Boesky, Milken, and other slightly lesser figures were the heroes of the 1980s. In a speech to business students at the University of California, Berkeley, Boesky said, “I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself. But Kevin Phillips noted that, “By early 1990 The New York Times noted that Wall Street found an unnerving whiff of populism in the public s anger over junk-bond pioneer Michael Milken’s $550-million-a-year salary.
Federal employees at the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) became suspicious that anyone could have as much success as Boesky in guessing the direction of stock values year after year. A SEC investigation showed that Boesky was indeed getting illegal insider information about corporate takeovers and mergers. When he was charged with breaking the law, Boesky implicated Milken, whose illegal dealings were even more complex. Boesky was eventually fined $100 million, half of his fortune, Milken paid over $1.1 billion, and both served almost 2 years in federal prison. In the 1987 movie, Wall Street,

THINKING HISTORICALLY
A
Changing World Economy 283
Robert Reich was a respected economist in the 1980s and would serve as secretary of labor in the 1990s. As Reagan's term came to a close, Reich looked at the Reagan tax cuts, which he argued had certainly shifted money toward the rich. However, he also said that there were larger forces at work that were reshaping the world's economy and that the real issue was that the United States could not control its economy. In 1991, Reich published The Work of Nations in which he said, "We are living through a transformation that will rearrange the politics and economics of the coming century....There will no longer be national economies, at least as we have come to understand that concept."Trade, finance, indeed the whole job market of the planet, Reich insisted, had become a single worldwide economy in which national policies mattered much less than in the past. "All that will remain rooted within national borders," Reich said, "are the people who comprise a nation."
In the new world, Reich believed, some were going to be much better off and others worse off. He argued that people found themselves in one of three quite different economic categories. Those who were employees in the older industries—auto or steel workers for example—found themselves with declining prospects. Well-paying jobs that had been secure were disappearing as manufacturing moved to other countries. A second group of workers, those who provided direct services—from selling hamburgers to health care workers to teachers—would keep their jobs since such services were hard to export, but would find their futures relatively flat. And finally, in the third category, those Reich called "symbolic analysts" the scientists, inventors, developers, and money managers, would do quite well, indeed better than ever before. For example, Reich noted:
In 1960, the chief executive of one of America's 100 largest nonfinancial corporations earned, on average, $190,000 or about 40 times the wage of his average factory worker. After taxes, the chief executive earned only 12 times the factory worker's wages. By the end of the 1980s, however the
chief executive earned, on average, more than $2 million 93 times the wages of his (rarely her) average factory worker. After taxes, the chief executive's compensation was about 70 times that of the average factory worker.
Clearly the Reagan tax cuts had something to do with the change but not everything.
For Reich, the larger issue was the shift from a national American economy to a unified world economy:
All Americans used to be in roughly the same economic boat. Most rose or fell together, as the corporations in which they were employed, the industries comprising such corporations, and the national economy as whole became more productive—or languished. But national borders no longer define our economic fates. We are now in different boats, one sinking rapidly [the industrial workers], one sinking more slowly [service workers], and the third rising steadily [that of managers and inventors].
In the economy that Reich described, Americans would compete, not with each one another, but with people in the same sort of work around the world. Not everyone agreed with Reich, but it was hard to look at the nation at the end of the 1980s and not conclude that some, indeed, were sinking and others were rising quite spectacularly.

the villain Gordon Gekko gave a “greed is good” speech, based on Boesky’s Berkeley talk, which became a symbol of an era.
It was not only a few high flyers who got into trouble in the late 1980s, however. Throughout much of the 1970s, the Down Jones Industrial Average had hovered just under 1,000 (that is, the average value of a share on the list was $1,000; see Chapter 22). In 1980, the average crossed the magic 1,000 line to 1,100, and from there it just kept going up along with public optimism. By 1987, the average was above 2,500. Then in October 1987, the bottom fell out as it had done before. On October 19, known us “Black Monday, the market fell by 508 points, closing below 2,000. The next day, the Federal Reserve Bank, seeking to avoid a repeat of the 1929 crash, responded, pumping millions of dollars into the market. Consumer confidence returned and the market stabilized,

but in one day, American stocks had dropped $500 billion in their value, and many investors lost their savings.
Among the victims of Black Monday was the nation’s savings and loan industry. In 1982, as part of the Reagan efforts to deregulate government, most of the restrictions on savings and loan associations were removed. They were allowed to invest not only in houses and cars, which they had long done, but also in risky oil and gas ventures, real estate developments, and even junk bonds like those sold by Michael Milken. They attracted many more depositors by paying previously unheard of high levels of interest. They made huge fortunes for their executives and investors. But when the stock market, junk bonds, and then housing prices collapsed in the late 1980s, the savings and loan industry found itself in serious trouble with investments that were not worth what they owed to depositors. Some 1,200 of the nation’s 4,000 savings and loans required federal help or went out of business. Since the federal government guaranteed savings and loan deposits as they did bank deposits, the government—and taxpayers—were left with the cost, which came to $500 billion or $2,000 for every American. Further investigations showed that U.S. senators had done special favors for the savings and loan industry and six senators were censured. Savings and loan owners who made fortunes were found to have stolen from their companies. William Crawford, a California official charged with investigating the scandal, said, “The best way to rob a bank is to own one.”

CHANGES IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
Explain cultural changes in the United States during the 1980s.
On April 5,1985, 3 months after Reagan’s second inauguration, Michael Jackson, the most successful American rock star of the 1980s, joined in a concert, originally planned by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, Irish and Scottish musicians, to raise funds for famine relief in Africa. The concert was broadcast around the world and raised $44 million in a production which included Jackson, Lionel Richie, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Cyndi Lauper, Bette Midler, Willie Nelson, Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, and Tina Turner.

singers Bob Dylan and Harry Belafonte performing at "Live Aid '85" Concert on July 13,1985, at J.F.K. Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Three months later, on July 13, 1985, some 100,000 people attended one of two simultaneous rock concerts held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and London, England. Another 1.5 to 1.9 billion people around the world watched the concerts on TV or listened on radio. At the July concert, Jackson, his guests, and an audience of many million sang We Are the World.
These Live Aid concerts eventually raised over $80 million for Africa. Subsequent concerts raised more money. They also symbolized new international connections. Without a time lag, people could listen to the same concert at the same time. They could also transfer money, hold meetings, and plan new enterprises, creating a worldwide culture and economy. Given the speed of travel, it did not take much longer for people to visit new places, transmit diseases, or start a new life halfway around the world. Popular Culture—Music, Television, Theater
In addition to the fundraising—which was badly needed—the 1985 concerts also symbolized the way American rock musicians had come to dominate the world. Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, and Cyndi Lauper first emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. They were joined in these concerts by others, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, and Tina Turner, some of whom had been international figures since the 1950s. They represented diverse musical styles from Turners start in rhythm-and-blues to Charles’s jazz, to Lauper s rock, but all had become cultural icons across the United States, in major world capitals, and in isolated rural villages in Asia, Africa, and tiny Pacific islands.
The popularity of American music and American musicians was made possible, in part, by rapidly changing technologies. Michael Jackson insisted that We Are the World be released at exactly 3:50 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time (10:50 a.m. on the East Coast of the United States) in 8,000 radio stations around the world. The technology to transmit the music to all of these stations was new. When the Live Aid concerts were held in July 1985, one of the musicians, Phil Collins, managed to perform in person at both the London and the Philadelphia concerts thanks to the supersonic concord plane that brought him across the Atlantic faster than the speed of sound. Music Television (MTV) began broadcasting in August 1981 and built a worldwide audience for rock music. Generating these huge audiences would not have happened without the nonstop broadcasting of music videos aimed at audiences in the 12- to 34-year-old demographic who made up the bulk of those who attended the concerts or listened to the broadcasts. And after We Are the World had been released, it and
828 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980-To The Present
other music from the concerts was listened to over and over by individuals using Sony Walkman personal stereos, first sold in 1979, or Sony compact disc (CD) players, which produced far better quality than older tapes and records. American music of the 1980s could be heard worldwide because American—and Japanese—technology made possible the easy and cheap distribution of quality musical sounds.
The music of the 1980s also connected with Americans, especially young Americans, and their counterparts around the globe. It was their generation’s challenge to the traditional culture and its music. Where jazz, rock, and folk music all began as protests, against musical and political systems, so the music of the 1980s was its own forms of protest. African-American artists dominated the music, but they were not alone. Tina Turner, an African-American, who with her husband had headlined the Ike and Tina Turner Revue in the 1950s and 1960s, emerged after her divorce as a force in her own right in the 1980s, celebrating her energy and her sexuality with recordings like Private Dancer in 1984. A younger white woman, Madonna, celebrated her sometimes off-the-wall sexuality in releases like her 1984 album, Like a Virgin. A new generation, the children of the baby boomers, was creating a new music and a new culture of its own in the 1980s and making sure that its country, and the world, listened.
The 1980s were one of the most successful decades in the history of the film industry. The most popular film of the decade was E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial, a story produced by Steven Spielberg about a small creature from outer space who liked candy and wanted to “phone home.” Other highly successful films of the decade included The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983) in George Lucas’s Star Wars trilogy; Batman', Ghostbusters; and the Indiana Jones movies, Raiders of the Lost Ark (all in 1981) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). There were also more violent movies such as Terminator (1984) with Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Rambo films with Sylvester Stallone. While both Schwarzenegger and Stallone played classic “good guys,” the films had plenty of blood and violence. Spike Lee directed films like Do the Right Thing, which explored serious issues in a thoughtful way. Martin Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ, released in 1988, generated critical acclaim but also demonstrations in front of theaters, with its portrayal of Jesus as a man with ordinary temptations. As with music, so with films, technology expanded beyond anything previously thought possible. People still watched movies in theatres, but they also watched them at home as VCRs made it possible for films to be distributed, not only to the local theatre but also to the local living room where people could watch at their leisure.
The most successful TV series of the 1980s, the Bill Cosby Show, reflected an updated version of the 1950s family shows. But the family in the Cosby show, the Huxtables, was led by an African-American doctor, played by Cosby. The focus on a successful African-American family in the mainstream of America, and their warm acceptance by viewers, was a clear shift. In contrast, when the lead character of Murphy Brown, played by Candice Bergen, had a child without being married and indicated that the father’s identity was not important, the vice president of the United States, Dan Quayle, criticized the show.
African-American artists and writers also came to play a dominant role in theater and literature in the 1980s. The playwright August Wilson began producing a series of plays that explored the black experience from 1900 to 2000, including Ma Rainey s Black Bottom in 1985 and Fences in 1986. Toni Morrison’s novel, Beloved, published in 1987, explored the evils of slavery and eventually won the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Culture Wars—The Christian Coalition and Other Critics
The cultural developments of the 1980s and 1990s in music, drama, and creative writing also produced a considerable critical response. Looking at the era, Robert Bork, a conservative legal scholar who had been denied a position on the Supreme Court by a Senate vote in 1987, published Slouching Toward Gomorrah in 1996 in which he blamed a decline he saw in American culture on the nation’s “enfeebled hedonistic

culture,” its “uninhibited display of sexuality,” and “popularization of violence. Many other authors, liberal and conservative, worried about what the liberal African-American journalist Carl Rowen called the “sexual rot and gratuitous violence that led to “decadence, decay, and self-destruction” in the United States. In 1985, Tipper Gore, whose husband was then Democratic Senator from Tennessee, co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center after hearing her 11-year-old daughter listen to music by the recording artist Prince that she deemed profane.
The religious right was made up of people who were increasingly angry at many of the cultural trends of the 1980s and 1990s. The Moral Majority, the major political organization of the religious right, declined in the late 1980s and disbanded in 1989 (see Chapter 27). It had fallen victim to some of the more extremist statements of its founder Jerry Falwell as well as institutional mismanagement. Some commentators thought that decline would be the end of religious conservatism as a political force. They could not have been more mistaken. After Pat Robertson lost his campaign for the Republican nomination in 1988, he helped launch a new conservative religious
Opposition to abortion became one of the major rallying cries of the growing religious right.
830 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980-To The Present
and political organization: the Christian Coalition.
While launching the Christian Coalition, Robertson hired a young veteran of the
College Republican National Committee, Ralph Reed, to run the organization on a day-to-day basis. Reed brought a steady hand as well as organizational and fundraising skills to the Christian Coalition that the Moral Majority never had. He was a young fresh face and managed to portray himself as a moderating influence on the more extreme Robertson.
Pat Robertson was born in 1930. His father was a conservative Democratic U.S. senator from Virginia from 1946 to 1966. Robertson earned a law degree from Yale before studying for the Baptist ministry. He founded the Christian Broadcasting Network and The 700 Club, a religious talk show that reached millions, before he began his more overt political campaigning. In running for president and then launching the Christian Coalition, Robertson sought to resist what he saw as the increased secularization of American culture and avert what he saw as God’s coming judgment on the nation’s sins. Another evangelical minister, describing Robertson’s supporters, said, “They have a bunker mentality. They feel modernity is against them—in matters dealing with sex, crime, pornography, education.”
Ralph Reed, born in 1961, was a generation younger than Robertson. As a student, he was fascinated with the mechanics of politics and initially put off by the religious right because of their amateurishness. He was determined that the Christian Coalition would be an effective organization. The two made a strong team. By 1992, the Christian Coalition had more than 150,000 members and controlled the grass-roots Republican Party in several southern states.
By the mid-1990s, every Republican candidate for president was courting the Christian Coalition and Reed could say, “We have gained what we have always sought, a place at the table, a sense of legitimacy.” His goal was more than legitimacy, however. Read and Robertson wanted to shape the nation’s political agenda, from the grass roots up as much as from the top down. Pat Buchanan, who served as an advisor to Reagan in the 1980s and sought the Republican nomination in the 1990s, told Reed, “You just keep working on those school board races and leave the presidency to me.” Buchanan never won a presidential nomination, but Reed told the National Press Club “There are an estimated 2,000 religious conservatives who now serve on school boards, city councils, state legislatures, and in Congress.” Their impact throughout the 1990s testified to the coalition’s power.
Religious conservatives were not the only critics of American culture in the 1980s and 1990s. Robert Bellah, a liberal sociologist, argued in his 1986 book Habit of the Heart that Americans were becoming so individualistic and consumption oriented that they were losing their ability to
work together for the common good. A decade later in 1995, a Harvard scholar, Robert Putnam, published Bowling Alone in which he explored the impact of individualism. Americans who, in the past, joined churches, social and service organizations, and bowling leagues, now stayed home to watch television, spent less time in face-to-face gatherings of any sort, and even if they went out to a bowling alley, now did it alone. Some critics thought that Putnam and Bellah romanticized the past, but few dismissed their worries. New Immigrants, New Diversities
In the 1980s and 1990s many who lived in the United States were very recent arrivals. In 2000, 28.4 million people, or 10.4 percent of the population of the United States, were foreign born. This increase was a significant change from the 4.7 percent who were foreign born in 1970 and marked the end of almost 50 years of very tough immigration restrictions. Immigrants they came in growing numbers in every decade. When Congress passed and Lyndon Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality (Hart-Cellar) Act in 1965, no one expected it to have a major impact on the overall numbers of people coming to the United States (see Chapter 21). They could not have been more wrong. The 1965 law capped the number of immigrants at the same place as the older law, however, it was designed to make the process fairer. In addition to the numerical limits in the 1965 law, it provided for family reunion. If one member of a family was a legal resident or citizen of the United States, then that member could bring his or her family, regardless of the caps. By the 1990s, two-thirds of all immigrants to the United States were coming as part of family reunions.
Official government numbers showed the impact of the changes brought about by the law:
4.5 million immigrants in the 1970s
7.3 million immigrants in the 1980s
9.1 million immigrants in the 1990s
In addition, by most estimates, between 250,000 and 350,000 came to the United States every year without official documentation. In 2000, the U.S. population stood at 281 million, including some 28 million who had come between 1970 and 2000—more individuals than at any other 30-year time span in the nation’s history.
The new immigrants who came between 1970 and 2000 also came from places different from immigrants of earlier eras. Before 1924, when the United States virtually closed its doors to immigrants (see Chapter 26), most immigrants had come from Europe and, unwillingly, from Africa. After 1980, most new immigrants came from Latin America and Asia. Between 1980 and 2000,
2 million people came to the United States from Europe (mostly from former Soviet states);
5.7	million people came from Asia;
4 million people came from Mexico;
2.8	million people came from other parts of Central America, and the Caribbean;
1 million came from South America;
600,000 came from Africa; and
250,000 came from Canada.
By any counting they were reshaping the country.
Immigrants moved to every part of the United States. Meatpacking plants in Kansas, potato farms in Maine, and agribusiness in southern Indiana all depended on recent immigrants who were willing to do hot, dirty, and generally low-paying work. The majority of immigrants, however, settled in relatively few areas, especially the states of California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Illinois, and New York. By 2000, California’s population was 27 percent foreign-born as a result of a major influx of new immigrants and a modest white exodus.

The sign at this vigil in Echo Park, Los Angeles, reads, "This fruit is the product of immigrants' labor." Members of the city's Latino community bless fruit baskets as they protest a state crack down on illegal immigration and the increase of border patrol guards.
Many immigrants also came to the United States without official approval. The borders with Mexico and Canada were hard to guard and many simply walked across. Others came on tourist visas and never left. In 1986, Congress passed legislation that President Reagan signed, giving anyone who had been in the United States since 1982 the right to seek amnesty, and 1.7 million people, most from Mexico, took advantage of the law.
Debates about immigration became intense. In campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination in 1992, Patrick Buchanan staked out the anti-immigrant views in the strongest terms. He said, “Our own country is undergoing the greatest invasion in its history, a migration of millions of illegal aliens yearly from Mexico... .A nation that cannot control its own borders can scarcely call itself a state any longer.” In 1986, almost three-quarters of California voters approved a law that made English the “official language” of the state. While the law had little formal meaning, it was a slap at those who spoke other languages. Some labor union leaders and workers, white and black, complained that new immigrants were taking their jobs or depressing wages in whole industries.
On the other hand, defenders of immigration argued that the American economy was dependent on immigrants who were willing to take jobs—in restaurants, agriculture, and home health care—that few native-born Americans were willing to do. Would the crops get harvested, the meat packaged, the dishes washed, and the elderly cared for if immigrants, documented and undocumented, were forced to leave? Immigrants are generally younger than the average population, pay taxes, and contribute to the Social Security system, though in the case of those who are undocumented, they may never collect benefits. Some studies, they argued, indicate that immigrants are more highly educated, more likely to be in stable families, and less likely to be engaged in crime, though other scholars disputed those numbers. While the arguments continued, people kept coming.
American Indians in the 1980s—Casinos and Rebirth
While their numbers were drastically reduced by war and disease, American Indian tribes have survived and sometimes thrived in spite of the difficulties. As restrictions on teaching American Indian languages, culture, and religion were lifted in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, a surprising reservoir of an earlier cultural heritage resurfaced. For

Caridad Rios, Adela Aguirre, and Sasa Savic Talk about Their Immigrant Experiences in the United States
o single immigrant experience stands for the hundreds of thousands of people who have moved from crisis, poverty, or war to make new lives in the United States. These brief interviews with Caridad Rios, a 40-year-old native of Lake Chapala, Jalisco, Mexico; Adela Aguirre, also from Mexico; and Sasa Savic from the former Yugoslavia describe some common experiences.
Caridad Rios: I don't believe I'll ever return to my country, because of them [her children]. Because how could I leave them? For better or worse they need their mother here, even if they're grown...This country is made up of immigrants. From the earliest times, immigrants came....This country belongs to the whole world....I have worked, now I am receiving food stamps, but who cares? I have worked, I have contributed here.
Adela Aguirre [speaking of Chinese immigrant women at the workshop she attended] The first time...that I began to notice, that I said that yes, they also feel bad, they also have problems. They also go through what I'm going through, so Adela, what are you complaining about? Yes. That was when I began to get more interested in everything. It was when I began to pay more attention to them. Because I said, I have to learn from them. I have to learn a lot from all my companeras, but even more from them [the Chinese women]. First of all, because they are another, they are another nationality, they have other customs, they have another language. And maybe the nicest thing they made me learn was just that, that I realized that there are people, of whatever origin or whatever nationality that will help you, will motivate you.
Sasa Savic Basically I was raised in a middle-class family in the former Yugoslavia. My father was an officer in the army. So when I finished high school I served in the army, because it was mandatory for everybody to serve for 1 year. So I did that and coming out of the army there was a lot of political problems in the country. The country was in turmoil; everybody wanted to separate from each other. So since I'm from a mixed marriage—my father is Serbian and my mother Croatian—it was impossible to choose a side and say,'okay, I want to fight in the Serbian army against Croatians or the Croatian army against Serbian. So we decided to elope; my girlfriend at the time and I decided to get married and to try to come to this country. It was very hard to get a visa at the time....Because we said we wanted to go there on our honeymoon, we were granted a visitor visa.

some tribes, Coyote is the perfect symbol of Indian life. Coyote is the trickster who disappears and reappears as he needs to in order to survive and thrive in new contexts. At the Spirit Mountain Casino, which is operated by the Grand Ronde Reservation in western Oregon State, a picture of Coyote dominates the gambling hall and the tribal logo. It is a fitting symbol.
Gambling transformed many American Indian communities in the 1980s. While often a subject of derision, gambling brought prosperity to many tribes that had experienced only poverty since their first engagement with Europeans. Two federal court cases, Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Butterworth in 1981 and Californio v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians in 1987, made it difficult for states to limit gambling on Indian reservations. Some of those who controlled the gambling industry did not like the idea of new competitors, and Donald Trump complained about “equal treatment under the law.” But the United States had always used a different set of laws for Indians, and treaty rights created a unique situation. In the court cases, tribes and their attorneys argued that the treaty rights creating the reservations gave them all the powers of any sovereign state to handle their own affairs. To regularize the new industry that was emerging, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) in 1988, and Reagan signed it. While the court cases and legislation did not give the tribes unlimited control over their own affairs, a new industry was born, one that brought prosperity to some, though not to others.
283
By 1994,72 tribes were operating gambling operations in half of the states, and many more were planned. The gross income of these operations, $1.5 billion, was only a tiny fraction of the $330 billion the Americans spent on gambling, but it was a huge new source of income for tribes that had existed for generations on the economic margins.
The Pequots Foxwoods Casino produced almost $900 million in 1994, and the tribal council used the money to create other job-producing enterprises, including a silica mine and a printing plant. They bought the former Electric Boat shipyard that helped maintain the U.S. nuclear submarine fleet. Their goal was long-term economic development that was not dependent only on the gambling industry. Other tribes did the same. The Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin used the income from its slot-machine complex near Green Bay to open a chain store and a high-tech research and development firm. The Choctaws of Oklahoma used income from a bingo parlor in Durant to build a manufacturing plant, hotels, and the Choctaw Nation Travel Plaza that earned $1.4 million per month in 1992.
The new wealth allowed tribes to design their own museums, support retention of tribal languages, and maintain aspects of their culture that were otherwise being lost. They also allowed tribes to expand schools, provide new job training programs and health services, and generally support their members at a higher level. Promises of wealth also led some to “rediscover” their Indian identity. Indians who had drifted away from reservations were now returning, a change since the 1950s when a government Urban Relocation Program had led perhaps half of all American Indians to move from reservations to cities. Others who were part Indian were now claiming their Indian ties. Determining who was, and was not, a member of a specific tribe became a complex issue for some. R. David Edmunds, an ethnohistorian who himself is part Cherokee, wrote that traditionally no one questioned tribal membership, “If the Shawnees said you were Shawnee, you were Shawnee.” By the 1990s, however, such issues had become more complex, and tribes sometimes had to make difficult decisions. Nevertheless, the new prosperity was significant.
AIDS and the Gay Community
In 1980, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was an unknown disease. In June 1981, the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S. government’s key agency for monitoring the spread of disease, reported AIDS for the first time. Later studies found that AIDS may have infected people in the United States as early as 1969, but only in the 1980s did Americans learn about what would quickly become a terrible new scourge, first identified among gay men.
By May 1982, the New York Times carried a story, “New homosexual disorder worries officials.” At first, health officials did not know what the disease was. They were starting to discover that a cluster of symptoms were appearing in certain groups of people, especially homosexual men and intravenous drug users, but it took some time to understand what was happening. The symptoms were terrible: tumors, breathing difficulty, difficult digestion, and eventually, death. By 1984, researchers discovered the infectious agent, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and understood that they were not dealing with a few isolated cases but, rather, a growing worldwide pandemic. In 1985, the CDC recorded 5,600 deaths from AIDS. Three years later, 61,816 died of AIDS. By then, researchers had also concluded that HIV was spread through contact with bodily fluids, especially but not exclusively through sex or through sharing needles or even blood transfusions that brought the blood of an infected person into contact with another. People with many sexual partners and people who routinely shared needles were especially susceptible. HIV, they also concluded, could not be spread by a hug, by touching the same material, or through the air, but many people panicked and would not come near anyone suspected of carrying the disease.
As HIV-AIDS spread—the CDC confirmed 98,835 cases by 1988—the famous and the unknown were afflicted. The actor Rock Hudson, who often played tough
834 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980-To The Present
heterosexual male roles but was gay, announced in July 1985 that he had been suffering from AIDS since 1984. Many, including Hudson’s good friend Ronald Reagan, were stunned. Hudson died in 1985. Arthur Ashe, a famous tennis star, announced in April 1992 that he had contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion in the mid-1980s and he died in February 1993. In 1987, a previously unknown teenager, Ryan White, became a national voice for AIDS victims. White, who suffered from hemophilia, had contracted AIDS from blood treatments, but was then ostracized and expelled from school in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana. He died in April 1990. White’s gentle personality made him a hero. In addition to White, Ashe, and Hudson, thousands of other Americans were suffering and dying. In some communities with large groups of gay men, especially San Francisco’s Castro district and New York City’s Greenwich Village, it seemed as if a whole community was dying, and those who survived spent their time caring for the sick and attending funerals.
As people understood more about the disease, they also turned to the federal government for action. The government could not stop AIDS, but it could fund research that might lead to treatment and cure. The government could also spread information more effectively than any other agency, especially as it became known that using condoms during sex resulted in significantly safer, if not completely safe, sex and that using sterilized needles and not sharing them offered significant protection for drug users. But the call for government action crashed into the ideology of many of the leading players in the Reagan administration. The president’s director of communications, Patrick Buchanan, had once said, “The poor homosexuals. They have declared war on nature and now nature is exacting an awful retribution.” Other Reagan supporters, including Secretary of Education William Bennett, may not have agreed with Buchanan, but they strongly opposed supporting condom use. Requests by scientists at the CDC for more research funds were routinely denied.
When the U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, himself very conservative on matters of sex education, decided that it was his duty to get information out to the public on the dangers of AIDS and how to reduce those dangers, he said he realized, “I would have to skate fast on thin ice to get by political appointees who placed conservative ideology over saving lives.” After Koop issued his first report, members of the Domestic Policy Council suggested “revisions” that Koop believed would undermine its effectiveness. Only in 1987 did Reagan speak publically about AIDS for the first time. Breaking a silence that had irritated many, including Nancy Reagan, the president called AIDS “public enemy Number One,” but he continued to refuse to acknowledge or meet Ryan White or mention condoms until after he left office in 1989.
Gay activists became increasingly militant. In the fall of 1987, ACT-UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) staged a massive demonstration of 500,000 people in New York City. In addition, ACT-UP and other organizations, including the American Foundation for AIDS Research, continued to lobby for better public education, which in the 1990s was very effective. Eventually in 1992, Congress appropriated approximately $2 billion for AIDS research. While no cure or medical prevention has yet been discovered, important advances in the treatment of AIDS came as a result. AIDS had once been a death sentence, but by 2000, many with AIDS were living long and full lives as long as they continued to monitor their treatments carefully. In combining issues of medical science, health, sexuality, and drug use, the AIDS epidemic illustrated a tangle of cultural issues facing the nation as it entered the 1990s.

Across the country, gay and lesbian organizations, especially ACT-UP shown here, demonstrated to demand more funding for research into the causes and cures for AIDS as well as support for immediate help to AIDS victims.

Chapter 28 The Reagan Revolutia
CONCLUSION
The Reagan Revolution began in 1980 when Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in his presidential bid for reelection. Reagan, supported by a broad coalition of working-class whites, suburbanites, and social conservatives, came to office with three key priorities: increase military spending, cut domestic spending and social programs, and cut the federal income tax. During the Reagan administration, all three goals were met, and both political parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, became more conservative. Many New Deal structures and programs were eliminated or drastically modified, and the combination of tax cuts and military spending increased the national debt significantly.
Reagan and his advisors rejected the idea that federal spending was the best way to stimulate a sluggish economy. Instead, they sought to foster private investment and create new jobs by cutting taxes. Relying on what they called supply-side economics, Reagan drastically reduced both taxes and domestic expenditures. Reagan’s initiatives, at first, did very little to improve the nation’s economy. During his first term, unemployment, inflation, and the national debt all rose steadily. But, by 1983, the economy, in the eyes of most Americans, was improving. Although the stock market was strong throughout much of Reagan’s presidency, the bottom fell out in 1987. By the late 1980s, several economic events, including the savings and loan crisis, suggested that the U.S. economy was in trouble again.
Reagan came to office with very little foreign policy experience, but he quickly focused on destabilizing existing Communist governments and acted to prevent the spread of communism, especially in Latin America. As a result, the United States intervened in both overt and covert ways in many countries in the Middle East and Latin America. Later in his administration, the efforts to build new contacts within Iran and to fund the opposition to the Nicaraguan government led to what was known as the Iran-Contra scandal that seriously undermined the administration’s credibility and foreign policy record. As part of his anticommunism agenda, Reagan also initiated the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), or Star Wars, with the intention of destroying any Soviet missiles in space before they could strike the United States. While SDI greatly troubled the Soviets, it was never a viable technology, and despite his hardline stance against communism, Reagan forged a diplomatic relationship with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Before he left office, Reagan and Gorbachev had essentially brought the 40-year-long Cold War to an end.
In the 1980s, the culture wars began to dominate American politics as technological changes brought the world closer together and new forms of music and entertainment dominated the culture. At the same time, the Christian Coalition gained increasing power and influence. The religious conservatives of the Christian Coalition were alarmed by liberalizing cultural trends and by the ways that immigration was transforming the country. By the end of the decade, the country had been rocked by the AIDS epidemic, which some tried to ignore but which was, indeed, one of the great public health crises in history.

On Inauguration Day, January 20, 1989, as Ronald Reagan left the White House, the nation was prosperous, his loyal vice president was replacing him, and perhaps even more significant, the long Cold War with the Soviet Union seemed to be coming to an end. George H.W. Bush would lead the nation in a very different international context than any predecessor since World War II. In April 1989, just after Bush’s inauguration, the Communist government of Poland, with Gorbachev’s permission, legalized the prodemocracy Solidarity and agreed to free elections. In June, for the first time in history, a Communist government was voted out of office and yielded power peacefully to its non-Communist successor. That fall, Hungary followed the same course and ousted its Communist government. Demonstrations in East Germany led to a change in leadership, and on November 9, the Berlin Wall that had divided the city, and Europe, for almost 30 years came down. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, Berliners who had never met each other embraced and celebrated. Leaders of East and West Germany talked of unification, which came 2 years later. In December, Czechoslovakia inaugurated a non-Communist government.
What had begun as a conversation between two leaders in a house in Iceland in 1986 had become, by 1989, what the new president called “a new world order.” The end of the Cold War drastically changed U.S. foreign policy, and allowed

people to see the world differently. Tracing the changes in U.S. foreign policy and politics in the post-Cold War world as well as the domestic changes, especially those brought about by technology in the decade after the Cold War ended, is the focus of this chapter.
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION,
1989-1993__________________________________________ 1994 Explain the New World Order that George Bush described.
Few people came to the White House as well-prepared to manage the rapid changes in the international situation as George H.W. Bush. As a former U.S. Ambassador to China, former head of the CIA, and former vice president, he knew the key players and understood the context of events as well as anyone. Unlike his predecessor, Bush came to office with a 1996 prime interest in foreign policy. It was an expertise that might serve him well in the rapidly changing world of the 1990s. The United States was also changing, economically and technologically, but President Bush was less prepared to deal with some of the rapid domestic changes that were taking place, which in the end cost him a second term in office.	1998
Foreign Policy Between 1989 and 1993
Bush and his foreign policy team—Secretary of State James Baker, Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft (a retired Air Force general), and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair General Colin Powell—were initially skeptical of the agreements by which Reagan and Gorbachev had sought to end the Cold War, and 1999 they did not propose to reduce defense spending. However, the pace of international developments only accelerated after Bush took office. Bush maintained a hands-off policy toward the dissolution of Soviet control in Eastern Europe. He said that the United 2000 States did not want to “poke a stick in the eyes of Mr. Gorbachev. But he insisted, in spite of pleas by Gorbachev and European leaders, that Germany had the right to be united and that the new nation should be part of NATO. Bush showed less inclination to state a position when Lithuania declared independence in March 1990, leaving it to the Lithuanians and the Soviets to work out the terms of their own agreement.
