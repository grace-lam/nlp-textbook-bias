CONVENING A CONGRESS, INAUGURATING A PRESIDENT, ADOPTING A BILL OF RIGHTS
7.1
Jefferson defeats Adams for president
Analyze the first federal elections and the adoption of the Bill of Rights.
In one of its last acts under the Articles of Confederation, the outgoing Congress set the dates for elections for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and presidential electors to occur in early 1789. The Constitution left it to each state legislature to decide how to manage these elections. No one had conducted elections like these before, and it took time to work out the process.
Elections for members of the House were held in January and February of 1789. As permitted in the Constitution, different states had different rules for who could vote. Some House races were hotly contested, including the one in Virginia’s fifth district that pitted two future U.S. presidents, James Madison and James Monroe, against each other. Madison won and played a crucial role in the first Congress. State legislatures then elected the members of the U.S. Senate, as they would do until 1913. Presidential electors were chosen by different methods depending on the state, and they cast their ballots for the first president.
Congress and President Washington: Setting to Work
By early spring, the new Congress began to assemble in the nation’s temporary capital, New York City (the location that many of its residents hoped would become permanent). Congress was supposed to convene on March 4, but it was not until April that either house of Congress could muster a quorum—a majority of the total members, which was required to do business. Much business awaited. The Constitution required each house to set up its own rules of operation. The Senate had to confirm the election of the president. The Constitution also gave the new government the power to set and collect taxes. The need for a tax law was urgent: each day that Congress delayed, thousands of dollars went uncollected.
On April 14, Charles Thomson, the secretary of Congress, arrived at Mount Vernon to officially inform George Washington of what he already knew: he had been unanimously elected president of the United States by the 69 presidential electors who also elected John Adams as vice president though by a smaller vote. Washington quickly traveled to New York where he and Adams were formally inaugurated on April 30, 1789. He then set to work creating the executive branch of the federal government.
The 58-year-old George Washington had no precedents to guide him. An independent republic with an elected citizen at its head was an unprecedented development for the world of 1789. Some, led by Alexander Hamilton who loved British models, recommended that Washington establish a court similar to that of King George III. Others, including Vice President John Adams, recommended a more egalitarian approach. Washington steered a middle course, insisting on formal state dinners and fairly formal relationships with those who came to call on him, but avoiding a throne or robes of office. He was called simply “Mr. President” instead of “your Highness.” Although he was the only president never to live in the White House, he did help to design it, although African slaves did most of the work building it. While in office, he maintained a formal presidential residence in New York City and in Philadelphia when the capital moved there in 1790.
The Bill of Rights
On May 4,1789, only a month after the House of Representatives had begun its work, James Madison told the House that he would soon fulfill his promise and propose amendments to the Constitution. On June 8, he offered amendments that included line-by-line changes in the Constitution. Proposing amendments was easy. Getting them passed was not. Some of Madisons strongest partners in getting the Constitution adopted were neutral or hostile to amending it. President Washington, at Madisons request, made a brief reference to amendments in his inaugural address. Later, Washington said of the proposed amendments “Some of them, in my opinion, are importantly necessary, others, though of themselves (in my conception) not very essential, are necessary to quiet the fears of some respectable characters and well-meaning men.” It was hardly a ringing endorsement. On the other hand, some Federalists in Congress thought it was far too early to amend the Constitution, especially when other issues, like balancing the budget, were pressing.
During the ratification process, however, Madison had promised to add a Bill of Rights to the Constitution, guaranteeing citizens important rights under a federal government. Without a promise for those added rights, key states would not have ratified the Constitution. While he was determined to fulfill his promise, Madison also knew that Antifederalists sought more far-reaching changes, and he wanted to act faster than those opponents. Representative Iheodorick Bland, a close ally of Patrick Henry, proposed a second convention to consider “the defects of this Constitution.” If Congress did not act to quiet this movement, the whole constitutional structure could unravel.
Madison quickly abandoned his original proposal for new clauses to be included throughout the body of the Constitution and decided instead to propose amendments to be added at the end of the document. The House initially passed 17 amendments, but the Senate changed them, and on September 25, Congress sent 12 amendments to the states for ratification. It was fast work for a body that had not existed 6 months earlier. An amendment setting the size of the House was not ratified; neither was an amendment limiting Congressional pay (it was ratified finally in 1992). The other 10 amendments became the Bill of Rights, added to the Constitution in 1791 after three-fourths of the state legislatures approved them. The
Bill of Rights
The first 10 amendments to the Constitution passed by Congress in 1789 and ratified by the states in 1791.
first of these amendments said:
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
Other of the amendments included “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,” freedom from being required to house soldiers in private homes (a major grievance against the British before the Revolution), the right to be “secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,” the right to trial by jury, the right to a speedy trial, and limits on excessive bail.
Finally, the Tenth Amendment—perhaps most important to many Antifederalists, especially those who worried about federal intervention in the institution of slavery—limited the powers of the national government:
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.
The Methodist Church on John Street in New York City is the oldest Methodist Church in the United States. Since Methodist and Baptist churches never received public support in any of the former colonies, they were among the strongest supporters of the prohibition on any Congressional action to create a state church for the United States that was included in the Bill of Rights.

CREATING AN ECONOMY: ALEXANDER HAMILTON AND THE U.S. ECONOMIC SYSTEM____________________
Analyze the enduring argument begun by Hamilton's economic vision for the United States and the alternative vision of Jefferson and Madison.
7.2
President Washington faced difficult problems, many of them economic. The inability of the federal government under the Articles of Confederation to collect taxes meant that federal debts were not being paid and that the financial status of the United States was in serious trouble. The government could not afford an army sufficient to protect the frontier. Tensions with Britain were made worse because Britain had not withdrawn its troops from western forts as promised in the Treaty of Paris and because London merchants who were owed large sums from Americans were angry. Although the Continental Congress had adopted the dollar as the national currency in 1785, there was no official currency; Congress, state governments, and private banks had printed a variety of paper notes, all of which could be easily counterfeited, and the ease with which they were put into circulation led to inflation. In the new United States, as during much of the colonial era, people bought and sold with an amazing variety of paper notes and coins from around the world, especially Spanish gold and silver. Solving the financial crisis and regulating the currency was essential for national prosperity.
In the summer of 1789, Congress adopted a five percent customs tax on all imports into the United States, creating a solid financial footing for the new government. It also set up a system of federal courts and approved the establishment of four senior positions within the executive branch: secretaries of state, war, and the treasury, and an attorney general. These four officials became the first presidential cabinet.
Washington quickly appointed Thomas Jefferson, then U.S. Ambassador to Paris, as his secretary of state; General Henry Knox, his deputy in command throughout the Revolution, as secretary of war; and his friend, the former governor of Virginia, Edmund Randolph, as attorney general. But given the nations financial problems, the most important and powerful position would be secretary of the treasury, and to that office, Washington appointed New Yorker Alexander Hamilton. A brilliant and ruthless political infighter, Hamilton could handle the economic crisis better than anyone else, even if Washington also knew from bitter experience that he could never completely trust Hamilton, who had served as Washington’s chief aide during the Revolution and had sometimes gone behind his commander’s back or quarreled directly with him.
The Secretary of the Treasury's Key Role
On his first full day on the job, Secretary Hamilton negotiated a $50,000 loan from the Bank of New York to keep the new government solvent. He also set about creating a Customs Service to collect the five percent import tax that Congress had already passed, and he organized what would become the U.S. Coast Guard to be sure that imports were not smuggled into the country without being taxed. Hamilton had once said, I hate procrastination in business,” and he was not about to make a slow start on the new job. Ten days after his appointment, the House of Representatives asked him for a report on the public credit of the United States-the most pressing national issue m virtually everyone’s view-and gave him until January to prepare it.
182 Part III A New Birth of Freedom-Creating the United States of America J 754-1800
Debt and Taxes
Hamiltons Report Relative to a Provision for the Support of Public Credit was the foundation of the economic development of the new nation. Hamilton had read widely in philosophy and economics, as if preparing for the moment when he would be asked to design a new economic system. As he looked at the crushing debt that the nation faced from the Revolution—$54 million in federal debt and $25 million more in state debts—he knew that radical action was required. Few people, including foreign and domestic investors and foreign governments, trusted the new country’s ability to pay its bills. As a result, neither the state and federal governments nor private businesses could borrow money. The government could not finance desperately needed activities, including the creation of an army. Private businesses could not restart commerce, which had been mostly frozen since the Revolution. Revolutionary War veterans who had been paid in government promissory notes had sold them for as little as 15 cents on the dollar rather than trust a government that seemed untrustworthy to pay what it had promised. In this crisis, Hamilton saw only one solution. The federal government, he believed, needed to assume all of the Revolutionary War debt—state and federal— and promise to pay it all off, dollar for dollar, while establishing a tax policy that would show wary observers that the government would meet its obligations. “Credit is the entire thing,” Hamilton argued.
Not everyone in Congress agreed. To Hamilton’s surprise, his close ally in the fight over adopting the Constitution, James Madison, led the opposition to debt assumption in the House, and more quietly, Secretary of State Jefferson led similar opposition within the administration. States like Virginia and North Carolina that had paid off most of their own war debts were unhappy with the idea that they would pay taxes to cover the debts of what they considered less responsible states like Massachusetts and South Carolina. Veterans who had sold their government promissory notes at highly depreciated rates during the 1780s to eat and live were appalled that the civilian speculators to whom they had sold them would get rich on the 100 percent payment of the debt. And for those who shared Jefferson’s view of a democratic nation of small farmers, Hamilton’s plan created a national government that was too big, would raise too much in taxes, sustain a standing army, and shift power from farmers to urban and commercial interests. They would have none of it.
In the spring of 1790, the House, led by Madison, rejected Hamilton’s proposals each of four times he submitted it. Ever the wily politician, Hamilton sought a compromise and Secretary of State Jefferson made it happen. Many years later, Jefferson told the story of how he hosted a dinner at his home in New York at which he, Madison, and Hamilton struck a deal by which each one got something that he considered important. Hamilton wanted New York City, his home and the nation’s commercial center, to be the permanent U.S. capital. But others—especially Jefferson and Madison—wanted to locate the capital further south. They disliked the difficult travel to New York, and they also disliked urban life. They feared that a northern capital would fuel northern antislavery tendencies in Congress. Not incidentally, Madison, like George Washington, owned land on the Potomac River that would become more valuable if the capital were nearby. If Hamilton would agree to support Jefferson and Madison on the location of the capital, then the two Virginians would support Hamilton’s economic plan.
In July, Congress made the compromise official. Philadelphia, not New York, was designated as the new temporary capital and the law also stipulated that a 10-square-mile site on the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia should become the nation’s permanent capital. They gave President Washington a free hand to select the specific site and plan the new center of government. Congress also passed Hamilton’s financial plan, including the assumption of state debts by the federal government. Henceforth, the new nation would have a government on a solid financial footing with a guaranteed credit rating, just as Hamilton wanted.
This painting of Alexander Hamilton (ca. 1804) was done by the artist John Trumbull after Hamilton had left office. Hamilton's fiscal program was controversial from the beginning but it launched the nation's economy in a commercial direction and also created political division that continued for decades in the United States.

The compromise solved the immediate issues, but the split on economic policy would lead to the creation of two hostile political parties—which came to be known as the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans (known at first as Antifederalists)— that would dominate the nation’s politics for the next decade. In the first years of the new government, those who supported the Constitution called themselves Federalists (wanting a strong federal government), and those opposed to the adoption of the Constitution and then Hamiltons interpretation of it were happy to be known simply as Antifederalists. But as the battle over Hamilton’s plans intensified, those in the government and the newspapers who supported Madison’s and Jefferson’s opposition began to call themselves Democratic-Republicans, claiming that they, not those following Hamilton, were the true defenders of the republic. Most everyone, including Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison, and especially Washington, abhorred the idea of opposing political parties, but such parties were beginning to form before Washington finished his first term in office, though no one yet called them that.
To a degree, the political divisions reflected a sectional split. Supporting Hamilton were bankers in New York and Philadelphia as well as merchants, especially those engaged in seagoing trade based in Boston or other ports. Those tending to support the Democratic-Republican cause included southern plantation owners, who always worried that the new government would move against slavery and who saw little value in banks and commercial development; farmers, ranging from supporters of Daniel Shays in Massachusetts to farmers in the backwoods of Kentucky; and small-town merchants who were less dependent on international credit. Supporters of each side also had their own newspaper. John Fenno had launched the Gazette of the United States in 1789 to support the Federalist cause. Two years later, Madison and Jefferson convinced Philip Freneau to launch the staunchly Antifederalist National Gazette. To support that paper, Jefferson, to his later embarrassment, also put Freneau on the federal payroll as an official of the State Department. The lines between two groups were growing stronger.
The First Bank of the United States
Once he had resolved the debt issue, Hamilton’s next move widened the divide between those who, like him, wanted an activist government and a robust commercial economy and those who preferred Jefferson’s vision of an agrarian nation made up of small independent farmers with a very modest national government. In December 1790,
Bank of the United States	Hamilton submitted another report to Congress that called for creating a Bank of

to be part of Britain. He wanted to use Britain’s economic model to build a nation that would become as powerful as Britain. Achieving that vision meant creating a federal bank that would manage the economy and fund a strong government, as Britain’s bank did for that country. As with the debt, not everyone agreed.
The Bank of England was a joint public-private venture. Most of its shareholders were private investors, but it played a key role in guaranteeing and repaying Britain’s public debt, and its paper bank notes were accepted as official currency in Britain. Hamilton did not trust Congress or the states to issue paper currency. He feared—all too realistically, given what had happened during the Revolution—that Congress and the states would solve financial problems by printing more currency and, thus, quickly debase its value and re-create the inflation that the nation faced in the 1790s. But Hamilton was confident that no investors would risk their funds by allowing more currency to circulate than they could afford to redeem. He was anxious to have those Americans who had funds to invest become strongly attached to the new government. Currency from a semiprivate bank could be trusted because the bank would have to redeem its paper currency in gold or silver. Hamilton believed the United States could have a stable currency that everyone trusted if the Bank of the United States were chartered.
Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
The 1799 building that was designed for the First Bank of the United States in Philadelphia reflected the solid structure and grand hopes that Hamilton had for his bank.
A central bank could also make loans, thus expanding the amount of credit available. With resources backed by both private investors and government guarantees, the bank could ease the credit squeeze and stimulate commerce and trade. Businesses could get loans. Investment in new enterprises could begin. Much of the bank’s financing would also be promissory notes from the government itself—notes that Hamilton had just guaranteed would maintain their full value.
For southern plantation owners like Jefferson and Madison, the bank plan was much worse than the plan to assume all debt for the Revolutionary War. The bank plan would centralize power in the big northern cities—Philadelphia, New York, and Boston—where the nation’s largest banks were. Jefferson did not like cities. He preferred small rural communities, which he believed were far more democratic places. He said, “I think our governments will remain virtuous for many centuries as long as they are chiefly agricultural.” And, he continued, when people “get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, they will become corrupt as in Europe.” In addition, Jefferson, like most Democratic-Republicans of his day, did not like banks. The battle over the Bank of the United States was a key battle in a war between those who wanted an urban commercial nation and those who wanted a nation based on independent farmers. It would not be the last such battle.
Jefferson feared that banks would keep the poor in poverty and enrich those who were already wealthy through ill-gotten gains based on speculation rather than hard work. For most farmers, who were always in debt given their need to buy seed and fertilizer before they could plant and harvest a crop, banks were the distant institutions that hounded them to repay loans. For Jefferson and Madison, and even for John Adams, the thought that the government they had worked so hard to create was now about to create a bank was galling. Although Hamilton and Madison had both helped write and defend the Constitution, they now parted company forever over their interpretation of it.
Chapter 7 Practicing Democracy 185
1A
Despite the opposition of some of the nation’s most eloquent leaders, the bank bill sailed through Congress. Almost all northern representatives voted for it, and almost all southern ones against it. The sectional lines, and the lines between the Federalist and Democratic-Republican factions (they were not yet political parties) were clearly emerging.
Once the bill passed both houses of Congress, Washington had to decide whether to sign it. For Madison, who had been operating as Washington’s key spokesperson in Congress, the bank was an unconstitutional extension of federal power, and he argued privately and persuasively that Washington should veto the bill. Washington then turned to his cabinet for advice. Attorney General Randolph and Secretary of State Jefferson both urged a veto. The Tenth Amendment was clear, they said, that anything not mentioned in the Constitution was left to the states, and the Constitution certainly did not authorize a federal bank. For Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton, however, the bank was essential, and the Constitution, he said, gave Congress the authority to do everything “necessary and proper” for the smooth functioning of the nation. He warned Washington that if the national government did not invoke the “necessary and proper clause,” then Americans would become “a people governed without government ” Washington signed the bill in February 1791, and the United States now had a bank and deeper political divisions than previously imagined.
After the bank bill, Hamilton proposed a federal mint to create uniform coins for use throughout the country. For almost 20 years after the Revolution, people had used foreign coins. Hamilton wanted U.S. coins based on the U.S. dollar, not the British pound. It was not a controversial proposal, and the federal mint was soon established. With the mint in place, Hamilton resigned as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795, and Washington appointed Oliver Wolcott in his place. Though he remained a close presidential advisor until the end of Washington’s term, Hamilton preferred to make money as a private citizen.
Hamilton's Commercial Nation vs. Jefferson's Agrarian Vision
Hamilton’s last major report to Congress was his Report on Manufactures. Unlike the earlier reports, this one was not a plea for immediate legislation, but rather a blueprint for the future of the nation as Hamilton saw it. Where Jefferson wanted an agrarian nation that exported raw materials, Hamilton wanted a more complete economy within the United States. He, too, saw farming as the backbone of the economy, but he also wanted to support factories that would create finished goods from the products of the fields, forests, and mines for both domestic consumption and export. In addition, he wanted the nation to make everything its military might need, from uniforms to gunpowder and warships.
Hamilton was a harsh critic of slavery, but although he did not mention slavery in his Report on Manufactures, the document was suffused with what 70 years later a new Republican Party would call “free labor.” Hamilton’s vision promoted open immigration. Immigrants from Europe would work in the emerging factories, Hamilton said, and a plentiful supply of new workers would keep wages low and factories profitable for their owners. He had no fear of child labor either, noting, in general, women and children are rendered more useful, and the latter more early useful, by manufacturing establishments than they would otherwise be.”

Hamilton wanted a federal government that would shape the nation’s economy rather than leave economic development to individuals. He believed that higher tariffs should protect new industries and that government incentives should help launch those ventures when private investment was not sufficient. He saw strong patent protection as essential to invention. Moreover, he wanted to build a network of roads and canals to help commerce flow.
Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
These ideas frightened Jefferson and Madison. At one point, Jefferson told Washington that he thought his treasury secretary was expanding the “general welfare” clause of the Constitution to give Congress the authority to regulate every aspect of the nation s economy. Jefferson would continue to worry, especially as Washington sided with his treasury secretary more often than not.
Although Hamilton was a brilliant if sometimes unscrupulous leader, not all of his ideas were his alone. He was regularly looking to Europe, especially Britain, for ideas, and there were many economic ideas ready for export. Hamilton greatly admired the British industrialists who were creating mechanized production on a scale never seen before. He was also influenced by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith whose book, Wealth of Nations, was published in 1776.
In the economic world that Smith described, wealth was generated, not by the simple ownership of things—land or gold or products—but, rather, by the free trade of goods and services and by competition to expand trade. As people competed to make a profit on their transactions, they increased the circulation of money, lowered the cost of goods, and created general prosperity—the wealth of nations and of individuals. Competition, Smith said, was the key to wealth. Thus he wrote, “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their self-interest.” As that self-interest is satisfied through competition, there is more meat, beer, and bread at lower cost available for everyone while the butcher, brewer, and baker live well. For Smith, who called Britain “a nation of shopkeepers,” it was the shopkeepers and manufacturers and traders, not the hoarders of gold and silver, who made wealth.

THINKING HISTORICALLY
Hamilton vs. Jefferson
In his 1791 Report on Manufactures, Alexander Hamilton defended "the expediency of encouraging manufacturers in the United States."Contrast!ng farming with manufacturing, he noted:
labour employed in Agriculture is in a great measure periodical and occasional, depending on seasons, liable to various and long intermissions; while that occupied in many manufactures is constant and regular, extending through the year, embracing in some instances night as well as day.
Hamilton knew that not everyone agreed with him. Some believed that it was wrong to use the government "to accelerate the growth of manufactures." Critics, he knew, liked a world in which, "the less independent condition of an artisan can be exchanged for the more independent condition of a farmer.
Hamilton's critics, led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, feared an activist government and thought his plans were an antidemocratic effort to strengthen the power of the financial elite and their political allies. Where Hamilton wanted the federal government to foster manufacturing and commerce, Jefferson and
his supporters wanted a passive federal government that stayed out of people's way. While still secretary of state, Jefferson wrote, "Hamilton's financial system.. .had two objects; 1 st, as a puzzle to exclude popular understanding and inquiry, 2nd, as a machine for the corruption of the legislature." Jefferson believed that independent farmers were far more likely to maintain a strong democratic government than paid employees, who, in giving up their economic freedom, would soon also give up their political freedom. He saw Hamilton's plan as a way to confuse the true agents of democracy. This debate from the 1790s is still alive today.

Smith’s book was a direct attack on the earlier ideas of mercantilism that saw wealth as a matter of getting and hoarding wealth. In the new world of a capitalist system or a market economy where commerce and trade were most significant, Great Britain, with its growing factories and its Royal Navy controlling the oceans, was destined to great wealth. As Smith was trying to describe the economic system in Great Britain, Hamilton was trying with surprising success, in spite of the opposition, to duplicate the system in the United States.

SETTING THE PACE: THE WASHINGTON ADMINISTRATION__________________________
Explain the precedents set by George Washington's presidential administration.
While President Washington tended to leave economic policy to his secretary of the treasury, he was far from a passive bystander during his 8 years in office. Although economic issues were the top priority, Washington also faced many others. Having spent most of his adult life in public service, Washington knew how fragile the new republic was. The votes to adopt the new Constitution had been close in several states, and powerful leaders, including Patrick Henry in Virginia and John Hancock in Massachusetts, would have been happy to return to a system in which the states were supreme and the national government only a weak federation. Many rural Americans, including the poor white farmers who made up most of the citizens, distrusted all governments and felt they got little benefit from them while the tax on imports raised the cost of necessities. An obscure Massachusetts farmer, William Manning, who had fought at the battle of Concord, now wrote a pamphlet, The Key of Liberty, in which he argued that “friends to liberty and free government” needed to be watchful of the “few” who were dominating the new administration and needed to be prevented from destroying “free government” and “tyrannizing over” the people. While farmers like Manning complained, Britain was alert, maneuvering in military and diplomatic actions along the borders of the fledgling republic, prepared to reopen hostilities and, indeed, retake the newly independent nation.
Washington was especially worried that the new nation would lose the land west of the 13 original states. Although Britain had ceded all its claims to land east of the Mississippi River to the United States, Indians who lived in that huge territory had not agreed, and when Washington took office, the tribes were considerably stronger than the U.S. Army. In addition, the British had not removed all of their forces from forts in that area, even though they had agreed to at the end of the Revolution. The British saw the Indians as a useful instrument to help them reignite a war that would end American independence and return the country to the empire.
Many western whites were so fed up with the lack of protection by the federal government that there was talk of forming a separate western nation. Between 1785 and 1788, John Sevier led settlers in the western counties of North Carolina—now the	j
state of Tennessee—to form a state they called Franklin, or sometimes, the Republic	’
of Franklin. They were desperate for support in their battles with local Cherokee and Chickasaw. When their petition to become a state failed, they virtually governed themselves as an independent nation. Sensing an opportunity, Spanish authorities offered financial support to the settlers if they would affiliate with Spain rather than the United States, but North Carolina authorities successfully reasserted authority in the region. When he became president in 1789, Washington wanted to be sure there were no similar interests in independence or foreign alliances in the western lands claimed by the United States.
188 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
As one of his first moves after taking office, Washington set out on a series of grand tours of the United States. He meant to see and be seen with the citizens of the country. People loved seeing in person this war hero, now president, and the tours were an important effort to solidify the country behind the president and the constitution. A lifelong soldier, Washington also played a major role in the wars between the United States government and the Native American tribes that dominated the Ohio region when he came to office. In spite of a series of defeats for the U.S. Army, Washington kept pressing his case and eventually defeated the tribes that had long inhabited the Ohio River Valley. When Hamilton’s efforts to raise taxes created an armed uprising of farmers along the Pennsylvania frontier—the so-called Whiskey Rebellion— Washington himself took charge of the army that put down the rebellion but also treated the rebels far more leniently than some like Alexander Hamilton wanted. Finally, in his second term in office, Washington turned most of his attention to foreign policy, specifically the growing tension between revolutionary France and the United States, which continued even after he left office.
The President Tours the Nation
To use his personal prestige to consolidate public support for the new government, Washington went on tours of the nation, not an easy task at a time when roads were poor and horses and carriages were the only means of transport once one left the waterways.

fn 1790, as part of one of his national tours, Washington visited Newport, Rhode Island, and its Touro Synagogue, the oldest synagogue in the United States. Moses Seixas, speaking for the congregation, wrote to Washington, thanking him for the visit. Washington responded with a statement of his commitment to religious freedom. In a nation that was still sorting out the meaning of democracy, and at a time before the First Amendment was added to the Constitution, Washington's letter was an important statement of American freedom.

Permit the children of the stock of Abraham to approach you with the most cordial affection and esteem for your person and merits—and to join with our fellow citizens in welcoming you to Newport....Deprived as we heretofore have been of the invaluable rights of free Citizens, we now with a deep sense of gratitude to the Almighty disposer of all events behold a Government, erected by the Majesty of the People a Government, which to bigotry gives no sanction, to persecution no assistance but generously affording to al, Liberty of conscience, and immunities of Citizenship: deeming every one, of whatever Nation, tongue, or language equal parts of the great governmental Machine....
Letter from G. Washington to the Hebrew
Congregation in Newport Rhode Island
While I receive, with much satisfaction, your Address replete with expressions of affection and esteem, I rejoice in the
opportunity of assuring you, that I shall always retain a grateful remembrance of the cordial welcome I experienced in my visit to Newport....The Citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.

The battles between the U.S. military and a confederation of tribes that were fought between 1785 and 1795 were sometimes referred to as
the Northwest Indian War, or Little Turtle's War, in recognition of the central role of the Miami leader, Little Turtle, in the early defeats of the U.S. forces.
Nevertheless, between 1789 and 1791, he rode by carriage and horseback from New York through much of New England and across the South. The trip allowed him to address important issues such as religious freedom, hear from citizens, and personalize a distant national government. Welcoming the nations greatest hero and leader was the social event of the season for these small-town residents, and for many it consolidated the sense of belonging to one nation. Privately, Washington sometimes complained about the accommodations, but he was convinced that his speeches and meetings had done much to build good will and support for the nation and his administration. Indian Wars: Building the U.S. Army
Washington was deeply concerned about how to handle the frontier Indian tribes. He blamed much of the problem on the “turbulence and disorderly conduct” of settlers who would not wait for permission or protection to enter the new territories but then who complained bitterly when Indians attacked them. Still, he needed to act with caution because he wanted these new settlers to be loyal citizens despite his frustration with them. On a personal level, he himself, like many members of Congress, had speculated in western lands and stood to make money if the land could actually be opened to white settlement. But given the poverty of the federal government-including only 600 soldiers in the army when Washington became president—the president hardly commanded a force that could make much of a difference in the vast western territory.
Ihe chief representative of the U.S. government on the western frontier, Arthur St. Clair, was both the appointed governor of what were then the Northwest Territories of the United States—lands Indians claimed—and a major general in the army. Congress had ordered him to end all Indian titles to the lands between the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. But St. Clair lacked the resources to do his job. His strategy, as he wrote to Washington, was to divide and conquer—to seek many treaties with individual tribes rather than one overall treaty with all the tribes. But this strategy did not go well. In 1789, just before Washington’s inauguration, St. Clair negotiated several treaties with one group of Indian leaders at Fort Harmar, but most other leaders and most tribes rejected these treaties, making them virtually useless.
In 1790, Washington asked Congress to expand the army so it could force the tribes of the Ohio region to “sue for peace before a blow is struck at them.” Congress agreed to expand the army to 1,000 men and added 1,500 state militia from Kentucky, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. This increased force, however, was still not strong enough to win the victories the president thought essential.
In September 1790, 1,450 troops under General Josiah Harmar marched into the territory of the Miami and Shawnee to destroy villages and crops as a show of force that might stop the attacks on frontier settlements. In October, Harmar’s army was attacked by Shawnees, Miamis, and Pottawattamies, and 500 of the Americans were killed before the rest retreated. After this defeat, attacks on white settlements continued, and attempts at negotiating peace failed. Although some Indians, led by a Seneca named Cornplanter, sought to make a separate peace for their tribes, most others rejected the government’s proposed treaties.
In 1791, President Washington ordered a new attack. General St. Clair himself led 2,000 troops in a direct assault on the Miamis on the Wabash River in what is now Indiana. On November 4, 1791, 1,500 Indians from several tribes led by Mishikinakwa—or Little Turtle—of the Miami and Blue Jacket of the Shawnee killed over 500 troops and most of the expedition’s female camp followers. Washington was shocked that St. Clair had allowed his army “to be cut to pieces, hacked, butchered, tomahawked,” and relieved St. Clair of his command. As 1792 began, most of the area the United States called its Northwest Territory was in Indian hands.
190 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
Throughout 1792, the Washington administration and many of the Indians tried to negotiate. In June 1792, Joseph Brant, the Mohawk leader who had earlier traveled to London to meet with King George III, went to Philadelphia and met with President Washington, becoming one of the few people to meet with both national leaders. The meeting with Washington was cordial but did not lead to any final agreements, and Brant continued to strengthen his ties with Britain. Brant and most of the Iroquois, Shawnee, and Miami leaders were determined to allow no white settlement west of the Ohio River and demanded that the United States abandon its forts in that territory. But white settlers continued to move across the Ohio River. They and their government wanted more land. Some of the negotiations were good faith efforts. Some were a sham. All failed.
While some in Congress and the press argued for peace and an end to the waste of money and lives in western military campaigns, Washington called for a full-scale war on the Indians. Secretary of War Knox began to create a truly professional army of 5,000 men. In late 1793, he launched a third military campaign in the Northwest Territory.
In place of the disgraced St. Clair, Washington appointed Anthony Wayne (known as “Mad” Anthony Wayne) as major general of the U.S. Army. Wayne trained his army, and during the winter of 1793-1794, they built a new base, Fort Recovery, on the site of St. Clair’s defeat. In August 1794, Wayne’s army defeated a large Indian force led by the Shawnee Blue Jacket at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, near present-day Toledo, Ohio. After fierce fighting among twisted tree limbs and trunks, the Indians broke ranks and retreated. British forces at the nearby Fort Miami did not support their Indian allies, and Wayne decided not to attack the British fort (see Map 7-1).
A year later, the Treaty of Greenville ended major hostilities between Indians and whites in the future states of Ohio and Indiana. The treaty established Indian reserves
Treaty of Greenville
A treaty agreed to in 1795 in which Native Americans in the Northwest Territory were forced to cede most of the present states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin to the United States.

MAP 7-1 Indian Removals and Resistance,
1790-1814. Between the end of the Revolution in 1783 and the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, there was almost constant warfare between Native American tribes and the U.S. Army in the Northwest Territory and further battles well into the 1800s elsewhere in what was then the West of the country.
Chapter 7 Practicing Democracy 191
After a series of Native American victories, the U.S. Army's victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794
brought organized resistance to an end. A year later, in 1795, defeated tribal leaders agreed to the Treaty of Greenville, ceding most of the land of the Northwest to white settlement. This picture shows Little Turtle talking with General Anthony Wayne.
while ceding most of the remaining lands to white settlers. For the tribes of the Northwest, the Battle of Fallen Timbers and the Treaty of Greenville were the end of their control of the territory. The defeated Indian leader Little Turtle was blunt, telling General Anthony Wayne, “You have pointed out to us the boundary line between the Indians and the United States, but I now take the liberty to inform you, that the line cuts off from the Indians a large portion of the country, which has been enjoyed by my forefathers from time immemorial, without molestation or dispute.” But after Fallen Timbers there was little that the tribal leaders could do. Many Indians moved to British Canada or further west into the Louisiana Territory, still formally controlled by Spain. Although groups of Indians and settlers continued minor skirmishes for another 20 years, 1795 was the end of the Indian Wars in the Ohio region. Efforts to survey settlements and create local governments came quickly.
Washington’s goals for the Northwest Territory and for dealing with the Indians were mostly accomplished. White settlers got the lands they wanted, the British lost their most powerful ally in the region, and the power and prestige of the U.S. Army were enhanced. Settlement continued long after Washington left office, and Ohio was admitted as a state in 1803. Indiana followed in 1816, Illinois in 1818, but Michigan and Wisconsin much later in 1837 and 1848, respectively.
Whiskey Tax, Whiskey Rebellion
When a compromise by Hamilton, fefferson, and Madison led Congress to pass Hamiltons economic plan in 1782, it solved one set of problems but created new ones. Paying off the debt required more income for the federal government than the customs tax alone could raise. After considering several options, Hamilton hit on the idea of taxing whiskey. If there were to be new taxes, a tax on whiskey seemed less undesirable than most options. Even Hamiltons long-time opponent James Madison supported it as a way to increase “sobriety and thereby prevent disease and untimely deaths.” Like the “sin taxes” of later generations, the tax on whiskey seemed an easy call. However, what seemed easy in New York and Philadelphia was seen by farmers in western Pennsylvania as a direct attack on their livelihood.
Western Pennsylvania and neighboring parts of Appalachia had been settled long before the Revolution, primarily by Scots-Irish Presbyterians who were willing to
192 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
fight Indians for land and who wanted to maintain their culture, including their love for whiskey. Turning corn, their staple crop, into whiskey was also the best way to get the crop to market. A farmer could distill corn into whiskey at home and then transport a keg, or several kegs, on a horse or mule over the mountains and sell the liquid corn at $16 a keg in East Coast markets, making a considerable profit. It was much easier and more profitable than trying to transport raw corn over the mountains, and between 1783 and 1795 when Spain closed the port of New Orleans to American goods, transporting any products down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers was not an option.
Hamilton’s tax, however, ate up the profit. Since the tax was applied uniformly to all producers, small producers of whiskey ended up paying a higher percentage of their income than did those producing larger amounts. Moreover, the tax singled out these whiskey-making farmers and not others such as land speculators (of which Washington was one). Western farmers complained that the tax discriminated against them, and it did. They were already angry. Most frontier farmers had opposed adopting the Constitution when it was being debated in 1787 and 1788. Now only a few years later, the first administration elected under that document wanted to destroy their best hope of economic prosperity. They rebelled.
The Whiskey Rebellion began with modest protests. The Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia legislatures passed resolutions opposing the tax. When these actions were not heeded by the administration, protests escalated quickly. Tax collectors were shot at, tarred and feathered, or beaten and threatened with scalping. In a mass meeting in Pittsburgh, rebels agreed to fight for the repeal of the tax and to treat tax collectors with the “contempt they deserve.” In 1793 and 1794, no federal taxes were collected in Kentucky or Pennsylvania’s western counties. A convention of more than 200 farmers at Parkinson’s Ferry debated armed resistance to the national government. In 1794, a federal marshal, David Lennox, and John Neville, a friend of Washington’s from the Revolution, were attacked by armed men when they tried to collect the tax. Neville’s house was burned, and he and his family barely escaped. On August 1, 6,000 rebels met outside of Pittsburgh and, modeling their behavior on revolutionaries in France, created a Committee of Public Safety, erected a guillotine, and made plans to attack the government garrison at Pittsburgh to gain weapons.
Hamilton advised Washington to “exert the full force of the Law against Offenders.” But Washington worried about losing the westerners’ allegiance to the United States. Throughout 1792 and 1793, he sought to negotiate with the whiskey makers. Washington’s overtures were seen as weakness by some of the Whiskey Rebels. Farmers who paid the tax were attacked and their stills destroyed.
Whiskey Rebellion
Armed uprising in 1794 by farmers in western Pennsylvania who attempted to prevent the collection of the excise tax on whiskey.
Western farmers who opposed the whiskey tax turned to increasingly violent means of resistance, including tarring and feathering U.S. tax agents as others had done to British tax agents before the Revolution.
Chapter 7 Practicing Democracy 193
7.3

By the summer of 1794, as the riots spread and after the attack on Neville, Washington had had enough. He saw the attacks on federal officials and the refusal to pay the taxes as part of a plot to overthrow the Constitution. He decided to act.
Given the size of the insurgency, Washington called for 12,000 troops to be drawn from the militias of New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia. The president himself took command of the force and, with Hamilton at his side, marched across Pennsylvania. While Hamilton promised that every rebel they caught would be “skewered, shot, or hanged on the first tree,” Washington remained “grave, distant, and austere.”
In the end, the sheer size of Washington’s army frightened the rebels and ended the rebellion. Most of the rebel farmers either accepted Washington’s offer of amnesty if they would swear loyalty to the United States or melted away into the woods and hollows. The army arrested 150 rebel leaders, but only two were convicted of treason, and Washington pardoned both of them. But the back of the rebellion had been broken. Federal authority—loved by some, hated by others—was supreme.
The French Revolution Comes to America
News and ideas moved slowly in the 1700s. People had to wait weeks to hear about ! developments in another state and months to hear about foreign events. Yet to a surprising degree, Americans in the 1790s were well informed about and influenced by developments in Europe, most of all by the French Revolution about which most Americans had strong opinions.
If much of Washington’s first term was taken up with economic matters and Indian wars, his second term (1793-1797) was dominated by the French Revolution (Table 7-1). Indeed, if revolution had not erupted in France, Washington might have served only one term and retired as he wanted to do.

194 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
By 1792, Washington believed that he had stabilized the country and would have been happy to retire. However, both Hamilton and Jefferson, by then bitter enemies, told Washington that the country still needed him, in part because each saw Washington as a buffer against the other’s policies. Most of their followers agreed. The most powerful argument for a second term, however, was Washington’s realization that revolutionary France would soon be at war with Austria and Britain, and that war would make American diplomacy much more difficult. He could not walk away from what he saw as a coming foreign policy crisis even as he insisted “at my age, the love of retirement grows every day more & more powerful.” His personal popularity exceeded any disagreement with his policies, and he was reelected unanimously.
When word of the European war reached Philadelphia in the spring of 1792, the Washington administration issued a formal Proclamation of Neutrality. Where Washington had seemed to favor Hamilton in economic matters, he favored Jefferson—and Jefferson’s successor Edmund Randolph—on foreign policy. When France’s revolutionary government asked for America to pay off debt from the Revolutionary War earlier than negotiated, Washington agreed. When the French announced plans to send a new ambassador, just after the execution of King Louis XVI in January 1793, Washington agreed to receive him. Washington was determined to maintain neutrality. He would not let Hamilton’s pro-British views draw him into a war, much as he disliked some of the news from France.
However, the new French ambassador, Edmond-Charles Genet—Citizen Genet as he was called, using the title that every person in France adopted if they wanted to keep their head—was as undiplomatic as a diplomat could be. He landed in Charleston, South Carolina, and immediately began commissioning American vessels to attack British shipping in direct violation of Washington’s neutrality policies. He also purchased munitions for France and enlisted volunteers to attack Spanish Florida. Then he went to Philadelphia to meet the president.
Washington had long mastered the art of showing icy displeasure. Having heard about Genet’s actions in Charleston, he met Genet with great formality, standing under a picture of Louis XVI, America’s ally during its Revolution, whom Genet’s government had just executed. In the nation’s capital of Philadelphia, Genet continued to raise arms for privateers to attack the British and recruit soldiers from Kentucky to attack Florida. Washington then demanded that the French government recall Genet, which it did early in 1794. (Fearing execution if he returned to France, Genet then asked for asylum and settled in New York as a private citizen.) But in Genet’s brief tenure as ambassador, the Citizen Genet Affair, as it came to be called, did lasting harm, inspiring hostility toward France among President Washington, Vice President John Adams, and other officials, while arousing more enthusiasm for the French Revolution among some Americans.
While Washington found it easy to dismiss Citizen Genet, he could not as easily dismiss Americans’ support for the French Revolution. In the first years of the revolution in France, most Americans strongly supported developments in the country’s oldest ally. When French citizens stormed the Bastille prison in July 1789, Lafayette, who had fought with Washington during the Revolution, sent the keys to the former prison to the president. Conservative Federalists joined with staunch Antifederalists in celebrating the emergence of a new constitutional state in Europe.
Some Federalists soon began to have doubts about the French Revolution, however. For those who worried that deference and hierarchy were disappearing all too fast in the United States, news of riots and killings in France were terrifying. For the emerging republican movement, however, the news from France was most encouraging. Thomas Jefferson never stopped believing that the revolution was a grand moment in history, even if he was uncomfortable with what he viewed as its excesses. Once Britain joined the war against revolutionary France, many Americans sided with France despite official neutrality.

Chapter 7 Practicing Democracy 195

Democratic-Republican Societies supporting the French Revolution sprang up across the United States. The first society was established in Philadelphia, but before long there were dozens, from Maine to South Carolina and from coastal cities to backcountry hamlets. These grassroots societies were more radical than anything even Jefferson was comfortable with. Some of those who joined the Democratic-Republican Societies were farmers who were angry with the federal government and ready for some revolutionary activity of their own. But the largest societies were in East Coast cities, where anti-British sentiment still ran deep. There, small-time merchants and manufacturers, mechanics, and other citizens were angry at the arrogance of an older, Federalist aristocracy and anxious to make their own place in the new nation. Members of these societies had great hopes for the ideals—if not all the tactics and the bloodshed—of the French Revolution and wanted to defend it. Not accidentally, most of the members of these societies also disliked Hamilton’s economic policies as well as the expanding power of the federal government and supported the Jeffersonian opposition in elections, even if the Democratic-Republican leaders in Congress kept their distance from them.
Regardless of differences, the president was generally considered above politics, so dissenters usually avoided direct criticisms of Washington himself. Even so, the Democratic-Republican Societies became bastions of hostility to many of his policies and closest allies. If the birth of the two-party system can be traced to the split between Hamilton and Jefferson over economic issues, then the deep divides over the revolution in France solidified the organization of the Federalists and the Democratic-Republican Societies and inspired the creation of the Democratic-Republican Party in the United States (see Table 7-2). The Federalists were pro-British and wanted a strong federal government and army as well as economic policies that supported commercial development. The Democratic-Republicans were pro-French and wanted a small federal government, more independence for the states and individuals, less commercial development, and more focus on independent farmers. Ironically, given all the republican talk of liberty and equality, the groups associated with Jefferson were also much more sympathetic to slavery. Many among the Democratic-Republicans saw states’ rights as a vehicle for protecting slavery. By contrast, the Federalists tended to see slavery as morally wrong and harmful to the nation’s commercial development.
Washington, who hated the very idea of permanent factions or parties, tried hard to stay “above the fray” and unite the factions. For a time he succeeded, which explains part of the reason he was unanimously reelected in 1792, but by the end of

his second term in office in 1797 more people were coming to see him as another Federalist leader. If he had run for a third term—something he had no intention of doing—the election would certainly not have been unanimous, though it is difficult to imagine a person of his enormous popularity being defeated.
U.S. anger at Britain was not fueled only by memories of 1776. In the 1790s, British soldiers still held Fort Detroit and Fort Niagara (near present-day Buffalo) in violation of the Treaty of Paris. In the summer of 1793, fearing that American neutrality was a cover for selling American grain to all sides in the European war, the British government issued Orders in Council (orders from the King through his Privy Council— the equivalent of Executive Orders in the United States) that banned all American commercial links with France or the French Caribbean islands. By 1794, the Royal Navy had taken 400 merchant sailors prisoner. Farmers could not sell their wheat, and dockworkers had no jobs. There were growing calls for war with Britain, which might help France, rid the frontier of the British, and end the restrictions on shipping. Washington, however, was determined to avoid war. He sent Chief Justice John Jay, who had been foreign secretary under the Articles of Confederation, to London to resolve the problems. For a short moment, Jay’s appointment as U.S. representative to London quieted the calls for war.
But the treaty Jay negotiated with Britain late in 1794 accomplished little of what Washington wanted. Britain did agree to pay compensation for its attacks on shipping since 1793, but not to end the ban on neutral shipping to France or to pay compensation for earlier American losses. While Britain also promised again to remove its troops from the Mississippi Valley, it had been ignoring its own promises to do so for a decade, and there was little reason to assume that it would now change policy. The most Jay could say of the treaty he had negotiated was “It breaks the ice.” Washington was bitterly disappointed that Jay had not accomplished more but sent Jay’s Treaty to the Senate for ratification anyway. The Senate vote in 1795 showed the growing divisions in the country. All 20 Senators identified with the Federalists in the Senate voted for the treaty, and all 10 associated with the Democratic-Republicans voted against it. The public attacks against Washington, which had been muted up to this point—in part because of his personal popularity and in part because many believed the president should be above attack—now became much louder.
In the final year of the Washington administration, one significant diplomatic victory helped to balance out the previous controversies. While Jay had been in London, Washington had sent Thomas Pinckney to Madrid. Where Jay had failed, Pinckney’s Treaty succeeded beyond expectations. Worrying that Britain and the United States might settle their differences at Spain’s expense, the Spanish agreed to a treaty that pushed the northern border of Florida farther south and westward to the Mississippi and, far more important, opened the Mississippi River and the port of New Orleans to U.S. commerce. Access to New Orleans was very important. During the colonial era Spain had allowed travel on the Mississippi River but, fearing the rising power of the new United States, had closed the port to all American citizens after the Revolution. With Pinckney’s Treaty, western farmers could again ship goods down the Mississippi through New Orleans to world markets instead of having to struggle across the Appalachians. In addition, for all the uproar over Jay’s Treaty, the British actually honored it, removing their soldiers from Niagara and Detroit. Washington believed he could now retire in confidence that the nation was secure.

THE BIRTH OF POLITICAL PARTIES: ADAMS AND JEFFERSON
Explain the growing split between the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties, including how the French Revolution and the personal differences among Hamilton, Adams, and Jefferson affected American politics.
The framers of the Constitution feared the idea of political parties and the idea of people voting for specific candidates in a national election for president. Because of these fears, they designed the election of the president to be a complex process in which each state would have the number of presidential electors equal to its representation in Congress. These electors would form the Electoral College. State legislatures could select these electors any way they wished. The plan did not entail candidates being nominated for the presidency. Each elector would get two votes, technically one for president and one for vice president, but electors would not differentiate the offices on their ballots. Instead, each elector would vote for whomever he wished as long as his two candidates were from different states. Whoever got the most votes from all the electors would be president. The runner up would be vice president. If no one got a majority of the electoral votes, then the election would be resolved in the House of Representatives where each state delegation would have one vote in selecting among the top three vote getters in the electoral college. No one knew how this complex system would work, but the avoidance of nominations or indeed the identification of actual candidates before the selection of presidential electors was an attempt to prevent the influence of specific factions. Since there had been a national consensus that George Washington should be the first president and since he was reelected unanimously, only Washington’s retirement tested the system. The first two tests, in 1796 and 1800, did not go well.
John Adams's Difficult Presidency
The election in 1796 that made John Adams president was an odd one. By 1796, Adams, though never a close friend or political ally of Hamilton, had come to represent the Federalists, those who supported the Washington administration’s foreign policy and most of Hamilton’s economic policies. Most Federalists also supported Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina for vice president and a few, including Hamilton, tried to maneuver Pinckney into the presidency.
Thomas Jefferson was the logical candidate of the Democratic-Republicans, that large group—though not yet an organized political party—who sympathized with the French Revolution and thought Hamilton had shifted too much power to the federal government and to the urban economic elites of New York and Philadelphia. Although Aaron Burr of New York was not an official running mate, many Democratic-Republicans supported him as their vice presidential candidate. Advocates of these views had formed Democratic-Republican Societies in all parts of the country, organized their own newspapers, sympathized with the Whiskey Rebels, and adopted the French tricolor of red, white, and blue as their political colors. They were ready to become a political force in presidential politics.
Adams and Jefferson remained at home throughout 1796—actually wanting to be president after Washington was considered unseemly—but many others campaigned for them. A Democratic-Republican paper in Philadelphia called Adams His Rotundity (he was heavy) and said that he was the “champion of kings, ranks, and titles.” Federalist papers said that Jefferson was an atheist, a friend of the radical French Revolutionaries, and a danger to democracy. There were also battles within the factions. After Adams learned of Hamilton s efforts to make Pinckney president instead of him, he called Hamilton “as great a hypocrite as any in the U.S.”
George Washington also entered the campaign, though without formally endorsing a candidate. In September 1796, Washington gave what he called his farewell address 6 months before he left office. Later generations saw the speech as the grand nonpartisan benediction of the nation s founder. Contemporaries understood
198 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
it differently. In the address, Washington said he wanted to warn his country “against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.” A political party would “distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms.” He also warned “that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.”
In 1796, most people took the speech to mean “vote for Adams not Jefferson.” In Washington s mind, the Democratic-Republican Societies embodied “the spirit of party generally, and he had seen how they could foment “riot and insurrection” when he had led the army against the Whiskey Rebels. He also feared that Jefferson’s pro-French views represented the “insidious wiles of foreign influence.” Although he would never say so directly, Washington wanted his vice president to be his successor. He got his wish.
Of the 139 electoral votes cast in the 1796 election, Adams received 71, all from New England, New York, and New Jersey, while Jefferson received 68, all from Pennsylvania and the southern states. So Adams and Jefferson, these two long-time political rivals, became president and vice president, respectively.
The anger of the 1796 campaign cooled quickly. The pro-Jefferson newspaper, the Aurora, declared that Adams was a man “possessing great integrity.” One of Jefferson’s strongest supporters in Congress, William Branch Giles of Virginia, said, “The old man will make a good President, too.” Jefferson and Adams exchanged cordial letters, and Adams invited the vice president to sit in the Cabinet—which Washington had never done for him—but Jefferson declined. The two dined with Washington just after Adams’s inauguration, and in his inaugural address, Adams insisted that it was his “inflexible determination” to maintain peace with all nations, including France, words that surely reassured Jefferson and his followers.
But the split between the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans went too deep for soothing words to heal. Differences came to a head in Congress in January 1798 when Matthew Lyon, a Democratic-Republican from Vermont, ridiculed the ceremonial greeting for President Adams and insulted Federalist Roger Griswold of Connecticut. Griswold then insulted Lyon who spat in Griswold’s face. Griswold attacked Lyon with his cane, and Lyon grabbed a pair of fireplace tongs to fight back on the floor of the House of Representatives. The two were pulled apart, but the incident symbolized the hatred between the two parties and the depths to which public discourse had sunk.
Nothing, however, represented the split between the two factions as much as their attitudes toward the French Revolution. Barely a week after his inauguration, Adams received troubling news that the French Directory, the five-member council then ruling revolutionary France, had refused to receive Adams’s choice as U.S. ambassador to France. Adams had actually chosen Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (brother of the Federalist candidate for vice president) to improve the U.S.-French
relationship, but the French did not see it that way. The Directory also launched an undeclared war on U.S. shipping. In the following months, the French captured 300 American merchant ships. From his son, John Quincy Adams, who was serving as U.S. Ambassador to Prussia, Adams also heard of a French plan to stir up revolt and secession in the western U.S. territories. The Federalist press called for war against France while the Democratic-Republicans claimed it was a false crisis made up by the pro-British Federalists.
Adams, who was more nonpartisan than his Federalist backers had hoped, sought a middle ground. He sent Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts and John Marshall of Virginia to join Pinckney in Paris and try to reopen negotiations. But he also asked Congress to establish a navy and provide funds to prepare for war if it came. The response to the new president’s actions broke along partisan lines, with Federalists supporting Adams and Democratic-Republicans opposing him. But Adams won authorization for a new Department of the Navy and funds to build and support three medium-sized warships called frigates.

Affair Diplomatic incident in 1798 in which Americans were outraged by the demand of the French for a bribe as a condition for negotiating with American diplomats.

An undeclared war—1797 to 1800— between the United States and France.
Alien and Sedition Acts
A series of three acts passed by Congress in 1798 that made it harder for new immigrants to vote and made it a crime to criticize the president or Congress.
This cartoon reflects the anti-French sentiment of many Americans, showing France as having five heads (for the five-member Directory that ruled at one point), the bloody guillotine in the background, and the demand for a bribe from the upright American delegates. Note also the Africans representative of French-owned Haiti.
However, Adams’s peace overtures to the French did not go well. When his new delegation arrived in Paris, the French foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand arranged for agents, whom Adams identified only as “X, Y, and Z,” to inform the Americans that negotiations could proceed only if Talleyrand was paid a bribe of $250,000 and the French government received a loan of $10 to $12 million as well as an apology for what the French considered Adams’s belligerent tone. Pinckney’s famous response was “No, no, not a sixpence.” In fact, the commissioners were prepared to pay a bribe, not an unusual part of diplomacy at the time, but the amount demanded was far too high.
When word of the so-called “XYZ Affair” reached Congress and the American public in March 1798, Adams’s popularity soared, and many called for a war against France to avenge U.S. honor. Federalists in Congress voted to increase the size of the U.S. Army and shift its focus from the western frontier to a presumed threat of French invasion on the Atlantic coast. Given British naval supremacy, a French invasion was improbable. Even if the British did not like the United States, they certainly did not want their archenemy France to control any territory in North America. Adams, unlike most Federalists, feared a large standing U.S. Army, especially after Hamilton won appointment as a major general within it. Adams preferred to strengthen the Navy to protect U.S. interests.
In 1798 and 1799, though there was no formal declaration of war, the United States engaged in what became known as the Quasi-War with France or, as Adams preferred to call it, the “Half-War.” Treaties with France dating back to the American Revolution were repealed, and the United States began a trade embargo against France. The United States also supported the independence of Haiti, something it had not done during the Washington administration. Congress created the Marine Corps along with the Navy and armed merchant ships so they could attack French ships near the U.S. coast or in the Caribbean. Even if France had the most powerful army in Europe, Talleyrand did not really want war with the United States, and he began to make peace overtures. U.S. neutrality, if not friendship, would be important, • Talleyrand thought, if France were to launch a planned invasion of England.
The war hysteria also led Congress to pass the Alien and Sedition Acts, actually three separate acts, that irreparably hurt Adams’s reputation even though he did not directly request any of them. Federalists had become increasingly fearful of pro-French agitation. Massachusetts Congressman Harrison Gray Otis asked, “Do we not know that the French nation have organized bands of aliens as well as their own citizens, in other countries?” Many Federalists wondered, could it not happen here?
i

To make sure that French efforts, aided by Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans, could not undermine the government and its Federalist leaders, Congress passed the Naturalization Act and the Alien Friends Act in June 1798, which were referred to as the Alien Acts. These laws lengthened the time to qualify for citizenship from 5 to 14 years—to ensure that recent pro-French immigrants could not vote—and allowed the government to deport anyone deemed dangerous to the United States. While no one was actually deported under the acts, many French citizens left the United States on their own rather than wait and see what might happen.
A month later, on July 14,1798, Congress passed the Sedition Act by a slim majority, and Adams signed the law. The Sedition Act targeted primarily newspaper editors like Benjamin Franklin Bache, editor of the Democratic-Republican Aurora, making any “false, scandalous, and malicious” speech against the government, particularly Congress or the president, a crime. Unlike the Alien Acts, the Sedition Act was vigorously enforced. Democratic-Republican Congressman Matthew Lyon—who earlier had the wrestling match with Griswold—was convicted under the law for continuing to criticize the Adams administration and spent 4 months in a Vermont jail. (His constituents made it clear what they thought of the act when they overwhelmingly reelected Lyon to Congress once he was released from jail.) All told, 17 people were tried under the act, including a drunk in New Jersey who had “cast aspersions on the President’s posterior” and was fined the then enormous sum of $150. But newspapers were not silenced, and the attack on free speech undermined support for the Federalists.
The Democratic-Republicans attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts. Vice President Jefferson initially counseled “patience with what he saw as “the reign of the witches” in the Adams administration, but soon came to view the Alien and Sedition laws as a fundamental threat to democracy. In the fall of 1798, he drafted resolutions, and his friends and supporters in the Kentucky legislature adopted his words, that asserted a state’s right to declare federal law “void and of no force” within the state’s jurisdiction. Virginia’s legislature adopted similar resolutions drafted by James Madison. Both legislatures invited other states to join them, but none did. Nevertheless, the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions drew a sharp line between the two political factions. On the Democratic-Republican side, Madison, like Jefferson, saw the resolutions as an appropriate protest within the framework of the Constitution he had helped write, and both men saw them as the basic right of state legislatures to nullify federal law. But the Federalists saw both resolutions as a fundamental attack on the basic authority of the federal government and, indeed, on the Constitution itself.
While Adams never repudiated the Alien and Sedition Acts, he did end the war fever. Through emissaries, Adams received a signal that France did not want war, and after British Admiral Horatio Nelson destroyed the French fleet in the Battle of the Nile in October 1798, any remote possibility of a French invasion of the United States disappeared. Adams had become convinced that Hamilton was trying to stir up a war for his own political ambitions. The president called him “a man devoid of every moral principle.” In February 1799, Adams told the Senate that he himself was committed “to embrace every plausible appearance of probability of preserving or restoring tranquility,” and he also asked them to approve a new ambassador to France to replace Pinckney. Many Federalists were enraged that Adams would try yet again for peace, and he had to endure a shouting match with Hamilton—now a private citizen but an influential one. He also had to fire his own Secretary of State Timothy Pickering, who was ready for war, and replace him with a close political ally, John Marshall (who would later become chief justice of the Supreme Court). But the Senate approved William Vans Murray as the new ambassador, and the new mission worked. It took all of 1799 and 1800 to negotiate, during which time the government of France changed from the Directory to the dictatorship of Napoleon Bonaparte, but peace came. The Convention of Mortefontaine ended the Quasi-War and protected U.S. shipping. Adams disbanded part of the army in May 1800 over the opposition

The Kentucky Resolutions of 1798
Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798, a WW firestorm of protest broke out. Leaders of the Democratic-Republican Party saw the new laws as a direct attack on freedom of speech, a bedrock of democracy. They also opposed the legislation because they feared it would foster war with France and expand the army, navy, and federal power in general. In response they sought to undermine the laws. Jefferson secretly drafted the resolutions below, which were adopted by the Kentucky legislature in November 7 798, while Madison drafted similar resolutions for Virginia. These Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions not only attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts but also declared that, since the federal government was a compact of the states, any state could declare any federal law unconstitutional within the bounds of that state. This claim would have far-reaching implications in the decades leading up to the Civil War. Although most historians see the Alien and Sedition Acts as a dangerous attack on free speech, they also see the resolutions as an equally dangerous effort to undermine national unity.
1.	Resolved, That the several states composing the United States of America are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government; but that, by compact, under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States, and of amendments thereto, they constituted a general government for special purposes, delegated to that government certain definite powers, reserving, each state to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self-government; and that whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritive, void, and of no force; that to this compact each state acceded as a state, and is an integral
party; that this government, created by this compact, was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself, since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.
2.	Resolved... therefore, also, the same act of Congress, passed on the 14th day of July, 1798, and entitled "An Act in Addition to the Act entitled 'An Act for the Punishment of certain Crimes against the United States;'" [the Sedition Act]...(and all other their acts which assume to create, define, or punish crimes other than those so enumerated in the Constitution,) are altogether void, and of no force; and that the power to create, define, and punish, such other crimes is reserved, and of right appertains, solely and exclusively, to the respective states, each within its own territory.

of his own party. He also pardoned John Fries who had led a nonviolent rebellion against federal war taxes in Pennsylvania in 1799 and had been sentenced to death for treason. These actions cost Adams dearly, particularly among his own Federalists. But he considered the choice for peace against war his crowning achievement and ordered that his gravestone read “Here lies John Adams, who took upon himself the responsibility for peace with France in the year 1800.”
The Election of 1800
The political differences between the two leading candidates for president in 1800, President John Adams and Vice President Thomas Jefferson, could not have been clearer. But the methods for actually selecting the next president and vice president in 1800 could not have been more convoluted. None of the problems with the Electoral College that were seen in 1796 had been resolved. At that time, political parties had been informal alliances of like-minded individuals. By 1800, however, the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans were much better organized. They had come to represent
202 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
two distinct philosophies and sets of personal allegiances. Nevertheless, Americans still distrusted formal political parties. Within the parties, advocates of different positions schemed to defeat not only the other party but also rivals within their own party. In December 1799, just as the maneuvering for the 1800 election was starting, news came that George Washington had died at his home in Mount Vernon, Virginia. People of all political factions mourned the loss of a unifying leader but also knew that the next election would be more divisive than ever.
Despite the fact that most of the Constitution’s authors did not want nominations of presidential candidates to occur before the selection of presidential electors, in 1800, each party’s Congressional delegations nominated the candidates in semisecret caucuses. When the Democratic-Republican caucus met on May 11,1800, it was clear that Jefferson would be their nominee for president. Several candidates were considered for vice president, but the Democratic-Republicans wanted someone who would help them win New York, which they saw as the key to the White House. The man to deliver New York’s votes was Aaron Burr. Few politicians, including Jefferson, trusted or respected Burr, but Jefferson did not intend to lose the presidency twice. In an ill-fated decision, the caucus and party leaders pledged that every elector would vote for both Jefferson and Burr. Everyone simply assumed that somehow Jefferson would receive the most votes and become president with Burr, the runner up, becoming vice president, but that assumption proved to be a serious mistake.
Federalist maneuvering was equally complicated. There was general agreement that failure to support Adams would fatally split the party. But the caucus also chose Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, the brother of their 1796 vice presidential nominee, to be vice president, in part because he was known to be loyal to Hamilton and in part because his refusal to give a bribe to France in the XYZ Affair had made him a hero. Behind the scenes, Hamilton hoped, as he had in 1796, that he could somehow engineer Pinckney’s election as president. Once again, Adams found out about Hamilton’s plans and was furious.
Because the Constitution gave each state the right to choose its presidential electors any way it wished, the actual voting for those electors was spread out over most of the year. In an early but crucial test, Burr was able to ensure New York’s electoral votes for the Jefferson-Burr ticket. Pennsylvania’s Democratic-Republican governor also promised to deliver its electoral votes for the Jefferson-Burr ticket or, if that failed, to simply prevent a vote to choose electors from taking place in that state so Adams could not receive any votes there.
As other states continued to select their presidential electors in the summer and fall of 1800, the contest remained fierce. A Federalist newspaper said a vote for the Democratic-Republicans was a vote “for the tempestuous sea of anarchy and misrule; for arming the poor against the rich; for fraternizing with the foes of God and man” while a Democratic-Republican paper asked people to choose between, “Peace or war, happiness or misery, opulence or ruin!” The Sedition Act made direct attacks on President Adams dangerous, but the press was far from neutral, and anger at that act added fuel to the Democratic-Republican fire.
Slaves could not vote, and slavery had not been a major issue in the previous presidential campaigns, but it was in 1800. Gabriel Prosser and Jack Bowler were slaves on a Virginia plantation not far from the state capital in Richmond. Throughout the summer, they were planning a slave uprising. Prosser promised death to all whites except “Quakers, Methodists, and French people,” that is, whites known to support abolition. Over 1,000 slaves were involved, forging swords from sickles, making their own bullets, and designing a flag that read “Death or Liberty.” The uprising was set for Saturday, August 30, when they planned to meet at the Prosser plantation, kill the white owners, and march on Richmond. However, a terrible storm on August 30 scattered the slave army, and Governor James Monroe discovered the plan and called out the state militia. The leaders of the uprising were quickly tried and executed, but the prospect of a slave uprising terrified the southern states.
Chapter 7 Practicing Democracy 203
Campaign banners were popular in the 1800 campaign, including this streamer that says, "T. Jefferson, President of the United States of America; John Adams—no more."
The issue of slavery also complicated the presidential campaign. Both political parties were divided internally over it. Adams hated slavery, but Pinckney, his running mate, was one of the largest slave owners in South Carolina. Both Jefferson and Burr owned slaves, Jefferson many of them. But Jefferson had also written in opposition to slavery. He needed northern Democratic-Republican votes in Pennsylvania and New York where abolitionism was gaining ground. Governor Monroe and Jefferson feared that too many slave executions would spark an abolitionist upheaval and cost them votes. On the other hand, leniency could cost them votes in the fearful southern states where Adams and Pinckney suddenly looked like the forces of stability.
Some slaves saw the ironies of the situation. Most of those arrested, including Prosser, simply remained silent, knowing that nothing they said would save them. One, however, calmly told the judges:
I have nothing more to offer than what General Washington would have had to offer, had he been taken by the British officers and put to trial by them. I have ventured my life in endeavouring to obtain the liberty of my countrymen, and am a willing sacrifice to their cause; and I beg, as a favour, that I may be immediately led to execution. I know that you have predetermined to shed my blood, why then all this mockery of a trial?
The tension between American freedom and American slavery, which was at the heart of the republic, surfaced in the 1800 contest.
Jefferson’s religious beliefs also became a major election topic. Yale’s president, Timothy Dwight, gave a speech asking whether the country was going to elect “men who set truth at nought...who doubt the being and providence of God.” Everyone knew who Dwight was talking about, given Jefferson’s liberal religious views. Many clergy and laypeople claimed that Jefferson had renounced the basic beliefs of Christianity. In fact, Jefferson was a deist who believed that God tended to leave the universe on its own. Adams himself, who tended to agree with Jefferson in religious matters, though he was more discreet and more often seen in established churches, privately expressed “indignation at the charge of irreligion,” but did not say anything publically during the heat of the campaign.
204 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
Ihe Hamilton-Adams feud could not be kept so quiet. In the summer of 1800, Hamilton wrote A Letter from Alexander Hamilton, Concerning the Public Conduct and Character of John Adams, Esq., President of the United States. Hamilton seems to have meant the 54-page document for the private use of a few electors, whom he was attempting to switch from Adams to Pinckney, but a delighted Democratic-Republican press found the document, and it became public. In words that could, ironically, have been prosecuted under the Sedition Act, Hamilton attacked Adams for his “great intrinsic defects of character,” including “his disgusting egotism,” “eccentric tendencies,” “bitter animosity,” and “ungovernable temper.” Ihe split among the Federalists was complete. Noah Webster, a tough Federalist from Connecticut and author of the first American dictionary, wrote to Hamilton that, if Jefferson was elected as a result of this Federalist split, “the fault will lie at your door and...your conduct on this occasion will be discerned little short of insanity.
In 1800, the candidates campaigned openly, unlike 1796. The ever-diffident Adams, surprisingly, seemed to enjoy campaigning, giving speeches in key states. Jefferson considered similar campaign stops but was dissuaded by Virginia’s Governor Monroe. Instead, he engaged in a nonstop correspondence with supporters and in less public forms of campaigning, offering financial and editorial advice to friendly newspaper editors.
Given the advantages that the Democratic-Republicans held, ranging from the unpopularity of the Alien and Sedition Acts to the split among the Federalists, the election was surprisingly close. Adams swept New England and most of the northern states while Jefferson held strong in New York and Pennsylvania and most of the southern states. Ihe three-fifths clause, which counted slaves in the population though they were not allowed to vote, gave the southern states an advantage in the electoral college that ultimately tipped the election for Jefferson. Ihe last state to vote was South Carolina, and when the Jefferson-Burr ticket carried every electoral vote in that state, the new Washington, D.C., Democratic-Republican paper The National Intelligencer ran a headline on December 12, “Splendid Intelligence...Mr. Jefferson may...be considered as our future President.” But it was
not to be so simple (see Map 7-2).
Because the Democratic-Republicans had been so well organized, Jefferson and Burr each received 73 electoral votes, putting them well ahead of Adams and Pinckney. But because Jefferson and Burr had each received 73 votes, the House of Representatives would now have to decide between two candidates who had tied in the election. In addition, though the Democratic-Republicans had also won a majority in the new Congress, the old Congress, with a Federalist majority, would decide the election. Many Democratic-Republicans, including Jefferson, thought that Burr had engineered this outcome to make himself president. Many Federalists suddenly gave Burr a second look. As far as anyone knows, Burr did not negotiate with the Federalists. But he also did not give way to Jefferson.
Ihe country was stuck.
When Congress heard the tally of electoral votes, the outcome was 73 for Jefferson, 73 for Burr, 65 for Adams, 64 for Pinckney, and one for John Jay. Ihe House then began to vote between the top two. But it remained deadlocked. Finally, Hamilton, who had fought for so long with Thomas Jefferson on almost every major government policy, convinced his fellow Federalists that Burr, whom he knew all too well from New York politics, was a dangerous man of too much ambition and too little morality.
On February 17, Thomas Jefferson was elected president by a vote

Quick Review Why did factions and political parties arise in the 1790s?
CONCLUSION
George Washington was elected unanimously as the first president of the United States in 1789. This unity, largely the result of his popularity as the general who had defeated the British, would be short lived as factions began to form around personalities and around very different ideas of what the government of the new nation should look like. Alexander Hamilton, Washingtons secretary of treasury, was an especially forceful advocate of a strong and activist central government. Those who agreed with this position came to be known as the Federalists. Hamilton had been charged with making the government financially solvent. He quickly convinced Congress to pass import taxes to pay off the Revolutionary War debts, to build up the national government, and especially to fund the U.S. Army. In addition, Hamilton persuaded Congress to launch the Bank of the United States as well as establish a currency system and a mint. He believed that making possible financial credit for both government and business would ensure the strength of the new republic.
In opposition to Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Washington’s first secretary of state, envisioned an idealized agrarian republic with a weak central government. He believed that the strongest powers should remain with the states and in the hands of the people. Jefferson distrusted banks, a standing army, and centralized authority.
As promised to many who ratified the Constitution, James Madison authored amendments to the Constitution that became the Bill of Rights. These amendments spelled out limits on the federal government. They guaranteed that the nation could not establish a state religion, limit free speech or a free press, or prohibit people from keeping firearms. They also promised protection from illegal search and seizure. Perhaps most important to those who initially opposed the Constitution, the Bill of Rights limited the power of the federal government itself to only those things that were specifically mentioned in the Constitution and reserved all else to the states and the people.
Washington’s tenure as president during two terms in office was filled with conflict. He took the role of mediator and negotiator as often as possible, including efforts to balance Hamilton and Jefferson, but mediating was a messy business. In the Northwest Territory, he tried to control disorderly settlers whose support he also needed. After illegally moving into territory in the Ohio River Valley and Kentucky, those settlers expected support from state and national governments when Indians defended their lands. As president, Washington sought a more powerful army to manage the conflict. In spite of initial Native American victories, before Washington left office, all of the tribes of the region then known as the Northwest had been defeated and millions of acres opened for white settlements. In response to a new federal tax on whiskey, a rebellion—the Whiskey Rebellion—broke out among settlers in western Pennsylvania who had no intention of paying the tax. With a massive show of force, the Washington administration brought the rebellion to an end, but once the rule of federal law had been secured, Washington pardoned individual rebels. The French Revolution began just as Washington was taking office, but it was during his second term (1793—1797) that it dominated the administration’s interest. Washington was determined to maintain neutrality as revolutionary France went to war with Great Britain and as large numbers of Americans came to support each side in the war.
206 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
After serving as president for two terms, Washington retired. In a close race, his vice president John Adams defeated former secretary of state Thomas Jefferson, and under the rules then in force, Adams became president and Jefferson vice president. Four years later, the two again ran against each other, but this time, after a hard fought and exceedingly complicated election process, Thomas Jefferson became the third president of the United States.
By the time Jefferson was inaugurated, the factions that Washington abhorred had begun to harden into two political parties. The Federalists who supported a strong central government, a national bank, and the development of commercial enterprise were represented in the presidential contests by John Adams, but Alexander Hamilton, who privately feuded constantly with Adams, drove the party’s ideas. On the other side, the Antifederalists, or Democratic-Republicans, led by Jefferson, were the party of those supporting states’ rights, a weak federal government, and agrarian—often slaveholding—interests. Once Jefferson defeated Adams, the Federalists would never elect another president, but the philosophical divide between the two parties would dominate American politics for decades.
