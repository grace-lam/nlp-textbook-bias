contradicted his campaign assertions. Richard Nixon himself was a jumble of insecurities and contradictions. His insecurities and his sense that there were many enemies about to attack him made it hard for Nixon to build warm personal relationships or inspire the broad popularity of presidents like Eisenhower or Kennedy. He isolated himself and often lied to hide the inner workings of his administration. Even though he had been elected as the voice of those who had supported Goldwater, his administration would be relatively liberal. Many federal programs were still popular, and Nixon was happy to support them and reap the political benefit even as he attacked liberals and liberalism as a way to win yet other voters to his side.
Nixon Domestic Policies—Liberal Legislation, Conservative Politics
Although a self-proclaimed conservative, Nixon seemed to some to be a liberal in disguise. In July 1969, Nixon led the celebrations when John F. Kennedys goal was achieved and Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon, propelled there by American technology. In spite of the revulsion against LBJ, the 1968 election retained many Great Society Democrats in Congress. Congressional Democrats and the Republican president worked together to pass significant legislation. Johnsons 1965 Voting Rights Act was renewed in 1970. New federal funds were provided for a “war on cancer” and other medical research. Offended when she heard a group of school superintendents dismiss the educational needs of girls, Representative Edith Green of Oregon, joined by Representatives Patsy Mink of Hawaii and Shirley Chisholm of New York, proposed Title IX, which was added to the Civil Rights Act in 1972, banning sex discrimination in higher education—in sports but also in all college and university activities, and Nixon signed the law. Funds for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security were increased. Federal affirmative action regulations were toughened by Nixons Department of Labor.
Nixon did much more than any of his predecessors to strengthen environmental protection. While the Kennedy and Johnson administrations had pressed passage of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act, it was under Nixon that the new cabinet-level Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created as well as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The 1973 Endangered Species Act expanded protection for animals and plants. New Clean Air and Clean Water acts mandated the cleanup of polluted areas without regard to the cost.
Nixon also approved government support of arts and culture, particularly regional art programs and folk art. When Nixon took office, the annual budget of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) was $7.7 million. Many worried that Nixon, who had never shown any appreciation of art, would cut the budget, but he proposed increases each year. By the time he left office, the NEA budget was over $60 million, almost a 10-fold increase.
Nixon championed the Family Assistance Plan (FAP) that was designed by Daniel Moynihan—then a Nixon policy adviser and later a Democratic senator. It would have replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children (known simply as “welfare” to most) with a guaranteed annual income. FAP was defeated by a combination of liberals who thought it did not provide enough money to people in poverty, and by conservatives who thought it expanded government handouts. Nixon also proposed a system of federally mandated health insurance, the only Republican to do so. Overall federal spending for people in poverty rose by some 50 percent, and total federal spending for social insurance (which always includes more middle-class than poor beneficiaries) rose from $27.3 billion in the year Nixon took office to $64.7 billion at the time of his second inauguration.
It is impossible to call anyone who presided over such spending a conservative. Nixon could be seen as the last of the New Deal presidents, and many Goldwater conservatives saw him that way and were furious with him. From Nixon’s perspective, the programs were popular, he basked in the praise for what he was doing, and he remained confident that the Goldwater conservatives were certainly not going to desert the Republican Party for the Democrats.

However, Nixon was an unusually ruthless “win-at-all-costs” politician more than he was either a liberal or conservative. If a policy like increasing Social Security benefits or launching the EPA brought him votes, he was all for it. If fanning the flames of divisiveness brought more votes, Nixon fostered division. He encouraged Vice President Agnew s attacks on protestors and experts. Nixon himself condemned protestors as the vicious and lawless elements in our society.”
In planning his reelection campaign, Nixon and his campaign manager, former Attorney General John Mitchell, developed a “southern strategy” to win over Wallace voters. The administration slowed enforcement of federal guidelines for school desegregation and courted segregationist politicians. When officials in the Justice Department sought to enforce desegregation rules, Nixon wrote to John Ehrlichman, his closest aide, Do what the law requires and not one bit more” He approved a plan that would involve the CIA and FBI in illegal bugging and wiretapping. He maintained a “Freeze List of those who must never be invited to the White House and a larger “Enemies List, including reporters, politicians, and others, who should be watched regularly.

International Issues—Vietnam, China, and Beyond
Before he left office, LBJ had reduced the bombing of North Vietnam and begun the Paris Peace Talks. Even so, the war itself dragged on. In his presidential campaign, Nixon had promised a “secret plan” to end the war, but the end would still be a long time coming. Nixon and his National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger had a habit of bypassing the State Department and sometimes even their own staff. In Vietnam and other foreign policy arenas, the Nixon-Kissinger policies were the closely guarded work of these two men.
Paris Peace Talks
Talks with North Vietnam that led to an agreement by the Nixon administration to with draw all U.S. troops from Vietnam in 1972.
THE CONTINUING SAGA OF VIETNAM
In the first months of the Nixon-Kissinger tenure, the Paris Peace Talks went nowhere. Nixon expanded the bombing of North Vietnam and started bombing supply routes and North Vietnamese enclaves in neutral Cambodia. In the next 4 years, from early 1969 until the bombing ended in December 1972, more U.S. bombs were dropped on Cambodia than were dropped by the United States during World War II. The expanded bombing did nothing to break the will of the North Vietnamese leadership, though damage and civilian casualties were high. The bombing of Cambodia took a higher toll. A year after the bombing began, Cambodia’s prime minister, Lon Nol, overthrew the chief of state, Prince Sihanouk. From his exile in China, Sihanouk then urged Cambodians to join the anti-American communist resistance, the Khmer Rouge. The result was a devastating civil war in heretofore relatively peaceful Cambodia. When the Khmer Rouge—a very different communist insurgency from that in Vietnam-defeated the Lon Nol government, they launched a decade of horror in which they tried to turn the clock back to “Year Zero” and make Cambodia a preindustrial state. In the process, they killed teachers or anyone showing signs of American, Vietnamese, or western education or influence. Perhaps a quarter of all Cambodians died, and many who survived had then to live through years of 14-hour work days and constant hunger. Ironically the horror of the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia ended only when Vietnam invaded the country in 1978.
While Nixon and Kissinger expanded the bombing, they sought to withdraw American ground troops from Vietnam. It was, after all, sending young Americans to Vietnam that was fueling most of the resistance to the war. In May 1969, the administration announced plans to change the draft regulations so a new lottery system would give young men a better sense of the odds of their being called while reducing the overall size of the call-up “pool.” Eventually, the Nixon administration moved from a draft to an all-volunteer army to reduce public resistance to Vietnam and future wars.
The administration’s new policy was called Vietnamization. Money and arms would be sent to the South Vietnamese government so more and better trained Vietnamese troops might replace American troops. In 1969, the South Vietnamese army expanded from 850,000 to 1,000,000 troops while the first 25,000 U.S. troops
ind Limits 781
were withdrawn. In the years that followed, fewer and fewer American troops were stationed in Vietnam. However, the people of South Vietnam had never embraced the war with the enthusiasm that either the South Vietnamese or American governments wanted, so it was difficult for the South Vietnamese government to rely on their loyalty.
Maintaining the morale of the U.S. troops who remained in Vietnam was very difficult. The war seemed to have no purpose. Those on leave sometimes refused to return. Desertions spiked as soldiers sought asylum in Canada or Sweden. In Vietnam, there were near-mutinies as soldiers refused to fight for strategic positions that seemed to have no value; “fragging” of officers—sometimes lethal attacks on officers by enlisted men—increased dramatically with over 1,000 reported between 1969 and 1972. Racial tensions among the troops escalated. Drug use increased. By one estimate, 40,000 of the 250,000 troops remaining in Vietnam in 1971 were using heroin. Protests against the war mounted within the army itself.
After 1968, protests against the war were larger and angrier than ever. In the fall of 1969, 600,000 to 750,000 people gathered on the Washington Mall to protest the war. When Nixon confirmed that U.S. troops had invaded Cambodia in April 1970, protests took place on 350 college campuses around the country. A quarter of all the nation’s college students may have been involved. On May 4, Ohio National Guard troops opened fire at protesters at Kent State University, killing four. Two days later, local police killed two protesting students at historically black Jackson State College in Mississippi. In April 1971, 1,000 veterans of the war camped out in Washington to protest the war while they read the names of dead buddies and flung medals on the Capitol steps. One of the veterans, 27-year-old John Kerry—a future senator and presidential candidate—testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He asked, “How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?”
President Nixon insisted that the protests made no impact on him. When students from a number of universities gathered in May 1970 to remember the four who died at Kent State, construction workers jumped into the crowd, hitting the students with

their hard hats. A few days later, officials of the construction unions presented Nixon with an honorary hard hat which he accepted as a “symbol, along with our great flag, for freedom and patriotism to our beloved country.” A Newsweek poll reported that 58 percent of Americans blamed the Kent State students for the violence, only 11 percent the National Guard. The same poll showed that 50 percent of Americans approved of the invasion of Cambodia while 39 percent opposed it. The anger swirling around the war took many forms, not only protests against the war, but also anger at the protesters and anger at two presidential administrations, as much for the failure to expand the war as for making war in the first place.
Then, as the 1972 presidential election approached, the United States and North Vietnam, meeting at the so-far unproductive Paris Peace talks, agreed to a compromise. Henry Kissinger, in private meetings with the North Vietnamese negotiators, agreed that North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam could remain there pending a final resolution. Le Due Tho, the North Vietnamese negotiator at the talks, agreed that the South Vietnamese Thieu government could stay in place pending the resolution and that American prisoners of war—mostly bomber pilots, some of whom had been held for years—would be returned. On October 31, 1972, Kissinger announced “Peace is at hand.” It turned out to be a premature announcement. South Vietnamese President Thieu, who had not been informed of the changing U.S. position, objected to the continued presence of northern troops, and after Nixon had won a second term on November 7, he backed Thieu. The war continued.
In December 1972, after his reelection, Nixon expanded the bombing of the North. More bombs were dropped in the 12-day “Christmas bombing” than in the previous 3 years. In January 1973, peace talks led back to the same agreement as had been considered in October, in spite of Thieu’s continuing skepticism. On January 27, 1973, a cease-fire took effect; U.S. combat troops soon left the country. American prisoners of war were returned and went home. The direct U.S. involvement in Vietnam was over. The United States continued to provide aid for the Thieu government, kept advisers in South Vietnam, and bombed supply routes in Cambodia. But without U.S. fighting forces, the South Vietnamese government lost ground and would lose more ground in the years ahead.
CHINA
While the war to stop a communist victory in Vietnam continued, Nixon, in perhaps the most surprising move of his administration, began to normalize U.S. relations with communist China. Ever since the communist victory in 1949, the Peoples Republic of China and the United States had remained deeply hostile to each other. Ihe United States continued to recognize the Chinese government-in-exile on the island of Taiwan as the official government of China, in spite of the fact that the communist government based in Beijing ruled the land. Then in July 1971, National Security Adviser Kissinger made a secret trip to China and laid the groundwork for a highly publicized trip by President Nixon to China in February 1972. Nixons every move was televised, including his handshake with Chairman Mao Zedong, his toasts with Premier Zhou En-lai, and his tour of the Great Wall. The trip had a number of substantive benefits for all concerned. From Nixon’s perspective he got a promise that China would not intervene in Vietnam. China got a promise of a smaller U.S. military presence in Taiwan. Both countries established new diplomatic channels and expanded trade and travel opportunities. For China, the trip also meant an end to decades of isolation, and for Nixon, it was a publications boost at the beginning of an election year. Long after the trip, Nixon said, This was the week that changed the world.. .a bridge across 16,000 miles and 22 years of hostilities.” In a tense world, it certainly began a new era of cooperation and coexistence.
EXPANDED FOREIGN DEALINGS
While Nixon’s trip to China received the most publicity, U.S. dealings with the Soviet Union may have been more substantive. In September 1970, Nixon and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev came to an agreement about Cuba. While the Soviet Union continued to provide Cuba with aid and the 27.1
President Richard Nixon, who had made his reputation as a staunch anticommunist, ended years of hostility between the United States and communist China with his February 1972 trip.
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (known as SALT I) and an Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM)
Major treaties negotiated with the Soviet Union to reduce the world's supply of nuclear weapons.
United States continued its embargo on trade with the island, relations thawed considerably when the Soviets agreed to suspend building a submarine base there and the United States promised there would not be another invasion of the island.
A year later, the United States and Soviet leaders reduced tensions in Berlin. In May 1972, Nixon traveled to Moscow for a meeting with Brezhnev in which they agreed to a Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (known as SALT I) and an Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) that began the process of reducing the world’s supply of nuclear weapons.
Other elements in the Nixon-Kissinger foreign policy were less successful. The Six-Day War in the Middle East had taken place in June 1967, a year and a half before Nixon’s election, but the new administration had to deal with the outcome. In a deceptive move, using American-supplied weapons but keeping the Americans in the dark about their intentions, Israel attacked Egypt and Syria. The Egyptian army was devastated, and Israeli troops came close to overthrowing the government of Syria until stopped by the United States at the insistence of the Soviets, who used the hotline between Washington and Moscow for the first time. Israel seized 42,000 square miles and tripled its size.
Nixon supported friendly Arab governments, especially the then “twin pillars” of Saudi Arabia and Iran. Nixon was delighted that with their oil money—much of it U.S.-supplied through massive oil purchases—Saudi Arabia and Iran could also handle their own defense and purchase American arms. When a crisis emerged in Jordan in the summer of 1970, Israel and the United States jointly defended a friendly government there. But real peace in the Middle East remained elusive.
Nixon and Kissinger sought to project American influence in other parts of the world with mixed results. They disliked India’s Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and believed that India was intent on an alliance with the Soviet Union. Although Gandhi could be difficult and Indian links to the Soviet Union were real, the long-term result was a U.S. policy to strengthen ties to a military dictatorship in Pakistan. The alliance led the United States to support that government when it tried to put down a rebellion in the Bengali region that cost perhaps a million lives. It would be a long time before Indian or Bengali people warmed to the United States.

In Chile, the United States tried hard to keep a Marxist Salvadore Allende from winning the 1970 election. When he did win, the CIA kept trying to destabilize the Allende government. The efforts worked, and Allende was overthrown and killed in a military coup in 1973. The U.S.-backed military forces that overthrew the democratically elected government launched Chile on a course of years of tyranny and terror.
Finally in August 1971, almost 3 decades after the World War II leaders, meeting at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, had made the U.S. dollar the currency against which all other would be pegged as a way to stabilize exchange rates (see Chapter 24), Nixon announced a New Economic Policy” and ended that practice. In the future, the dollar would float freely in relationship to other international currencies. Nixon hoped that by cutting the dollar loose from other currencies, the new exchange rates would make it easier for people in other countries to buy U.S. goods. He wanted to bolster the economy before the 1972 election, and the economy received a valuable jolt. The long-term result of ending the stability in international exchange rates was less certain.

THE MOVEMENTS OF THE
1960s AND 1970s Analyze the many political and cultural movements that followed in the track of the Civil Rights Movement.
The Civil Rights Movement had captivated the country’s attention in the 1950s and 1960s, but it was not until the late 1960s and 1970s that many other groups of Americans formed their own movements to demand new rights and freedoms. Women, Latinos, American Indians, and members of the white counterculture all formed their own organizations, made their own demands, and pushed the society to acknowledge their concerns between 1968 and 1980.
The Women's Movement
Through the 1960s, the place of women in society remained surprisingly unchanged and unconsidered. Newspapers still ran separate listings for male and female jobs. Only a token number of women were admitted to law, medical, or other professional schools. Husbands still had to sign off on a wife’s credit card application. In November 1964, Stokely Carmichael made his infamous comment, “The position of women in SNCC is prone.” Women who went to Mississippi to fight for civil rights ended up doing domestic chores as well as organizing, and women in the antiwar movement found it very difficult to be seen as credible leaders. Women started to see the reality of their circumstances, and they did not like what they saw.
Women also began running for office in larger numbers than ever before. Only a tiny number of women served in state legislatures or Congress before the late 1960s. Nevertheless, during the 1960s, momentum grew as more women, and a more diverse group of women, started running for and winning elections. More women were elected to Congress, including Patsy Mink (D-Hawaii) in 1965, the first Asian woman; and Shirley Chisholm (D-New York) the first African-American woman in 1969. In 1971, Chisholm, Mink, Bella Abzug, and other women in elective and appointed offices created the National Women’s Political Caucus (NWPC), a bipartisan organization to encourage women to seek office. In 1972, Chisholm also ran for president and carried 151 delegates in the Democratic National Convention. In 1975, Ella Grasso was elected governor of Connecticut, the first woman to be elected a state governor who was not following her husband.

In the 1970s, many different groups of women came together to protest inequality, raise consciousness, and change the ways men and women interacted in American society.
At the end of the 1960s, some younger women began consciousness-raising groups, discussing their experiences as women as well as the emotional, political, and economic toll that sexism was taking in their lives. Like the students who founded SNCC, these younger women had far less patience with working “inside the system than their elders. Some began to separate from larger organizations and political movements while others also separated from the men with whom they were previously aligned politically or personally.
A month after the violent demonstrations at the Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1968, Robin Morgan began organizing women to disrupt the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The pageant was very popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Women representing each state were judged for their beauty and poise. “Miss America was perfect for us lefty Women’s liberationists,” Morgan insisted, “She touched capitalism, militarism, racism, and sexism, all in one fell swoop.” Women who came to Atlantic City had a “Freedom Trash Can” in which they threw underwire bras, constricting girdles, copies of Playboy magazine, and other symbols of women’s oppression. When the New York Post carried the story, the editors wanted to make a comparison to draft card burning, and erroneously coined the term “bra burning,” though as far as anyone knows, no bras were burned in Atlantic City or at any other women’s event.
A short time later, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance at the Department of Labor supported Bernice “Bunny” Sandler when she filed a complaint against the University of Maryland after she had been turned down for a faculty appointment because, she was told, “Let’s face
it, Bunny, you come on too strong for a woman.” Sandler decided to challenge the decision. The case eventually became a nationwide class action suit against university discrimination.
In August 1970, moderate and radical feminists came together to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the women’s suffrage amendment. On Women’s Strike for Equality Day, fifty-thousand 50,000 women marched down New York’s Fifth Avenue, including Congresswoman Bella Abzug, National Organization for Women founder Betty Friedan, and newer leaders such as Gloria Steinem and Kate Millett.
Joining Friedan and Pauli Murray, the co-founders of NOW, younger women like Kate Millett, Germaine Greer, and Gloria Steinem began their activist careers at the end of the 1960s, bringing the issues of women’s struggles and women’s rights to the foreground. In 1970, Florence Howe founded the Feminist Press to reissue the work of earlier feminist writers and publish the work of new women authors. In Massachusetts, 12 women founded the Boston Women’s Health Book Collective and published a small booklet, Women and Their Bodies, in 1970. An expanded version, Our Bodies, Ourselves, became a best seller. A group of African-American feminists calling themselves the Combahee River Collective—in honor of a Civil War battle led by Harriet Tubman—issued a statement in 1977, saying, “Black, other Third World, and working women have been involved in the feminist movement from its start,” and they wanted to be sure that “elitism within the movement” did not marginalize them. The poetry of the black lesbian feminist Audre Lorde began to gain wide circulation at the same time.
In 1972, Gloria Steinem, who had become a major voice of women’s liberation, sometimes to the irritation of Betty Friedan, launched Ms. magazine, which turned into a mass market success when it sold 250,000 copies in its first 8 days. Too tame for some, and too much of a one-woman show for others, Ms. remained a voice of new ideas and important, challenging thinking. It also successfully encouraged a switch from “Mrs.” and “Miss” to the marriage-neutral term “Ms.” that matched the equally neutral “Mr.”

Other women were lobbying state legislatures to make abortions legal. Among them was a young attorney, Sarah Weddington, who took on a Texas case that would eventually change the abortion laws of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the initial arguments of the case of Roe v. Wade in the spring of 1972. Jane Roe was a fictitious name to protect the plaintiffs identity. In January 1973, the court announced the 7-2 decision that the right to privacy prevented any state from outlawing abortion in the first two trimesters of a woman’s pregnancy. Roe v. Wade would lead to battles about abortion and the role of the courts for decades.
Still other women endeavored to change their working conditions or to open new careers to women. In 1973, Boston office workers organized a group they called “9 to 5,” which became a union. Using new federal laws against workplace discrimination, women also entered nontraditional careers in business and the construction trades that had been closed to them. Women began to appear as plumbers, bus drivers, and senior business executives.
The leaders of NOW, especially Pauli Murray, were determined to revive the struggle for an Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. An Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was first proposed by the Women’s Party in the early 1920s, immediately after the success of the women’s suffrage amendment. By the 1970s it seemed like the next logical step. Newly elected Representative Shirley Chisholm gave a passionate speech, “Equal Rights for Women” to the House in 1969. NOW began serious lobbying of the Senate in 1970. The ERA passed by a vote of 354 to 24 in the House and 84 to 8 in the Senate. President Nixon endorsed the amendment that said simply, “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” As we will see, however, as it moved through state legislatures for ratification, the ERA fell victim to a much changed political atmosphere. The United Farm Workers, 1965-1970
Cesar Chavez began organizing in the grape-growing town of Delano, California, in 1961. He was soon joined by Dolores Huerta. The Farm Workers Association (FWA), which later became the United Farm Workers union, drew on both the community organizing model developed by Saul Alinsky in Chicago and on the older tradition of a mutual benefits association within the Catholic Church. Catholic priests and nuns, Protestant ministers, and members of the United Auto Workers Union all helped the FWA grow. College students, many fresh from campus-based protest and civil rights activity, joined the effort. It was a powerful coalition, stretching far beyond the small towns of California’s little noticed agricultural regions.
In September 1965, Chavez, Huerta, and Larry Itliong, a leader of the Filipino farm workers, planned a coordinated effort by Filipino and Latino organizers and called a major strike for the fall harvest in Delano. A meeting of 1,200 Mexican American workers on September 16, 1965, began with a chant ‘ Viva la Huelga! Viva la Causa! The drawn-out Delano strike and subsequent grape boycott had begun and received widespread support across the country. It took 5 years, but on July 29, 1970, the Delano grape growers signed a contract recognizing the farm workers union as their bargaining agent. Chavez declared, “From now on, all grapes will be sweet.
The American Indian Movement—From Alcatraz to Wounded Knee
In November 1969, American Indians began a year-and-a-half siege of the abandoned federal prison on Alcatraz Island that gained national attention. Earlier, in 1964, Vine Deloria, a 30-old Standing Rock Sioux, won leadership of the National Congress of American Indians that had been founded in 1944 to support the development of Indian tribal governments. A new direction began for the nations largest Indian organization. The American Indian Movement (AIM) was founded in Minneapolis among urban Indians in the late 1960s, but become a major force on the reservations in the 1970s, making some of its leaders like Russell Means and Dennis Banks national figures.

Three Views on Women’s Rights
■JIMhen Betty Frieda and Pauli Murray launched NOW in 1966, WW they wanted the equivalent of the NAACP for women—a national organization to lobby, raise issues in the media, and reach a wide audience. In 1969, Shulamith Firestone spoke for more radical feminists through the Redstockings Manifesto. While NOW blamed a system of oppression, Redstockings blamed men. In response to both, Phyllis Schlafly challenged their basic approach and specifically the momentum building for an Equal Rights Amendment.
National Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966
We, men and women who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place...
WE BELIEVE
that the power of American law, and the protection guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution to the civil rights of all individuals, must be effectively applied and enforced to isolate and remove patterns of sex discrimination, to ensure equality of opportunity in employment and education, and equality of civil and political rights and responsibilities on behalf of women... WE REJECT
the current assumptions that a man must carry the sole burden of supporting himself, his wife, and family, and that a woman is automatically entitled to lifelong support by a man upon her marriage; or that marriage, home and family are primarily a woman's world and responsibility—hers, to dominate, his to support. We believe that a true partnership between the sexes demands a different concept of marriage, an equitable sharing of the responsibilities of home and children, and the economic burdens of their support.

Redstockings Manifesto, July 7,1969
I
After centuries of individual and preliminary political struggle, women are uniting to achieve their final liberation from male supremacy. Redstocking is dedicated to building this unity and winning our freedom. II
Women are an oppressed class. Our oppression is total, affecting every facet of our lives. We are exploited as sex objects, breeders, domestic servants, and cheap labor. We are considered inferior beings, whose only purpose is to enhance men's lives. Our humanity is denied. Our prescribed behavior is enforced by the threat of physical violence. Because we have lived so intimately with our oppressors, in isolation from each other, we have been kept from seeing our personal suffering as a political condition. This creates the illusion that a woman's relationship with her man is a matter of interplay between two unique personalities, and can be worked out individually. In reality, every such relationship is a class relationship, and the conflicts between individual men and women are political conflicts that can only be solved collectively.

We identify the agents of our oppression as men. Male supremacy is the oldest, most basic form of domination. All other forms of exploitation and oppression (racism, capitalism, imperialism, etc.) are extensions of male supremacy: men dominate women, a few men dominate the rest. All power structures throughout history have been male-dominated and male-oriented. Men have controlled all political, economic, and cultural institutions and backed up this control with physical force. They have used their power to keep women in an inferior position. All men receive economic, sexual, and psychological benefits from male supremacy. All men have oppressed women. IV
Attempts have been made to shift the burden of responsibility from men to institutions or to women themselves. We condemn these arguments as evasions. Institutions alone do not oppress; they are merely tools of the oppressor. To blame institutions implies that men and women are equally victimized, obscures the fact that men benefit from the subordination of women, and gives men the excuse that they are forced to be oppressors. On the contrary, any man is free to renounce his superior position, provided that he is willing to be treated like a woman by other men. We also reject the idea that women consent to or are to blame for their own oppression. Women's submission is not the result of brainwashing, stupidity or mental illness but of continual, daily pressure from men. We do not need to change ourselves, but to change men.
The most slanderous evasion of all is that women can oppress men. The basis for this illusion is the isolation of individual relationships from their political context and the tendency of men to see any legitimate challenge to their privileges as persecution.
VWe regard our persona, experience, and our feelings about that experience, as the basis for an analysis of our common situation. We cannot rely on existing ideologies as they are all products of male supremacist culture. We question every generalization and accept none that are not confirmed by our experience.
Our chief task at present is to develop female class consciousness through sharing experience and publicly exposing the sexist foundation of all our institutions. Consciousness-raising is not "therapy," which implies the existence of individual solutions and falsely assumes that the male-female relationship is purely personal, but the only method by which we can ensure that our program for liberation is based on the concrete realities of our lives.
The first requirement for raising class consciousness is honesty, in private and in public, with ourselves and other women.
VI
We identify with all women. We define our best interest as that of the poorest, most brutally exploited woman. We repudiate a11 economic, racial, educational or status privileges that divide us from other women. We are determined to recognize and eliminate any prejudices we may hold against other women.
We are committed to achieving internal democracy. We will do whatever is necessary to ensure that every woman in our movement has an equal chance to participate, assume responsibility, and develop her political potential.
VI,
We cal, on al, our sisters to unite with us in struggle. We call on all men to give up their male privilege and support women s liberation in the interest of our humanity and their own.
In fighting for our liberation we will always take the side of women against their oppressors. We will not ask what is '/revolu-tionary''or"reformist,''only what is good for women.
The time for individual skirmishes has passed. This time we are going all the way.

Phyllis Schlafly, "What's Wrong with 'Equal Rights' for Women?", February 1972
Of all the classes of people who ever lived, the American woman is the most privileged.
We have the most rights and rewards, and the fewest duties....
Women's lib is a total assault on the role of the American woman as wife and mother, and on the family as the basic unit of society. Women's libbers are trying to make wives and mothers unhappy with their career, make them feel that they are "second-class citizens" and "abject slaves." Women's libbers are promoting free sex instead of the "slavery" of marriage. They are promoting federal "day-care centers" for babies instead of homes. They are promoting abortions instead of families.
Why should we trade in our special privileges and honored status for the alleged advantage of working in an office or assembly line? Most women would rather cuddle a baby than a typewriter or factory machine. Most women find that it is easier to get along with a husband than a foreman or office manager. Offices and factories require many more menial and repetitious chores than washing dishes and ironing shirts.
Women's libbers do not speak for the majority of American women. American women do not want to be liberated from husbands and children. We do not want to trade our birthright of the special privileges of American women—for the mess of pottage called the Equal Rights Amendment....

In 1973, traditionalists among the Sioux on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota staged a dramatic takeover of the village of Wounded Knee, site of the massacre of 1890. Dennis Banks and Russell Means became the spokespersons for AIM and dared the federal government to repeat the attack. The standoff lasted 71 days as AIM held the town as agents of the U.S. Marshall Service and the FBI surrounded them. In May, after an FBI agent had been seriously wounded and two AIM members killed, both sides agreed to end the siege, and the Sioux won a government agreement to reconsider the treaty rights of the Oglala Sioux.
Another demonstration soon followed when Indians staged a sit in at the Bureau of Indian Affairs offices in Washington, DC. In 1975, two FBI agents were killed in another standoff at Pine Ridge, and one of the AIM leaders, Leonard Peltier, was arrested and sentenced to prison for life, although his involvement in the violence and the verdict in his case remain hotly contested almost 40 years later.
The upsurge of Indian activity at Alcatraz, Wounded Knee, the Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Washington, and elsewhere gained more than publicity. In 1970, the Nixon administration negotiated the return of the Blue Lake in New Mexico, considered sacred by the Taos people, to the Taos Pueblo. In 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was passed by Congress, resolving long-standing land disputes. The 1972 Indian Education Act also provided funds for new schools that would be under tribal control. In 1973, the government began again to recognize Indian tribes as legitimate agents, starting with the Menominees in Wisconsin.

The most dramatic scenes of the black Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s took place in the South. In the 1970s, integration efforts moved north.

THINKING HISTORICALLY
The Young Lords Party and the Origin of Political Movements in the 1970s
27 J
27 A
Historians have debated why so many different political movements—among women, Latinos, American Indians, gay men and lesbians, and others—emerged in the late 1960s and 1970s. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement had been confined almost exclusively to the black freedom struggle. A new white student movement also emerged in the 1960s. In the next 10 years, it seemed, every group of Americans was starting to demand its own rights and to challenge social injustice wherever it was found.
One of the most colorful, if short-lived movement groups was the Young Lords Party, a Puerto Rican group that came into existence in New York City in 1969. Pablo Guzman, one of the founders of the Young Lords, remembered their origins. His description of the diverse forces that led them to organize sheds light on the experience of many other groups.
In Guzman's account, the Young Lords began with a street protest in the summer of 1969.
"All we had been trying to do after sweeping up the streets on previous Sundays was talk with sanitation about once-a-week pickups and nonexistent trash cans, and about how to decently treat people asking for help instead of blowing them off." If protests helped win victories for the African-American community, they reasoned, why not them. But when the protest produced an angry police presence, Guzman and his friends decided to recruit others. "It was the summer of 1969, and the first stateside organization of radical young Puerto Ricans was announcing itself—we hoped—as a political force."
They quickly learned about La Raza Unida (the people united) that was emerging among Mexican Americans in the West, about the Weather Underground that had broken off from the Students for a Democratic Society to embrace more violent tactics, and about the Black Panther Party, the militant black organization, on which the Young Lords would model themselves. They
were also influenced by international connections in a world where many were challenging American dominance. Guzman had spent a semester studying in Mexico. He said, "I left as Paul Guzman, a nervous only-child of a Puerto Rican-Cuban mother and a Puerto Rican father...I came back to the states as Pablo Guzman."
While other groups influenced young urban Puerto Ricans like Guzman, there were also other roots to the protest movement, as Guzman reflected:
But it didn't come from nowhere—my parents and my grandparents, after all, had first instilled in me a sense that there was far too long a history of injustice in this society. "Only,"as my father would say later at my trial, "your mother and I never thought you would actually try to do something about it. Not on such a scale, anyhow."
But with deep roots in their own communities and with the inspiration of seeing others, the Young Lords, like the American Indian Movement or the gay men of the Stonewall Inn, were not going to remain quiet in the face of what they saw as significant injustice.

that the Boston School Committee (the local name for the school board) had engaged in a deliberate policy of redrawing school district lines to maintain racial segregation, and the court ordered an immediate integration of the schools, transferring students across the city by bus, for the opening of school in the fall of 1974. Boston exploded. It was many years before peace returned to the Boston schools.
While Boston was split over school integration, New York was split over a proposal developed by community leaders, the mayor, and the Ford Foundation for local community control of public schools. In certain “experimental districts,” in predominantly Puerto Rican East Harlem, and an African-American neighborhood in Brooklyn, local school boards were elected and given powers previously held by the

central office. When the Brooklyn board transferred 12 white teachers out of the district in May 1968, the overwhelmingly white New York teachers union called a citywide strike that lasted for much of the 1968-69 school year, crippled the schools, and exacerbated racial tensions in New York.
In other cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, Baltimore, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Buffalo, whites virtually deserted the city for the suburbs. As a result, more African-Americans were elected to mayor’s offices. Richard Hatcher had been elected mayor of Gary, Indiana, and Carl Stokes mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, in 1967; Tom Bradley was elected in Los Angeles, Coleman Young in Detroit, and Maynard Jackson in Atlanta, all in 1973; and Walter Washington in Washington, DC, in 1974.
Blacks and Latinos also began to seek opportunities in higher education in numbers never seen before. A growing black middle class could afford college in substantial numbers for the first time, and Johnson-era affirmative action programs opened doors. But some whites felt that affirmative action subjected them to “reverse discrimination.” The arguments about affirmative action came to a head when Allan Bakke, a white applicant, was rejected for admission to the medical school at the University of California at Davis in 1973. Bakke sued, claiming that he had been denied because the university held 16 percent of the slots for minority students. In the U.S. Supreme Court’s Bakke decision in June of 1978, four justices ruled that race-based programs were illegal and that the university had discriminated against Bakke while four justices ruled that race-based affirmative action was constitutional. The ninth justice, Lewis Powell, joined with those ordering Bakke s admission, but on much more limited grounds. Powell said that an individual could not be excluded solely on the basis of race, but that race could be a consideration. One law professor remarked, It was a landmark occasion, but the court failed to produce a landmark decision.

Woodstock Music and Art Fair
A countercultural music festival that attracted an audience of over 400,000 in 1969.
In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court in Lau v. Nichols ruled that school districts must make accommodations for students who came to school not speaking English. These accommodations could include English-immersion programs or full bilingual programs. They could not, as San Francisco had been doing, simply tell a non-English speaker like Kenny Lau to make the best of it and learn English on his own. A year later, in November 1975, Congress passed and President Ford signed the Education for all Handicapped Children Act requiring the “least restrictive” possible accommodation for students with special needs.
The 1970s were also a time in which the nature of American racial diversity began to change. In 1965, when Lyndon Johnson signed a new immigration law, only five percent of immigrants to the United States were from Asia. In the 1970s, that number climbed to 50 percent. Small Japanese and Chinese communities grew dramatically while immigrants began to arrive from India, Pakistan, and Korea. Especially in California, the growing Asian population changed state and local politics. Immigration from Latin America also increased significantly, not only from Mexico but also from many countries of Central and South American as well as the racially diverse islands of the Caribbean. With this growing racial diversity, interracial marriages became more common. A child with one Asian parent and one parent from Central America was not adequately described with traditional ethnic labels.
Out of the Closet—Stonewall and Gay/Lesbian Rights
The New York Times for June 29,1969, carried an article that reported a shift in the city’s gay community that would eventually spread to the nation. Of particular note, it said:
Hundreds of young men went on a rampage in Greenwich Village shortly after 3 a.m. yesterday after a force of plainclothes men raided a bar that the police said was well known for its homosexual clientele.
Something shifted when a group of gay men, whom the police assumed would submit quietly to arrest as they had in the past, refused to do so. Many who had long kept their identities hidden stood up. Many would never return to a closeted life. In the 1970s, gay liberation became a political movement.
While the American Psychological Association (APA) had traditionally defined homosexuality as “a form of mental illness,” pressure from outside and from within its own ranks led to a 1973 change when its board voted to remove homosexuality from its list of psychiatric disorders. “We will be removing one of the justifications for the denial of civil rights to individuals whose only crime is that their sexual orientation is to members of the same sex,” an APA leader said.
In November 1974, Elaine Nobel was elected to the Massachusetts state legislature as the first openly lesbian or gay state representative in the United States. The following January, Minnesota state senator, Allan Spear, announced that he, too, was gay and, inspired by Nobel, would no longer keep his sexual orientation a secret. Then in 1977, Harvey Milk, a gay man, was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, symbolizing the radical change that was taking place.

Counterculture and Its Critics—Sex, Drugs, and Rock'n' Roll The summer after Richard Nixons inauguration, more than 400,000 young Americans gathered on August 15-17, 1969, on a farm in Bethel, New York, for the Woodstock Music and Art Fair. Many more would have attended if massive traffic jams and rain-induced mud had not made travel to Woodstock exceedingly difficult. Those who attended Woodstock heard Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Jefferson Airplane as well as folk performers, including Joan Baez. Many smoked marijuana, swam in the nude, and generally enjoyed a weekend free from the constraints of traditional society. If any event stands as a symbol of the counterculture of the late 1960s, Woodstock was that event. It was also a symbol that stood closer to the end of the countercultures life than the beginning.
792 Part VIII Fears, Joys, and Limits, 1945-1980
Several factors helped create the counterculture’s hippies of the 1960s. One was the creation of hallucinogenic drugs. The creation of a diethylamide of lysergic acid (LSD) by Albert Hoffman (no relation to Abbie Hoffman), who was seeking a way to treat schizophrenia, set a new generation on a drug-assisted search for vision quests and heightened ecstasy in body and soul. LSD was popularized by Timothy Leary and Ken Kesey as the key to the ultimate revelation or a way to “blow your mind.” Music was also essential to the counterculture. Rock n roll had gone through extraordinary changes in the 1960s. Two British rock groups, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, became huge hits in the United States in the early 1960s with music that mocked mainstream music, including songs like A Hard Day’s Night.” Bob Dylan moved from folk music to rock. His Like a Rolling Stone” moved to number one on the charts. In Sergeant Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band” and their first movie, Yellow Submarine, the Beatles embraced the psychedelic world. Finally, anger at a war that seemed always to be escalating led some, notably Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, to conclude that the best protest was street theater and humor that mocked those who they thought were leading the country to ruin.
If the counterculture had a physical home, it was in San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury district from 1966 to 1969. In Haight-Ashbury, the counterculture ruled its own small domain. Street theater could be seen on every corner. A group called the Diggers gave out free food. Relationships were casual and informal. Drugs were easily available. The summer of 1967 was declared the “summer of love,” and young people from every corner of the United States streamed into “the Haight” to “make love, not war.” But drugs led to too many emergency room visits and violence. Rock heroes Janice Joplin and Jimi Hendrix both died of drug overdoses in 1970 and Jim Morrison died in 1971, each 27 years old. Venereal disease spread rapidly. The free food disappeared, and the street actors went elsewhere. Utopia, it seemed, could not last long.
The Woodstock festival of 1969 was a 3-day celebration of new freedoms that were already passing for many.

THE CULTURE WARS OF THE
1970s 27 .J
Analyze the reaction to the liberal and radical politics of the 1960s and 1970s and the growth of new militant conservative movements.
In the 1970s, the United States was a deeply divided nation. Among activist women there were major conflicts between feminist and with antifeminist groups. Conservative Protestants, Catholics, and Jews found new common ground, often in opposition to liberals in their own traditions. The nations deep racial divides shifted as various groups representing specific ethnicities—whites, blacks, Latinos, Asians, and American Indians—moved in different directions.
Phyllis Schlafly and the Defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment
Perhaps no one symbolized the new political situation, what some have called the culture wars of the 1970s, as much as Phyllis Schlafly. Schlafly was born Phyllis Stewart in a middle-class family in St. Louis, Missouri, in August 1924,3 years after Betty Friedan, another child of the Midwest. However, their paths diverged dramatically. Schlafly, deeply influenced by her Roman Catholic background and the commitment to individual responsibility she was taught as a child, became a Republican Party activist.
Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Schlafly was a conservative activist within the Republican Party. She organized grassroots efforts for Barry Goldwater and wrote A Choice Not an Echo, an attack on liberals within the Republican Party.
Chapter 27 Rights, Reaction, and Limits 7{
MAP 27-1 Support and Opposition to the ERA. Although the majority of state legislatures voted to approve the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, the amendment fell three states short of the required three-fourth's approval.
After the Goldwater defeat, a new opportunity opened for her. In December 1971, Schlafly was invited to a debate in Connecticut. She wanted to focus on national defense, but was told that the focus would be the Equal Rights Amendment that was being debated at that time in the U.S. Senate. Schlafly had no opinion of the amendment, but agreed to read up on it before coming to Connecticut. She did, and the result was her decision to make opposition to the ERA her prime focus.
In 1972, as Congress was voting on the ERA, Schlafly wrote “What’s Wrong with ‘Equal Rights’ for Women?” and then launched the STOP ERA initiative. Schlafly pulled in women whom she knew from anticommunist organizing. By early 1973, STOP ERA had chapters in 26 states. Eventually, 35 states ratified the ERA, but it fell three short of the required 38 states and was not added to the Constitution (see Map 27-1). Schlafly claimed much of the credit for its defeat. New cultural issues, including opposition to feminism, to abortion rights, to homosexual rights, and to the defense of prayer in school, as well as a particular definition of morality and law and order in the larger society, became the keys to a new conservative constituency and, for Phyllis Schlafly, a new career as an activist. For the Republican Party, they would be the keys to victory in several future election cycles.
Equal Rights Amendment
A proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women equal rights with men; ratified by 35 states, three short of the needed number.
Moral Majority
One of the first large-scale organizations of the emerging "religious right," which organized support for conservative candidates and was a major force in American politics in the early 1980s.
Phyllis Schlafly gave nundreds of speeches, like this one at the Illinois state capitol building, convincing enough states to defeat the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The Rise of the Religious Right
Looking back at the 1972 election, Charles Colson, one of Nixon’s prime advisers said, “It was.. .the first time in modern American political history that social issues became dominant.” They would become even more dominant in later campaigns.
In 1978, Pat Robertson, who had founded the Christian Broadcasting Network in 1960, said that if traditionalist Catholics and evangelical Protestants, long distrustful of each other, could come together, “We have enough votes to run the country.” These were fighting words and they made Robertson a central player in the religious right in the 1980s.
By far the most powerful expression of the growing religious right in the 1970s was a new organization, the Moral Majority, founded by Reverend Jerry Falwell, pastor of the Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, which claimed 17,000 members. Falwell was also president of Liberty Baptist College (later Liberty University) and host of the television Old Time Gospel Hour, which ran on 300 stations for an audience of some 1.5 million people.
The Moral Majority was, Falwell said, “pro-life, pro-family, pro-morality, and pro-American.” It was anti-ERA, in favor of prayer in schools, the teaching of alternatives to evolution, and like some earlier secular conservative movements, intensely anticommunist. Falwell opposed U.S. foreign policy that favored the relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union and called on the nation’s leaders to fight communism. He said, “Our government has the right to use its armaments to bring wrath upon those who would do evil.” Falwell, who had opposed civil rights in the 1960s said, “If you would like to know where I am politically, I am to the right of wherever you are. I thought Goldwater was too liberal.” The Moral Majority helped to register perhaps 2 million new voters before the 1980 election. They were a force to be reckoned with.

POLITICS, ECONOMICS, AND THE IMPACT OF WATERGATE
Explain the political impact of Watergate and subsequent developments that set the stage for the "Reagan Revolution."
U.S. leadership and the U.S. economy faltered in the 1970s. The three presidents who served during that decade were ultimately viewed as flawed or weak. Nixon was driven from office in a scandal called Watergate. His successor, Gerald Ford, disappointed many, particularly for pardoning Nixon, and Ford’s successor, Jimmy Carter, was unable to pull a nation out of a crisis with Iran and out of a gas crisis at home. The country, desperate for strong leadership, put its faith in a movie-star-turned-politician, Ronald Reagan, to start a new decade.
The Economic Context
The 1950s and 1960s had been decades of almost constant economic growth. During the 1960s, the nation’s poverty rate dropped from 22.2 percent to 12.6 percent. The income of many Americans rose dramatically. More Americans had more to spend and more financial security than in any previous generation. While the 1970s did not see anything like a return to the financial distress of the 1930s, they were not such good times. The sense of decline was widespread.
Although the U.S. economy grew in the 1960s, the economies of other countries, especially Germany and Japan, grew more quickly. U.S corporations failed to invest in research and development as much as companies in competing countries. Americans began buying foreign-made goods that were less expensive or of better quality. U.S. manufacturers moved production to other countries where wages were lower, costing U.S. workers their jobs. In 1971, for the first time since 1900, the United States imported more than it exported.
Throughout the 1970s, unemployment continued to be much higher than in the 1960s. While high unemployment normally meant low inflation, inflation also remained high during the decade, and the combination came to be known as “stagflation.” To keep taxes low and foster public support for the Great Society, while also increasing military spending for Vietnam, Lyndon Johnson had allowed government debt to grow dramatically. Nixon also did little to reduce government debt, using government programs to build popularity while keeping taxes low for the same reason. The result was continued inflation in spite of the unemployment. When federal officials tried to reduce unemployment by providing stimuli to the economy, inflation got worse. When they cut spending, unemployment soared. The country began to talk about a “misery index”—the combined harm done by unemployment and inflation. Between March and December 1974, the Dow Jones Industrial average fell from 892 to 577, a major loss for investors.
The economy was further undermined by a rapid rise in energy costs. In retaliation for U.S. support for Israel during the Yorn Kippur war in October 1973, Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised the price of oil on the world market. Oil, which had sold for $1.77 a barrel in October 1973, rose to $12 a barrel by the spring of 1974. Suddenly gasoline and heating oil were very expensive. Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter were all bedeviled by public anger over long lines at gas stations, something Americans had not experienced since World War
II.
Average Americans saw their disposable income decline as more money had to be spent to keep their cars running and their houses warm. American automakers were slow to anticipate the impact of the rising prices for gasoline and kept making only large gas-guzzling cars. As a result, sales of Japanese imports, Toyotas, Hondas, and Datsuns, which had held only a small share of the U.S. auto market, soared. Steel mills, tire manufacturers, auto parts makers, and, of course, Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors, all cut back and laid off workers. Unemployment rose, especially in the Northeast and Midwest, a region that took on the new name of the Rustbelt. A 1976 New York Times series described the shift from the old industrial

Northwest and Midwest to the South and Southwest, “All day and through the lonely night the moving vans push southward, the 14-wheeled boxcars of the highway, changing the demographic face of America.”
Ihe rapid decline of the Rustbelt and the equally rapid growth of the South and Southwest meant many things to the United States in the 1970s. The South itself had certainly changed. It was no longer the rigidly racially segregated economic backwater it was in the 1950s. Indeed, the South was more racially integrated than the North. Tanya Tucker’s 1974 song, “The South Is Gonna Rise Again,” told her audience that the South would rise, “but not the way they thought it would back then. I see everybody hand-in-hand.” In the new economy, Tucker sang, “I see sons and daughters of sharecroppers but they’re not pickin’ cotton anymore.” But they were also not joining unions, and wages in the South stayed lower than in the North. Elected representatives of the new South tended to oppose what they saw as an intrusive government.
For some, the rise of the air-conditioned “Sunbelt” stretching from the Old Confederacy through the Southwest of Arizona and California, was a chance for a fresh start in fast growing cities like Houston, Texas, or Phoenix, Arizona, and the suburbs around them. For others, especially those left behind in the north, it was a disaster. In 1975-76, New York City suffered a major financial crisis. When the decline in city tax revenue and federal aid meant that the city could not pay its bills, it was forced to lay off 3,400 police officers, 1,000 firefighters, and 4,000 hospital workers. Cleveland eventually defaulted on its debts in 1978. Throughout the North, city services declined and crime spiraled.
There seemed to be relatively little that the federal government could do through the 1970s to change the economic situation or address stagflation. Tax cuts, proposed by every administration, did not have the impact that some hoped and, in the absence of corresponding cuts in federal spending, which were highly unpopular, tended to fuel further inflation. Americans found themselves in an unaccustomed era of limits, and they regularly took their anger out on political leaders of both parties.
Watergate and the End of the Nixon Presidency
When he was reelected in November 1972, Nixon seemed to be at the peak of his powers. In fact, he was beginning a long slow decline that would make his second term a torture for him, his administration, and ultimately, the country until he finally resigned in disgrace in August 1974.
The constitutional crisis known as Watergate began with a simple burglary in June 1972. As the election campaign heated up, the special operations group known as “the plumbers,” was set up within the ill-named Committee to Re-elect the President (CREEP). G. Gordon Liddy, leader of the plumbers recommended to CREEP’S director, former Attorney General John Mitchell, and his deputy Jeb Stuart Magruder, that they break into the offices of Democratic Committee chair Lawrence O’Brien, which were housed in the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., to put a tap on his telephone. Mitchell and Magruder approved the plan, but the plumbers were caught. Police found an address book on the burglars that included a number for E. Howard Hunt, a former plumber now working for CREEP, and both Hunt and Liddy were soon arrested as co-conspirators in the break-in.
The White House dismissed the whole thing as a “third-rate burglary.” If Nixon had simply admitted the stupidity and fired Hunt and Liddy, perhaps even Mitchell and Magruder, the issue might have ended there. But such a move was not Nixon’s style. His orders to his chief aide, Haldeman, were to “play it tough” and, most fatefully to order the CIA to stop an FBI investigation of the burglary. In those moves, the grounds for the eventual impeachment of the president were laid since the CIA order to the FBI was an obstruction of justice.
While the Democratic candidate George McGovern tried to raise the issue during the fall campaign, not much came of it. But when Hunt and Liddy went to trial in front
796 Part VIII Fears, Joys, and Limits, 1945-1980
of federal district judge John J. Sirica, the judge quickly determined that there was more to the case than a simple burglary. In addition, two Washington Post reporters, Carl Bernstein and Robert Woodward, also began a search for more information, including the cultivation of a secret source who they called Deep Throat. (Only decades later was it revealed that Deep Throat was Mark Felt, Deputy Director of the FBI, who was angry that the FBI had been ordered out of the case and angry at Nixon for passing him over for the director s position when the FBI’s long time director J. Edgar Hoover died.)
In January 1973, just as Nixon began his second term, the Watergate burglars were found guilty in federal court. Sirica gave them all maximum sentences, but promised to reconsider if they would break their silence. One of the burglars, James McCord, started to talk to federal prosecutors. By April, not only McCord but also John Dean, Nixon s White House lawyer, and Deputy Campaign Director Magruder were talking to the Grand Jury. They also talked to staff of a Senate Select Committee, chaired by Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina. At that point, several of Nixon’s closest advisers, including Haldeman and Ehrlichman resigned. Still, proof of the president’s knowledge or involvement of the affair was lacking. Then in May, the Ervin Committee started to hold televised hearings, and the nation first watched McCord accuse Dean and Mitchell, and then watched Dean accuse the White House. They also learned that Nixon had secretly taped conversations in the Oval Office to preserve a record for his memoirs.
By fall, Ervin, Sirica, and Archibald Cox, a Justice Department special prosecutor, all demanded the Oval Office tapes. Nixon refused to turn them over, claiming “executive privilege,” the right of the president to keep White House deliberations confidential. On October 20, the president ordered his Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, to fire Cox as special prosecutor. Richardson refused, and Nixon fired Richardson, then fired Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus. Finally, the third-ranking person at the Justice Department, Robert Bork, fired Cox. The moment was known as the “Saturday Night Massacre.” Nixon surrendered only some of the tapes, including one from days after the break-in that had an “accidental” eighteen and one-half minute erasure. Public opinion started turning against the president.
The administration, so thoroughly embroiled in scandal and secrecy, was not able to pursue much else in foreign or domestic policy. It was in the middle of the Watergate crisis that Arab leaders, angry at Nixon’s efforts first to reduce the dollar’s value in international exchange rates (since oil was paid for in U.S. dollars) and then to support Israel, retaliated by increasing the cost of oil by some seven times. When in June 1974 Nixon tried to deflect his domestic troubles with another dramatic international trip— to Moscow to meet with Soviet leaders—the summit produced no meaningful results.
In the meantime, things seemed to go from bad to worse for the president. In October 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew was convicted of soliciting kickbacks and forced to resign. Nixon appointed House Republican leader Gerald Ford as vice president. Ford, a popular leader with no particular ties to the White House, was quickly confirmed. As the investigation uncovered more of Nixon’s dealings, the president responded, I am not a crook.” It was a low point in presidential history. But more was to come.
In March 1974, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and former Attorney General Mitchell were indicted. Federal courts ordered that the White House tapes be turned over to the courts and to the House committee, which had begun drawing up charges that would lead to the impeachment of the president. Nixon appealed the decision about the tapes. On July 24, the Supreme Court ruled that Watergate was a criminal matter and executive privilege did not apply. The tapes had to be handed over. On July 27, Democrats and many Republicans on the House committee began voting to recommend the impeachment of the president for obstruction of justice.
Rather than face the full House vote and the trial in the Senate, both of which he now knew he would lose, Nixon went on television on the evening of August 8 and told the nation, “I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as president, I must put the interest of America first... .Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow.”

Detente
The policy of building better understanding and a more peaceful relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.
As the Nixon family began a sad journey to their home in San Clemente, California, Gerald Ford was sworn in as president. The nation breathed a sigh of relief that a long and distracting ordeal was over. Conservative columnist James J. Kilpatrick wrote, “The swearing-in of Gerald Ford can’t come one hour too soon. At noon on April 9, Chief Justice Warren Burger, just after administering the presidential oath to Ford, turned to Pennsylvania Senator Hugh Scott and said, “Hugh, it worked. Thank God it worked.” Burger was celebrating the victory of the Constitution. Ford tried hard to live up to the trust that people, liberal and conservative, now placed in him. But he did not inherit an easy situation.
Gerald Ford
Gerald Ford entered the White House with high approval ratings. He also inherited an economy that was staggering from inflation and unemployment as well as an international scene that included the last stages of the defeat of South Vietnam. Fortunately for him, there was a sense of bipartisan good will in his early days in office. George Reedy, a staunch Democrat and former press secretary for Lyndon Johnson, said, “Ford is one of the very few men in public life whose absolute honesty I do not question.” Such a reputation was a precious, if limited, asset as Ford faced the nations problems that were now his.
Ford came from Grand Rapids, Michigan. He had been an Eagle Scout, a star football player at the University of Michigan in the 1930s, and a Navy veteran of World War II. Like several other World War II veterans, including Kennedy and Nixon, Ford entered politics soon after the war, winning a seat in the House of Representatives in 1948. He gained a reputation for hard work and honesty and was elected House Minority Leader in 1965. Even so, not everyone respected him. Lyndon Johnson said that the House Minority Leader had played football once too often without a helmet. Before and during his presidency, he was often portrayed as long-winded and bumbling.
The new president believed that his top priority was to heal a wounded nation. A month after taking office, he made a controversial proposal that draft evaders be given amnesty in return for alternative service as a way to heal the divisions of the Vietnam War. Ford gave Richard Nixon a “full, free, and absolute pardon” for any crimes committed during his administration. Some hinted that Ford had made a deal with Nixon, but the new president insisted during and after his term in office that his top priority was healing the country, which included moving beyond Watergate.
Ford was convinced that the best way to counter inflation and unemployment was to get government spending under control and reduce the federal deficit. Congress, however, was very reluctant to accept any of Ford’s proposals to cut federal spending. By January
1975,	as the economy continued to worsen, Ford supported a tax cut. Congress approved an even larger cut than Ford had requested, and he reluctantly signed the popular bill in March 1975. He then proceeded to infuriate Democrats by vetoing a number of federal spending bills. Throughout most of the rest of his term, Ford and the Congress battled over tax and spending issues, both sides wanting tax cuts, but Ford insisting they be offset by spending cuts. Each side was determined to blame the other for ongoing economic woes and to claim the credit when the economy did improve modestly in late 1975 and early
1976.	However, no one could claim that the economy was healthy during Ford’s term.
In addition to economic challenges, Ford had also inherited a number of foreign policy crises. The Cold War was still very real, and when the Soviet Union expelled the author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in February 1974, public opinion in the United States was inflamed, undermining some of Nixon’s detente efforts to build a new and better relationship with the Soviet Union. Ford calmed U.S.-Soviet relations when he met with Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev and signed the Helsinki Accords, promising peaceful resolution of outstanding issues and new scientific cooperation. The Middle East, however, remained tense, and India tested its first nuclear weapon in May 1974. In addition, Kissinger, whom Ford had retained as secretary of state, supported a military coup in Argentina in 1976, as he had in Chile in 1973.

Gerald R. Ford, Remarks Upon Taking the Oath of Office as President, 1974
ichard Nixon resigned as president on August 9, 1974, the first president in American history to do so. Nixon's elected vice president, Spiro Agnew, had already resigned and, following a new constitutional amendment, Nixon had appointed Gerald Ford to the office. Thus, when Ford became president in 1974, he was the first president in history to be unelected as either president or vice president. As he took office, he had a strong sense of the kind of national healing that the country needed from him. Moments after being sworn in, he spoke to the nation:
Mr. Chief Justice, my dear friends, my fellow Americans:
The oath that I have taken is the same oath that was taken by George Washington and by every President under the Constitution. But I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances never before experienced by Americans. This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts....
I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your President by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your President with your prayers. And I hope that such prayers will also be the first of many....
I believe that truth is the glue that holds government together, not only our Government but civilization itself. That bond, though strained, is unbroken at home and abroad.
In all my public and private acts as your President, I expect to follow my instincts of openness and candor with full confidence
that honesty is always the best policy in the end.
My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.
Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule. But there is a higher Power, by whatever name we honor Him, who ordains not only righteousness but love, not only justice but mercy.
As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate....
God helping me, I will not let you down.
Thank you.

Thinking Critically
1.	Historical Context
Beyond the Nixon resignation, what "extraordinary circumstances" might Ford be referring to?
2.	Comparison
Why might Americans be willing to trust Gerald Ford's words after the dishonesty of the Johnson and Nixon administrations?
Bill
Most frustrating, however, was Vietnam. The last U.S. troops had been out of Vietnam for more than a year when Ford took office, but military advisers, CIA, and State Department officers remained, and the United States continued to provide crucial aid. Congress was out of patience with the war. In March 1975, Ford briefly considered a recommendation from Kissinger to resume the bombing of North Vietnam but ultimately rejected it. Nevertheless, he was furious when in April Congress refused his request for emergency military aid to South Vietnam. In early 1975, the pro-American government of Laos fell to communists. In early April, the pro-American Lon Nol government of Cambodia fell to the Khmer Rouge. On April 29,1975, the government of South Vietnam surrendered. As North Vietnamese tanks crashed through the gate of the presidential palace in Saigon and the last U.S. helicopters took off from the roof of the American Embassy, there was little Ford could do but attempt the rescue of some Vietnamese orphans, mostly children born as a result of relationships between Vietnamese and U.S. service personnel. The long American presence was over. South Vietnam disappeared and the communist government renamed Saigon as Ho Chi Minh City.
As the 1976 presidential election approached, Ronald Reagan, the popular two-term governor of California challenged Ford in the Republican primaries. Reagan was staunchly anticommunist, attacking Ford and Kissinger for yielding too much to the Soviet Union, and he appealed to conservative voters. But Reagan was not able to dislodge a sitting president. Ford sought to unify the party by replacing his current (appointed) vice president, former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, on the ticket with a more conservative candidate, Kansas Senator Robert Dole, whom Reagan liked.
Chapter 27 Rights, Reaction, and Limits 799
As the last helicopters left the roof of the U.S. embassy in Saigon in 1975, hundreds of Vietnamese who had supported the U.S. effort tried to get out. Most were left behind.
Democrats believed that after Watergate, and especially after Ford’s pardon of Nixon, 1976 was to be their year, and they waged a vigorous campaign. At the beginning of the primary season, former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter was considered a long-shot in a race that involved some of the nation’s best known leaders, including Washington Senator Henry Jackson and Representative Morris Udall of Arizona. To the surprise of many, Carter won primary after primary and went on to a first-ballot nomination. He selected the well-known liberal senator from Minnesota, Walter Mondale, as his vice president.
Carter started the race with a 20-point lead in the polls, but Ford was a better campaigner than many expected. In the end, Carter’s focus on the continued high inflation and unemployment, the “misery index,” the lingering national anger about Watergate, and Carter’s success in positioning himself as the outsider won the election. Ihe final vote was very close with Carter winning 50 percent of the popular vote to Ford’s 48 percent. Ford took his loss in stride saying, “I want to be remembered as...a nice person, who worked at the job, and who left the White House in better shape than when I took over.” Most agreed he deserved that tribute. Many also looked forward to a more wholesale change of national management in January 1977.
Jimmy Carter's Difficult Years—Gas Lines, Inflation, Iran
By tradition, after taking the oath of office at the Capitol, a new U.S. president leads the inaugural parade back to the White House. Normally the president rides in a limousine, but in 1977, Jimmy Carter chose to walk so he could be closer to the people, something that Carter very much wanted to have as a hallmark of his presidency. In the long campaign, Carter promised “never to tell a lie or to make a misleading statement.” After the lies and cover-up of Watergate and Lyndon Johnson’s “credibility gap,” Carter was a refreshing change.
800 PartVIll Fears,Joys,and Limits, 1945-1980
Jimmy Carter was born in 1924 in the still rigidly segregated South, in the small town of Plains, Georgia. His father was a successful farmer, but Plains was a small place, and Carter left it to attend the U.S. Naval academy at Annapolis, Maryland.
After his navy service, Carter returned to Plains to run the family peanut farm and soon entered politics, serving in the Georgia state Senate in the 1960s. In 1970, he was elected governor of Georgia. Some civil rights leaders never trusted Carter. But in his inaugural address as governor, he said, “The time for racial discrimination is over.”
As governor, Carter courted the King family and created a biracial coalition that he thought should be typical of the ‘New South,” which he sought to represent.
Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn were deeply religious, active members of their Southern Baptist Church in Plains and later in Washington, DC, where Carter taught a Sunday School class. Carter s Christian faith reassured some and worried others, but his unapologetic sincerity and his equally clear commitment to the separation of church and state uninterested in imposing his beliefs on others—tended to win him respect.
Carter s openness, his down-home style, and his fresh approach heightened his popularity. Two months into his administration, the new president had an extraordinary 75 percent public approval rating. The new administration knew from the beginning that the economy was the key to any success they would have. In spite of some modest improvements, stagflation remained a reality, and the rising costs from the energy crisis seemed to grow worse by the minute. During his first year in office, Carter proposed a large economic stimulus package that included $4 billion for public works programs.
Although an economic conservative, Carter was willing to risk inflation to get a sluggish economy moving and put more Americans back to work. He also sought to end government regulations that he thought got in the way of a more robust economy. He signed the Airline Deregulation Act that ended government control of airline prices with significant benefit to consumers. Later in his term, he also supported an expansion of the food stamp program to provide food to the hungry and stimulate the economy.
Carter appointed former Republican cabinet member James Schlesinger as his special adviser on energy—later secretary of energy when Congress approved the new cabinet department—and told Schlesinger to come up with a comprehensive energy plan, and do so in 3 months. Schlesinger did, and Carter appeared on television to tell the nation of his new proposals, which included a “gas guzzler tax” on high-mileage cars, tax credits for conservation, and a total of 113 separate proposals to reduce energy consumption and increase its availability. Newsweek summarized the speech,
“Some of the time he was Jimmy the evangelist, preaching to a nation living in energy sin. Then he was Jimmy the engineer, rattling off statistics and throwing around terms like retrofitting and cogeneration. And then he was Jimmy the leader, summoning the nation to fight the ‘moral equivalent of war.’” Unfortunately for Carter, the energy plan had been developed in secret, and the Congress was far from enthusiastic about it.
Carter also tried to deal with both unemployment and inflation, but by the fall of 1978, he had become convinced that he had to make inflation his top priority. Robert Strauss, a special counselor in the White House tried with some success to “jawbone” business and labor (persuade them through public appeals) to keep wage increases and prices down. Later in 1978, Carter appointed Alfred Kahn to institute wage and price freezes. Still inflation increased. As Americans used credit cards to keep up with the increases in costs, credit card and other consumer debt grew from $167 billion when Carter took office to $315 billion in 1979, further fueling the inflationary spiral. Only late in Carter’s presidency did inflation decline when Paul Volcker, chair of the Federal Reserve Board, dramatically shrank the nation’s money supply, causing a major upsurge in unemployment, but that achievement, too, was at great cost to Carter s popularity.
Fueling the inflationary spiral, and causing a crisis of its own, the price of fuel just kept going up. In March 1979, the nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in central Pennsylvania	j
malfunctioned and the reactor core began to melt down. More than 100,000 Pennsylvania
residents were required to flee. The disaster led to a national fear and disdain against
nuclear energy. No new nuclear plants were built in the United States, leading to increased

dependence on oil (see Map 27-2). However, oil was a volatile source of energy. The United States had long since ceased being able to produce all of the oil it needed and imported a significant amount from the Middle East (see Map 27-3). In the middle of Carter s energy crisis, OPEC increased the price of oil by 60 percent. Carter predicted that the move would cost 800,000 people their jobs in the United States. The immediate result was further inflation and very real shortages. Gas stations across the country simply ran out of gas. The public uproar was palpable, and much of the anger focused on the president.
At the end of June 1979, as Carter returned from foreign policy triumphs—the signing of the SALT II arms control agreement with the Soviet Union in Vienna and an economic summit in Tokyo, Japan—he received a call from his pollster and confidant Patrick Caddell who insisted that Carter come to Washington immediately, saying, “You have no idea how bad it is here.” The president cancelled a planned vacation in Hawaii and headed to Washington. After a 10-day retreat at Camp David, Carter spoke to the nation on July 15,1979, about what he saw as its “crisis of confidence.” It was a visionary statement, but it did not shorten the gas lines or improve Carter’s standing in the polls.
Some of Carter’s greatest early successes came in foreign policy, but foreign policy was also the arena of his greatest failures. He announced one of his goals in his short inaugural address: “We will move this year a step toward our ultimate goal—the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this earth.” To accomplish the goal, Carter sought to expand detente with the Soviet Union. He also meant to increase respect for human rights at home and abroad. Under Carter, there would be none of Henry Kissinger’s Realpolitik stances in foreign affairs that ignored human rights or democratic institutions. Early in his term, Carter took a number of steps in all of these directions. He quickly pardoned draft evaders from the Vietnam era. He halted production of the B-l bomber which was planned as a more advanced, and expensive, version of the B-52. He ended development of the neutron bomb. He also established full diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China, furthering the new relationship that Nixon had begun. In 1978, Carter won Senate ratification of treaties for the eventual turnover of the Panama Canal to the Republic of Panama. All of these moves brought harsh critiques, but most Americans supported them.

MAP 27-3 Oil-Producing Nations As the United States became more and more dependent on imported oil, it became deeply engaged with the sometimes unstable nations that produced the bulk of the world's supply.
Carter’s greatest foreign policy triumph was the signing of the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel in September 1978. Carter was determined to be a Middle East peacemaker. He visited both Egypt and Israel and then invited Menachem Begin of Israel and Anwar Sadat of Egypt to come to the presidential retreat at Camp David for 13 days in September 1978. Carter remembered, “The easy, gentle atmosphere was very helpful. It kept tensions down.” After some very tough negotiations, the leaders achieved a major breakthrough. The Camp David Accords included formal recognition of the state of Israel by Egypt while Israel agreed to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt.
Carter was dogged in his pursuit of detente with the Soviet Union. In June 1979, Carter negotiated the SALT II agreement that built on earlier agreements and placed a limit on the numbers of missiles and bombers each side would have. It was an important development; however, the effort at detente was undermined by events halfway around the world. In December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to protect a beleaguered pro-Soviet government there. Carter saw the vastly expanded Soviet presence in Afghanistan as a violation of the decades-old American policy of containing Soviet communism. He ended the export of grain to the Soviet Union and ordered a U.S. boycott of the 1980 summer Olympic Games scheduled for Moscow. In spite of the fact that more than 60 other nations honored the Olympic boycott, it was a deep disappointment to athletes who had been preparing for years to compete. Carter s moves had hurt his popularity at home and had undermined his efforts toward detente.

Iranian hostage crisis
The invasion of the American embassy in Iran by revolutionary guards who then took 66 hostages, holding them from November 1979 until January 1981.
Carter’s worse foreign policy disaster, however, was with Iran. In January 1979, the government of the shah of Iran (who had been installed by a U.S.-backed coup in the 1950s) was overthrown. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the exiled leader of the Muslim radicals, returned to Iran and created an Islamic Republic with a government that was based on religious law and that gave religious leaders like Khomeini ultimate authority. When in October the ailing shah was admitted to the United States for medical treatment, Khomeini and his followers were furious. On November 4, 1979, a mob stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage.
The Iranian hostage crisis became the dominant event of Carter’s last year in office. The government froze Iranian assets in the United States, expanded the pressure on Iran, and tried every way possible to negotiate the release of the American hostages. In April 1980, feeling that negotiations were a failure, Carter approved an attack on Iran to rescue the hostages. The attack was a failure as a sandstorm and hydraulic problems disabled some of the helicopters and another crashed into a cargo plane. Eight Americans were killed but none got close to the hostages. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest. Later that year, after Iraq attacked Iran, the Iranian government agreed to negotiate but the process was slow. Only on the day Carter left office in January 1981, and after Reagan had taken the oath of office, were the hostages released.
The Coming of Ronald Reagan
Carter’s problems with the economy, energy, and hostages formed the backdrop to the 1980 election campaign. Within the Democratic Party there was great unease with the president. His cautious economic policies and determination to balance the federal budget alienated liberals. His go-it-alone style alienated Congress. Massachusetts Senator Edward “Ted” Kennedy challenged Carter in the primaries. Public opinion polls showed a two-to-one preference for Kennedy, last of the charismatic Kennedy brothers, over Carter. But Kennedy never seemed able to articulate the reasons he was challenging
804 Part VIII Fears, Joys, and Limits, 1945-1980
Carter. And for all of his popularity, memories persisted of the time in 1969 when Kennedy had driven a car off a bridge near Chappaquiddick on Marthas Vineyard and left a young woman, Mary Jo Kopechne, to drown. In the end, Carter defeated Kennedy for the nomination.
Kennedy supported Carter in the general election, but the wounds of a tough primary fight remained. Carter stayed close to the White House and focused on the hostage crisis. The president who once prided himself on his openness and accessibility now adopted a “Rose Garden Strategy,” leaving his office only rarely, even to campaign.
The Republicans entered the campaign with great confidence.
The contest for the nomination quickly came down to one between former California governor and movie actor, Ronald Reagan, and former CIA director and U.S. ambassador to China, George H.W.
Bush. Bush fought a tough campaign, calling Reagan’s economic plan ‘ voodoo economics.” But Reagan was hugely popular with conservatives who were known as the “Republican base.” He was also an effective and articulate campaigner and easily won the nomination.
Reagan named Bush as his running mate. Conservatives, who had felt
marginalized since Barry Goldwater’s loss in 1964, believed that their day had come. Reagan was an effective campaigner, impressing many with his sunny optimism. In the one presidential debate that was held, Reagan scored points with his poise and his response “There you go again” to a Carter critique. Reagan won in a landslide. The Republicans gained 34 seats in the House, though it still had a Democratic majority, but they took over the Senate with a 53 to 47 majority that included the defeat of Democratic stalwarts Frank Church of Idaho and George McGovern of South Dakota. The Democratic Speaker of the House, Tip O’Neill said of the election, “A tidal wave hit us.” Bill Moyers, who had served in the Johnson administration, said, “We didn’t elect this guy [Reagan] because he knows how many barrels of oil are in Alaska. We elected him because we want to feel good.” The 1980s and the time of the “Reagan Revolution” would be a very different one than the decade that had just ended.
Quick Review What could Ford and Carter have done to be more effective during their terms in office?

CONCLUSION
Public discourse in the United States, which had been heated in the 1960s, became even more divisive and angry after 1969. In the 1970s, new Civil Rights Movements emerged as women, gays and lesbians, Latinos, Asians, and American Indians began to demand equality and fair treatment. Against this expanding civil rights backdrop, a new conservative ideology surfaced, focusing on religion, morality, and culture. Compared with the 1950s and 1960s, the 1970s ushered in an economic downturn that undercut the security of many Americans. The 1970s also gave rise to political turmoil as one president was forced to resign in disgrace and two others lost their bids for reelection.
The new Civil Rights Movements of the 1970s resulted in advancements for many segments of the American population. Women achieved significant legislative and judicial victories, which allowed them to improve both their working conditions and their social status. Filipino and Mexican American farm workers successfully bargained for recognition of a union in California. American Indians staged protests at Alcatraz, Wounded Knee, and the offices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, achieving modest gains with respect to civil rights and tribal autonomy. Gay and lesbian Americans began to step out of the closet, and the modern gay rights movement was born. At the same time, traditional conservatives were bewildered and angered by the
Chapter 27 Rights, React!
Its 805
rapidly shifting culture of the United States, and the so-called culture wars began. The “moral majority” organized a political response to repudiate both the civil rights agendas of the 1960s and 1970s and the Great Society legislation of Lyndon Johnson.
The Republican Party became increasingly conservative in the 1970s, but Richard Nixon was an inconsistent conservative at best. During Nixon’s tenure, Title IX was added to the Civil Rights Act, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration were created, and overall government spending to aid the poor rose significantly. On the international front, Nixon authorized a relentless bombing campaign against North Vietnam and secretly expanded the fighting into Cambodia. At the same time, Nixon sought to withdraw all ground troops from Vietnam. Despite the war in Vietnam, Nixon normalized relations with Communist China and successfully negotiated two treaties with the Soviets designed to reduce the supply of nuclear weapons. Ultimately, the Watergate scandal ended Nixon’s presidency. When Vice President Gerald Ford took office, he hoped to heal a wounded nation, but controversial domestic decisions and multiple foreign policy crises seriously damaged the effectiveness of his administration.
In 1976, Jimmy Carter, a little-known governor from Georgia was elected president. Carter successfully brokered a peace between Egypt and Israel. Nonetheless, ongoing economic problems at home—inflation, a high unemployment rate, and gas shortages—and his failure to secure the release of American hostages in Iran resulted in Carter’s stunning reelection defeat to Ronald Reagan in 1980.
