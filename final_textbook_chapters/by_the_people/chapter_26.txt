was the first among them to oppose the war. A 1966 SNCC position paper attacked a war “to preserve a ‘democracy’ which does not exist at home. In April 1967, Martin Luther King, Jr., stood in the pulpit at New York’s Riverside Church to tell the civil rights movement and the nation that he had come to see that the war was sending poor and black Americans 8,000 miles away to fight for rights that they did not have in the United States. “Somehow this madness must cease,” he pleaded.
As the war continued, some opponents took their opposition to a new level. When some 35,000 demonstrators surrounded the Pentagon and tried to disrupt daily business in Washington in October 1967, the government reacted harshly with mass arrests of the protestors. Between 50,000 and 100,000 young men left the United States, most of them moving to Canada, to avoid serving in a war they thought was wrong. Many of those who moved to Canada eventually returned to the United States, especially after presidential pardons granted by presidents Ford and Carter, but some 50,000 Americans became permanent residents of Canada as a result of the Vietnam War while others stayed in neutral nations like Sweden.
In 1967, a group of young men in San Francisco announced that they were staying in the United States but refusing to cooperate with the military draft in any way. “We will renounce all deferments and refuse to cooperate with the draft in any manner, at any level,” they said. Draft resistance, and a willingness to be arrested for the act, was a new stage in the protest movement. Later, Dr. Benjamin Spock (whose book on child care had been the bible for the parents of many of those now refusing the draft) and Rev. William Sloan Coffin were arrested for urging draft resistance.
Still others took their protests to other forms of direct action to try to stop the war. In May 1969, opponents of the war, including some religious leaders, walked into the offices of Dow Chemical Company, which made the napalm jelly that was used to burn, kill, and maim in Vietnam, and poured blood into filing cabinets and on office equipment to disrupt the workings of the offices.
While opposition to the war in Vietnam broadened, Johnson isolated himself with trusted advisers. He agonized about casualty reports, wept while signing letters of condolence to those who had lost a loved one in the war, and regularly got up at 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. to check on casualty figures. He never seriously considered changing course and stopped talking to those who suggested that he should. He authorized the CIA, which was only supposed to operate abroad, to spy on American antiwar leaders who he became convinced were communists, and he authorized the FBI to infiltrate and disrupt the antiwar movement. Johnson brought the army commander in Vietnam, General Westmoreland, to Washington, DC, in November 1967 to tell Americans that there was “light at the end of the tunnel” in Vietnam. By that time, fewer Americans were convinced.
1968
Tet Offensive
A significant North Vietnamese assault on Amer ican bases across Vietnam.
In 1968, the growing tensions of war, race, and change in America seemed to explode. Few were untouched by the anger and fear that the year provoked.
Two months after General Westmoreland’s optimistic assessment, the light at the end of the tunnel in Vietnam dimmed considerably. On January 30, 1968, the first day of Tet, the Vietnamese lunar new year, North Vietnamese and NLF forces attacked everywhere across South Vietnam, all at once. They blew a hole in the wall surrounding the American embassy in Saigon and came close to getting into the inner compound. They attacked the distant Marine post at Khe Sanh. They took control of the old Vietnamese capital city of Hue. And they attacked American and South Vietnamese forces all over the country. Eventually, the Tet Offensive was beaten back, at terrible cost to the North Vietnamese. By one estimate, the North lost 40,000 troops compared to 2,300 South Vietnamese and 1,100 Americans. Even so, the North had won an important victory. Public trust in Westmoreland and Johnson was never restored. The president and the general had said that the United States was winning the war, but now it certainly looked like it was losing. Johnson’s popularity dropped
772 Part VIII Fears, Joys, and Limits, 1945-1980
from its already low 40 percent approval rating to 26 percent. Walter Cronkite, the anchor of the CBS Evening News and perhaps the most trusted journalist in the country, who had maintained careful neutrality in his reporting, traveled to Vietnam after Tet and returned to tell his viewers, “It seems more certain than ever that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in a stalemate.” Many agreed.
When Westmoreland responded to the Tet Offensive by asking for even more troops, beyond the 525,000 Americans already in Vietnam, Johnson’s new Secretary of Defense told the president, We seem to have a sinkhole.... I see more and more fighting with more and more casualties on the U.S. side and no end in sight to the action. Secretary of State Rusk, long a supporter of the war, recommended a bombing halt and an offer of negotiations with North Vietnam. Johnson hated the advice, but he could no longer ignore it.
At the same time, Johnson’s lack of popularity was catching up with him. Everyone assumed that, as an incumbent president, Johnson would seek and easily win his party’s nomination for another term in office. But the antiwar mood was growing, in the country and in the Democratic Party. On March 12,1968, in the nation’s first primary vote in New Hampshire, Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, who had become a strong opponent of the war, won 42 percent of the votes against LBJ’s 49 percent. Many who had participated in antiwar demonstrations decided to be “clean for Gene” and campaign door to door in New Hampshire. They found a ready electorate, people of many different persuasions, including those who were fed up with the seemingly endless war and those who were frustrated because LBJ seemed unwilling either to commit the force needed to win or to withdraw. The New Hampshire vote was far too close for a sitting president.
Even worse than the challenge from McCarthy, at least from Johnson’s perspective, was one from New York Senator Robert Kennedy, whom Johnson loathed. Bobby Kennedy realized that McCarthy’s win could mean LBJ’s defeat for the nomination and that, since McCarthy had opened the way, it was a good time to challenge an incumbent of his own party. While McCarthy was little-known, Bobby was perhaps the best known politician in the country. Soon after the New Hampshire vote, Kennedy announced that he was entering the contest. For many who opposed the war, wanted further social change, and dreamed of a return to the glory days of the JFK presidency, Bobby’s 1968 campaign was a dream come true. His campaign struck an emotional chord among both supporters and opponents—seldom seen in American politics.
On March 31, 1968, just weeks after the New Hampshire vote, Johnson gave a nationally televised speech. He announced plans to reduce the bombing as “the first step to deescalate the conflict.” He called on Ho Chi Minh to “respond positively and favorably to this new step for peace.” Then he surprised the country, perhaps himself, by adding, “I shall not seek, and will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.” Johnson, the ultimate politician, knew that public trust was essential to govern. And by March 1968, he had lost that trust. North Vietnam did respond, and the road to peace had begun. It would be a long and painful road, however, one that would last far beyond the end of Johnson’s term. Johnson s career and his hopes for the country had become casualties of Vietnam—though very far from the only casualties.
Four days after Johnson’s surprise announcement, Martin Luther King, Jr., was shot and killed in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was supporting a strike by the city’s garbage collectors. With the murder of King, the leading spokesperson for nonviolence, many felt that the cause of nonviolence itself had been damaged. Riots erupted all over America. Police arrested 20,000 people in 130 cities in the week following King’s assassination. Forty-six people, 41 of them black, were killed. Urban America seemed to be coming unglued.
The riots that followed King’s death reflected the deep anger in much of the African-American community. In Oakland, California, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale had founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense in 1966. Newton and Seale insisted that urban police forces had become occupying armies in the black community. Following a
Black Panther Party founders Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. The Panthers advocated a radical economic, social, and educational agenda that made it the target of a determined campaign of suppression and elimination by the police and the FBI.
California law then in place allowing unconcealed weapons, the Panthers conducted their own armed patrols of Oakland as a defense. Such an armed presence, however, almost assured violence. A 17-year-old Panther, Bobby Hutton, was killed the same month as King. Many more Panthers would be killed in subsequent years. The Panthers always remained a tiny fringe group, as popular for swagger as for their breakfast programs and their commitment to armed self-defense. Even so, while small, they were a symbol that many blacks embraced—a move away from the self-sacrificing nonviolence of King to a more angry and militant stance.
Two weeks after King’s death and the urban riots, students at Columbia University, led by the SDS chapter, took over the president’s office and refused to leave. Four buildings were held by white students and a fifth building, separately, by black students. The Columbia sit-in was a protest over the university’s war-related research and a university plan to build a new gymnasium in the park that separated the university from Harlem. In addition, it reflected far-reaching anger toward all authorities. After 8 days, the university administration called on the police to clear the buildings and they did. The violence of the police move onto the campus—during which more than a hundred demonstrators were injured—also pointed to the deep fault lines in the nation. The mostly working-class white police were furious at the white students whom they considered privileged snobs. The student revolt at Columbia was one of many. Students protesting the
war or local issues took over buildings, held mass rallies, disrupted classes, and burned war-related research materials on more than 150 campuses in the 1968-69 academic year.
In the face of this violent, some said crazy, time in American history, Bobby Kennedy continued his campaign for the presidency. On June 5, Kennedy won the California Democratic Primary. It was the capstone to his campaign. He not only championed the antiwar cause, but befriended Cesar Chavez of the Farm Workers Union, rural whites in Appalachia, Puerto Rican immigrants living in New York City, American Indians on isolated reservations, and urban blacks in city after city, as no candidate had ever done. Then, only moments after his California victory speech, Kennedy was shot by an Arab nationalist. He died days later. As with King, many hopes died with Kennedy.
When the Democratic Party convention finally took place in Chicago in August 1968, Kennedy was dead. The McCarthy campaign had been sidelined. The party nominated Hubert Humphrey, LBJ’s loyal vice president who had not entered a single primary. Humphrey had long been a darling of the liberal wing of the party, but his silence on Vietnam and his steadfast loyalty to the increasingly unpopular Johnson meant that he had lost the trust of many.
While the convention met to hear speeches and act on the nomination, protests erupted inside and outside the convention hall. Many delegates protested on the floor of the convention itself. Huge demonstrations were also planned for Chicago during convention week by demonstrators who had their own divisions. One faction, led by long-time pacifist David Dellinger, wanted a nonviolent but militant protest against the war, LBJ, and Humphrey. Another group, for whom Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis of the SDS were the most prominent, wanted a more direct confrontation that they knew might provoke police violence. Finally, a group who called themselves Yippies, led by Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, believed that the best way to protest was to make fun of the Democrats and the Chicago police in every way possible.
Chicago s mayor Richard Daley was determined to quash all demonstrations. As the convention met, the police attacked the demonstrators with tear gas and billy clubs in the glare of television cameras. They attacked delegates. They attacked the press. Nationally known reporters
774 Part VIII Fears, Joys, and Limits, 1945-1980
Dan Rather and Mike Wallace were both roughed up. As crowds chanted, “The whole world is watching,” the violence in Chicago was broadcast around the world. One McCarthy delegate described what he saw from his hotel window, “Cops chased kids off into the park and out of sight among the trees, emerged with one cop dragging a boy or girl by the leg and another cop running alongside clubbing in the groin. A man tried to carry a bleeding woman into the hotel, and they were both clubbed and thrown into the wagon.”
In the aftermath of the convention, a commission appointed to investigate what had happened described it as a “police riot.” The fact that this could happen, with “the whole world watching,” represented how deeply divided Americans were in 1968.
The November 1968 presidential election presented three choices. First was Hubert Humphrey and his vice presidential nominee, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie, a ticket that barely seemed to limp out of the Chicago convention. Humphrey said later,' broken, battered, and beaten.”

In what was later termed a "police riot" by an investigating commission, Chicago police officers attacked and beat demonstrators at the 1968 Democratic Party convention.
“My wife and I went home heart -But there were two other contenders in the 1968 race.
In addition, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, who had made his name blocking school integration had launched a strong third-party campaign in 1968. To the surprise of many, he qualified for the ballot in all 50 states. Wallace and his running mate, Air Force General Curtis LeMay, seemed to have broad support, ranging from the most conservative groups in the country—including the KKK and the John Birch Society—to the many white southerners opposed to racial integration to many in the North who were appalled by riots and antiwar demonstrations. With comments like, “If any demonstrator every lays down in front of my car, it’ll be the last car he’ll every lay down in front of,” Wallace courted what he called the “law and order” vote.
Third, the Republican Party emerged from its summer convention as united as the Democrats were divided. Richard M. Nixon, who had lost to John Kennedy in 1960, spent the intervening 8 years quietly laying the ground work for a political comeback. He collected many political debts and cashed them all in to win the 1968 nomination on the first ballot. His running mate was Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew, who had once been seen as a liberal but who, especially after the Baltimore riots following King’s death, had become a voice of white backlash against what he called the “circuit-riding, Hanoi-visiting, caterwauling, riot-inciting, burn-America-down” types in the black and white community. Nixon announced a “secret plan” to end the war in Vietnam and otherwise ran a carefully scripted, television-sawy, and very expensive campaign. The Republicans outspent the Democrats almost two to one.
In early fall, it seemed as if Nixon was unstoppable, in spite of Wallace s popularity. Nixon’s major theme “Working Americans have become the forgotten Americans,” his promise to do something different in Vietnam (no one knew what), and his success in representing anti-Johnson sentiment without getting specific all worked in his favor. An early poll gave him 43 percent of the vote to Humphrey’s 28 percent and Wallace’s 21 percent. Humphrey, however, ran a surprisingly strong campaign. He tried to repair the Democratic coalition, distanced himself from Johnson, and reached out to his longtime supporters. At the same time, Nixon struck some as too smooth, and a vote for Wallace seemed a wasted vote. By election day, the polls said the race between Humphrey and Nixon was too close to call.
Nixon won the November election, by a close vote of 37.7 million to 37.1 million, while Wallace took almost 10 million votes. Nixon’s electoral college lead was greater: 301 to 191 The Democrats retained both houses of Congress, however. Humphrey
won 97 percent of the black vote but only 35 percent of the white vote. Between them, Nixon and Wallace had won 57 percent of all of the votes, a significant backlash against Johnson’s huge 1964 victory, against the war, and against the demonstrators who opposed it. In 1968, Americans were more deeply divided by race and class and region than they had been in many years, and anything approaching national consensus was a distant dream. The election results also showed that Vietnam would remain an unsolved issue for a new administration.

CONCLUSION
In contrast to the 1950s, which represented a time of relative stability and complacency for some Americans, the 1960s ushered in a period of intense activism and social upheaval that in one way or another touched most. Writers and artists began to criticize almost all aspects of American culture and helped set in motion the modern ecological conservation movement, the feminist movement, a new focus on poverty, and a vocal antiwar movement. Perhaps the most iconic of these movements was the student movement. In 1960, a small group of students formed Students for a Democratic Society, which sought to end war, racial injustice, and economic inequality. In its early years, members of that organization engaged in marches, protests, and other forms of direct action to counter government policies inconsistent with their stated mission.
Despite increasing social activism across the nation, President John F. Kennedy remained concerned more with foreign than domestic issues. President Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline Kennedy brought youth, charm, and energy to the White House. Although Kennedy achieved some domestic victories, he was preoccupied, to a large extent, with Cuba, Germany—especially Berlin—and the Soviet Union. After the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, Cuban ties to Russia grew. The Soviets sent military personnel to the Caribbean island, and in 1962, the Russians began building bases in Cuba for housing missiles capable of reaching the United States. A clash between the United States and the Soviet Union seemed inevitable, but the two nations reached an agreement that resolved the crisis and thereby avoided a potentially cataclysmic confrontation.
In November 1963, Kennedy was assassinated and Lyndon Johnson became president. Unlike his predecessor, Johnson attempted to focus more on domestic rather than on foreign policy issues and, in fact, was remarkably successful in advancing his domestic policy goals, which he called the Great Society. During his tenure, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, a new immigration law, and the Voting Rights Act, as well as created Medicare and Medicaid health insurance and greatly expanded federal aid to education and the poor. Still, Vietnam was a lingering problem. As Johnson steadily increased U.S. involvement in Vietnam, opposition to the war intensified at home.
In 1968, mounting tensions in American society exploded. In the midst of the violence, at home and abroad, Johnson announced that he would not seek another term as president. Four days afterward, Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated and race riots broke out across the country. Two months later, Robert Kennedy was shot and killed. At the 1968 Democratic Party convention, protests erupted outside the convention hall, and the police attacked demonstrators as well as onlookers in what was later called a “police riot.” While the Democratic Party was fracturing, the Republican Party seemed strong. Nevertheless, the presidential race of 1968 was a very close one. The tumultuous year ended with the election of Republican candidate Richard Nixon to the presidency.

Widely diverse groups of American began to protest conditions and policies that they found intolerable. Among them, members of the American Indian Movement took over the closed prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, claiming it as "surplus federal land" that rightly belonged to them.
Basic contradictions in American life came to the surface between 1968 and 1980. The new Republican president, elected thanks to a backlash against the unresolved war in Vietnam, initially widened the war. Nixon, elected with conservative support, also began a new era of relations with Communist China and signed some of the most far-reaching social legislation in history. While the civil rights and antiwar movements splintered, more Americans began demanding their rights in other areas. A womens movement transformed intimate relationships, the work world, and American culture. The civil rights campaigns of Latinos, Asians, American Indians, gay men, and lesbians also made their impact.
Public discourse became more divisive and angry after 1969. The new vice president, Spiro T. Agnew, called protesters “nattering nabobs of negativism.” A new conservative ideology emerged, built on Barry Goldwater’s campaigns but also on cultural issues, which included opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment and the growth of a new “religious right.” Before the decade was over, the United States was defeated in Vietnam; Richard Nixon had resigned in disgrace; his appointed successor, Gerald Ford, was defeated in his bid for reelection; and his successor Jimmy Carter was also defeated in his reelection attempt. The decade was one that held much anger, much sordidness, and few moments of greatness.

Early in 1969, Kevin Phillips, a special assistant during Richard Nixon’s successful presidential campaign, published The Emerging Republican Majority. Phillips analyzed what he saw as the significance of the election and focused on two major changes in American politics. The new Republican Party, Phillips said, was based in “the rising insurgency of the South, the West, the New York City Irish, and middle-class suburbia. Phillips offered a detailed statistical analysis to show that the suburbs especially were overwhelmingly middle class, white, and Republican.
The elections, as Phillips described them, were a reaction against the Civil Rights Movement, which had generated considerable anger in white America and a repudiation of Johnson s Great Society. Expanded government programs and services offended people who wanted small government, who distrusted an intrusive state, and who feared racial integration.
Many found the analysis convincing even though Phillips did not assess the impact that the war in Vietnam had on the politics of 1968. Even so, many, including Lyndon Johnson, attributed the 1968 Democratic presidential losses to the war. While antiwar protesters were furious at Johnson and the Democrats for continuing the war, many other Americans were angry that the war was not being won. Anger at antiwar dissidents also ran deep. For a substantial number of Americans, celebrations of freedom from restraint—political, cultural, and sexual—were abhorrent.
The Roots of the Conservative Reaction of the 1960s
While the suburban-based conservatism was new, it was deeply rooted in the early development of suburban culture. Some Americans had long disagreed with the direction of the country. William F. Buckley’s conservative journal, the National Review appeared in 1955. Ayn Rand’s novel Atlas Shrugged appeared in 1957, the themes of which argued that any interference with individual rights would destroy human freedom. Ministers such as James Fifield at the First Congregational Church in Los Angeles preached that, “The blessings of capitalism come from God.”
As late as 1960, there were plenty of conservatives and liberals in both parties. After the 1960 election, however, the two parties began to move in opposite directions, and over time, most liberals moved to the Democratic party while most conservatives became Republicans. The drift toward fairly rigid and uniform positions in each party was clear by the late 1960s. In the 1960s and 1970s, the conservative shift among Republicans was led by Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, who emerged as the hero of the conservative wing of the Republicans. In his first Senate campaign in 1952, Goldwater asked audiences, “Do you believe in expanding federal government?...Do you want federal bureaus and federal agencies to take over an ever-increasing portion of your life?” If the answer was “no,” then, Goldwater said, he was their man. In 1960, he criticized Eisenhower as representing a dime store New Deal. He criticized the U.S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision as an unconstitutional federal intervention in the rights of states, and he voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, saying that the race relations issue “is best handled by the people directly concerned.” His book, The Conscience of a Conservative, published in April 1960, spoke to a white middle class that was unhappy with taxes and government intrusion, no longer interested in the New Deal safety net, frightened by the Civil Rights Movement, and fiercely anticommunist. It was this conservative movement that took over the Republican Party in 1964, even though their hero went down to defeat.
Four years later in 1968, it was Goldwater’s philosophy, not Eisenhower’s, that Richard Nixon used to make his comeback. Nevertheless, Nixon’s actual presidency
