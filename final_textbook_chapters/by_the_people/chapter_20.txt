566 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890-1945
In 1914, all of Europe went to war. President Woodrow Wilson was determined to stay out of the conflict and campaigned for reelection in 1916 with the slogan “He kept us out of war” Although Wilson would not continue to keep the nation out of the European war, the man he defeated in the 1912 presidential election, former President Theodore Roosevelt, was ready to go to war much sooner than Wilson. As president, Roosevelt liked to summarize his foreign policy with the proverb, “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” When Europe began what was then called the Great War, the former president was speaking less and less softly and arguing that the United States should prepare for war and that Wilson’s neutrality was a sign of personal and national weakness.
Roosevelt’s enthusiasm for a more activist approach to foreign policy was not out of character with his own presidency. When he became president in 1901, the United States had already acquired Alaska, Hawaii, and other islands in the Pacific. Many Americans wanted more land, or at least greater influence around the world. Other than his very active involvement in the acquisition of the Panama Canal Zone, Roosevelt had been surprisingly cautious in international relations. He reduced U.S. involvement in the Philippines, negotiated an end to war between Russia and Japan, brokered an agreement to soften Japan’s sense of insult at California’s anti-Japanese measures, and sought successfully to keep peace with the world. Many of Roosevelt’s strongest political supporters, progressive senators like Robert La Follette and reformers like Jane Addams, adamantly opposed U.S. endeavors abroad and U.S. involvement in World War I.
Nevertheless, although foreign policy is always shaped by many people and many forces, presidents Roosevelt and Wilson were certainly the dominant figures in U.S. international relations between 1898 and 1920. Their story, and the world they and so many others shaped, is the subject of this chapter.
CONTINUING EXPANSION
Significant Dates
20.1
Explain continued U.S. expansion, particularly U.S. acquisition of what would much later be the 49th and 50th states.
The geographical expansion of the United States that had continued from the time it declared independence persisted throughout the Progressive Era. Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan of the U.S. Navy persuasively laid the foundation for continued expansion in his book, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, published in 1890. Few books were ever as influential in the development of U.S. foreign policy. Mahan argued that all great nations in history had great navies that could control the world s oceans and, specifically, that the U.S. Navy needed to be large enough to be a significant player in the Pacific. He worried that the U.S. Navy was too small and that the lack of U.S. control of Pacific islands limited the nations reach. The popularity of his book accelerated developments already underway, and within a decade, the U.S. Navy had been expanded to the third largest in the world while the United States had annexed Hawaii and Puerto Rico in 1898 and had assumed control of Samoa, the Philippine Islands, and Cuba.
Not surprisingly, some have called the late 1800s the age of U.S. imperialism. Whether that term correctly describes U.S. expansion in this era continues to be debated. Certainly, thinking in the United States was influenced by the ways Britain, France, and Germany were seeking new colonies in Africa and the Middle East. Many Americans did not want their country to be left behind. Some people in the United States agreed with those Europeans who insisted that the white race was destined to rule the world’s people. Immigrants or the children of immigrants sometimes wanted the United States to intervene in their old homelands to protect the rights of compatriots. Even so, a surprisingly diverse array of Americans did not want their country involved in anything beyond its borders. Expansion beyond North America was never without controversy, even as the United States became involved around the globe.

Alaska
Long before Mahan argued for greater U.S. control of the oceans, the United States
assumed ownership of the huge Russian territory known as Russian America, or
Alaska. In the 1740s, Vitus Bering, a Danish captain serving the Russian Navy explored
the Arctic Oceans between Asia and North America. Soon thereafter, Russia had joined
Britain, France, and Spain in claiming large parts of North America. A Russian gover-
nor moved to Sitka, Alaska, in 1799 to administer Russian communities that dotted the
coast of what is today Alaska, Canada, Washington, Oregon, and northern California.
Control and management of the vast Russian territory was vested in the private Russian
American Company. Russians fished and traded in sea otter skins, providing support
for the colony and modest returns to Russia itself.
The value of Alaska to the Russian company or government was never great.
Tensions with native residents ran deep. Russians exploited Native Alaskans while
Western diseases took a heavy toll of the native population. In response, Native
Alaskans massacred Russian communities at Sitka and Nulato. By 1860, the govern-
ment was unhappy with the Russian American Company and worried about defending
the long Alaskan coast from the British Navy.
American settlers in Washington Territory were learning about the rich fishing,
whaling, and fur trapping that was possible in Alaska. Secretary of State Seward envi-
sioned its value and coordinated negotiations to purchase it from Russia. The negotia
tors agreed on a price of $7.2 million, and on October 18, 1867, the Russian flag was

hauled down at Sitka and the Stars and Stripes rose in its place. Congress balked at appropriating the funds for the purchase, and critics called the whole transfer Seward s folly,” but the nation had gained valuable new territory. Fishing, mining, the fur trade, and indeed the sale of ice to Californians made Alaska a good investment. However, Aleuts, Sitkas, Kolosh, and other Alaskan tribes found that they had only substituted one overlord for another. U.S. troops, miners, and settlers fought with Alaskan tribes as they had with native peoples further south.
Having purchased Alaska, the U.S. government was slow to do much with it. Only in 1884 did Congress create any official form of government for what they called the District of Alaska. Soon thereafter, gold was discovered in the district, and the Klondike gold rush of the late 1880s expanded the American population of Alaska as did 1898 legislation that extended the provisions of the 1862 Homestead Act to Alaska. Finally in 1912, President Taft signed legislation giving Alaska full territorial status, and the elected legislature first met at Juneau the following year.
Hawaii
Hawaii's Queen Liliuokalani was overthrown in an uprising led by American planters. A century later, the U.S. government apologized to native Hawaiians for this illegal act.
Although the United States was a major influence in Hawaii long before Mahan argued for a wider Pacific influence for the nation, it was in Mahans time that the United States annexed Hawaii. While the American Revolution was being fought, a British explorer, fames Cook, landed on a chain of islands that he named the Sandwich Islands, which came to be known as Hawaii. Before Cooks arrival in 1778, there had been no contact between the native Hawaiians and Europeans. The Polynesian people whom Cook encountered were governed by a stable if loosely held feudal monarchy. Unfortunately, like other native peoples, they had no immunity to Western diseases, and the contact initiated by Cook took a terrible toll.
Hawaii’s strategic location halfway between California and Japan and its harbors that were perfect for American whaling vessels greatly interested American and European merchants and U.S. Navy officers. By the early 1800s, Hawaiian harbors were filled with U.S. Navy ships and private whaling vessels, and Americans mixed with Hawaiians on a regular basis. In 1820, a group of New England missionaries and three American-educated Hawaiians arrived to convert Hawaiians to Christianity and interest them in American culture.
U.S. control of California with its large Pacific harbors in 1848 and the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 expanded U.S. commercial and military interest in the kingdom of Hawaii. Trans-Pacific steamship lines that began at the Pacific docks where the railroad ended sought fueling stations on their way to Asia, and Hawaii’s Pearl Harbor was the perfect stopping place. At the same time, American-owned sugar plantations had become a major economic force in Hawaii. Native Hawaiians, who were now a minority within their own country and controlled perhaps 15 percent of the land and 2 percent of the capital, did not want to further U.S. influence in their country, but the Hawaiian government agreed that it would not grant special trading rights or naval bases to any other country in return for a promise that Hawaii could ship a steady supply of sugar duty-free to the United States. Hawaii’s King Kalakaua visited the United States in 1874 to formalize the agreement.
By the 1880s, American economic power in Hawaii was overwhelming, but the islands remained independent. When King Kalakaua died, his sister Queen Liliuokalani succeeded him. She sought to regain “Hawaii for the Hawaiians” and reduce the economic and political power of the United States. Most of the American planters on the island did not like the queen’s moves and formed the Annexation Club. In 1893, the annexation group overthrew her and seized power. Ihe U.S. minister in Hawaii, John L. Stevens, cabled Washington, “The Hawaiian pear is now fully ripe and this is the golden hour for the United States to pluck it.” The U.S. Navy landed sailors “to preserve order,” thus securing the queen’s overthrow. Hawaii would have been annexed to the United States if the recently inaugurated Democratic President Grover Cleveland had not sensed that there was something unseemly about the whole affair and ended negotiations with the rebels. Cleveland announced his firm opposition to annexation.

MAP 20-1 The U.S. in the World, 1900. By 1900, the United States had claimed many islands in the South Pacific and had strong involvement with other Pacific islands as well as Latin American countries.
Under Cleveland, the United States might have supported Liliuokalani’s restoration had she not insisted that she would execute all of the rebels. That action was too much for Cleveland, and his administration ignored Hawaii, which continued as an independent nation under the control of the American planters who had overthrown the queen’s government.
When William McKinley was elected president in 1896, he demonstrated none of Cleveland’s resistance to U.S. acquisition of Hawaii as the next step in the nation’s “Manifest Destiny.” McKinley said, “We need Hawaii as much.. .as in its day we needed California.” In June 1897, McKinley proposed a treaty of annexation, to which the planter government agreed. McKinley realized that anti-imperialists in the Senate could block the two-thirds vote required to approve the treaty, so the president used the same strategy that John Tyler had used half a century earlier for Texas. He asked both houses of Congress to annex the territory by joint-resolution, which required only a majority vote. By June 1898, to the protests of native Hawaiians and the cheers of the planters, Hawaii became a permanent territory of the United States. In that same year, the United States annexed tiny Midway and Wake islands and, a year later, agreed to divide Samoa with Germany. Across the Pacific, Mahan’s dream of stations for the growing navy was a reality (see Map 20-1).

THE SPLENDID LITTLE WAR.. .WITH SPAIN—CUBA, PUERTO RICO, AND THE PHILIPPINES,
1898 _____________________________ Analyze the causes and consequences of the U.S. War with Spain in 1898.
20.2
Ihe U.S. War with Spain in 1898 (often called the Spanish-American War) followed decades of U.S. expansionism—much of it expansion into territory that had previously been part of Spains once-vast empire in the Americas. Spain had at one time exercised political control of all of Latin America, except for Brazil, and it had ruled the Philippine Islands for centuries. As a result of successful independence movements, all that was left of the Spanish empire in the 1890s was the Philippines and a collection of Caribbean islands. Many in Spain wanted to retain those outposts for their own value and as symbols of Spains past glory. Nevertheless, as a result of a short war—which future Secretary of State John Hay called “a splendid little war”—Spain lost the last of its holdings. Ihe United States gained long-term influence in both Cuba and the Philippine Islands, and made Puerto Rico a permanent U.S. territory.
Tensions in Cuba
Ihe U.S. War with Spain started in Cuba. Ihe United States had long been interested in Cuba. Well before the Civil War, southern Senators had suggested that the United States ought to acquire Cuba as a slave state to offset the growing number of Northern free states. In 1854, the American ambassadors to Europe’s leading powers issued the so-called Ostend Manifesto, demanding that Spain sell Cuba to the United States, but it did not happen. After the Civil War, Cuba was no longer of value as a slave state, but interest in the island never disappeared from American politics, and American investors were active there. By the 1890s, almost 90 percent of Cuban exports came to the United States, and American investors owned much of the best farm land on the island.
Cubans wanted to throw off Spanish rule and win independence. An 1890 agreement with Spain had reduced the tariff on sugar, launching a boom in the Cuban economy, but a new U.S. tariff in 1894, strongly influenced by lobbying from the Sugar Trust in the United States, significantly raised the tariff on imported sugar. Ihe increased cost of Cuban sugar in the United States, significantly reduced the sales of Cuban sugar and devastated the Cuban economy. Cuban revolutionaries led by Jose Marti, who had been living in exile in New York City, saw the resulting Cuban depression as the ideal moment to gain independence. Marti returned to Cuba in 1895, and his revolutionary forces began burning cane fields, killing Spanish soldiers, and making Spanish rule more costly. Spanish authorities responded by creating concentration camps where they held Cubans in controlled enclaves that separated them from the rebels. Many in these camps suffered from malnutrition and disease.
When William McKinley was inaugurated as U.S. president in 1897, he made it clear that he wanted Spain out of Cuba. American public opinion was on the side of the rebels. New York newspaper editors William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer engaged in what was called “yellow journalism” (named for a popular cartoon character of the day known as the “Yellow Kid”), publishing sensationalized accounts of Spanish atrocities in Cuba. They sent well-known artists like Frederic Remington, and writers like Richard Harding Davis, to Cuba to report on Spanish actions to increase circulation for their publications.
While many Americans saw the Cuban revolution of the 1890s as a simple question of good Cubans against bad Spaniards, American business leaders with investments in Cuba also worried that a revolutionary victory would threaten their investments. Marti, while grateful for American support, worried about long-term American influence, insisting that, “To change masters is not to be free.”
170 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890-1945
The Spanish government in Madrid did not want a war with the United States, and they worried—correctly, it would turn out—that the government, and indeed the Spanish monarchy, could not survive the overthrow of the last bastion of Spain’s empire in the Americas. As U.S. public opinion became more belligerent, so did public opinion in Spain.
Spanish people rallied to their flag, and in one town a mob attacked the U.S. consulate.
War in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippine Islands
In February 1898, over 200 American sailors were killed when the battleship USS Maine
blew up in Havana Harbor. The explosion may well have been the result of a bad boiler;
however, Americans blamed Spain, and ‘Remember the Maine” became a rallying cry.
McKinley managed to get Congress to declare war without ever asking for it.
The U.S. invasion of Cuba was not well managed. American troops arrived wearing wool uniforms—hardly the right material for a hot Caribbean summer. Even though Theodore Roosevelt gained fame for leading mostly African-American troops (shown as white in subsequent pictures) in a rapid assault on San Juan Hill, the battles in Cuba were generally slow and difficult. In 4 months of fighting, 345 Americans were killed in action while 5,000 died from disease.
Since the United States was at war with Spain, McKinley also approved the orders that had been issued by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt (issued just before he resigned that position to fight in Cuba) to Admiral George Dewey to sail the U.S. fleet to the Spanish-owned Philippine Islands. The six warships under Dewey’s command quickly sank the Spanish fleet at the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, giving the United States control of a Pacific territory much larger than Cuba. The American Pacific fleet also captured the Spanish garrison on Guam Island and took control of the uninhabited atoll of Wake Island.
Finally, the United States decided to take the last Spanish outpost in the Caribbean,
Puerto Rico. Once control of Cuba seemed assured in July 1898, McKinley ordered General Nelson A. Miles to Puerto Rico. He wanted to be sure the troops arrived before peace talks began with Spain. In 1898, some Puerto Ricans welcomed the U.S. overthrow of Spanish authority, and the indigenous independence movement in Puerto Rico was not as strong as that in Cuba.
By August 1898, Spain was ready to ask for peace. Much to McKinley’s displeasure, the congressional resolution authorizing the war had included the Teller Amendment, named for Senator Henry Teller of Colorado, which said the United States could not permanently annex Cuba. If the United States could not annex Cuba,
Puerto Rico seemed like the next best permanent U.S. territory in the Caribbean. In the case of the Philippines, which had not been an initial focus of the war, McKinley felt that he could “see but one plain path of duty—the acceptance of the archipelago.” In the Treaty of Paris of December 1898, Spain ceded control of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines to the United States for a payment of $20 million. Afterward, the United States promised eventual independence for Cuba. Suddenly, the United States was a world power, joining the nations of Europe with its own far-flung empire. What to do with that empire would be a subject of considerable debate in the future.
The Anti-Imperialists
When the U.S. War with Spain ended, the United States had to decide what to do with
its new territory. In spite of the Teller Amendment, President McKinley did everything
possible to maximize U.S. involvement in Cuba, including ensuring that the U.S. Navy
would have a perpetual base at Guantanamo Bay. The United States was going to keep
Puerto Rico, but what about the distant Philippines? The war had begun and ended in the
Caribbean over issues of Spanish control of Cuba; however, as part of the war, the United
Chapter 20 Foreign Policy and War in a Progressive Era 57l
A large number of the troops who fought in Cuba, including those commanded by Theodore Roosevelt in his assault on San Juan Hill, were African-American soldiers like these from the 9th Cavalry.
After liberating the Philippine Islands from Spain, the United States quickly found itself at war with the Filipino people who wanted independence and, as this picture shows, took many of the people of the island prisoner.

States also found itself in control of a chain of seven thousand islands with 7 million people living thousands of miles from the United States.
President McKinley told a group of visiting Episcopal clergy that he had lost sleep and had prayed long and hard about what to do with the islands and that the answer had come to him: “[T]here was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them.” The United States could not give them back to Spain or another country and, he insisted, “they were unfit for self-government.”
Nearly all Filipinos were already Christian since Catholic Spain had ruled the islands for nearly 400 years, but McKinley meant Protestant Christianity. The Constitution might prohibit the government’s direct involvement with the religious beliefs of the Filipinos, but allowing missionaries was easy.
A greater difficulty with the president’s plan was the fact that many Filipinos did not want to be annexed by the United States. A revolt against Spain had been underway long before Commodore Dewey sank the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. In addition, Dewey had encouraged Emilio Aguinaldo, leader of the Filipino insurrection, to establish an interim government for the islands. Aguinaldo expected U.S. recognition of Philippine independence, and even after it became clear that this was not President McKinley s plan, Aguinaldo hoped for either the defeat of McKinley’s treaty in the Senate or a victory in the 1900 presidential elections by William Jennings Bryan, who strongly opposed annexation of the Philippines. When the Senate ratified the treaty with Spain and Bryan lost the election, Aguinaldo led a revolt against the United States. What the U.S. government called the “Philippine Insurrection,” Aguinaldo called a war for independence.
Between 1898 and 1902, and beyond, the U.S. Army engaged in a brutal battle with Filipino insurgents. Many more American soldiers were killed in the postwar insurgency in the Philippine Islands than were killed in the war with Spain. Thousands of Filipinos were killed—perhaps 20,000 in combat and 200,000 from war-related causes—and many more left homeless.
572 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890-1945
Within the United States, broad-based opposition to the war in the Philippines was organized as the Anti-Imperialist League, founded at Boston in June 1898. The league included unlikely allies. Andrew Carnegie offered to buy the islands from the United States to secure their independence and wrote to one member of McKinley’s cabinet, You seem to have finished your work of civilizing the Filipinos; it is thought that about 8,000 of them have been completely civilized and sent to Heaven; I hope you like it. Charles Francis Adams (descendent of two presidents), former abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson, reformers including Jane Addams and Henry Demarest Lloyd, labor leaders including Samuel Gompers, rival Democrats William Jennings Bryan and Grover Cleveland, and university presidents like Harvard’s Charles W. Eliot and Stanford’s David Starr Jordan all opposed the annexation.
The nation s best-known authors, Mark Twain and William Dean Howells, turned biting humor on McKinley’s efforts. Twain said that the U.S. efforts in the Philippines meant that the United States had become “yet another Civilized Power, with its banner of the Prince of Peace in one hand and its loot-basket and its butcher-knife in the other.” Booker T. Washington said, “Until our nation has settled the Indian and the Negro problems, I do not think we have a right to assume more social problems.”
Most anti-imperialists insisted that the Constitution did not allow for the United States to acquire any territories that it did not plan to eventually admit as states and that “the Constitution follows the flag”—meaning all of the civil and political rights guaranteed in the Constitution also applied to other people under U.S. control. The advocates of territorial expansion did not agree, and in May 1901, the U.S. Supreme Court in a series of 5-4 decisions in the Insular Cases declared that the Philippines and Puerto Rico were territories, not future states, and that therefore those residing there were “subjects” not “citizens.” It was a bitter moment for the anti-imperialists.
While Roosevelt had been one of the staunchest advocates of going to war in 1898 and of keeping control of the Philippine Islands after the war, by the time he became president in 1901, the U.S. effort was increasingly unpopular and he had other priorities. In 1901, the Army captured Aguinaldo. William Howard Taft, who had been governor general of the Philippines, was welcomed home, and a truce settled on the islands, though U.S. troops remained until the Japanese invasion at the start of World War II. United States’ attention turned elsewhere.

FOREIGN POLICY, FOREIGN ADVENTURES,
1900-1914_______________________ Explain developments in U.S. policy in Panama, Asia, and Mexico between the U.S. War with Spain and World War I.
When Theodore Roosevelt became president in September 1901, he inherited two major foreign policy issues from McKinley—the ongoing war in the Philippines, which he quickly put behind him, and the question of a Central American canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, which he embraced with Rooseveltian enthusiasm. Roosevelt considered the Central American canal one of his proudest achievements.
A
Canal in Panama Ever since the California Gold Rush of 1848, there had been talk of building a canal across Central America that would allow shorter travel by ship from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans, but the hurdles were significant. The narrow point of land between North and South America was hot and damp, and mosquito-born diseases made working there a death sentence. The land was also mountainous, and for any canal to be built, engineers had to design a series of locks to raise and lower ships. Nevertheless,
Chapter 20 Foreign Policy and War in a Progressive Era S

204
Mostly West Indian workers, using steam shovels and hand tools in backbreaking labor, built the Panama Canal once the United States gained control of the territory.
Roosevelt Corollary
President Theodore Roosevelt's policy asserting U.S. authority to intervene in the affairs of Latin American nations; an expansion of the Monroe Doctrine.
in 1850, the United States and Britain negotiated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, stating that any canal would be a joint venture though neither controlled the territory. Fifty years later, few in the United States still wanted a joint venture with Britain, and in November 1901, Secretary of State John Hay and the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Pauncefote, concluded a treaty that gave the United States the exclusive right to build an interocean waterway in Central America. McKinley had created an Isthmian Canal Commission that recommended building a canal in Nicaragua, but Roosevelt preferred a shorter route through Panama.
The canal was not the first time Roosevelt involved the United States in Latin America. In 1902, shortly after he came to office, the government of Venezuela held back on debt payments to European banks. Britain, Italy, and Germany sent ships to Venezuela, but Roosevelt, citing the Monroe Doctrine, pressured them to withdraw. A year later when the Dominican Republic seemed set to follow the same route as Venezuela, Roosevelt sent U.S. forces to the island and took control of its customs operation, dividing the revenue between the country and the European creditors, an involvement in the finances of the Dominican Republic that lasted until 1941. Then, in 1904, he formalized U.S. action in the Dominican Republic, announcing the “Roosevelt Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, stating that the United States had a right to intervene in any nation in the Americas that could not manage its own affairs.
Roosevelt’s greatest interest in Latin America, however, remained constant. He wanted a canal, and he wanted it built in the territory of Panama that then belonged to Colombia. Even though the government of Colombia did not agree, many in Panama saw the situation differently. Panama was a frontier province of Colombia, distant enough that it could take 15 days for messages from Panama City to reach the national government in Bogota. Many in Panama were ready to declare independence. There is no evidence that Roosevelt actively urged a revolution, but he certainly did nothing to discourage one either. In November 1903, when Panama revolted against Colombian rule, Roosevelt sent orders to U.S. Navy ships standing by on both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Panama to “prevent landing of any armed force with hostile intent, either government or insurgent.” Since the insurgents were already in Panama and the only forces that wanted to land were from the Colombian government, the impact of the order was clear. Describing the independence movement in Panama, Roosevelt told the U.S. Congress that the people of Panama had risen up against Colombia, “literally as one man.” Senator Edward Carmack retorted, “Yes, and the one man was Roosevelt.”
Once Panama declared independence, the United States quickly—with “indecent haste,” one critic said—recognized the independent Panamanian government and then 1890-1945
74 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression,
proposed the canal to them. Three months later, in February 1904, both nations ratified a treaty giving the United States the right to a canal zone 10 miles wide, which “the United States would possess... [as] if it were the sovereign of the territory”, while the new government in Panama City got the $10 million that had originally been offered to Colombia. Roosevelt got the route he wanted, if not the good will of Latin America.
Late in his term, Roosevelt visited Panama. Ever the energetic enthusiast, he climbed up to the driver’s seat of the biggest steam shovel digging the canal, spoke with some of the 19,000 West Indian laborers who were doing the backbreaking work (and who died at an astounding rate—85 just in the month of the president’s visit), met with authorities of the new government, and envisioned ships passing through the canal and towns rising on the banks of what was still, at that point, a muck-filled ditch. The canal did not open until 1914, long after Roosevelt had left office. With or without Roosevelt, the United States would most likely have built a canal between the oceans at some point. Nevertheless, the route and the speed were a result of Roosevelt’s efforts.
The United States, Russia, Japan, and China
Across the world, Russia had long been expanding its territory. Russian Cossacks had
asserted control of Asian Siberia for Russia in the 1600s and then looked west to North
America and south in Asia. All Russian expansion came to an abrupt halt in early
1904, however. Japan, which had emerged as a modern military and diplomatic power,
was determined to stop Russia from acquiring influence in Manchuria and Korea. The
Japanese fleet under Admiral Heihachiro Togo attacked and destroyed a Russian fleet
anchored at Port Arthur. To America, the war seemed far away, and the United States
quickly declared neutrality. A year later, in May 1905, another Russian fleet was destroyed.
The Japanese Navy sank twenty-two Russian ships, killed some 4,000 Russian sailors, and
captured several more ships along with the Russian commander Admiral Rozhdestvenski.
Nevertheless, no peace treaty emerged, and Japanese resources were spent.
The Japanese government sent a secret message to Roosevelt, asking if he would “directly and entirely of his own motion and initiative. ..invite the two belligerents to come together.” Roosevelt loved the idea of playing mediator and proposed arbitration to the tsar. Russia agreed, and the announcement of the peace conference won Roosevelt worldwide praise.
Once Roosevelt got representatives of both countries to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in August 1905, they argued about borders, money, and a postwar plan.
But eventually, Roosevelt’s arm-twisting led to a peace agreement. The war ended, and Roosevelt was praised by the Russian tsar and the Japanese emperor. A year later,
Roosevelt was rewarded with the Nobel Peace Prize.
While the czarist government was grateful for Roosevelt’s role in ending the war,
Russian immigrants to the United States had their own grievances against the tsar’s rule. When hundreds of Russian Jews were killed in pogroms between 1903 and 1906,
Jewish immigrants in the United States pressured the U.S. government to do something about the situation, and President Roosevelt and Secretary of State John Hay issued a formal protest. The Russian ambassador responded to the protest saying that it was “unbecoming for Americans to criticize” Russia in light of American lynching of African-Americans and the bad treatment of Chinese immigrants.
Japan, too, though appreciative of Roosevelt’s efforts to mediate with Russia, was not pleased by San Francisco’s segregation of Japanese students. California was the port of entry for immigrants from Japan and China. It was also the place where anti-Asian feelings ran strongest. In October 1906, in the aftermath of the city’s great earthquake, as they reorganized and reopened the city’s schools, the San Francisco School Board adopted a policy of racial segregation for Chinese, Korean, and Japanese children. The government of China protested but was too weak to do more. In Japan, however, anger at the insult led to calls for war. Roosevelt tried to convince Californians to rescind the segregation order while encouraging the government of Japan to ignore the insult, but failed at doing both.

The U.S. policy urged by President Taft of using private investment in other nations to promote American diplomatic goals and business interests.
However, in 1907 and 1908, he successfully negotiated the Gentlemen’s Agreement by which the United States agreed not to pass any formal limit on Japanese immigration and the Japanese government agreed to limit the emigration of laborers to the United States. For Japan, it was important not to face anything as insulting as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 had been. For Californians, Roosevelt had accomplished the goal of establishing a limit on Japanese immigration. At the same time, Roosevelt used Japan s threat of war to ask Congress to appropriate funds to expand the U.S. Navy and then sent the Great White Fleet—16 battleships painted gleaming white rather than navy grey—around the world with a dramatic stop at Tokyo Bay. The 1908 tensions with Japan had receded, though they were hardly ended.
In China, tensions were also rising against the United States. The Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists, (called Boxers by foreigners) a secret society consisting of local farmers, peasants, and others who were victims of disastrous floods and opium addiction, led the Boxer Rebellion in 1901, attacking all foreigners, including American businessmen and missionaries, whom they blamed for their plight. Although the Boxer Rebellion was quickly quashed by an international force, Chinese citizens, carrying anti-American posters and singing anti-American songs, organized a massive boycott of U.S. goods in 1905.
Woodrow Wilson's Asian Policy
While he was president, Theodore Roosevelt had insisted that the long-standing Open Door Policy allowing the United States and Britain free trade with China be continued in spite of Japans desire to dominate all Asian markets. President Taft had less lofty goals for Americas role in the world, and though he was wary of political ties, he strongly encouraged American investment wherever there was an opportunity, leading critics to call his policy dollar diplomacy. Late in Taft’s term, J.P. Morgan negotiated a large international loan to China to support the building of new rail lines there. Upon becoming president, Woodrow Wilson found himself immediately involved with Asian matters and specifically the Morgan loan. Wilsons new secretary of state, William Jennings Bryan, had deep reservations about the loan. Within 2 weeks of the inauguration, Wilson announced that the government of the United States opposed the loan because its terms undermined “the administrative independence of China.” China did not get the loan. Unfortunately, it also did not get the railroads that the loan was supposed to finance, something that weakened the country in its future dealings with Japan.
Tensions with Japan that had been brewing since Roosevelt’s time continued. Just as Wilson assumed office, the California legislature adopted a law that no one “ineligible for citizenship” could buy land in California. Since Japanese immigrants could not become citizens, everyone knew at whom the law was directed. Secretary Bryan made two trips to California to try and get the law rescinded, but failed. Japan’s government reacted angrily, as it had with school segregation in 1906, and again a war seemed possible. Wilson and Bryan did everything they could to diffuse the situation. The leaders in Tokyo also did not want a war, but in Japan, feelings of deep anti-American animosity were furthered by California’s continuing determination to marginalize Japanese immigrants.
Wilson and Bryan also tried to end U.S. control of the Philippines. They convinced Congress to pass legislation granting eventual independence to the islands, but Republican opponents succeeded in deleting any specific deadline. Only after World War II did the United States recognize the independence of the Philippines, though it had been promised in 1916.
Mexico and Latin America
The most difficult foreign policy issue for Wilson in his first term involved Mexico. In February 1913, just before Wilsons inauguration, Mexican army general Victoriano Huerta led a military coup against the elected moderate, President Francisco Madero, who was killed in the bloody overthrow. Many American investors wanted the U.S. government to support the new Huerta administration, but Wilson announced, “We can
•76 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890-1945
have no sympathy with those who seek the power of government to advance their own personal interests or ambitions. Wilson and Bryan believed that the coup was part of a battle between British and American oil companies, and they wanted none of it.
Wilson desperately wanted to let Mexico work out its own future. As he told the journalist Ray Stannard Baker, he “felt shame as an American over the first Mexican war” of 1848. He continued that it was “his resolution that while he was president there should be no such predatory war.” He also believed that a people had the right “to do as they damned pleased with their own affairs.” Baker added that the president did, indeed, use the word damned.
In spite of the president’s intentions, Americans had major investments in Mexico, and thousands of American citizens worked in Mexico as teachers, nurses, and construction workers. Wilson could not ignore the country, and he sent envoys to try to persuade Huerta to resign, but failed. He spoke passionately about “the self-restraint of a really great nation.” When a revolution against Huerta led by Venustiano Carranza and Francisco “Pancho” Villa broke out, Wilson recognized it. In April of 1914, when Wilson got word that a large shipment of European arms for Huerta’s government was on its way to the Mexican port of Veracruz, Wilson ordered the Navy to land at the port and stop the arms. The arms were stopped, but to Wilson’s surprise, Mexico did not welcome the intervention, Mexican forces fought the U.S. Marines, and 17 Americans were killed. Not only Huerta but also Carranza condemned what they called a U.S. invasion. The end result was good for Carranza. Without the new arms, Huerta resigned and went into exile, and Carranza rode into Mexico City as the victor. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile agreed to negotiate a solution, and the Americans withdrew from Veracruz.
Unfortunately, a new civil war began in Mexico when Villa split with Carranza. In March 1916, Villa, who was now leading a full-scale revolt, led several hundred troops in an attack on the U.S. border town of Columbus, New Mexico. They wanted arms that were stored at nearby U.S. Army Fort Furlong, but more important, the wily Villa wanted to create an international incident. He did not get the arms, but he did get the incident.
Wilson notified Carranza of his intention to respect Mexican sovereignty, but also ordered the U.S. Army, under General John J. Pershing, to enter Mexico and find Villa.

MAP 20-2 U.S. Intervention in the Caribbean and Latin America. Between 1865 and 1933, but especially under the administrations of McKinley and the "progressive presidents"—Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson—the United States intervened regularly in the nations of the Caribbean and Latin America.
Carranza had much to benefit from eliminating Villa and stayed out of the battle. Some 10,000 U.S. troops under Pershing’s command were well-equipped with motor vehicles and airplanes, but they never found Villa though they engaged in some bloody battles as they chased him through northern Mexico for months. Eventually in early 1917, as Wilson became more and more concerned with the war in Europe, the U.S. forces withdrew without success, and Villa survived until he was assassinated in 1923.
The United States intervened in several other Latin American matters during Wilson’s administration (see Map 20-2). Bryan offered an apology to Colombia for the U.S. role in the revolution that had separated Panama and negotiated a $25 million payment to Colombia. Roosevelt was furious at an obvious slap at his administration, and his friend Henry Cabot Lodge blocked authorization of the funds in the Senate. The United States sent Marines to end unrest in Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti; they stayed in Haiti until 1934. For all of their talk of nonintervention, Wilson and Bryan seemed quite willing to intervene in the Americas.

THE UNITED STATES AND THE GREAT WAR
20.4
Analyze the causes and consequences of U.S. involvement in World War I.
..
Just after the November 1912 election, while he was still living in Princeton, Presidentelect Wilson told one of his former faculty colleagues, “It would be an irony of fate if my administration had to deal chiefly with foreign problems, for all my preparation has been in domestic matters.” It was an irony that would come to pass with a vengeance.
War in Europe
On June 28, 1914, the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir apparent to the throne of the Austria-Hungarian Empire, and his wife, Sophie, were assassinated in the town of Sarajevo by a Serbian nationalist who wanted independence for Serbia. Nothing could have seemed as far removed from the United States than the murder of members of a central European royal family. However, within a very short time, the impact of the assassination was felt everywhere in the world.
In the summer of 1914, Europe was at peace. Even so, independence movements within the Austria-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, particularly in Balkan states (including Serbia), were challenging the empires’ central governments (see Map 20-3). In addition, a newly united Germany was angry at being shut out of the colonies in Africa and Asia by the speed with which the British and French had moved. An arms race had developed among the continent s greatest powers, and in their quest for security, European nations had developed a complex series of defensive alliances. Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Turkish Ottoman Empire were known as the Central Powers. Russia, France, and Great Britain were known simply as the Allies. All of these factors quickly led Europe to tumble into all-out war when Austria set out to punish Serbia and Russia came to the aid of the Serbians. By August, all of Europe was engulfed in what was called the Great War. (The term World War I was coined only after the outbreak of another great war in 1939, one which quickly came to be known as World War II.)
At the beginning of the war, many Europeans were caught up in patriotic fervor. Young men signed up promptly and marched off proudly. Both sides expected an easy victory. The German army attacked France by moving through neutral Belgium. It was a move that cost Germany dearly in public support, but it allowed the German army to get within 30 miles of Paris early in the war. Then an allied counteroffensive drove the Germans back, and by November 1914, both sides were dug in for the long trench warfare that would not move very much—though every small move cost thousands of soldiers their lives—until March of 1918. The long years of trench warfare were ghastly. In 1916 at the Battle of the Somme, 60,000 British soldiers were killed in a single day. In a year-long battle for the town of Verdun, a million soldiers were killed. New forms of artillery, tanks, and flamethrowers, along with the introduction of poisonous mustard gas, caused what seemed like never-ending waves of death while life in the trenches involved living for months with mud, rats, and rotten food. Despite these costs, the battle lines did not change significantly. Wilson called it “this vast gruesome contest of systematized destruction.”
The United States saw all of these developments as a distant tragedy. A young American mining engineer, Herbert Hoover, organized the Commission for Belgian Relief, which along with the American Red Cross, sent aid to people caught in the path of war. Hoover gained international fame as the “Napoleon of mercy, for his efforts. However, most Americans preferred not to get involved and agreed with U.S. ambassador to London Walter Hines Page, who said, “I thank Heaven for many things first the Atlantic Ocean.” President Wilson declared neutrality. He wanted to stay out of the war, and he understood that any European war would stir up deep tensions in a nation made up of immigrants from every one of the nations at war. Neutrality, however, would not be easy to maintain.

The warfare on land and on the oceans around Europe cut into U.S. trade, hurting wheat farmers and cotton growers who could not get their goods to European markets. Britain began to place large orders for farm products and for munitions while using its powerful navy to maintain a blockade of the Central Powers. War-torn Britain needed money to buy these things, but when J.P. Morgan began to float large loans, Secretary of State Bryan imposed a ban on loans to belligerents, seeking the “true spirit” of strict neutrality. Bryan’s ban hurt U.S. commerce, and Britain and France claimed it was prejudicial toward them, so Bryan and Wilson announced that “commercial credit could be extended to the allies. No one understood the difference between “commercial credit” and loans, but the distinction allowed the European allied powers to get the goods they wanted, U.S. farmers and manufacturers to profit, and everyone to pretend that neutrality was still maintained.
The Wilson administration had to steer a difficult course while facing considerable internal pressures. Former president Roosevelt urged massive buildup of the army
580 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890-1945
and navy as well as a military draft, all in the name of preparedness for an eventual war on the side of the British and French. From Roosevelt’s perspective, Wilson was dangerously passive.
In contrast, Progressive Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin and other politicians, especially those from states with large German populations led a peace movement, fearing that Wilson was edging toward war. Jane Addams led a large woman’s movement for peace. Many union leaders saw the war as a battle between European capitalists in which the working class should not be involved. Anarchists and socialists condemned the war. Between 1914 and 1916, in spite of Roosevelt’s best efforts to build support for preparedness and war, most Americans in and out of office favored keeping as far distant from Europe’s problems as possible.
Of the many diplomatic tensions that the war in Europe created, by far the greatest had to do with the German use of a new kind of sea power—the submarine, or U-boat. Britain s navy ruled the waves, but German U-boats could glide under the waves and strike at ships bringing supplies to Britain and France. On February 4,1915, the German Admiralty announced that the waters around Britain were a “war zone” and its submarines would freely attack any ship bringing supplies to Britain. Wilson and Bryan sent a formal diplomatic note that sinking ships without warning was “an act so unprecedented in naval warfare” that the United States would hold them to “a strict accountability for such acts.” No one defined what “strict accountability” meant. Somehow, submarine warfare—having a ship struck by a torpedo seemingly out of nowhere—terrified people in a way that direct ship-to-ship combat did not. Submarine warfare also threatened the profitable U.S. trade with Britain. For Wilson, it also raised the issue of basic rights of U.S. citizens, as neutrals, to travel freely. On the last point, the president and his secretary of state differed strongly. Bryan asked “whether an American citizen can, by putting his business above his regard for his country, assume for his own advantage unnecessary risk and thus involve his country in international complications.” For Wilson, the freedom of neutrals to travel was “in the interests of mankind,” and protecting the rights of neutrals under international law was a national duty.
In March 1915, a submarine sank a small British passenger ship, the Falaba, and an American citizen was killed. Then on May 7, 1915, a submarine sank the British liner Lusitania, the grandest and fastest ocean liner then in service. The Lusitania sank in 18 minutes and 1,198 people were killed, including 127 American citizens. The United States demanded an apology from Germany. When Bryan suggested also issuing a formal warning to American citizens not to travel on ships belonging to countries that were at war, Wilson refused.
In response to the American note, the German government sent secret orders to its submarine captains to avoid large passenger liners, but their official word to the United States was evasive. Wilson promised that if Germany would give up submarine warfare, he would also press Britain to end the blockade of goods flowing to Germany and Austria, but he also prepared a second note to Germany saying that the sinking of
Lusitania involved “principles of humanity.”
Bryan argued for protesting the British blockade and for linking the second note to a policy that would bar passenger ships from carrying munitions (the Lusitania may well have been carrying munitions in addition to passengers). Wilson thought that Bryan’s plan would undermine the needed message of protest. Bryan resigned rather than sign the second Lusitania note. He told the president that he was risking war by creating a situation where a foolish move by the German government could drag the United States into a war and that he could do more for peace building public opinion outside the administration than within. Bryan s departure was a sad parting between two people who had come to like and admire each other but who deeply believed in different courses of action. Robert Lansing became acting secretary and signed the note. Congress debated but did not pass a law barring Americans from travel on belligerent ships. Sinkings and diplomatic notes continued, as did American domestic politics and new developments in Woodrow Wilson s personal life.
Especially before the United States entered World War I, songs like"! Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier" were popular among many who did not want to see young American men caught up in the fighting.
Chapter 20 Foreign Policy and War in a Progressive Era 581
In the summer of 1914, as Europe began to move toward war, Ellen Wilson, the president’s wife of 30 years whose warmth offset Wilson s sometimes dour personality, became desperately ill. Her kidneys were failing, and through the summer, the president read diplomatic cables while sitting by his wife s bedside. She died at the White House at the beginning of August. The president wrote, “I never understood before what a broken heart meant.” Less than a year later, Wilson met a vivacious 42-year-old widow named Edith Bolling Galt and quickly fell in love. Although some in the cabinet worried about how the public would respond to a new marriage so quickly after the loss of his first wife, the two were married in December 1915. The nation had a new First Lady who would support Wilson and have a significant role in policy as war and illness later sapped his energy.
While Wilson was seeking to maintain neutrality and dealing with his personal life, 1916 was also an election year. After Ellen’s death, he had seriously considered not running, but his new personal life and his desire to see the diplomatic crisis through led him to declare his candidacy for a second term. The Republican Party was reunited and nominated Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes. Hughes had served two terms as governor of New York, but he had also been on the Supreme Court since 1910 and thus sat out the Roosevelt-Taft split. Roosevelt called him “the bearded iceberg,” but campaigned strongly for the ticket as did Taft. It was a very close contest, but in the end, Wilson carried California by 4,000 votes and, with it, the Electoral College.
A month after the election Wilson tried to broker a peace between Europe’s warring powers. He asked both sides for their demands. Germany indicated that it was willing to discuss peace, but a new British government led by Prime Minister Lloyd George said it had no interest in American mediation. Then in December, Lloyd George indicated willingness to talk while the Germans backed off. In the midst of this diplomacy, the German government made two fateful mistakes. On January 31, 1917, it announced to the United States that it was resuming “the full employment of all the weapons...at its disposal.” At the same time, German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann sent a secret cable to the German embassy in Mexico with an offer to the Carranza government—long estranged from Wilson and the United States—that if it would attack the United States, Germany would see to the restoration of the territory from Texas to California that had been taken from Mexico in 1848.
The British government managed to intercept and decode the Zimmermann telegram and release it to the public, turning much of American public opinion against Germany. Wilson was more concerned with unrestricted submarine warfare than any interference from Carranza. He broke diplomatic relations with Germany. He then asked Congress for authority to arm merchant ships, but La Follette and other Republican Progressives blocked the bill in the Senate. Wilson called them “a little group of willful men” and claimed the authority to arm the ships on executive authority. At the same time, other Americans, including former President Roosevelt were pressing Wilson to do more for Britain. As early as January 1915, Roosevelt, although out of office, wrote to British Foreign Minister Sir Edward Grey, calling Wilson’s lack of greater support for the British “very obstinate.” Roosevelt thought Wilson was stumbling in 1915 and was ready to march. In the end, when war came, it brought Roosevelt political and personal tragedy. Wilson would accept neither his advice to help Britain nor his offer of service, and in July 1918, Roosevelt’s beloved son Quentin was killed in combat in France.
From the German perspective, an immediate attack on supplies going to Britain and France was the only way to win the war. If they could block food and munitions from getting to the allies, then the Germans believed they could win the war before the United States could organize itself to do much harm. In March, U-boats sank three U.S. merchant ships with the loss of 15 American lives. As Bryan had warned, Wilson’s hard line meant that Germany had the initiative. The president felt he had run out of options. On April 2, 1917, Wilson appeared before a joint session of Congress and asked for a declaration of war against Germany.

Woodrow Wilson, War Message 1917
llfilson had spoken directly to Congress many times before. Inf Nevertheless, when he decided that the United States needed to go to war on the side of Britain and France the words took on a new level of importance. Everyone knew what he would ask, but they waited to hear his reasons.
Gentlemen of the Congress:
On the 3d of February last I officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government that on and after the 1st day of February it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports of Great Britain and Ireland or the western coasts of Europe.... Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character, their cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents....
With a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves, but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional duty, I advise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial German Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the Government and people of the United States; that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it....
What this will involve is clear. It will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with Germany....It will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war....It will involve the immediate full equipment of the Navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the enemy's submarines. It
will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the United States already provided for by law in case of war at least 500,000 men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service....It will involve also, of course, the granting of adequate credits to the Government, sustained, I hope, so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present generation, by well conceived taxation....
One of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity....That it means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors the intercepted note to the German Minister at Mexico City is eloquent evidence....
The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind.

The War at Home—Support and Opposition
Not everyone was convinced by Wilsons eloquence. In the Senate, Wisconsins La
Follette and George Norris of Nebraska led the opposition to a declaration of war.
Norris, a Republican long part of the Progressive movement, said, We have loaned
many hundreds of millions of dollars to the allies in this controversy. And he saw the
war as simply a way to defend those loans, insisting, “We are going into war upon the
command of gold.” He would have none of it. When the vote came, six Senators, three
Republican and three Democrats, opposed the war. In the House, 50 Representatives
voted no on the war resolution. The most dramatic vote came from Jeannette Rankin
of Montana. Rankin was the only woman in the House, elected at a time when women
in most states still did not have the vote. She was under intense pressure from some
suffragists, who planned to demand votes for patriotic women as a war measure, to
vote for the war, but in the roll call Rankin answered, “I want to stand by my country,
but I cannot vote for war. I vote no.” (In 1941, after a long absence, Rankin would

be on the floor of Congress again and would be the single no vote against U.S. entry into World War II.) Once the United States was formally at war, the previous antiwar constituency split between those including Bryan, who believed that once the United States had made the decision to go to war everyone should support the war effort, and others—from Jane Addams to Eugene V. Debs to Emma Goldman who continued to oppose the war no matter what the president asked or how the Congress voted. Despite the opposition, once the United States was formally at war in the spring of 1917, the Wilson administration set out to do everything possible to assure the support of every citizen. In his war speech Wilson had said, “If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression.” He meant it.
To build support for the war, Wilson created the Committee on Public Information (CPI) and appointed the respected progressive journalist George Creel as its head. No one could challenge Creel’s progressive credentials as a muckraker, supporter of women’s rights, and political reformer. Creel rejected crude propaganda, insisting that “[a] free people cannot be told what to think. They must be given the facts and permitted to do their own thinking.” Creel also insisted that he and the Wilson administration would be the ones to decide what “facts” to give people and, more seriously, what alternative “facts” should be blocked.
Creel announced, “It was a fight for the minds of men, for the ‘conquest of their convictions,’ and the battle-line ran through every home in the country.” Under his leadership, the CPI hired other muckraking journalists, including Ray Stannard Baker and Ida Tarbell, and published 75 million pamphlets supporting the U.S. war effort. They recruited 75,000 “Four Minute Men,” volunteers who were ready to speak at a moment’s notice in favor of the war effort and against Germany at any theater or neighborhood meeting. He worked with the still-new movie studios to create films like The Kaiser: Beast of Berlin. Creel’s CPI launched a special “War Americanization Plan” to encourage foreign-born immigrants, especially those from the Central Powers, to buy Liberty Bonds and otherwise assert their American patriotism. He also hired Charles Dana Gibson, famous for creating the nation’s model of feminine beauty in the “Gibson Girl,” to produce prowar posters that would glorify the American war effort and call on all Americans to purchase war bonds and tend home vegetable gardens—or victory gardens—as well as for young men to serve in the army. The government also launched “war study courses” to encourage patriotism and loyalty among public school students. Creel was confident enough of his efforts that he opposed more blatant limitations on civil liberties. After the war, he wrote, “Better far to have the desired compulsions proceed from within than to apply them from without.”
Herbert Hoover, who had gained fame organizing support for people in war ravaged Belgium, became the head of the U.S. Food Administration and urged Americans to support the war by eating less and conserving more so that food could be sent to the troops or the Allies. Like Creel, Hoover believed that voluntary compliance was most effective, so he rejected rationing in favor of what he described as mobilizing “the spirit of self-denial and self-sacrifice in this country.” People got the widely touted message, “FOOD WILL WIN THE WAR—DON’T WASTE IT.” The federal government also created the Fuel Administration and the War Industries Board and took direct control of the nation’s railroads. Most of the new agencies were led by business executives, and the criticism of business leaders that had characterized Wilson’s first term virtually disappeared as the nation’s corporate elite became essential supporters of the war effort.
While Creel led the government’s “fight for the minds” of the American people and Hoover tried to change their eating habits, other self-styled patriots had their own agendas. The nongovernmental American Protective League (APL), which eventually grew to 250,000 members, included some who had opposed German immigrants or domestic political radicals and who saw the war as a time to further their agenda. APL members, without government authority, opened mail and listened in on telephone calls, looking for spies and traitors. Fearing such animosity, many German-Americans 1890-1945
were careful to demonstrate their loyalty. The Deutsches Haus of Indianapolis became the Athenaeum of Indiana; sauerkraut became liberty cabbage; and German language classes, schools, and newspapers were closed. On occasion, the split between those who supported and those who opposed U.S. involvement in the war turned violent. A few months after the United States entered the war, during the hot summer of 1917, some 2,000 members of the APL along with the sheriff of Bisbee, Arizona, raided a mass meeting of the Industrial Workers of the World—the large and radical union that strongly opposed the war—and rounded up over a thousand IWW members and supporters, a third of whom were Mexican-American, leaving them out on the desert without food or water for 2 days before letting them escape to New Mexico. A German-American, Robert Prager, was lynched by a mob in Collinsville, Illinois. An IWW organizer, Frank Little, was lynched in Butte, Montana, after he told striking copper miners that they were battling an “imperialist, capitalist war.” An editorial in the Washington Post said of the violence, “In spite of excesses such as lynching, it is a healthful and wholesome awakening in the interior of the country.”
In 1917 and 1918, Congress passed several acts to control the country’s responses to the war, including the Sedition Act of 1918 and the Espionage Act of 1917, giving the government vast new powers to limit free speech and the press that had not been seen in the United States since the Alien and Sedition Acts of the John Adams administration. The Sedition Act of 1918 made illegal “uttering, printing, writing, or publishing any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the government of the United States...or the military or naval forces of the United States.” Postmaster General Albert Burleson banned from the U.S. mail anything that he thought violated the act. Attorney General Thomas W. Gregory and his successor A. Mitchell Palmer prosecuted violators or left it to local U.S. attorneys to do so.
In spite of government policies and the efforts of many in organizations like the APL to force all Americans to support the war, dissenters continued to speak out. Jane Addams, leader of the Women’s Peace Party as well as Chicago’s Hull House, spoke to the City Club of Chicago just after war had been declared, saying, “That the United States has entered the war has not changed my views of the invalidity of war as a method of settlement of social problems a particle, and I can see no reason why one should not say what one believes in time of war as in time of peace....” Her words were greeted only by silence from the club women. The National Federation of Settlements, which Addams had helped to found, said, “It has been very painful to many of us who hold Miss Addams in deep affection and wholly respect her, to find that we cannot

think or act in unison with her.”
Jane Addams continued to oppose the war and seek international mediation to end it. She not only wanted the United States out of the war but also wanted to end the war wherever it was fought. At the same time, Addams, ever the practical settlement house leader, sought to ensure that there was “bread in time of war,” no matter who needed to eat. She happily cooperated with the U.S. government s Food Administration though she objected to its slogan, “Food Will Win the War.” Nevertheless, Addams urged residents of Chicago to plant vegetable gardens and consume less so that more could be sent to those in greatest need.
While Addams was snubbed for her antiwar stance, others paid a much higher price. Radical leaders were watched carefully for “unpatriotic” words and actions.
Over a hundred IWW and Socialist Party leaders were arrested and jailed on charges of violating the Sedition Act. In June 1918, Eugene V. Debs told a huge rally in Canton, Ohio, “I realize that, in speaking to you this afternoon, there are certain limitations placed upon the right of free speech. But Debs also made it clear that he was equally as opposed to the leadership of Germany as to that of the Allies for, he said, all sides were using working people to fight their battles. So he continued, “Ihe master class has always declared the wars; the subject class has always fought the battles. In particular, he added, “[T]he working class who make the supreme sacrifices, the working class who freely shed their blood and furnish the corpses, have never yet had a

Schenck v. United States
The first of several decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the Sedition and Espionage Acts.
Knowing that the Americans were coming, the British and French launched a major offensive in the summer of 1917. As with previous efforts, the offensive was turned back, and the terrible losses led to mutinies throughout the French army. The Allied armies seemed to be losing the will to fight.
On Germany’s eastern front, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in November 1917 led to a new government that wanted nothing to do with the war. The Bolsheviks signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk which ended the war between Germany and Russia on German terms, the most important term of all being that Germany could now focus exclusively on the western front and attack France in the spring of 1918.
The treaty did not come in time to save Germany, however. By 1918, 850,000 fresh U.S. troops had arrived, and they quickly went into combat, while the German troops were exhausted by 4 years of war. For the German soldiers, the fact that they were facing so many well-armed fresh troops undermined morale as much as any specific American victories, though those victories were not without importance. At Chateau-Thierry in June of 1918, U.S. forces helped stop a German offensive toward Paris. By that fall, the Americans were part of an Allied effort that had driven the German army out of France and back inside Germany. The end was becoming clear. An armistice was signed, and on November 11, 1918, at 11:00 a.m., the guns of Europe fell silent.

soldiers began arriving in France in the summer of 1918 and were quickly moved to the front lines. While presidents and generals planned, those doing the actual fighting—recent arrivals to war from farms and crowded city neighborhoods—told their own stories of fighting, fear, bravery, and sorrow, including this one recorded by Mathew Chopin while still in France, waiting for a ship home in early 1919.
At early dawn we continued advancing "over the top" through clouds of gas and smoke—under rain of machine gun bullets, shrapnel and steel. The Huns [as most Americans called the Germans during the war] were shelling heavily the edge of the roadside. It was freezing cold; we were out of water and had just a small ration of salmon and hard-tack. Completely exhausted and thirsting for a drink, I remember grabbing a canteen from a passing artillery caisson to soothe my parched lips, when the explosion of a shell sent over deadly gas, getting four of our men. We got down in a valley for awhile during a machine gun barrage and then up again, firing away at the enemy as fast as our automatics could work....
So many of our men were getting wounded and as the litter-bearer was killed while going out under fire for wounded, my sergeant sent me with another man to replace him. It was a dangerous situation going over rounds of Hell, as we had to go up
and get them under machine gun and rifle fire... .We began picking up the wounded as fast as they came and bandaging those in need of first aid. It was a heartrending sight that weakened the strongest, for everywhere were wounded and lifeless forms— some all torn to pieces, their limbs and heads entirely severed from their bodies! I remember making a trip about a mile under heavy gun fire to get a wounded stretcher-bearer whose partner had been killed. He was a game little Yank, yet a pitiful sight, with his side all ripped open by shrapnel. As I laid him gently on the stretcher, I still remember his last uttered words, "Oh God, if I could only live to die at home!"

588 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890-1945
The peace talks at Versailles brought together a wide range of world leaders but were dominated by the leaders of Great Britain, France, and the United States.
someone, and for a generation, young women outnumbered young men by significant numbers. Ships were sunk, villages and towns destroyed, national economies wrecked. While some including Wilson wanted to use the end of the war to secure “a just and lasting peace,” others wanted vengeance, and still others wanted to forget all about war and simply have a good time in a life that they knew could be cut all too short. Amid all these conflicting political and emotional crosscurrents, leaders of the victorious nations met in Paris at the beginning of 1919 to write a peace treaty.
Woodrow Wilson, who had broken precedent early in his term by speaking directly to Congress, broke precedent again when the war ended. He sailed for Paris to personally lead the American delegation at the Paris peace talks. No American president had ever left the United States while in office, and some even wondered whether it was constitutional to do so. Wilson waived the concerns aside. Modern communications would allow him to remain in close touch with Washington while he was across the Atlantic. The British, French, and Italian Prime Ministers were all going to be present, and Wilson had no intention of handing the American role off to anyone else.
When the president and Mrs. Wilson arrived in Brest, France, on December 13, 1918, they were greeted as heroes, and they continued to be honored as they toured France, Britain, and Italy. A banner on the Champs-Elysees in Paris announced, “Honor to Wilson the Just,” and an American newspaper reporter wrote, “No one ever had such cheers.” It must have been a satisfying moment for the war-weary president. For Wilson, one ominous cloud over the negotiations
was the fact that Republicans had made substantial gains in the congressional elections of November 1918 in spite of his impassioned appeal to the voters to keep the Democrats in charge while he negotiated a treaty. Then, while he was in France in January 1919, Wilson received a telegram that his arch-rival Theodore Roosevelt had died. A reporter said he thought he saw a look of pity and then a smile of triumph on the president’s face, though Wilson was far too diplomatic to say anything.
When the Paris peace talks convened at the old royal palace of Versailles, Wilson thought he was in a very strong bargaining position given the role of U.S. resources and troops in bringing the war to a successful conclusion for the allies. His counterparts thought differently. Georges Clemenceau, the tough 77-year-old French premier, wanted vengeance for France’s terrible losses, and British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, though more moderate than Clemenceau, harbored nothing like Wilson’s generous spirit. France and Britain had lost 10 to 20 times as many soldiers as the United States, most of the battles had been fought in France, and neither leader nor their followers were in any mood to be generous. The losers—Germany, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire—were excluded from the conference. The new communist government of Russia, which had signed its own separate treaty with Germany in early 1918, was also excluded from the peace conference, and Wilson sent troops to try and support the overthrow of the communist government, which would lead to long-term tension between Russia and the United States.
Since 1916, Wilson had been telling his fellow Americans what he wanted from a peace conference. He insisted the traditional U.S. isolationism could not continue and the nation must be willing to “become a partner in any feasible association of nations to maintain the peace.” In October, just before the presidential election, he told an audience in Omaha, Nebraska, “we are part of the world.” And in January 1917, he told the Senate that the United States wanted “peace without victory.” His goal was to avoid future wars based on the “covenant of a new international organization that would ensure that “no such catastrophe shall ever overwhelm us again.

20.4
In January 1918, as the United States went to war, Wilson outlined what came to be known as his Fourteen Points. The president said that America insisted on “open covenants of peace, openly arrived at.” The commitment to openness was a mix of Wilsonian idealism and a reaction to the release by the new Russian leader, V. I. Lenin, of secret agreements that had been negotiated by the czarist government, Britain, and France. Although he did not use the word “self-determination,” Wilson condemned old-style European imperialism and, indeed, any wars fought for territory. He insisted that the many diverse nationalities living within the Austria-Hungarian and Ottoman Turkish empires should have “an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development (see Map 20-4).” Most of all, he called for a “general association of nations” to preserve peace.
Wilson stayed at the peace conference for 6 months except for one 2-week return trip to the United States. He did not have as much success as he expected. He was not well-staffed. He found himself in painful meetings with the three European premiers who had different goals from his and who, especially Clemenceau, obviously did not respect him.
The treaty that emerged from the peace conference was, perhaps inevitably, a disappointment to everyone. Wilson got his League of Nations, which would include not just the allies—as Clemenceau initially wanted—but would be open to every nation of the world. The league’s covenant included Article X in which member nations agreed to “respect and preserve as against external aggression the political integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League.” However, though the League now existed, Wilson had also paid a high price to get it.
Clemenceau compromised on his initial goal of dividing Germany into several smaller nation-states, but he won on achieving strict limits to German military power, temporary occupation of the Rhineland, and a “war guilt” clause, which meant that Germany should pay most of the war’s cost. Most of the world’s non-European

kPart VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890-1945
peoples were bitterly disappointed with the treaty. Middle Eastern and African colo-
nies that had belonged to the defeated Central Powers expected to be granted their
independence by the peace conference. Instead, they became “mandates” assigned to
various victorious powers that were supposed to grant them independence at some
unspecified future date. Japan, which had played only a modest role in the war, won
the right to continue its control over Shandong province in China, leading a young
Mao Zedong to call the treaty really shameless.” In addition, protests erupted in
India, Egypt, Korea, and China over other provisions in the treaty.
African-American leaders also protested the failure of the Treaty of Versailles to respect the right of citizens of former German colonies in Africa or mention racial discrimination in the final treaty. W.E.B. Du Bois tried to organize a Pan-African conference in Paris to protest the treaty’s failings, but the British government would not give passports to Africans from British colonies who wanted to attend, and the U.S.
State Department refused permission to American delegates, including Madame C.
J.
Walker, the first African-American woman millionaire, and journalists Ida Wells-Barnett and William Monroe Trotter. Du Bois made it to the meeting only by signing up as a cook on a freighter bound for France. During the peace negotiations, several new nations were created within Europe—
Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia—that were supposed to recognize the hopes for independence by ethnic groups who had been dominated by the old tottering Austria-Hungary and Ottoman empires, but the mapping of those boundaries set off its own ethnic tensions, especially for people who suddenly became an ethnic minority in a new country (see Map 20-5).
Wilson convinced himself that he had gotten as good a treaty as he could—which was perhaps true given the other actors at the peace conference—and he invested his greatest hopes in the idea that the League of Nations could resolve any remaining issues. He signed the treaty at Versailles in June 1919 and sailed for home. On July 10, Wilson personally spoke to the U.S. Senate, asking them to ratify the treaty. He reminded his audience of the nation’s high ideals in going to war and the fact that “in the settlements of the peace we have sought no special reparation for ourselves.” The key to the whole treaty and, indeed, to future peace, Wilson continued, was that the League of Nations was “the only hope of mankind.” So he begged the Senate to ratify the treaty immediately without any amendments, asking, “Shall we or any other free peoples hesitate to accept this great duty? Dare we reject it and break the heart of the world?” The Senate, which had final authority to approve any treaty, would take 8 months to give Wilson his answer.
Wilson was greeted as a hero when he arrived home in the United States, and public opinion seemed to be on his side, but there were problems lurking for the Versailles Treaty. The battle over the treaty has often been portrayed, as it was by Wilson, as one between his internationalism and an older isolationist view of America; however, the issues were more complex. Wilson had made the treaty needlessly partisan by campaigning vigorously, but unsuccessfully, for a Democratic victory in the 1918 elections and then failing to take any Republican leaders with him to Paris. He had also lost many of his strongest supporters who were disillusioned by the attack on civil liberties that he had allowed during the war and the compromises he had made at Paris. Some senators such as California’s Hiram Johnson and Idaho s William Borah opposed any binding promise to intervene in other nation s affairs. Borah said that he wanted not isolation but freedom to do as our own people think wise and just.
The greatest threat to the treaty came from Massachusetts Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who hated the treaty and hated Wilson even more. Lodge objected to the treaty for many reasons.
He feared the treaty, he said, because it gave an international organization “the power to send American soldiers and sailors everywhere a power, Lodge insisted, which ought never to be taken from the American people or impaired in the slightest degree.
Some thought Lodge was less concerned about the league than about the insult to

people like himself who had been excluded from the treaty-making process and his personal animosity to the president. Nevertheless, Lodge insisted that the issues were beyond party, that the United States “is the world’s best hope but if you fetter her in the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, you will destroy her power for good and endanger her very existence.”
592 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890-1945
As he had done at Princeton and in New Jersey state politics when he faced opposition, Wilson appealed over the heads of his immediate opponents to a wider audience, in this case, the whole nation. In the fall of 1919, Wilson began a 10,000-mile tour of the country, giving 40 speeches in 21 days to enthusiastic audiences, asking them to tell their senators to support the treaty. The public response was gratifying but did not move votes in the Senate. Ihe trip also broke the president’s already fragile health. On September 25 at Pueblo, Colorado, after a speech in which he said that with the treaty he had negotiated, “international law is revolutionized by putting morals into it,” and promising that his beloved league would “lead us, and through us the world, out into pastures of quietness and peace such as the world never dreamed of before,” he collapsed and admitted that he could not go on. After he returned to the White House, Wilson suffered a life-threatening infection and a massive stroke that left him partially paralyzed. Ihe medical conditions may also have clouded his judgment and made him more stubborn.
Ihe Senate Foreign Relations Committee recommended approval of the treaty but with 14 reservations, including one insisting that the U.S. military could not be sent to defend Article X without specific congressional approval. Wilson adamantly refused to consider the reservations. In a final vote on November 18 and 19, 1919, the Senate first came to a tie vote for the treaty with reservations—far short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve a treaty. Then on a second vote in which they considered the treaty without reservations, the Senate defeated the entire treaty by a vote of 55 to 39. Ihe League of Nations would be launched in Geneva, Switzerland, but without the participation of the United States. Wilson’s grand vision for a world at peace with the United States as a leader was dead. Many argued that the president’s refusal to compromise had been among the forces that killed it. Colonel House, who had once been Wilson’s closest confidant, wrote that he had once thought that Senator Lodge was the worst enemy of the treaty, but before the debates and votes were over, he had decided that the worst enemy had actually been Wilson himself.
With the end of World War I, Europe had a dramatically different map and the United States had a dramatically different political situation. People who had fervently gone to war in 1917 were tired and cynical by 1919. The cost of the war in lives, money, and liberties led many to question the governmental and business leaders who had been most enthusiastic about it. By 1920, many in the nation were ready to forget high-sounding idealism, progressive or otherwise. It was, perhaps, time for more joy or, at least, the election of a more genial and less idealistic president.
Quick Review How did U.S. participation in World War I shape Wilson's presidency?
CONCLUSION
During the Progressive Era, the United States began to look outward more than in the past and to extend its power and influence further across the globe. The three American leaders known as the “progressive presidents”—Theodore Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson—all spent much of their administrations dealing with foreign policy. In what some have called “the age of U.S. imperialism, the United States took control of vast new territories, including Hawaii, a number of Pacific islands, the Canal Zone in Panama, as well as Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippine Islands. Alaska, which had previously been purchased from Russia now became an official U.S. territory, Hawaii was annexed after an American-led revolt on the island, and the Canal Zone was acquired by treaty after complex negotiations with Panama and Colombia. Most of the other territories came under U.S. control as a result of the 1898 War with Spain. While Cuba and the Philippine Islands eventually attained independence, U.S. influence continued there for a long time.

The increased involvement of the United States in international affairs in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and its expanded territorial reach, made the United States a major world power. Consequently, diplomatic tensions began to mount, especially between the United States and Latin America, where construction of the American-controlled Panama Canal and military interventions in Mexico, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti created resentment. Although the United States had successfully brokered a peace agreement between Russia and Japan in 1905, further U.S. involvement in Asia coupled with anti-Asian legislation in California, embittered the Japanese. Many within the United States also opposed American involvement in the affairs of the rest of the world, especially after the 1898 War with Spain and the continued U.S. occupation of the Philippine Islands.
After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) went to war against the Allies (Russia, France, and Great Britain). Americans were divided about the conflict and looked to President Wilson to maintain U.S. neutrality. However, for some Americans, feelings changed when German U-boats sank three U.S. merchant ships and a British ocean liner, which killed 127 American citizens. The publication of a secret German cable to Mexico—known as the Zimmermann telegram—in which Germany promised the return of Texas to Mexico if Mexico would attack the United States, turned more of American public opinion against Germany. In 1917, when Germany expanded its submarine attacks, the United States entered the war.
Support for U.S. involvement in the war was not universal, and a large and vocal peace movement emerged. But the Wilson administration pressed for a series of laws to silence dissent. In particular, the Sedition Act and the Espionage Act gave the government unprecedented power to restrict free speech. The Supreme Court upheld these laws, and many antiwar protesters were prosecuted and jailed.
By 1918, the Allies, with support from American troops, had defeated the Central Powers and an armistice was signed. At the Paris peace talks, President Wilson hoped to secure a lasting peace and favored treaty provisions that called for a League of Nations. Republican opposition to the league blocked U.S. adoption of the treaty, and the League of Nations was launched without American involvement.

1920s___________________________________ Analyze the political and policy developments of the decade.
Almost as soon as the era ended, journalists and historians began talking about the “Jazz Age” or simply, “the 1920s,” as a way to describe a distinct era in American history. The 11 years that was framed by the end of World War I in November 1918 and the stock market crash of October 1929 was unique in many ways. As troops returned to the Unites States from their service in Europe during World War I and as national leaders debated the Treaty of Versailles at the start of this era, many Americans wanted to forget about the rest of the world and its troubles. They expected the resulting peace to usher in a time of pleasure and plenty.
For many white middle-class Americans, the twenties were, indeed, a time of great prosperity and a time to enjoy the freedom of the Jazz Age. However for others, including many white farmers in the Midwest and South, southern black sharecroppers, and American Indians living on isolated reservations, the twenties were not prosperous at all. For many recent immigrants and for residents of small towns and rural areas the 1920s were a decade when they felt especially marginalized; when it was clear that sophisticated urban dwellers looked down on them and their cultural and religious values and their resentment took many forms. Understanding the differing experiences of those who lived through this decade is the focus of this chapter.

When the guns of World War I fell silent on November 11, 1918, the world celebrated. While the United States had been spared much of the war’s cost, many Americans were not sure what to make of the postwar world. Some Americans had talked of socialism, even communism, since the strikes of the 1870s, but most did not follow their lead. As a result of World War I, communists had seized control of Russia. Some Americans celebrated the new Russian government, but many more feared it and wondered whether there might be links between Americas homegrown radicals and Russia. For African-Americans who had fought in the war, had risked their lives for democracy, and had seen different cultures, the idea of returning to a United States with rigid segregation generated new tensions and determination. Other African-Americans had moved North to take war-time jobs, and they had no intention of returning to the segregated South. To the surprise of some, within months of the armistice, the country quickly became a very tense place.
With the coming of peace, American workers wanted a part of the new postwar prosperity and tried to gain back the money they had lost from stagnant wages in an era of wartime inflation. In January 1919, 35,000 shipyard workers went on strike in Seattle, Washington, and a month later, 60,000 workers in other industries joined them. The week-long Seattle General Strike, when virtually no one in the city went to work, stands as the largest citywide strike in U.S. history, and it frightened many.
The Seattle strike was the largest but hardly the only strike in 1919. Textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the scene of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike (see Chapter 18), engaged in a short and successful strike to demand a 48-hour work week in January 1919. In September, the police force of Boston, Massachusetts, who had not received a raise since 1913, went on strike. Without a police force in Boston, mobs looted stores and bars, the police commissioner created a temporary voluntary force, and Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge gained national fame when he fired all of the striking police officers, saying, “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.”
While people debated the right of public employees to strike, steel workers went out on strike in September 1919 after the chairman of U.S. Steel, Judge Elbert Gary, refused to meet with union representatives. A month later, coal miners walked off the job, just as the nation’s demand for coal for winter heat was beginning.
Strikes were not the only signs of political chaos in 1919. In April, bombs arrived in the mail of Postmaster General Albert Burleson, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, several members of the U.S. Senate, Seattle’s antistrike Mayor Hanson, and federal immigration authorities and judges. Not one of them was injured, but no one ever discovered who sent the bombs. On May Day, an international Socialist holiday in honor of the Haymarket events (see Chapter 18), riots erupted in several cities, including Cleveland, Ohio, where one socialist was killed and 40 injured in a parade. A few days later, a protester in Washington, DC, was shot and killed when he refused to stand for the national anthem. The crowd applauded. The American Legion, a new organization of returning soldiers, promised to uphold Americanism and attack radicals. In Centralia, Washington, an IWW group killed four parading Legion members, and the Legion lynched an IWW organizer.
At the same time, the worldwide influenza pandemic that began in 1918 came to the United States. During 1919, half a million Americans died of the flu, many more than had died in the war. The influenza did not discriminate between young and old or rich and poor. Although its source was microbes, not radicals, the influenza epidemic contributed to the sense that something was terribly wrong in the postwar world.
