THE REVOLUTION WAS IN THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE
Explain why, in the 15 years before the Revolutionary War began, support for the patriot cause spread so quickly among many different groups of North Americans who opposed Britain for different reasons.
THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE
Explain how political and military strategy, support for the patriot cause, and American alliances with France and Spain led to an American victory in the war for independence.
On May 28, 1754, George Washington, then a 22-year-old gentleman farmer recently promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Virginia militia, and Tanaghrisson, an Iroquois chief, led a force of Virginia militia and Indians to attack French soldiers in what is now western Pennsylvania. The French troops had been sent from Fort Duquesne-modern Pittsburgh—to look for Washington’s force. Fort Duquesne was part of a string of French forts built along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to maintain New France’s claims in the region. The French perspective was that the English were trespassing on their territory. Washington, however, was asserting the British claim to the Ohio River Valley.
The English-Iroquois force surprised the French with a dawn attack. It had been raining and the French had failed to post sentries. Ten of the French were killed and 22 taken prisoner. The shots fired that May morning in what came to be called Jumonville Glen, after the French commander who was killed there, were among the first in a war that would have effects worldwide.
Although Washington defeated the French in that first attack, he knew that a much larger French force actually controlled the Ohio River Valley. He retreated from Jumonville Glen and built a small armed camp that he named Fort Necessity. In July, 50 French soldiers and 300 of their Indian allies forced Washington to surrender. The French allowed the English to return to Virginia but only after Washington signed a document admitting that he had attacked and killed—or assassinated, depending on how one translated the French—French troops in the May skirmish while Britain and France were officially at peace. That skirmish in Western Pennsylvania helped provoke a world war in the 1750s, and that war then influenced the residents of British North America, including George Washington, to fight for and win their independence in the 1770s.
Far more than anyone else, George Washington dominated the era leading up to and through the American Revolution. It is important to remember that for much of this time, he was an officer in the British army before becoming—as shown here—a leader of the American forces.

Explain Britain's victory over France in the French and Indian War and what conflicts followed this victory.
In North America, the world war that started near Pittsburgh was known as the French and Indian War. Because of its outcome, French Canadians came to call it the War of Conquest. In most of Europe, it was called the Seven Years’ War. Whatever the war was called, it was fought over more of the planet than any previous war. The voyages of Columbus and subsequent maritime trade and migrations had created a vast interactive world, and in 1756, that world exploded.
The French and Indian War, 1754-1763
In North America, the formal declaration of war in 1756—two years after Washingtons skirmish with the French—surprised no one. The English and their Iroquois allies were in constant tension with the French and their Ottawa, Delaware, and Shawnee allies. Both sides hated each other and were ready for war.
During that time, Britain and France were also sliding toward war in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. In January 1756, England and the German kingdom of Prussia agreed to defend each other s territory. In response, Austria signed a treaty with France. War among these countries was declared in May 1756, and the French navy defeated a British fleet in the Mediterranean the next month. Counting on his English allies to provide support, King Frederick the Great of Prussia then attacked Austria and Russia. Sweden and Saxony joined the French alliance against Prussia.
The war quickly spread to Asia. The British East India Company and the French Compagnie des Indes each controlled parts of the Indian subcontinent, either directly or through alliances with local rulers. Suraj ud Dowlah, the ruler of Bengal, who was allied with France, used the situation to attack and capture British Calcutta. A British force

under Robert Clive retook the city and the French post at Chandernagor. British control of Bengal, won in that war, laid the foundation for Britain’s 200-year rule in India.
Ihe British also attacked the main African slave-trading island of Goree off the coast of Senegal and took control of it from the French, hurting the French economy but having no impact on the slave trade on the island. Goree had been the port for transshipment of slaves since the Portuguese founded it in the 1500s and was valuable no matter which
While battles took place in North America, Europe, India, and Africa, much of the Seven Years’ War was fought in the Caribbean. British warships based in Jamaica captured the French islands of Grenada, the Grenadines, St. Vincent, Dominica, and Tobago as well as Martinique and Guadeloupe with their rich sugar plantations. At the war’s end in 1763, Martinique and Guadeloupe were returned to France in exchange for concessions in North America, but the British kept the remaining islands. After Spain entered the war on the side of France in 1761, the British captured Havana, Cuba, and Manila in the Philippines, all of which were returned to Spain in 1763 in exchange for Spanish Florida.
The war changed the landscape of North America (see Map 5-1 and Map 5-2). In 1758, after a French force defeated the English at Fort Ticonderoga in New York, a

British force—with George Washington as one of its officers—took Fort Duquesne, renaming it Fort Pitt (today’s Pittsburgh) in honor of William Pitt, who had led Britain as prime minister during the war. That same year, Teedyuscung, leader of the Delaware tribe, decided that his French allies could not be trusted and sought an alliance with the English and the Iroquois. Although Teedyuscung and the Delaware did not get the Pennsylvania lands they sought, they and the Iroquois received a British promise that after the war there would be no white settlement west of the Alleghenies—a promise the British attempted to keep until the American Revolution.
In the most significant North American battle, a British army under General James Wolfe defeated a French army led by the Marquis de Montcalm and captured Quebec, the capital of French Canada, in September 1759. The British victory ended French control of all of Canada.

By the early 1760s, both Britain and France were exhausted from the fighting. Although Britain had won major victories, its new king, George III (r. 1760-1820) wanted peace, and in 1763, the two countries signed the Treaty of Paris to end the war. (Both this treaty and the later treaty ending the American Revolution in 1783 were known as the Treaty of Paris.) The world war had many outcomes. All of the governments that fought the war emerged deeply in debt. In Europe, little land changed hands, but in other parts of the world, the changes were dramatic. Britain made concessions to bring hostilities to an end, but was still the biggest winner. Its dominance of India was secure, and the British presence on the coast of Africa and in the Caribbean was enhanced. In addition, Spain ceded Florida to England. Most significantly, the war eliminated France as a North American power although France did regain its control of the rich sugar-producing islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean. France ceded Canada and the land east of the Mississippi River to the British. To compensate its Spanish allies for their support, France also ceded its claim to the lands west of the Mississippi River, along with New Orleans, to Spain. The French threat to New England and New York ended. Britain now controlled most of North America east of the Mississippi River.
Pontiac and Indian Responses
Hendrick, a chief of the Mohawk tribe—one of the nations of the Iroquois—was a close ally of the British until killed in battle in 1755.
For American Indians living between the Mississippi River and the Atlantic, the end of the French and Indian War was an unmitigated disaster. As a British official had said, “to preserve the balance between us and the French is the great ruling principle of the modern Indian politics.” For the tribes further south—including the Cherokee and Creeks—the Spanish presence in Florida had allowed them to play a three-way balancing act between Britain, France, and Spain. But with the French and Spanish out of eastern North America for the time being, the potential for bargaining virtually disappeared.
Even for the Iroquois, the cost was high. Although they were allied with the British, Iroquois power had partly come from Britain’s need for Iroquois allies in its competition with the French. After 1763, the French were gone. At the war’s beginning, the Iroquois Chief Hendrick, or Theyanoguin, had told the representatives of the British colonies who met at Albany, New York:
Brethren—The Governor of Virginia and the Governor of Canada, are both quarrelling.... The Governor of Virginia and Pennsylvania have made paths thro’ our Country.. .they should have first asked our consent.
Without the presence of the French in Canada, the British governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania had little reason to ask the Iroquois for consent to anything. The British general Lord Jeffrey Amherst, seeking to save money for his government and seeing no reason now to placate the Indians, refused to provide the gifts of ammunition and gunpowder that various tribes had come to see as a kind of rent for the use of their lands. The Indians considered the move to be both an insult and a fundamental threat since the tribes’ survival depended on the gunpowder to hunt deer.
For the Indians who had sided with the French, the outlook was even worse. Neolin, a Delaware, living on the Ohio River, preached resistance to the “dogs clothed in red” as he called the British. His visionary message, calling on the Indians to return to the “original state that they were in before the white people found out their country,” sparked a wide-ranging Indian movement to return to former Indian ways.
Pontiac, an Ottawa chief, was inspired and heeded Neolin’s call, sparking what came to be known as Pontiac’s Rebellion. In the spring of 1763, only months after the Treaty of Paris was signed, Pontiac

THINKING HISTORICALLY
Pontiac's Vision
Seeking support for an uprising, Pontiac described a vision similar to Neolin's in which the Master of Life or the Great Spirit told him to return to living by "the bow and arrow" with no need of "gun or powder" and to cleanse his people and their land of the ways of the whites. Pontiac said:
This land where ye dwell I have made for you and not for others. Whence comes it that ye permit the Whites upon your lands? Can ye not live without them? I know that those whom ye call the children of your Great Father supply your needs, but if ye were not evil, as ye are, ye could surely do without them. Ye could live as ye did live before knowing them—before those whom ye call your brothers had come upon your lands.
Thinking Critically
1.	Documentary Analysis
Who did Pontiac blame for the occupation of Indian lands by whites, the English colonists or his own people?
2.	Historical Interpretation
In what ways does Pontiac's vision represent a call for cultural and spiritual reform? What connections might Pontiac have seen between such reforms and successful resistance to white encroachment?
■ill
convened a meeting of Ottawa, Chippewa, Pottawatomi, and Wyandot people near Detroit. Pontiac told his listeners of his vision in which he had been promised that, if they would cleanse themselves of the ways of the whites, they would see their lands and old powers restored. He insisted, “It is important for us, my brothers, that we exterminate from our lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us.”
Pontiac and his followers attacked British forts across the region. The British held Detroit and Fort Pitt, but many other forts surrendered to the Indians: Fort Miamis, near Fort Wayne, Indiana; Fort Ouiatenon, near Lafayette, Indiana; Fort Michilimackinac on the Great Lakes; and most of the old French posts in Indiana and Ohio. Most of the Ohio country was again in Indian hands. The British were caught off guard but fought back.
The English commander, Jeffrey Amherst, ordered his troops to put “every Indian in your Power to Death.” His troops won several battles. Amherst also encouraged the distribution of smallpox-infected blankets to Indians, a move that rapidly spread the disease. In October, Pontiac received a letter from the French telling him that the French were not going to come to his aid. On receiving this news, Pontiac initiated a peace process. He met with the British authorities in Oswego, New York, in July 1766 and signed a treaty of peace. Three years later, he was murdered, probably by other Indians who resented both the deaths his rebellion had caused and his relatively quick surrender that meant the deaths were in vain.
The Proclamation Line of 1763
Soon after the long French and Indian War, the new British monarch King George III and his first minister George Grenville tried to ensure peace in North America. They meant to honor the commitments they had made in 1758 to the Delaware and Iroquois tribes and protect them from white settlement. Already embroiled in Pontiac’s conflict, which largely involved formerly French territories, they did not want other rebellions, and they were wary that land-hungry settlers would quickly begin to expand into Indian-dominated areas. In October 1763, the king issued a proclamation that there should be no British settlement west of the crest of the Appalachian Mountains and that Indian rights to western lands would be protected forever. The proclamation also directed any colonists who had already settled in these lands “forthwith to remove themselves from such Settlements.” For many of the tribes who lived on the
Chapter 5 The Making of a Revolution 123
The Proclamation Line
Royal proclamation of 1763 designed to protect Indian tribes by setting a boundary at the peaks of the Appalachian Mountains beyond which no western white settlement was to take place.
western slopes of the mountains and beyond, the Proclamation Line fulfilled what they believed they had been promised.
The Grenville administration took other steps to keep peace with the Indians. They replaced Amherst with the more conciliatory General Thomas Gage, who immediately resumed negotiations and gift giving with the tribes. The Grenville administration also strengthened the authority of the superintendents of Indian affairs, who had sought accommodations with the tribes since the 1750s.
The Proclamation Line slowed white settlement into western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and what would become Kentucky. But it also infuriated the British colonists—both land-hungry farmers and rich speculators—and did far too little to protect the Indians. Grenville and Parliament were too far away, and despite the British military outposts, their efforts to enforce the line were ineffectual, which had fateful consequences in the ! next decade.
The Paxton Boys and Rural White Responses
In the town of Paxton, in Pennsylvanias Lancaster County, a group of farmers decided that the way to end warfare between whites and Indians on the frontier was to get rid of j all Indians, whether they were allied with the British or the French. Calling themselves s the Paxton Boys or the Hickory Boys, these frontier vigilantes said:
We have long been convinced from sufficient evidence that the Indians that lived as independent commonwealths among us or near our borders were our most dangerous enemies.
In December 1763, the Paxton Boys attacked a Delaware village, killed six people, and burned the town. Then they killed 14 Indian survivors who were in protective custody in the town of Lancaster. They began a march to Philadelphia to find other Indians, especially Delawares, who had taken refuge there. Before the mob got to Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin and a delegation of the colony’s leading citizens negotiated an end to the rebellion, but the hatred of Indians would haunt the inhabitants of North America for a long time to come. After 1763, many white residents of British North America began to lump all American Indians together as an enemy race, even though their parents and grandparents had viewed different tribes quite separately, depending on a tribe’s relationship to the British cause. Like many earlier wars, the fighting in the French and Indian War was between the British and the Iroquois allies on one side and the French and the Ojibwa, Ottawa, Shawnee, Wyandot, and other tribes allied with them. Soon after the war, the lines came to be seen as much more racial, with all whites allied against virtually all Indians. This change in attitudes had far-reaching consequences for the residents of North America.
Threats of New Taxes
Relations between the British colonists and the American Indians were not the only concern of British authorities after 1763. Victory in the war had virtually drained the kingdom’s treasury. Britain’s national debt was double what it had been when the war began. In 1764, George Grenville and the majority in Parliament asked Britain’s North American colonists to pay what the authorities in London thought was a fair share of the war s cost. Their argument was that the war had protected colonists far more than it had anyone living in Britain. What seemed just and equitable in London, however, was seen quite differently in the colonies. These differences on who should bear the cost of the war would soon have significant consequences.

REVOLUTION WAS IN THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE”_____________________________
Explain why, in the 15 years before the Revolutionary War began, support for the patriot cause spread so quickly among many different groups of North Americans who opposed Britain for different reasons.
Long after the Revolution was over, former president John Adams wrote to another former president, Thomas Jefferson, describing the Revolutionary War that began in 1775 as “only an effect and consequence.” According to Adams, “Ihe Revolution was in the minds of the people, and this was effected from 1760 to 1775, in the course of fifteen years before a drop of blood was shed at Lexington.” He was right. For many British North Americans, a revolutionary change did indeed take place in their minds between 1760 and 1775, and it took place for many different reasons.
While people like Adams and Jefferson and many of their peers moved from being loyal British subjects to revolutionary advocates of independence in those years, others did not. People such as Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts, William Franklin (Benjamin’s son), and perhaps a fifth of the white colonists remained Loyalists— Americans who wanted to maintain loyal ties to Great Britain and who opposed the American Revolution. For reasons of their own, a majority of African slaves were probably also Loyalists. The Loyalists lived through the same momentous changes as those who embraced the revolutionary cause, but they came to different conclusions. Still other colonists remained neutral throughout the struggle, focusing on personal matters or simply not caring who ultimately governed them.
In addition, people in the colonies came to their own differing conclusions at varying times. Sailors and shop owners in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia as well as backwoods farmers in western Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas were sometimes much more ready for revolution, much sooner, than their better-known leaders.
For African slaves, the growing spirit of revolution held both potential and danger. Some slaves and free blacks saw in the revolutionary rhetoric the possibility of their own freedom. In contrast, other African-Americans saw the British government as a potential protector and even liberator against slave owners who embraced the patriot cause. Potential for freedom was not a guarantee in any scenario, however.
Ihe Iroquois, Cherokee, and other Indian tribes knew that frontier whites had little use for the king’s ban on white settlement and, if freed from British authority, would stream west. As the possibility of expanded settlement fueled revolutionary fervor among frontier whites, it also fed fears among Indians, most of whom sided with the British after 1776.
In effect, during the 15 fateful years that John Adams described above, many different groups of people with wide-ranging hopes and fears considered the possibility of an American Revolution and arrived at different conclusions. Each of these groups fought their own revolutions, sometimes in alliance with each other, sometimes acting at cross-purposes. Far from being clear, the goals and tactics of the revolutionaries were an ever-changing patchwork as different groups fought for their own purposes and made shifting alliances.
Loyalists
The name given to those in the colonies— perhaps one-fifth to one-third of the total population—who supported the British and opposed American independence.
Transition from the "Rights of Man" to Revolt
Many residents of the British colonies had grown up reading John Lockes defense of Britain’s Glorious Revolution of 1689. Long before tensions between the colonies and the government in London reached a crisis, colonists believed, as Locke said, that the people always retained “a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative” authority when they wanted to. Throughout the 1770s, Locke’s ideas guided some of the Revolution’s most articulate advocates such as Ihomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin as well as backwoods rebels like Ethan Allen, a man of modest

education who was the leader of Vermont’s Green Mountain Boys. Using Locke’s arguments in their speeches and lawsuits, they taunted royal governors, and ultimately, they used Lockes ideas to justify armed resistance.
Revolutionary leaders also read and cited French philosophers Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu—and authors from ancient Greece and Rome, all of whom advocated a commitment to liberty and the need to overthrow unjust authorities. Leaders of the patriot cause became convinced that England represented the evils of empire while the colonists represented the virtues of republicanism, which supported a broad distribution of power to people, enabling them to determine how and by whom they would be governed.
Leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, those who argued for independence and those who argued to maintain the ties between Britain and the American colonies, all read the same literature. Nearly all of them believed that George III ruled only by the consent of Parliament, not from any sort of divine right. For a hundred years before the American Revolution, British subjects in the old and new worlds constituted a community of people who valued “the rights of Englishmen” and distrusted efforts to undermine those rights. When, in 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote that the colonies had a right to independence because it was a self-evident truth that “all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,” he was reflecting a way of thinking that was familiar in America and Britain.
Those who shared common ideas about rights, liberty, and freedom extended beyond just residents of Britain and North America. The world that was at war in the 1750s and 1760s became a world involved in revolution in the 1770s and 1780s and beyond. Although the government of the King Louis XVI of France would play an essential role in the American victory, Louis XVI himself would lose his throne and his head to a French revolution within the next decade. The French and American Revolutions led to further revolutionary efforts across much of Europe as people in Germany, Poland, Scandinavia, and Italy attempted their own revolutions. Future president James Madison wrote in 1792 that “America has set the example and France has followed it, of charters of power granted by liberty.”
Madison did not, however, mention another revolution that was much closer to the United States than those in Europe. In 1791, slaves in the French colony of Saint Domingue (modern Haiti) rebelled. Saint Domingue was one of the richest and most oppressive slave systems in the world, where some 500,000 African slaves grew sugar and coffee that made the 40,000 French owners very rich. A free black, Toussaint L Overture—who quoted the same philosophers as North American revolutionaries— led the rebels in Haiti to win a series of victories. L’Overture himself was captured and died in France, but a new free Republic of Haiti was proclaimed in 1804. The rebellion was the most successful slave revolt in history and another in a long line of revolutions against distant authorities.
In addition, not long after the American Revolution, between 1810 and 1826, most of Latin America expelled its Spanish and Portuguese colonial masters. Simon Bolivar led revolutionary movements in his native Venezuela and helped establish the Republics of Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. His 1812 Manifesto of Cartagena expressed the same philosophical ideas as those of his counterparts in North America and Europe. The American Revolution, then, was part of a worldwide revolution against distant authorities and old ideas, and it was based on a new philosophical understanding of “the rights of man” and the way the world should be organized.
126 Partlll A New Birth of Fr
The Accompanying Revolution in Religion
In 1740, a Presbyterian minister, Gilbert Tennent, one of the leaders of the Great Awakening (see Chapter 4), preached a sermon on “The Danger of an Unconverted Ministry in churches throughout New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Tennent’s sermon, with its plea to test the personal faith of ministers, was a direct challenge to the leaders Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800


of the major Protestant denominations—Presbyterian, Congregational, and Episcopal. As a result of the Great Awakening, church members claimed permission—indeed, the responsibility—to judge their ministers. It was not a great leap for citizens to claim the same permission, and responsibility, for judging those in civil authority.
One visiting revivalist asserted that Patrick Henry, rector of the Episcopal church in Hanover, Virginia (and uncle to the patriot leader Patrick Henry), was a “stranger to true religion.” Reverend Henry, in return, demanded that Virginia’s governor stop these “strolling preachers” who were, in his view, “a set of incendiaries, enemies not only to the Established Church, but also common disturbers of the peace.” In a way, Henry was right. The Great Awakening disturbed the peace, split churches, and undermined all authorities.
Seaport Radicalism—From the Stamp Act to the Boston Massacre and Boston Tea Party
The Boston Tea Party of 1773 was probably the most famous act of resistance in America before the Revolution, but it was far from the first. Between 1747 and 1774, dockworkers, sailors, and townspeople drove the leading British officials—customs officials, navy officers, and even governors—away from the docks and out of Boston five times. Similar acts of rebellion took place from New York to the Carolinas.
Impressment had been British navy policy for centuries and, since the 1690s, had been a source of riots in colonial ports. When a warship was short of sailors, which happened often due to high rates of death and desertion, the captain had the authority to impress (or kidnap) likely sailors from merchant ships or ports and sign them up for naval service. Commercial sailors were paid higher wages than those in the navy and often had better working conditions, so impressments were, as one senior British naval officer noted, a source of “Hatred for the King’s Service . . . [and] a Spirit of Rebellion,” for many who lived along the waterfront.
In November 1747, British Commodore Charles Knowles sent sailors in search of new recruits while his ship was in Boston Harbor. They impressed 46 men into service. A rebellious crowd responded, taking some of Knowles’s officers hostage and chasing the royal governor out of town. A successful brewer, Samuel Adams, defended the rioters as an “Assembly of People drawn together upon no other Design than to defend themselves and repel the Assaults of a Press-Gang.” He insisted that they “had a natural right” to do so. Perhaps his cousin, John Adams, should have considered an earlier date than 1760 for the start of revolutionary thinking in the colonies.
British actions in the 1760s and 1770s escalated tensions in North American cities. The British government desperately needed to pay off the debt from the French and Indian War and attempted to do so, in part, by imposing new taxes. With each attempt—the Sugar and Currency Acts of 1764, the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend duties of 1767, and the Tea Act of 1773—colonial resistance grew. In a spiraling series of encounters, Parliament sought to raise funds, backed off in the face of colonial resistance, and then enacted new “get tough” policies that also backfired (see Table 5-1). The impact of the persistent but failed efforts to raise taxes fueled colonial resistance and the sense that resistance was effective. The taxes seemed fair only to those in Britain who were in power. The colonists saw each tax as a new attack on their liberty and each British effort at compromise as a sign of weakness.
The Sugar Act of 1764, the first tax, and the Currency Act of 1764 provoked limited but spirited resistance. The tax on sugar included rum and molasses, both made from sugar. The Currency Act prohibited colonies from issuing their own paper money as legal tender for either public debts, including paying taxes, or private debts, including paying merchants for goods made in Britain. In response, merchants and artisans in New York and Boston joined in a nonimportation movement in 1764 that was the beginning of a growing refusal to buy or use anything manufactured in Britain.

Description
Increased duties and strengthened collection of customs on rum and molasses, which particularly affected merchants and importers
Prohibited the colonies from issuing their own paper money as legal tender for public or private debts to Britain
Taxed all legal and commercial documents, creating an immediate hardship for business leaders and building resentment in many ports where people depended on those businesses for jobs Repealed the Stamp Act but said Parliament could legislate for the colonies in "all cases Whatsoever" Restricted trade in sugar, which helped British and Caribbean merchants at the expense of North American merchants
Placed new duties on paper, lead, paint, glass, and tea. All but the tax on tea were repealed in 1770—the same day as the Boston Massacre.
The "Intolerable Acts" of 1774
Allowed the British East India Company to ship tea to the colonies without having to pay normally required duties, making it cheaper than most smuggled tea. The Townshend tea tax would still apply once it reached the colonies. The Act supported the East India Company, almost bankrupt because so many customers were purchasing cheaper, smuggled tea from elsewhere.
Parliament's response to the tea riots; they closed the port of Boston, expanded the royal governor's authority, shifted control of the Ohio River country to the British governor in Quebec (the Quebec Act), and allowed British troops to use any uninhabited building as a barracks, without the owner's authorization (the Quartering Act).
Sons of Liberty
Secret organizations in the colonies formed to oppose the Stamp Act. From 1765 until independence, members spoke, wrote, and took direct action against British measures especially the Stamp Tax and the tax on tea.
128 Part III A Nev^g^of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
A year later, resistance to the Stamp Act of 1765 was stronger, and it united colonists of many social classes. The act required legal and commercial documents, including magazines, newspapers, and playing cards to be printed on special paper showing an official stamp. Payment for the stamped paper had to be in British currency. In the spring of 1765, Patrick Henry asked Virginias legislature, the House of Burgesses, to pass resolutions that came to be known as the Virginia Resolves opposing the tax. Middling and upper-class New Yorkers—including lawyers and merchants who would have had to pay the highest taxes if the law was enforced—began writing articles against the tax in the city’s many newspapers, which circulated widely. Some also formed a new secret organization, the Sons of Liberty, which sent delegates to all the colonies to create a kind of underground resistance to the tax—a tax they described as a sign of British tyranny. Nine colonies sent delegates to a gathering known as the Stamp Act Congress in New York City in October 1765. There they issued a Declaration of Rights and Grievances, which said that Parliament had no right to tax the colonies, and they petitioned for a repeal of the Stamp and Sugar Acts.
More important than the petition was the fact that leaders of the growing resistance movement met together and began to sense their unity. As one of the organizers of the congress said, There ought to be no New England men, no New Yorker, etc. known on the Continent, but all of us Americans.” This appeal to unity was a new sentiment in colonies that had, up until now, jealously guarded their independence from each other. Britain s parliamentary action had provoked this increasing unity.
While colonial leaders met and wrote petitions, some of the strongest resistance to the stamp tax developed in the working-class taverns where laborers and sailors gathered. Poor people had little reason to actually pay the tax because they did not use many legal documents or paper products that would require the stamped paper, but the tax was a symbol of British arrogance and threatened to slow the colonial economy, which could put sailors and laboring people out of work. To the poor, the haughty British authorities were becoming intolerable.
When Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Colden placed the embossing stamps in Fort George at the tip of Manhattan—until the new tax went into effect on November 1, 1765, public protests mounted into what came to be known as the New York Stamp Act Riot. New York merchants and groups like the Sons of Liberty
agreed not to import any British goods while the Stamp Act was in force.
In taverns across the city, angry citizens shared their discontent with the British. On the evening of November 1, a crowd paraded around the city with torches as well as effigies of the lieutenant governor and the devil. They dared the British troops to fire on them and burned Coldens coach. Next, the crowd broke into the home of Major James of the Royal Artillery, drank his considerable supply of liquor, and burned the house.
Calling themselves the Sons of Neptune to distinguish themselves from the more middle class Sons of Liberty, the crowd resisted efforts to end the violence. Months later, when news reached New York in May 1766 that the Stamp Act had been repealed, celebrating crowds fired guns, broke windows, and erected a “liberty pole” to taunt British authorities.
Similar riots by the “lower sorts” took place in other colonial cities.
In Boston, a mob ransacked the governor’s home, and in Annapolis,
Maryland, a crowd burned the stamp distributor’s warehouse and forced him to flee the colony. In Wilmington, North Carolina, a mocking, angry crowd paraded the stamp collector through the streets. And in Charleston, South Carolina, a crowd of workers and seamen burned effigies of the stamp distributor.
In response to the unrest, British authorities under the new prime minister, the Marquess of Rockingham, decided to repeal the Stamp and Sugar taxes but also to show force. In 1766, while repealing the taxes, Parliament also voted the Declatory Act, which claimed its right to tax and regulate the colonies “in all cases Whatsoever.” In addition, Parliament passed the Revenue Act of 1766, restricting trade in sugar, which helped British and Caribbean merchants at the expense of colonial merchants.
A year later, Charles Townshend, chancellor of the Exchequer (treasurer) in a new British government, imposed new taxes on lead, paint, paper, and tea, known as the second Revenue Act of 1767 (also known as the Townshend duties of 1767). The new British government was desperate to find a way to pay off the war debt but also wanted to assert Parliament’s authority over the colonies. In particular, Parliament
wanted to curtail smuggling by some of the most prosperous colonial merchants and to control the mobs that kept rioting in Boston and New York. In September 1768, the warships of the Royal Navy arrived in Boston, and British troops marched through town in a show of the government’s authority. According to Paul Revere, the troops “Formed and Marched with insolent Parade, Drums beating, Fifes playing, and Colours flying, up King Street.” The presence of so many troops created a sense of siege in Boston.
A year and a half later, British soldiers were still stationed in Boston, creating constant tensions with residents who resented their presence. One source of the tension was the fact that off-duty soldiers were allowed to work on their own part-time, increasing competition with colonists for jobs by accepting lower wages. On the evening of March 5, 1770, an angry crowd began to throw snowballs at British soldiers. They taunted the lone British sentry at the State House, Private Hugh White. As the crowd around White grew, more people joined in the taunting or watched from the sidelines. John Adams called the crowd “a motley rabble,” but they had strong support in a city tired of the presence of so many soldiers.
British Captain Thomas Preston sent more soldiers to support White while the crowd grew to 300 or 400. Preston asked the crowd to disperse, assuring them that the soldiers would not fire since he himself was standing directly in front of them. However, someone threw something that knocked one of the soldiers down, and some of the soldiers started firing, even though no one heard Preston give any orders. Three men were killed—including a seaman, Crispus Attacks, a former slave who was part African and part American Indian and who would be celebrated as the first man and first black

Chapter 5 The Making of a Revolution 129
Boston Massacre
After months of increasing friction between townspeople and the British troops stationed in the city, on March 5,1770, British troops fired on American civilians in Boston who were throwing projectiles at them, killing five and stirring even greater hatred toward the British army.
Daughters of Liberty
Organized as a women's response to the Sons of Liberty, the Daughters opposed British measures, avoided British taxed tea, spun their own yarn, and wove their own cloth to avoid purchasing British goods.
In this print, designed to fuel hostility toward the British more than provide an accurate record, Paul Revere showed the British soldiers— more organized than they actually were—firing on a helpless crowd.
person to die in the Revolution. Two more later died of their wounds. The Boston Massacre, as colonists called it, fueled anger at the British authorities. To avoid further confrontation, the Royal Governor pulled the troops out of Boston. His action also left most of the town in the hands of an increasingly anti-British population.
Some of the British troops involved were accused of murder. John Adams defended them in a subsequent trial (in which they were found not guilty). Later, Adams said that his defense of the soldiers, though highly unpopular, was, “one of the most gallant, generous, manly and disinterested Actions of my whole Life. Nevertheless, Adams also said that there was “no Reason why the Town should not call the Action of that Night a Massacre.” Paul Revere described the event as a deliberate military attack on a peaceful crowd. Sam Adams created a “committee of correspondence” to encourage resistance in other colonies. With such rhetoric, many Bostonians would likely never again be loyal British subjects.
In 1773, Britain decided to maintain the tax on tea, but repeal the other Townshend duties. The Tea Act of 1773 not only asserted Parliament’s authority to levy whatever taxes it wished but also attempted to protect the almost-bankrupt British East India Company, which was struggling because customers were purchasing cheaper, smuggled tea elsewhere. Under the act, the East India Company could ship large quantities of tea to the colonies without paying required duties, making the tea cheaper for the colonists, even with the Townshend tea tax. The plan was to encourage colonists to buy the taxed British East India Company tea instead of smuggled teas.
Given the tension and anger in Boston, the city’s response could easily have been predicted. City residents had no intention of paying that tax, even on discounted tea. In New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston, patriotic groups, often led by the Sons of Liberty, convinced merchants not to allow the tea to land from the British ships. “No taxation without representation,” became the rallying cry from colonists who were fed up with having no say in matters that affected them.
In November 1773, a shipment of British tea arrived in Boston on the ship Dartmouth. Even before it arrived, crowds had forced the tea merchants to barricade themselves in their warehouse. Once the Dartmouth appeared, a crowd forced the ship to move to Griffin’s Wharf where dockworkers, sailors, and merchants, not the British authorities, controlled the dock. The customs commissioners fled rather than risk getting tarred and feathered, an increas-
ingly popular punishment by patriotic crowds for those who supported royal authority. Governor Thomas Hutchinson would not let the Dartmouth sail back to England, and the crowd would not let the tea be unloaded. Ihe stand-off lasted into December.
On December 16, angry citizens met at the Old South Meeting House. When the governor would not back down, Samuel Adams said, “This meeting can do nothing more to save the country.” The crowd’s response—probably well rehearsed—was a series of faked Indian war whoops, a shout of “Boston harbor a tea-pot tonight,” and a call to gather at Griffin’s Wharf. As thousands watched from the shore, men, slightly disguised as Mohawks, boarded the Dartmouth and dumped the tea into Boston Harbor.
Ihe Boston Tea Party galvanized anti-British sentiment in other colonies, and the city was seen as the incubator of revolutionary activity long before the next shots were fired. In response to the incident, the British closed the port of Boston to all shipping, creating a financial crisis that led to further anger and unrest among not only dock-workers but also the merchant elites who depended on the port for their wealth.
Women, too, became increasingly involved in leading their own protests. In response to the Stamp Act crisis of 1765, small groups of women who were determined to boycott British goods in protest began calling themselves the Daughters of Liberty. New England women organized spinning bees to make their own cloth so they could avoid buying English textiles. Among the elite and working people, wearing homespun clothing

Their efforts continued to strengthen and spread, especially with the strong support they got from newspapers. In 1774, 51 women in Edenton, North Carolina, promised not to consume English goods, including tea, and other women organized similar boycotts elsewhere. When war broke out after 1775 and many goods became scarce, women protested when colonial merchants hoarded goods or demanded higher prices. In 1777, women in Poughkeepsie, New York, broke into the house of a merchant they thought was hoarding goods. As the war continued, women led food riots throughout the colonies.
Revolts in the Back Country
Rural people on the frontier from New York to the Carolinas were also taking matters into their own hands, but for different reasons. Backcountry Virginians had rebelled in various ways against royal authority since Bacons Rebellion in 1676, and in all of the colonies, major splits reflected gaps between coastal areas that had more access to, and more representation in, colonial governments than rural inland settlements.
In the mid-1760s, feeling ignored and cheated by what they saw as distant and corrupt coastal authorities, farmers in the western regions of North and South Carolina created what they called the Regulator movement. In South Carolina, Regulators attacked when gangs of outlaws stole from isolated farms. The governor eventually agreed to create circuit courts in the back country, which diminished the violence. In North Carolina, the movement protested corrupt practices of sheriffs and court
officials who forced settlers to pay illegally high taxes and legal fees. Regulators rallied settlers, who refused to pay the taxes, closed the courts, and attacked officials. The governor sent in state militia from the coastal areas, and in their largest encounter with the Regulators, 29 people were killed and 150 wounded.
Throughout the colonies, however, the most contentious issue for inland communities was relationships with Indian tribes. Inland people complained that those on the coast used inland settlers as a buffer from the Indians. In Pennsylvania, there were also ethnic splits between the regions. Pennsylvania’s mostly English Quaker elite had settled around Philadelphia. As pacifists, they tried to maintain peaceful relations with the Indians. But between the Quakers and the Indians was a zone inhabited by Scots-Irish and Germans who did not share the pacifism of the Quakers and who found themselves much closer to potential Indian hostility.
The rapid growth of the white population exacerbated the conflicts between frontier whites and Indians. The ever-increasing pressure for more land, a lot more land, could be satisfied only by white movement into areas that belonged to Indian tribes. As whites encroached, attacks by Indians increased. Settlers wanted, and expected, the British to protect them. But after 1763, King Georges Proclamation Line halted further movement west—at least legally. Ihe British-imposed barrier caused intense anger on the frontier.
British agents sought to not only relieve the pressure among land-hungry white settlers but also honor the king’s commitment to the Indians. A 1768 treaty allowed white settlement in present-day West Virginia and Kentucky. A similar treaty opened parts of western Pennsylvania and New York to white settlement. But colonists wanted much more land than these treaties gave them and were prepared to fight to get it— whether with Indian tribes or with the king s representatives.
Violence extended all along the lines of settlement. A German immigrant, Frederick Stump, was arrested for murdering 10 Indians in western Pennsylvania in 1768 and then freed from jail by a white mob. In Virginia, vigilantes who called themselves the Augusta Boys killed Cherokees.
General Thomas Gage, the senior British commander in North America, found the situation intolerable. He complained to London that, “all the people of the frontiers

from Pennsylvania to Virginia inclusive, openly avow, that they never find a man guilty of murder, for killing an Indian.” In response to the frontier resistance, Parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774, assigning all lands north and west of the Ohio River to the British-controlled Province of Quebec. That action effectively took Indian policy out of the hands of frontier agitators or royal governors along the coast. The Quebec Act also recognized the legal rights of the Catholic Church, which deeply offended the overwhelmingly Protestant Americans. Colonists saw the Quebec Act as one of what they called the Intolerable Acts, a series of laws that included the act that closed the port of Boston until the price of the tea and the tax on it was paid, a revision of the colonial charter of Massachusetts, and a Quartering Act that allowed governors to place troops in any uninhabited building. Patriots insisted that because Parliament was enacting these laws with no representation from colonists, Britain was violating the rights of English subjects in North America. Parliaments actions, including closing the port of Boston and challenging frontier farmers, were unintentionally provoking a common sense of grievance among people who had previously been quite separate in their complaints.
Growing Unity in the Colonies—The First Continental Congress
While people began to organize and challenge British authorities from Virginia to Massachusetts, leaders of the rebellion in Massachusetts asked the other colonies to join it in united action against what they saw as British tyranny. All of them except Georgia— which was fighting Creek Indians and wanted Britain’s support—sent delegates to Philadelphia in September 1774 to what became known as the First Continental Congress.
Most of the delegates who came to Philadelphia agreed that Parliament had no right to tax the colonies without their consent. The delegates also sought unified opposition to the British treatment of Boston. However, few were ready for a break with Britain. The Virginians wanted to continue to export tobacco, and South Carolina depended on the export of rice and indigo. Finding common ground was not easy. But the delegates did gain experience working together, even when they argued—which they did a lot.
There was little talk of war or independence at the 1774 gathering. But before they adjourned on October 26, the delegates declared that their rights were based on the laws of nature, the British constitution, and the colonial charters, and were not to be trifled with. They also agreed to a ban on British imports to take effect in December 1774, a ban on exports that would take effect in September 1775 (after the tobacco and rice crops were safely on their way to Britain), and—for symbolic reasons—an immediate ban on the consumption of tea from the East India Company. They agreed to meet again in May 1775 if relations with Britain did not improve.
Talk of Freedom for Slaves
For African slaves in British North America, the most revolutionary moment of the 1700s took place in London in July 1772. An American slave named James Somerset had been taken from Virginia to England as a personal servant by his master Charles Stewart. In London, Somerset became friends with free blacks and white abolitionists. In October 1771, he ran away. He was caught and put on a ship bound for Jamaica. But Somersets white friends petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, requiring that Somerset be brought before a judge to determine whether he was imprisoned lawfully. They insisted that he was held against his will—which, like all slaves, he certainly was. Eventually, the Lord Chief Justice ruled that since Parliament had never legalized slavery in England itself, as opposed to the English colonies, Somerset had to be freed because “the state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reason, moral or political; but only by positive law.” This decision basically ended slavery in England itself.
The Somerset decision caused a considerable stir in the colonies and in Britain. In September 1773, the Virginia Gazette noted that, as news of the decision spread, running away to England was a notion now too prevalent among the Negroes, greatly

Phillis Wheatley, Poem to the Earl of Dartmouth, 1773
Phillis Wheatley was born in West Africa in 1753. She was captured at age seven or eight and brought to Boston as a slave where she was purchased by John and Susanna Wheatley, who provided her with a good education. The young Phillis was moved by English poets, Christianity, and the talk of democracy that she heard in upper-class Boston in the 1760s and 1770s— which, she believed, applied to slaves as well as free people. In response, she wrote poems about religion, slavery, and freedom, including this one titled, "To The Right Honorable William, Earl of Dartmouth, His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for North America, &c." She was allowed to travel to London to see some of her poems published in 1773 and was later freed on the eve of the American Revolution. She died in 1784.
No more, America, in mournful strain Of wrongs, and grievance unredress'd complain,
No longer shalt thou dread the iron chain,
Which wanton Tyranny with lawless hand Had made, and with it meant t'enslave the land.
Should you, my lord, while you peruse my song,
Wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung,
Whence flow these wishes for the common good,
By feeling hearts alone best understood,
I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate
Was snatch'd from Afric's fancy'd happy seat:
What pangs excruciating must molest,
What sorrows labour in my parent's breast?
Steel'd was that soul and by no misery mov'd That from a father seiz'd his babe belov'd;
Such, such my case. And can I then but pray Others may never feel tyrannic sway?

to the vexation and prejudice of their masters.” Benjamin Franklin, who was living in London, had once owned slaves, but now, like many others, he was turning against the institution, calling it “this pestilential detestable traffic in the bodies and souls of men.” In Massachusetts, after successfully defending a slave in a trial to obtain his freedom in the Nantucket Court of Common Pleas, John Adams said, “I never knew a jury by a verdict to determine a negro to be a slave. They always found him free.”
Legal challenges were not the main ways in which slaves sought freedom before and during the American Revolution, however. Slaves heard about the protests of the Stamp Act and saw how effective mob action was. Some 107 slaves ran away from a plantation near Charleston to join other runaways who were creating their own communities in hard-to-penetrate swamps.
Whites on both sides of the Atlantic noted the absurdity of colonists protesting their own perceived enslavement by Parliament while, as one wrote, those same colonists enslaved “thousands of tens of thousands of their fellow creatures!” The most consistent voice for abolition in the 1760s and 1770s came from the Quakers, who made it mandatory for members of their denomination to free their slaves or allow them to purchase their freedom. Others such as Virginias Arthur Lee—from a great slaveholding family in the colony—wrote that “freedom is unquestionably the birthright of all mankind, of Africans as well as Europeans.” In the 1700s, the slave trade was still a profitable institution. While some whites wrote anti-slavery letters and pamphlets, 7,000 slaves were imported into Charleston in 1765. The debate around slavery was as heated as the debate around British rule, and no one living through these years could fail to notice the contradiction of fighting for liberty and enforcing slavery.

THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE
5.3
Explain how political and military strategy, support for the patriot cause, and American alliances with France and Spain led to an American victory in the war for independence.
As talk of rebellion spread in 1774, not long after the Boston Tea Party, John Adams overheard rural farmers discussing the events in Boston. One insisted, “If parliament can take away Mr. Hancocks wharf and Mr. Rowe’s wharf, they can take away your barn and my house.” Adams realized that if isolated farmers were agreeing with a mob in Boston, revolution was possible. Indeed, battles would soon break out in Lexington and in Concord, starting the American Revolution. At the same time, word was quickly spreading among Africans regarding the disputes about slavery. They were poised to take action to support either the colonists or the British—whichever side would benefit them the most. Beginning in 1775, what had been occasional mob actions turned into outright warfare as increasingly well-disciplined colonial militia fought against the British army. While some colonial leaders met in Congress and declared independence in 1776, other colonists, later aided by French forces, fought a long and bitter series of battles that won the actual independence that had been declared.
From Lexington and Concord to Bunker Hill—Revolt Becomes War
General Thomas Gage also understood the growing rebellion. When Parliament passed the Intolerable Acts, Gage was charged with moving British troops back into Boston and allowing no trade until Massachusetts submitted to the crown (see Map 5-3). Gage recommended to London that efforts be made to conciliate the colonists. But the leaders in Parliament were in no mood for conciliation, and Gage received orders to restore order at all costs. As he moved his troops, Gage kept a close eye on the Massachusetts rebels who kept an equally close eye on him. Paul Revere, who had helped lead the Boston Tea Party, now led an informal group of unemployed artisans who noted every troop movement in Boston.
THE BATTLES OF LEXINGTON AND CONCORD, APRIL
1775 In the inland towns of Concord and Worcester, the colonial militia was collecting arms, and Gage knew it. Hoping for secrecy, he ordered troops to prepare to march to Concord to seize the arms. The colonists had been expecting such a move. Paul Revere was to report any troop movements by hanging lanterns in the steeple of the North Church—one lantern if the troops moved inland and “two if by sea,” meaning by boats across the Back Bay. When the British troops started to move, Revere had two lanterns hung in the steeple (the British took the water route). Then he and William Dawes began their famous rides through the night to alert the colonial militia. Revere himself was arrested by British troops, but Dawes woke Sam Adams and John Hancock, who made it to Concord to organize the militia. When the British reached Lexington Town Green at little after 4:30 a.m. on April 19, 1775, they were met by colonial militia. Shots were fired, killing eight militiamen and wounding 10 others. Only one British soldier was wounded in this first battle of the Revolution.
There was no further gunfire until the British entered the town of Concord where they found few arms. As they left to march the 16 miles back to Boston, militiamen hidden behind trees, buildings, rocks, and fences attacked their easy targets. At the end of the day, the British had 273 casualties, the militia 95. What had been unrest was now a war.
Word of the battles of Lexington and Concord spread quickly. Many shared Thomas Jefferson’s belief that “the last hopes of reconciliation” had now ended. People who were not sure about independence felt they had to make decisions. Some, perhaps as many as a third of all white colonists, remained loyal to the crown, though in New England they did so quietly. But many began to commit to what they saw as a patriotic cause, some even taking matters into their own hands. Ethan Allen, who, since

MAP 5-3 British Courts and Troops Stationed in the Colonies as the Revolution Began. As unrest grew in the colonies, British authorities made every effort to assert control. They stationed more troops in all of the colonies, especially in restive Boston, and established a series of courts—Vice-Admiralty Courts—in Charleston, Philadelphia, Boston, and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Stationing more troops and clamping down on smuggling did nothing to end colonial resistance and, as word spread of the battles of Lexington and Concord after April 19,1775, colonial resistance only grew.

FROM THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL TO THE FORMATION OF THE COLONIAL
army In the weeks after the battles at Lexington and Concord, the Massachusetts militia, fortified with recruits from Connecticut, began to dig in on the hills surrounding British-occupied Boston—Dorchester Heights to the south, Bunker Hill, and Breeds Hill to the north. Colonel William Prescott of the Massachusetts militia was put in charge of fortifying the northern hills. Chapter 5 The Making of a Revolution 135
General Gage again felt that he had to act. On June 17, Gage ordered an attack on Breed’s Hill. It was a British victory, but at a high cost—226 British dead and 828 wounded compared with 140 militia killed and 271 wounded. As one Englishman remarked, If we have eight more such victories, there will be nobody left to bring the news.
Ihe battle, which later became known as the Battle of Bunker Hill, even though it had taken place on Breeds Hill, had been between ill-organized militia and regular units of the British army. After that battle, however, the American forces became better organized and gained support from all 13 colonies.
African-Americans in the Armies of Both Sides
The outbreak of war opened a new avenue to freedom for American slaves. While some, like Wheatley, embraced revolution for liberty and freedom, others heeded different words. Jeremiah, a free black in Charleston, heard the rumor that the British intended to “come to help the poor negroes.” He did not wait for that help but began to organize one of several slave uprisings in the Carolinas in 1775 and 1776. Jeremiahs ? plans for an insurrection were discovered, and he was hanged and burned at the stake ! in August 1775 by prorevolutionary authorities in South Carolina.
There was a good reason for the rumors among the slaves. In 1775, Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia, under attack from the rebels, fled Williamsburg.
In November of that year, from his refuge on a British warship, he announced:
I do hereby further declare all indented servants, Negroes, or others.. .free, that are able and willing to bear arms, they joining His Majesty’s Troops as soon as may be.
The proclamation terrified whites. With it, the slaves’ perspective of the revolutionary struggle was transformed into a struggle about who would “give them their liberty.” And in South Carolina, where there were 80,000 slaves—60 percent of the population—such liberty would be a radical revolution indeed.
Many slaves responded to the invitation. Between 800 and 1,000 slaves joined the British army. Dunmore organized them into what he called the Ethiopian Regiment, whose members wore a sash reading “Liberty to Slaves.” In one engagement, an American colonel, Joseph Hutchings, was captured by two of his own former slaves. When the British landed on Staten Island in 1776, New York and New Jersey slaves joined them. When they Royal Navy sailed up rivers in Pennsylvania and Maryland, more slaves joined them, and when the British attacked Charleston, still more joined.
Runaway slaves built forts, tended the wounded, carried supplies, and fought alongside white soldiers. British generals understood that in recruiting slaves they were also disrupting the economies of the rebellious colonies. Although disease took a terrible toll among black soldiers and their families, and though many were captured and reenslaved, the loyalty of slaves to the British cause eventually brought freedom to some of them. Approximately 300 former slaves sailed with Dunmore when he left Virginia in 1776, and by the end of the war, British forces had relocated some 3,000 more in Canada or in colonies in West Africa.
The American army was much slower to enlist free blacks or slaves than the British. African-Americans, however, did serve among the colonial troops at Lexington and Concord in 1775, including Lemuel Haynes, who became one of the leading ministers in Massachusetts after the war.
Washington was reluctant to arm black soldiers, fearing not only the reaction of white troops but also the possibility that arms given to black soldiers might eventually support a slave revolt. Nevertheless, by the winter of 1777-1778, when things looked grim for the Revolution, Washington finally embraced black volunteers. Shortly after, in February 1778, Rhode Island offered freedom to “every able bodied Negro, Mulatto, or Indian Man slave in this state.. .to serve during the continuance of the present war with Great Britain.” Perhaps one in four male slaves in the state eventually enlisted in what was known as Rhode Island’s Black Regiment. Those who survived the war were given their freedom in 1783.

Moving Toward Independence
When the delegates to the Second Continental Congress gathered as promised in Philadelphia on May 10, 1775, the Battles of Lexington and Concord had changed everything. They knew that they had to manage a war and attempted to create the Continental Army. The obvious choice to command it was George Washington, a respected member of Congress and veteran of the French and Indian War.
Washington took command of the colonial militia, such as it was, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on July 2, 1775, shortly after the Battle of Bunker Hill. American resistance would be more coordinated than it had been during the early skirmishes. Washington commanded between 9,000 and 14,000 troops—he was never sure—while Gage led about 5,000 in Boston. Despite the difference in numbers, the Royal Navy controlled the water, and Gage’s troops were highly disciplined soldiers. Washington’s troops were a ragtag army, capable of effective guerrilla fighting and great courage, but hard to discipline, easily bored, and ready to return to their homes if fighting dragged on.
After selecting Washington and beginning to find the money—mostly in foreign loans—to support an army, the Second Continental Congress turned to another pressing question: What did they want from the war? John Dickinson of Pennsylvania wanted reconciliation with Britain if Parliament would respect the rights of the colonists. John Adams and most of the Virginia delegates wanted independence. Others were not sure. It took a year for the debate to be resolved, and before then, other matters intervened.
THOMAS PAINE’S COMMON SENSE
While the Congress debated independence, a new arrival from England, Thomas Paine, published a pamphlet, Common Sense, in January 1776. Soon, over 100,000 copies were in circulation. Paine asked, “Why is it that we hesitate?.. .For God’s sake, let us come to a final separation... .The birthday of a new world is at hand.” Paine made two basic points: that monarchy was always a bad way for people to be governed and that the time was right to declare independence. With his passionate words and exquisite timing, Paine shaped public opinion. Common Sense appeared on the same day George III declared the North American colonies to be in a state of rebellion. The two events could not have contrasted more clearly. John Adams was no admirer of Paine or his pamphlet, which he saw as simple minded and needlessly antagonistic, though he agreed with its conclusion. Nevertheless, Adams said that he expected Common Sense to become the “common faith” of the new nation. Declaring Independence, 1776 On June 7,1776, after months of debate in the Congress, Richard Henry Lee, a delegate from Virginia, offered a motion:
Resolved.. .that these United Colonies are, and of a right ought to be, free and independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.
John Adams immediately seconded the motion.
In the debate that followed, delegates led by John Dickinson opposed the resolution. Most of the delegates had likely come to this Congress with the hope of reconciliation, not with any plan for permanent separation. But the fighting with British troops and the influence of publications like Common Sense had changed many minds. Congress eventually agreed to delay a vote on independence until July 1 but to also appoint what became known as the Committee of Five—Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston-to draft a declaration in case Congress did vote for independence.
Jefferson, known for his skill with words, was chosen to write the first draft. Adams and Franklin, and ultimately the full Congress, made adjustments, which frustrated and hurt the sensitive Jefferson. The most important changes included removing
Recently arrived from England,Thomas Paine took up the patriot cause with a fervor that many more established colonists lacked. In his easy-to-read pamphlet, Common Sense, he attacked not only the British treatment of the colonies but also the very idea of monarchy. His words were significant in fanning the flames of the independence movement.

Chapter 5 The Making of a Revolution 137
Jefferson’s passionate attack on the slave trade, which was hypocritical in light of the fact that Jefferson owned many slaves and made no move to free them. In addition, far too many of the others in the Congress had investments in the trade to accept Jefferson’s language anywhere in the document. However, no one suggested removing Jefferson’s assertion that the king “has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages,” even when they all knew that it was whites on the frontiers who were invading Indian territory, and the king’s government was trying to keep the two apart. Those in Congress saw the frontier whites as essential supporters of the patriot cause and were in no mood to antagonize them.
The waiting period before the vote paid off. By July 1776, no one was willing to go on record as being opposed to independence. On July 2, a unanimous Congress voted for independence, and on July 4, they adopted a declaration of independence that began with these powerful words:
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
The philosophical ideas that John Locke had used to defend England’s change in monarchs were now, a hundred years later, used to announce to the world that monarchy itself was being abolished in England’s former colonies. In Philadelphia, people celebrated with “bonfires and ringing bells, with other great demonstrations of joy.”
When word of the Declaration of Independence reached New York City, a mob of soldiers and residents celebrated by pulling down the statue of King George III that stood on lower Broadway. The metal was eventually melted down to make bullets for the revolutionary cause.
138 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
A crowd in New York tore down the statue of George III, Washington built up morale in the army by reading the Declaration to his troops, and the celebrations continued up and down the coast.
THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION A
year later, the Congress adopted a governing document for the new and fragile country they had created. In 1777, the Articles of Confederation created a national, though weak, government for what was now called the United States of America. Although 11 of the colonies ratified the Articles within a year, the last, Maryland, did not do so until 1781. Nevertheless, with the Articles of Confederation, states banded together in a formal—and ultimately successful—alliance to prosecute the war and govern the nation in the peace they hoped would follow. With the Declaration of Independence, the 13 different colonies declared themselves to be 13 independent states that agreed to work together for certain limited common purposes. Although they were committed to cooperate, especially in fighting for independence, the representatives were distrustful of centralized government. Under the Articles of Confederation, there would be no national executive or court system in the new nation. In addition, Congress could raise money through taxes only if every state agreed. Nevertheless, this government—really, an alliance of independent states more than anything that looked like a modern nation—was able to coordinate its fight and win the Revolution. Whether such a government could build a nation, however, remained to be seen. Articles of Confederation

George Washington and His Victorious Patchwork Army
The American Revolution was a long and bloody war between two strikingly different
armies. On one side were Washington’s patchwork Continental Army and various
rebel militias—later supported by troops from France and Spain. In the course of the
long war, some 200,000 of the 350,000 men who could have served participated in
some military activity, but the turnover was such that no more than 25,000 served
at any one time. Fighting against them was a corps of extremely well-trained British
troops, supported by organized units of Loyalist colonists (as many as 8,000 at the start
of the war and increasing as the war continued) and hired soldiers from Germany.
Ultimately, many factors led to the success of the ragtag rebels and their allies in their
battles with the British troops (see Map 5-4) and perhaps more important their ability
to survive in spite of the British effort to eliminate them as a fighting force.
Most of the revolutionary Minute Men who fought at Lexington and Concord (called Minute Men because they had pledged to be ready to fight on a minute’s notice) were farmers who owned their own weapons and knew how to shoot. In some of the early battles, the popular image of the “citizen soldier” may have been true as farmers and townspeople took up arms to defend their communities. But as the war continued, and as Washington and his officers created the kind of discipline necessary for an effective army, more and more of the early volunteers faded away, replaced by recently indentured servants, impoverished transients, or those who traded a jail cell for a uniform. A colonial officer called the troops, “a wretched motley Crew,” but Washington was an effective leader who never seemed to lose control when others started to panic, and he was deeply committed to the cause.
Despite being ill-trained, ill-fed, ill-clothed, and restless, these troops continued to fight, even after seeing the “horrors of battle... in all their hideousness,” as one soldier remembered. Surprisingly, these often forgotten men are who won the independence that others celebrated.
A few women also took a direct role in the war. Armies in the 1700s usually included women known as camp followers. Some were the wives of soldiers, who could not or would not leave their husbands. Others were single women seeking adventure or simply survival in army life and army rations. Camp followers carried water to the battlefield, fed and supported the troops, nursed the wounded, and occasionally fought in battles’ Mary Ludwig Hays, known as Molly Pitcher (for the water she carried),

also supposedly loaded her husband s cannon after he was wounded at the Battle of Monmouth in 1778. Deborah Sampson disguised herself as a man, joined the army, and fought for years until a doctor discovered her identity after she was wounded.
Washington understood that though his army could fight, it could not withstand a direct battle with British regulars. He told Congress that he needed to fight a defensive war and avoid any general action. For much of the war, his goal was not a decisive victory, but avoiding a decisive loss. The longer Washington was able to keep his army together and out of too many battles, the better the chance that the British would tire of the war. He knew how well-trained the British army was—having served in it—but he also expected that training and discipline had narrowed their conception of war and would give him the edge as long as his troops could use nontraditional tactics and avoid capture or defeat.

American Voices
Joseph Plumb Martin, Narrative of a Revolutionary Soldier, 1775-1783
Joseph Plumb Marin was a private in the American army through eight years of war. He saw few direct battles but many small skirmishes. Martin knew that his primary task was to survive and avoid capture. His humorous journal, written when he was 70 years old, makes clear that his greatest enemies were neglect and hunger.
I, the redoubtable hero of this Narrative, first made my appearance in this crooked, fretful world, upon the twenty-first day of November, in the year 1760....I remember the stir in the country occasioned by the stamp act, but I was so young that I did not understand the meaning of it; I likewise remember the disturbances that followed the repeal of the stamp act, until the destruction of the tea at Boston and elsewhere; I was then thirteen or fourteen years old, and began to understand something of the works going on... .Time passed smoothly on with me till the year 1774 arrived, the smell of war began to be pretty strong, but I was determined to have no hand in it, happen when it might; I felt myself to be a real coward. What—venture my carcass where bullets fly! That will never do for me... .1 was ploughing in the field about half a mile from home, about the twenty-first day of April [1775], when all of a sudden the bells fell to ringing, what the cause was we could not conjecture....During the winter of 1775-6, by hearing the conversation and disputes of the good old farmer politicians of the times, I collected pretty correct ideas of the contest between this country and the mother country, (as it was then called)....I felt more anxious than ever, if possible, to be called a defender of my country.
1777—Next morning, we joined the grand army near
Philadelphia, and the heavy baggage being sent back to the
rear of the army, we were obliged to put us up huts by laying up poles and covering them with leaves; a capital shelter from winter storms... .About this time the whole British army left the city, came out and encamped, or rather lay, on Chestnut-hill in our immediate neighborhood; we hourly expected an attack from them; we had a commanding position and were very sensible of it. We were kept constantly on the alert, and wished nothing more than to have them engage us, for we were sure of giving them a drubbing, being in excellent fighting trim, as we were starved and as cross and ill-natured as curs. The British, however, thought better of the matter, and after several days maneuvering on the hill, very civilly walked off into Philadelphia again. Starvation seemed to be entailed upon the army and every animal connected with it....
1780—Here was the army starved and naked, and there their country sitting still and expecting the army to do notable things while fainting from sheer starvation.

THE BRITISH EVACUATE BOSTON
After the Battle of Bunker Hill, the British controlled Boston but were hemmed in there. Through the winter of 1775-1776, Washington commissioned a promising soldier, Henry Knox, a young Boston bookseller, as a colonel in the Continental Army and sent him and his men to move the guns captured at Fort Ticonderoga on sleds over snow-covered mountains to Boston. On the night of March 1, 1776, Washingtons troops assembled the guns on Dorchester Heights and then bombarded the city until March 17 when the British finally evacuated Boston. THE WAR IN THE NORTH—MANHATTAN, TRENTON, AND VALLEY FORGE
The victory in Boston was one of the few outright victories Washington would achieve. Washingtons goal, however, was to engage in more indirect strategies that would wear down the British while preserving his own limited troops. Just as the American Congress was declaring independence in Philadelphia in 1776, Sir William Howe, who had replaced Gage as the British commander, landed his army on Staten Island, across from Manhattan. Howe had some 32,000 troops, including 8,000 German mercenaries—essentially soldiers for hire—known as Hessians (since many were from the German province of Hesse). During the war, some 30,000 Hessians fought for the British, approximately a quarter of all of their soldiers. Hessian troops were
Chapter 5 The Making of a Revolution 141
recruited, often by force, from among the poorest Germans, and German princes would rent them out as units, especially to the British. Many Hessians soldiers had little interest in the British cause, but had little choice except to fight for it. Washington had his own morale problems, but his soldiers were somewhat more willing to fight.
As the two sides watched each other, Washingtons troops dug fortifications to defend Brooklyn and Manhattan. In late August, Howe’s larger and better-trained force attacked Brooklyn. Rather than risk battle and capture at this point, Washington abandoned Brooklyn and brought all 9,500 of his troops across the East River to Manhattan on the night of August 30. When Howe attacked Manhattan in September, Washington again retreated. Throughout the early fall, Washington continued a retreat, and the British advanced through New Jersey. As they settled down for the winter, the British held most of New Jersey, while Washingtons army was across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.
Then, on Christmas night of 1776, Washington and 2,400 troops made a daring raid across the Delaware River and captured Trenton, New Jersey. They also captured many Hessian soldiers, some of whom quickly joined the rebel side. In January, they would go on to successfully attack a British force in Princeton. By the winter of 1776-1777, Washington controlled southern New Jersey while the British held northern New Jersey and New York City, which they would control throughout the war.
In May 1777, British General John Burgoyne assembled a large army in Canada. His plan was to proceed down the Hudson River and smash the “unnatural Rebellion” in New York and New England. Initially, the plan went well. Burgoyne had some 8,300 men, including 3,000 German troops. He led his army across Lake Champlain, overran the Americans at Fort Ticonderoga, and continued south into New York’s Hudson River Valley, an exhausting effort that involved moving a large army with heavy supplies through dense forests. As he moved through the area, Burgoyne’s sometimes pompous pronouncements to colonists and the German troops’ inability to communicate with them bred additional colonial resentment and motivated fresh volunteers for the American cause.
In September 1777, near Saratoga, New York, Burgoyne’s army encountered American troops under the command of an experienced general, Horatio Gates, and Benedict Arnold (still on the American side, but soon to be caught negotiating a plan with the British to defect). The British were surprised that their bayonet charge could not break the American lines. Both armies suffered heavy losses, but neither won a decisive victory. Burgoyne’s army was now cut off from its winter quarters and, shortly after, was forced to negotiate. Some 5,800 British troops were captured and held as prisoners until the end of the war. The Battle of Saratoga, was a turning point for the colonial cause. It eliminated a significant British force, and it proved to the world— especially those in France and Spain who were watching the war closely—that the Americans could stand up to Britain’s toughest troops. As a result, American diplomats including Benjamin Franklin were able to negotiate an agreement with the French and later the Spanish to recognize the united colonies and provide military assistance.
The British wanted not only to split the colonies and, especially, to capture Washington and his army, but also to catch the members of the Continental Congress by overtaking Philadelphia where the Congress met. In September 1777, British troops captured Philadelphia, but the members of Congress escaped before the British arrived. Washington was able to block supplies into the city, and the following spring, the British abandoned Philadelphia, which remained in colonial hands for the rest of the war, though there were continued riots between patriots and Loyalists in the city.
Before the British left Philadelphia, however, the American forces had to survive perhaps their most difficult winter. Washington selected Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, 18 miles northwest from Philadelphia as a place to keep an eye on the British in the city. His army was exhausted, cold, and hungry, and they got colder and hungrier as the winter continued. For weeks, there was little to eat. In time, however, Washington was able to appoint commissary officers who found food and clothing for the soldiers. A Prussian
142 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
officer volunteering in the American cause, Baron von Steuben, began training the troops in close order drills. Von Steuben possessed expertise in military training and hoped to make a name, and a home, for himself in a free America. In addition, a French officer, the Marquis de Lafayette, was recruited to lead forces that harassed the British. By the time the British sailed out of Philadelphia, the American troops were better fed and clothed, better trained, and ready for new battles—preparation they would need in the next years.
In 1778, General Sir Henry Clinton replaced Howe, and a new British strategy took shape. Clinton ordered the Royal Navy to harass the colonists up and down the Atlantic coast and encouraged Britain’s Indian allies to attack frontier settlements. In addition, he sent the main British land force south to overrun the Carolinas and Georgia. If he could detach those three colonies, Clinton thought, the Revolution might crumble. After 1778, the major battles of the war would be in the colonies’ western and southern regions.
THE IMPORTANCE OF FRANCE AND SPAIN
The Revolution was won by the rebels for many reasons, including the key fact that France and Spain were willing to help. The two countries had their own reasons for wanting to embarrass the British and reduce Britain’s power on the world stage. In particular, both France and Spain wanted greater access to trade with North America, which was highly restricted as long as the British controlled the colonies. By the 1770s, the French still resented the British victory in the Seven Years’ War and wanted to ensure that France, not Britain, was the dominant power in Europe. As early as 1775, France sent agents to America to see what might be gained from assisting in the rebellion. Similarly, Spain started to supply the colonists with food and gunpowder from Spanish-held New Orleans and Cuba. While they were willing to support the rebellion, neither France nor Spain wanted to engage in war with Britain unless the colonists were serious. In arguing for a declaration of independence in 1776, Adams told the Congress: “Foreign powers cannot be expected to acknowledge us, till we have acknowledged ourselves and taken our station among them as a sovereign power, an independent nation.” He had two specific foreign powers in mind.
In 1776, Benjamin Franklin led an American delegation in Paris to seek further help. Franklin with his simple fur cap and plain spectacles, yet sophisticated manner, charmed the French. However, Franklin needed more than charm to win real help. With the Americans’ declared independence and victory over Britain’s troops at Saratoga, French leaders started to take him more seriously. His diplomatic efforts secured important supplies and, in February 1778, a full French alliance with the United States of America, the first diplomatic recognition of the new nation. A few months later, France formally declared war on Great Britain. For the rest of the war, Washington could count on the French army and navy to fight the British.
In 1779, Spain also declared war on Britain. Spanish forces moved up the Mississippi River from New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast and took the British forts at Baton Rouge, Natchez, Mobile, and Pensacola. Spanish attacks in the Mississippi River Valley diverted British troops from the Atlantic coast, helping the American effort.
Once France and Spain went to war with Britain, the American Revolution became a world war. The French and British navies fought in the English Channel, Spain attacked British-held Gibraltar in the Mediterranean, and all of them fought battles in the Caribbean. Most important for the American cause, the French fleet supported Washington’s troops throughout the latter part of the war while Spanish funds and smuggling efforts provided badly needed supplies.
THE IROQUOIS AND THE BRITISH
The Iroquois were divided about how to respond to the rebellion, and at the beginning of the war most sought to remain neutral. However, many saw Britain as the key to their independence, and as the war continued, neutrality faded. Beginning in the summer of 1777, Mohawks under the leadership of Thayendanegea, also known as Joseph Brant, attacked white communities 5.1

across New York and Pennsylvania. The attacks on farms threatened a crucial colonial food supply. In response, in the summer of 1779 Washington sent perhaps a third of his army to attack the Iroquois and “lay waste all the settlements around...that the country may not be merely overrun but destroyed.” From Washingtons perspective, the Iroquois had to be stopped. For the Iroquois, Washington’s fierce response was proof that the American leadership would always be an implacable enemy. Both sides adopted brutal scorched-earth tactics that left long-lasting hatreds.
BRITISH LOYALISTS
Colonists who remained loyal to Britain formed their own militia, and in the Carolinas, an army of over a thousand Loyalists challenged rebel forces. Other Loyalists joined British regiments. American rebels had nothing but contempt for them. In the New York-New Jersey area, Catherine and Phillip Van Cortland, one of the area’s leading families, remained loyal to Britain. When Washington gained control of their part of New Jersey, he ordered that the Van Cortland house be used as an army hospital. With her husband away, Catherine and her children were told to leave. She described their February 1777 departure: Our youngest children could not pass a far yard where they were milking cows without wishing for some. My little Willing was almost in agonies, springing in my Arms and calling for milk. I therefore rode up and requested the good man to let me have some from one of his pails.... the man stopped, asked who we were, and.. .swore bitterly he would not give a drop to any Tory Bitch. I offered him money, my children screamed; and, as I could not prevail, I drove on.
In some cities including Newark, New Jersey, in 1777 and Philadelphia in 1780, the wives of missing Loyalists were exiled by the American forces. Some Loyalist families were able to blend back into their old homes after the war, but many left for Canada or England and never returned.
WOMEN’S SUPPORT FOR WASHINGTON’S ARMY
In 1780, at a par ticularly bad time for the Continental troops, Esther De Berdt Reed (wife of the governor of Pennsylvania) and Sarah Franklin Bache (Benjamin Franklin’s daughter) asked patriot women to give up all luxuries and contribute to a fund for the Continental Army. Eventually, the women raised $300,000, a huge sum at the time. The women’s goal was to give $2 in hard currency to every soldier. Washington refused the offer and asked the women instead to buy cloth and sew shirts for the soldiers. The women agreed and produced thousands of shirts for the ill-clad troops. The experience also led to the creation of the Ladies Association, the first intercolonial organization of women in America and a model for future national organizations of women.
Women throughout the colonies found additional ways to support the cause. In Fishing Creek, South Carolina, young girls went from farm to farm, asking, “Is the owner out with the fighting men?” If the answer was yes, then they harvested the land. In five or six weeks, they had completed the harvest for the whole county, saving patriot farmers from economic ruin and providing food stores for the revolutionary cause. Stories of similar efforts abounded.
THE WAR IN THE SOUTH—FROM CHARLESTON TO YORKTOWN
After capturing Savannah, Georgia, in December 1778, the British attacked Charleston, South Carolina, in 1780, and on May 12, 1780, that city surrendered. The loss was significant. If the British took control of Georgia and the Carolinas, it would be hard to continue the resistance in the name of the united colonies and the strategy seemed to be working. 144 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
As the battle for control of the south continued, Washington named one of his generals, Nathaniel Greene, to lead a southern campaign. Greene divided the American forces, taking command of half and assigning others—a contingent of Maryland and Virginia militias—to Daniel Morgan, an experienced officer from Virginia. The British commander, Lord Cornwallis also divided his army between himself and Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton, who had a reputation for exceptional cruelty.
While the two armies maneuvered, smaller independent units fought their own battles. Not every resident of South Carolina supported independence, and local Loyalists fought against colonial units. Throughout 1780 and 1781, the South Carolina backcountry was filled with ugly and often personal conflicts. Unlike other colonies, the civilian death toll was high in South Carolina as a result.
Morgan made a stand against the British forces in a South Carolina pasture known as Cowpens in January 1781. In one of the last full-scale battles of the war, the American troops defeated Tarleton’s army and captured some 800 British soldiers—a crucial American victory. Although the British still held Charleston and small units loyal to the British harassed the revolutionaries, after Cowpens, the Americans were in control of the South Carolina countryside.
Cornwallis saw little chance of further success in the Carolinas and marched into Virginia in May 1781. He decided to fortify Yorktown on the York River where he thought he could count on being resupplied by water. As Cornwallis’s troops dug in at Yorktown, Washington was in the north planning another attack on New York City. Greene’s army was far to the south. At the prodding of the French, Washington moved quickly to take advantage of the situation. In September, the French navy blockaded the York River and cut Cornwallis off from resupply. Then, supported by French troops under the Count de Rochambeau, Washington marched his own army from New York 450 miles south at surprising speed. On September 28, Washington’s 16,000 troops attacked Yorktown. The siege continued for the next 2 weeks, but after failing at an attempted escape, Cornwallis surrendered on October 17,1781.

HOW DID THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION UNFOLD?
Between 1775, when fighting broke out near Boston, and the 1783 Treaty of Paris, the British and rebellious American colonists fought the Revolutionary War. This war, however, was in reality a civil war, as some colonists remained loyal to the British Empire while their neighbors rebelled against imperial power. Even though George Washington's Continental Army was outmatched in military manpower and lost more major battles than it won, the superior decision making of its leaders combined with patriotic support throughout the colonies led to a victory for the Americans, and the Thirteen Colonies emerged as the independent United States of America.
The idealized prominence of General George Washington as a war leader is shown as he meets with other generals and officers of the American colonies in a large state room.

THE TREATY OF PARIS
The surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown did not end the war, but it virtually guaranteed that it would eventually end favorably for the Americans. British troops still controlled New York City, Charleston, Savannah, and parts of the countryside, but many in Parliament were tired of the war, and public opinion in Britain had turned against continued hostilities. In June, 1780, Congress had sent John Jay to join Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in Paris to negotiate peace. After news of the Yorktown surrender arrived, the British delegates agreed to a draft treaty that began, “His Britannic Majesty acknowledges the said United States ... to be free Sovereign and independent States.” The two sides continued to negotiate boundaries, fishing rights, and legal claims, and Britain concluded separate treaties with France and Spain. The final treaty was signed in Paris on September 3, 1783. The Revolutionary War was over, and a new nation had been born. Quick Review Did the French and Indian War lead directly to the coming of the American Revolution? What other factors might have prevented or caused the outbreak of war in 1775? Make a list of some of the different groups that came to the conclusion that life would be better for them if the colonies were independent from Great Britain. Why did they want independence? Could any independent nation satisfy such diverse goals?
CONCLUSION
Many factors led to the beginning of the American Revolution. As American colonists sought to evade British taxes, John Locke’s ideas about the “Rights of Man” influenced some men—and women—and provided a moral justification for disobeying the crown. Ihe First Great Awakening led many to challenge religious and civil authority.
While ideas fueled the conflicts, the aftermath of the French and Indian War led to some of the most decisive events leading up to the colonies’ break with Britain. While the colonists benefitted from the British takeover of New France, many rebelled against Parliament’s efforts to get colonists to help pay the cost of this war through increased taxation without representation in Britain’s Parliament. Many colonists, too, would not honor George Ill’s Proclamation Line of 1763, which prevented them from appropriating Indian land. Slaves in the American colonies welcomed news that courts in England were moving toward outlawing slavery there; however, plantation owners, who depended on slavery and the slave trade, now had another reason for supporting an open break with the mother country. As resistances to British policies and taxes grew, Parliament responded with new taxes and sent more troops, which only inflamed colonists’ passions and further united them against British rule.
At the first and second Continental Congresses, representatives of the colonies debated the best course of action. In 1775, violence escalated. The combination of unwanted British armed forces in North America as well as unwanted taxes and oppressive laws culminated in armed resistance by the colonists. By mid-1775, Americans had formed their own army under George Washington. The protracted war that followed engulfed the colonies, involving not only white men but also white women, slaves, and the Indians, along with armies and aid from France and Spain. Finally, after years of avoiding capture by the British army and some successful victories by the patriot forces, new alliances with France and Spain helped the colonists’ army, commanded by George Washington, win the surrender of the largest British army in North America. With the surrender of the British forces at Yorktown in 1781, and the Treaty of Paris in 1783, the independence of the United States became a reality.

148 Partlll A New Birth of Freedom-Creating the United States of America, 1754-1800
Creating a Nation
Having won independence, the new United States faced many crises. In an effort to resolve some of the tensions, some of the nation's leaders proposed a new form of government and met in Philadelphia over the long hot summer of 1787 to produce a new Constitution.
1783-1788
In 1787, a Philadelphia physician, Benjamin Rush, wrote, “The American war is over, but this is far from the case with the American Revolution. On the contrary, nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed.” For the generation that had lived through the 1760s and 1770s, opportunities abounded to help shape the new nation they had created. When Congress adopted the official seal of the new nation (found today on the back of every dollar bill), they included the Latin phrase Novus Ordo Seclorum, “a new order of the ages.” Thomas Paine wrote, “We have it in our power to begin the world over again.” Many in the new United States of America thought they could do just that.
The revolutionary leaders—Washington, Adams, Jefferson—have become cardboard characters. Their words have been invoked too often, their deeds too sanitized. But if today’s citizens are to make sense of the Revolution and the creation of a new nation, they need to see those leaders as real. In addition, people today need to realize that many other actors were also asserting their place in—or, in the case of American Indians and Loyalists, on the margins of—the new nation. Those known as the “founding fathers” were far from the only actors. Women who had lived through the Revolution were far less willing to leave political or domestic decisions to men than their mothers and grandmothers had been. Poor farmers often felt
