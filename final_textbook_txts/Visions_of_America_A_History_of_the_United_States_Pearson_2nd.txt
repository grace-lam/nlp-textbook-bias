The Atlantic World to 1590
 To the people who had lived in the Americas for millennia, the idea that theirs was a “New World” would have seemed strange. Scientists continue to debate when the first people arrived in the Americas from Asia, but estimates range from between 40,000 and 14,000 years ago. In the millennia that followed, the peoples of the Americas fanned out and established a range of societies. Yet to the Europeans who arrived in the Americas toward the end of the fifteenth century, America was indeed a “brave new world,” as William Shakespeare wrote, inhabited by exotic plants, animals, and peoples. In images and words Europeans portrayed this extraordinary land in the most fantastic terms. Some accounts spoke of America as an Eden-like earthly paradise inhabited by good-natured, but primitive, peoples. Others emphasized themes like those featured in this engraving, Amerigo Vespucci Awakens a Sleeping America. Vespucci, an Italian-Spanish navigator from whose first name the New World came to be called the Americas, gazes upon a naked native woman rising from her hammock. Her nudity symbolizes the wild sexuality Europeans believed characterized the native inhabitants of the Americas. The cannibals behind her, devouring human flesh, represent savagery, a second prominent element of the European vision of the New World. Neither vision of the Americas was accurate, but both would greatly complicate Europeans’ understanding of the American civilizations they encountered, leading to a legacy of violence, exploitation, and conquest. The European arrival in the Americas was part of a process of exploration and colonization pursued primarily by Portugal, Spain, France, and England. This impulse was driven both by a hunger for riches as well as by profound changes in European society, religion, economics, and politics brought on by the Renaissance and Reformation. Africa was eventually drawn into this vast trading network encompassing the entire Atlantic world. Colonization almost always involved the severe exploitation of native peoples, including dispossession of land and coerced labor. Eventually Europeans turned to the international slave trade and the labor of enslaved Africans to draw the wealth from the mines and fields of the New World.

 “Your Magnificence must know that herein they are so inhuman that they outdo every custom (even) of beasts; for they eat all their enemies whom they kill or capture . . . and are libidinous beyond measure.” AMERIGO VESPUCCI, 1497

The First Americans
 In one sense America was the New World—or at least a newer one in terms of human habitation. The oldest traces of human life have been found in Africa, where the earliest human fossil remains unearthed date to somewhere between 190,000 and 160,000 years ago. In contrast the oldest human fossils found in North America are roughly 14,000 years old, far more recent than those found in Europe, Asia, or Australia. The ancient inhabitants of America, Paleo-Indians, were an Ice Age people who survived largely by hunting big game and to a lesser extent by fishing and collecting edible plants. Within a few thousand years of their arrival in America from Asia, they had fanned out across the Americas. 1.1 Migration from Asia to America Most scholars believe the first inhabitants of America migrated from Asia across the Bering Strait by way of the land bridge that once connected Asia and North America.

Migration, Settlement, and
 the Rise of Agriculture Most scholars agree that humans first migrated to North America from Asia across a land bridge that formed during the Ice Age (1.1) about 20,000 years ago. This land bridge lasted from about 28,000 to 10,000 BCE before melting glacial waters submerged it below rising sea levels. An alternative theory holds that humans may have traveled to the New World by boat even earlier; this has attracted some support, but most scholars favor the land bridge theory. With much of the world’s oceans frozen in massive glaciers, ocean levels during the Ice Age were almost 360 feet lower than present-day levels, resulting in dry land where the Bering Strait is now. Nomadic hunters simply crossed what to them appeared an endless 600-mile wide tundra in pursuit of migratory big game animals like the woolly mammoths— huge, long-tusked members of the elephant family that provided furs for warm clothing and ample stocks of meat.

 slowly warmed as the Ice Age passed, causing the great glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise. The SO UT H rising waters covered the BerAM ERI CA ing Strait land bridge, cutting off migration from Asia. But the recession of the glaciers also opened the way for human migration southward and eastward into what is now Canada and the United States. Over time this migration reached the very tip of South Monte Verde, America. CHILE Armed with spears tipped with flint, a hard, dark stone, Paleo-Indians roamed in search of big game. These spear heads, called Clovis points, named after the New Mexico town in which scientists first discovered them, were one of the Stone Age tools used by the ancient

THE FIRST AMERICANS

 inhabitants of America. Clovis point arrowheads like those shown in (1.2) were lashed to poles to make simple spears. Paleo-Indians also used other simple stone tools such as stone axes and scrapers for hunting and preparing meat, a variety of bone tools such as antler harpoons for fishing, and bone needles for sewing hides. These ancient peoples generally hunted in small bands of perhaps 20 to 30 people in cooperative kin groups. Hunting parties pursued a wide range of prey, including primitive horses and the oversized ancestors of many modern species, such as beaver, bison, caribou, and forerunners of the camel. Hunting, gathering, and other activities among Stone Age peoples were probably divided along gender lines. Men hunted and fished, while women reared children, gathered nuts and berries, and made clothing. Many of the mammals that Paleo-Indians hunted, including horses and camels, eventually became extinct (the Spanish reintroduced modern horses from Europe thousands of years later). Three competing scientific theories attempt to explain the mass extinctions of large mammals in the Americas. Some scientists believe overhunting led to the demise of the large mammals. Others argue that dramatic climate change—the rising temperatures that accompanied the passing of the Ice Age—killed off animals that were unable to adapt to the new warmer environments. The most recent explanation focuses on diseases that may have been brought to the New World by humans and the animals that accompanied them, most notably dogs and possibly rats. Whatever the cause of the mass extinctions, the decline in large game eventually led PaleoIndians to search for new food sources and develop new modes of providing food and other necessities. Approximately 9,000 years ago, a period known as the Archaic Era began. Lasting approximately 6,000 years, it ushered in significant social changes that began with increased efforts by native peoples to shape the environment to enhance food production. At first these efforts were primitive. Archaic Era Indians, for example,

 burned forest underbrush to provide better habitats for smaller mammals such as deer, which they hunted. They also relied increasingly on gathering nuts and berries and, in some cases, on harvesting shellfish from lakes, streams, or coastal waters. The gendered division of labor found in Stone Age societies persisted into the Archaic Era: women cared for children and did much of the gathering and preparing of food while men hunted and fished. Some Archaic Era Indians even took the first steps toward agriculture. At first they encouraged the growth of edible plants, such as sunflowers and wild onions, by simply weeding out inedible plants around them. Over time Archaic Era Indians learned how to collect and plant seeds and developed basic ideas about irrigation. These primitive cultivation techniques led to increased food supplies and diminished reliance on hunting. By about 5000 BCE fixed agricultural settlements appeared in what is now Mexico. There native people learned how to grow maize (corn), squash, and beans, leading to the development of food surpluses and consequently large increases in population. Planting, tending, and defending crops necessitated the creation of larger permanent settlements, leading to urbanization, the creation of towns and cities. Increased food surpluses allowed the ancient peoples of the Americas to devote more resources to a variety of cultural, artistic, and engineering projects. The combination of agriculture, urbanism, and increasing social complexity set the foundation for the emergence of the first great civilizations of the southern region of North America, an area stretching from modern Mexico to Nicaragua known as Mesoamerica. The most advanced societies in Mesoamerica included the Olmecs (1150 BCE to about 800 BCE), Maya (peaked in 300 BCE–900 CE), and Toltecs (900 CE–1200 CE). These complex societies developed written languages, systems of mathematics, sophisticated irrigation techniques, and

As it developed, Aztec society became extremely stratified. At the top of the social pyramid sat a powerful emperor. Below the emperor were a class of nobles, a priestly class, a warrior class, and an administrative class that collected taxes and tributes. The foundation of this vast pyramid comprised merchants, artisans, and farmers. At the very bottom were slaves. Some were Aztec-born and became slaves temporarily as punishment for crime. Prisoners of war also added to the slave population, and human chattel was provided as part of tax debts owed to the Aztec Empire by its many conquered peoples. Gender roles were sharply defined among the Aztec. Women helped men tend the fields but were primarily responsible for child rearing, cooking, weaving cloth, and shopping in the markets.

An elaborate system of dams controlled the water level of the lake, while aqueducts carried fresh water to the city. A sophisticated system of floating gardens produced food to feed the large urban population, which swelled to almost 300,000 over the next two centuries. The

Eastern Woodlands
Indian Societies
 A different type of society developed in a region encompassing what is now the Eastern United States and Canada. In contrast to the native societies of the Southwest and Mesoamerica, Eastern Woodlands societies were neither highly urban nor stratified. Organized into tribes, these Eastern

How did Eastern Woodlands Indian and
 Mesoamerican societies differ?

 Woodlands Indian peoples lived as hunters and gatherers as well as agriculturalists. Most spoke a dialect of one of two major Indian languages, Iroquois and Algonquian. Instead of living in urban settlements, Eastern Woodland Indians moved with the seasons to take advantage of different food sources, tracking animals in forest regions or fishing in lakes, streams, and rivers. Consequently as this painting, one of the earliest European views of an actual Indian village (1.4), shows, their villages were composed of wood and bark structures that were easily disassembled and reassembled to make seasonal movement possible. Dwelling in small villages rather than settled urban areas, Eastern Woodlands Indians avoided many of the sanitation problems and diseases that periodically afflicted ancient cities such as Tenochtitlán and Cahokia. The complex religious life of Eastern Woodlands Indians embraced the concept of a supreme being, the great Manitou, but also included animism, or the belief that everything in nature possessed a spirit that had to be respected. Rather than seeking to own land and subdue the world around them in the manner of European societies, Eastern Woodlands Indians sought to inhabit the land and to live in dynamic relationship with it. These beliefs, however, did not keep them from actively altering or managing their environments to their advantage. Indians adopted strategies such as controlled burning of brush, a technique that encouraged the growth of habitats for the deer they hunted. This type of strategy contrasted with European agriculture, which used clear cutting to make land available for farming. The tribal societies of the Eastern seaboard had a relatively egalitarian political and social structure. Apart from the chief and a religious figure known as a shaman, most members of a tribe enjoyed a rough equality. While many indigenous societies in the Americas, particularly the more hierarchical ones of Mesoamerica, were patrilineal, with inheritance and decision making residing in the male

THE FIRST AMERICANS

 line, some Eastern Woodlands societies were matrilineal, tracing descent and determining inheritance from ancestors on the female side. In some tribes women enjoyed significant roles in tribal governance. When captives were taken in war, for example, women often decided whether to adopt or execute them. Nonetheless Woodland Indians divided labor along gender lines, with women consigned to the fields, planting beans, corn, and squash, while men tracked and hunted animals for food, hides, and pelts.

 “They are not delighted in baubles, but in useful things.… I have observed that they will not be troubled with superfluous commodities.” THOMAS MORTON, English lawyer, 1637 Eastern Woodland Indians were more communal than individualistic in outlook. Although trade was important and individuals might own some goods, accumulating material wealth was not an important goal, as it was in the more stratified Mesoamerican societies. Individual tribes controlled territory, but the notion of owning land as private property was alien to most of these tribal societies. Warfare among many Eastern Woodlands tribes was intermittent but common. They often fought over control of tribal territory or hunting rights. Warfare typically consisted of skirmishes between rival war parties, a style of combat that usually kept causalities low. Causalities suffered in war, however, might trigger further military actions, or “mourning wars,” intended to replenish the population reduced by fighting. In such a war some prisoners taken captive might be tortured and killed, while others deemed suitable were adopted by the tribe. The persistent warfare among tribes led to the creation of the powerful Iroquois League of Five Nations, an organization that sought to reduce conflict among its members: the Seneca, Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Oneida nations. Women played a significant role in the governance of the league. Female elders from each of the individual

 nations selected the men who formed the league’s Great Council, a body that met to discuss matters of common concern, especially war and peace.

American Societies on the Eve
 of European Contact American Indian societies were socially and culturally diverse, ranging from the highly stratified and urban Aztec in Mesoamerica to the relatively egalitarian hunter-farmer Iroquois in the Northeast. The peoples of the Americas spoke a host of different languages, developed distinctive religious traditions, and created different political models to govern themselves. These societies shared many characteristics among themselves and with peoples in other parts of the world. Like their Asian and European contemporaries, the societies of the Americas were pre-modern, with limited scientific knowledge and widespread belief in magic. Most people worked the land, struggling to provide the basics needed to support life. Except for the privileged few, life was hard, sometimes brutal, and short. In the Andes Mountains of South America, alpaca and llamas were domesticated, providing wool or food and, in the case of the llama, serving as a pack animal. But in contrast to Africa, Asia, or Europe, in North America and Mesoamerica there were no large domesticated animals, such as horses (extinct after the Paleo-Indian period), cattle, or camels. Without such animals the people of these regions lacked the mobility and power that horses afforded Europeans, Africans, and Asians and that camels provided for North Africans and Asians. American societies on the eve of contact with Europeans were distinctive in another way. While African and Asian societies had developed considerable trade with Europe, the peoples of the Americas had remained largely cut off from contact with other parts of the world for thousands of years. This isolation had prevented their exposure to a host of diseases. By the time of the first contact between Europe and America in the late 1400s, many of the inhabitants of Asia, Africa, and Europe, long exposed to a common pool of diseases because of their extensive trade contacts, had developed immunity to many virulent pathogens. In their relative isolation, however, the indigenous societies of the Americas were highly susceptible to the microbial invaders introduced by Europeans.

 What were some of the distinctive characteristics shared by all of the societies of the Americas?



 CHAPTER 1

PEOPLE IN MOTION: THE ATLANTIC WORLD TO 1590

European Civilization in Turmoil
 As the Aztec Empire was reaching the height of its power at the close of the fifteenth century, European society was in the midst of a profound transformation. This period of cultural, intellectual, scientific, and commercial flourishing is known as the Renaissance. The revival of interest in ancient Greek and Latin not only led to renewed interest in the civilizations of Greece and Rome but also caused Renaissance thinkers to re-examine the early history of the church and its teachings. Reformers drawing on these traditions and reacting to the corruption of the Roman Catholic Church challenged the authority of the church. The rise of a new strain of Christian thought, Protestantism, led to creation of a host of new Christian sects. Amid this tumult powerful monarchs across Europe forged new nation-states out of the relatively weak decentralized governments of Europe. Modern nations such as England, France, and Spain were born in this era. State building required money, and the monarchs of these nations were eager to increase their wealth and power, a desire that ultimately led to the colonization and exploration of Africa and the Americas.

The Allure of the East and
 the Challenge of Islam The leading European powers’ decision to explore, conquer, and exploit lands in the Atlantic world was facilitated by a host of economic, technological, and cultural changes. Contact with Asia led to major changes in taste and patterns of consumption during the early modern period, from the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries. Europeans looked beyond their borders, particularly to China and the Far East, for spices to enrich their bland foods and for luxury goods, especially exotic textiles such as silk and cotton, to enliven their fashions. These commodities, not native to Europe, had to be obtained from Asia. The overland trade routes to the East were controlled by Muslims, adherents of Islam, a monotheistic faith shaped by the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. Since its emergence in the seventh century Middle East, Muslim influence spread, stretching from Europe to parts of Africa and Asia. Europeans resented the economic power of Muslim rulers who controlled the lucrative trade routes to the East. European antagonism toward the Muslim world also sprang from an intense religious animosity. For almost 300 years, Christian Europe had waged a holy war against Islam, launching Crusades to regain control of Jerusalem, a city sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Islam’s influence in Europe was

 most pronounced in the Ottoman Empire, whose power eventually spread across the Eastern Mediterranean and Balkans.

Trade, Commerce,
 and Urbanization Among the important changes in Europe during this period was the dramatic growth of the economy. The Black Death (1347–1352 CE), a pandemic that spread to Europe between 1347 and 1352, wiped out about half of Europe’s population. In the centuries following the Black Death, Europe’s population began to expand again, eventually becoming larger than it had been before the epidemic. The economies of Europe also recovered. By 1400, the Italian city-states, especially Venice, dominated trade and finance, particularly trade with the East. In part, Venice’s dominance resulted from its proximity to the lucrative eastern trade routes. Italy also dominated textile production, and Florence became Europe’s leading producer of woolen cloth. Slowly the economic center of Europe shifted west and north. By about 1500, the city of Antwerp in what is today Belgium had become the leading commercial center of Europe but was eventually surpassed by the Dutch port of Amsterdam. As trade and commerce expanded, innovative financial practices and services facilitated continued economic growth. New accounting methods helped

 merchants keep track of inventories and profits and losses. Marine insurance reduced the risks of maritime trade. A more elaborate banking system also helped finance trade. The growth of deposit banking, a system in which merchants could deposit funds with bankers and then draw on written checks instead of presenting gold or silver coins for payment of goods, greatly bolstered trade and commerce. All these developments made economic ventures more secure and encouraged investment, some of which was directed toward overseas trade and exploration. Together the new commercial and financial practices were key elements in the growth of capitalism. Simply put, capitalism is an economic system in which a market economy, geared toward the maximization of profit, determines the prices of goods and services. This new, profit-driven capitalist ethos slowly transformed European life beginning in the fifteenth century. Capitalism also transformed rural Europe. European culture had always viewed nature as something to be tamed and exploited (see Competing Visions: European and Huron Views of Nature, page 12.) Rather than simply produce food for themselves, the new capitalist ethos led some farmers to seek the maximum yield from their land and plant crops that would fetch a higher price at market. In other cases landowners evicted farmers from their lands, so that they could graze sheep on the land and produce wool that would be turned into cloth. This latter change in agriculture forced many to leave the countryside and seek employment in towns and cities. Migration from the countryside and commercial development led to greater urbanization in Europe. In the two centuries after the Black Death, the population of London increased from 50,000 to more than 200,000. Outside of London, England’s changes were less dramatic, but no less significant. Populations mushroomed in ports such as Bristol, regional market towns such as Cambridge, and the new textile centers such as Norwich.

View the Map Spread of Printing


 Technological improvements and new inventions also spurred economic growth. The printing press transformed the way knowledge was produced and disseminated. While a scribe hand-copying a book onto parchment might turn out two or three books a year, the typical print run of a book produced on paper by a printing press was between 100 and 1,000. Printed books not only made it easier to preserve knowledge but also encouraged advances in science and in geographic exploration by making it easier to collect, organize, and analyze information. Printed texts and engraved images also whet the appetites of Europeans for exploration by making accounts of exotic places such as India and China more accessible. Marco Polo’s (1254?–1324) influential text about his adventures in China, The Travels of Marco Polo, circulated widely in manuscript form for more than a century before a printed edition appeared in 1477. Printing created an entire new industry for the production, dissemination, and sale of books. The new technology also transformed visual culture, making it possible to create cheap images. The new technique of engraving (1.5) was a multistep process. On the right a skilled craftsman gouges out an image on a copper plate. In the center the plates are inked and then wiped clean. On the left the final stages in the engraving process are demonstrated, including the giant press used to create the final image.

Competing Visions
EUROPEAN AND HURON VIEWS OF NATURE
European capitalism was built on deeply rooted beliefs, including the notion of private property and the belief that nature existed as a resource for humans to tame and exploit. European and Eastern Woodlands Indian cultures had starkly different attitudes toward the natural world. Following a mandate laid down in the biblical Book of Genesis, Europeans believed that they had a God-given right to rule over nature. The Huron, an Eastern Woodlands Indian tribe from Canada, approached nature in a radically different way that reflected their animist belief that all living things had spiritual power. What ecological consequences flowed from the Huron view of nature? How might this view have shaped the European impression of Indians? What ecological consequences follow from the Western view? In Genesis God gave humans complete control over nature. According to this view humanity was not simply enjoined to “subdue nature” but to make sure that the “fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth.” And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. King James Bible, Genesis 1:28 (1611) 
Lucas Cranach, Adam and Eve


 How does this painting of Adam and Eve reflect European views of nature?

 One of the best sources for understanding Indian views of nature can be found in the writings of Jesuit missionaries, a Catholic order active in the French colonization of Canada. In this selection a Jesuit recounts his exchange with a Huron Indian about the proper treatment of animal bones, which Hurons believed had to be treated with respect to avoid angering the animal spirits that might take offense and make hunting more difficult. It is remarkable how they gather and collect these bones, and preserve them with so much care, that you would say their game would be lost if they violated their superstitions. As I was laughing at them, and telling them that Beavers do not know what is done with their bones, they answered me, “Thou dost not know how to take Beavers, and thou wishest to talk about it.” Before the Beaver was entirely dead, they told me, its soul comes to make the round of the Cabin of him who has killed it, and looks very carefully to see what is done with its bones; if they are given to the dogs, the other Beavers would be apprised of it and therefore they would make themselves hard to capture.

EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION IN TURMOIL

Renaissance and Reformation
 A revival of interest in the cultures of Greek and Roman antiquity, arising first in Italy, spread across Europe at the end of the fifteenth century. This rebirth of classical learning, the Renaissance, transformed the way Europeans thought about art, architecture, science, and political philosophy. The most significant change was the shift from theology, the primary scholarly subject in the Middle Ages, to the study of the liberal arts, including poetry, history, and philosophy. Much like the ancient Greeks, Renaissance scholars emphasized the human capacity for self-improvement and exalted the beauty of the human body in painting and sculpture. For these scholars, known as humanists, humans were the masters of their world and obligated to study it. These Renaissance values, in particular the spirit of exploration, would soon inspire explorers to seek out new lands and trade routes. In contrast to medieval Europe, with its cloistered monasteries where monks prayed and copied texts for their own libraries, the Renaissance placed a high value on public art, architecture, and philosophical thought aimed at civilizing humanity. Civic humanism, the new philosophy of the Renaissance, encouraged artists and philosophers to participate in public life, especially in cities, which replaced monasteries as the ideal place to encourage learning and glorify God. The study of ancient languages fostered a new interest in the early church and inspired some religious figures to call for reforms in the Roman Catholic Church. One church practice that drew intense criticism was the sale of indulgences. In essence money donated to the Church could buy forgiveness for sin in this life and after death. In 1517 a young German monk named Martin Luther attacked the sale of indulgences and other key elements of Catholic doctrine and practice. Luther eventually developed a new theological alternative to Catholicism. Rejecting the Catholic Church’s focus on good works as the key to achieving salvation, Luther argued that only faith could bring salvation. Luther also argued that ordinary people did not need to depend on the clergy to gain access to God’s word; they could and should read the Bible themselves. Luther translated the Bible from Greek and Latin to German, and the newly invented printing press made it widely accessible. Anyone who could read could now receive the word of God in his or her own home. Luther championed the idea of the priesthood of all true believers—the notion that everyone could



 experience salvation directly. Priests would continue to preach the word of God and perform rituals such baptizing infants and marriage ceremonies, but Luther would dispense with the Catholic ritual of going to a priest for confession, penance, and absolution for sins. Luther also rejected monasticism. The place for the committed Christian was in this world, not cloistered away in a monastery. Luther also urged Christian monarchs to take up the cause of religious reform and reject the authority of the Pope. His attack on the political power of the Roman Catholic Church appealed to some European rulers eager to strengthen their power. Luther was summarily excommunicated by the Church, but his calls for reform had wide appeal, especially in what is now Germany and Scandinavia. His supporters, known as Protestants, began a movement for religious reform known as the Reformation. Protestantism found an especially receptive home in Geneva, a French-speaking city in Switzerland. Here the French reformer John Calvin (1509–1564) articulated a new variant of Protestantism with a different theological emphasis from Luther’s version. Calvin’s theology stressed the doctrine of pre-destination, the notion that God had destined people to salvation or damnation prior to their birth no matter how righteously or wickedly they lived. He also maintained that the true church was not embodied in any official organization, including the Roman Catholic Church, but rather in a group of the “elect,” or those chosen by God for salvation. According to this ideal the elect could continue to act as a reformed church even if they had no physical place of worship or formal ministry to serve their spiritual needs. With the Bible and personal faith, argued Calvin, Protestants could constitute a true church wherever they lived, including, eventually, a wilderness like America. Calvinists in Switzerland and elsewhere took their critique of Catholic worship a step further than Lutherans, becoming iconoclasts, or image breakers. They took the biblical injunction in Exodus to avoid “graven,” or carved images literally: decrying them as sacrilegious and a form of idolatry, Calvinists smashed the stained glass windows and religious carvings that adorned churches. One Catholic nun described a Protestant rampage in Geneva in these terms: “Like enraged wolves, they destroyed those fine images with great axes, and hammers, especially going after the blessed crucifix, and the image of Our Lady [Mary].” This contemporary image of one such rampage shows Protestants pulling down sculptures and smashing stained glass

 windows (1.6). Once purged of all such Catholic images, religious worship, Calvinists believed, could focus on the words of the Bible alone. In 1560 English Calvinists published the Geneva Bible, a text that would become the most important text for Englishspeaking Protestants.

New Monarchs and the
Rise of the Nation-State
 By 1500, the kingdoms of France, England, Portugal, and Spain had evolved into sovereign nation-states. Powerful monarchs consolidated their power, eliminated rivals to their thrones, created administrative bureaucracies to rule, and built larger, more effective armies. Paying for these required huge sums of money, and if they could not raise what they needed at home, some monarchs began to look

 abroad. Territorial expansion and exploration of new regions, they reasoned, would increase both trade and revenues. In England Henry VII (r. 1485–1509) established the House of Tudor as the ruling family of England. His son, Henry VIII (r. 1509–1547), expanded the power of the monarchy. His most important act as king of England was his break with Rome when the Pope refused to dissolve his marriage to the Spanish princess Catherine of Aragon. After failing to obtain a divorce, Henry declared himself head of his own independent English church. He rejected the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, confiscated the monastic lands, and sold them for a handsome profit or gave them to favored supporters. The intensity of Henry’s anti-Catholic feeling (and his particular hostility to the Pope) is evident in this portrait painted by an unknown artist in 1570 (1.7). Henry VIII lies in bed, pointing to his

 son and successor Edward VI (r. 1547–1553). The Pope collapses in the foreground and two monks flee the scene, while a monastery is sacked in the background. Perhaps the most ambitious of the new monarchies was Spain’s, created by the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. When they became joint rulers of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella followed a strategy common to all the new monarchs: they reduced the power of the nobility and strengthened their own control over the military. They also boosted crown revenue by raising taxes and making tax collection more efficient. As part of their effort to transform Spain into a world power, Ferdinand and Isabella sought to strengthen the power of the Roman Catholic Church and ally its interests with the state. In 1478 the Spanish monarchy sought the Pope’s approval to create the Spanish Inquisition, a religious tribunal charged



 with finding and punishing heresy, or unorthodox beliefs among Christians, and for eliminating nonChristians, most notably Muslims and Jews, from Spain. Thousands of suspected heretics were arrested, tortured, and imprisoned. Hundreds were executed. Eventually in 1492 the government ordered all Jews, except those who converted to Christianity, expelled from Spain. That same year Ferdinand and Isabella achieved another goal in their effort to strengthen Church and state by conquering Granada, the last remaining Islamic state in Spain. The conquest of the last Muslim kingdom in Spain, in 1492 was the final phase of this reconquista (“re-conquest”). Spain’s holy war united state and Church in a single purpose. This partnership between a militant clergy and an equally aggressive military would serve Spain well when its attention moved beyond Europe to the wider Atlantic world.

Columbus and the
Columbian Exchange
 In 1492, Queen Isabella agreed to outfit a small expedition to find a quicker route to Asia. The expedition’s leader, an Italian sailor named Christopher Columbus, was an experienced mariner who had worked in the Portuguese seagoing trade to Africa and the Atlantic islands. Familiar with Marco Polo’s written accounts of China, Columbus believed he could find a faster and more direct route to Asia than traveling around the tip of Africa by simply crossing the Atlantic. He first asked the King of Portugal to fund the voyage, but the king’s advisors warned Columbus that he had greatly underestimated the circumference of the Earth and would certainly perish long before he reached Asia. Undeterred Columbus turned to Queen Isabella, who consented to fund his expedition.

Columbus Encounters
 the “Indians” After sailing for 33 days, Columbus reached the Caribbean islands, most likely the Bahamas. Mistakenly convinced that he had arrived in India, he called the native peoples “Indians.” Columbus claimed all the lands he visited for Spain. Concluding that the native people were savages, he believed that they were “fit to be ordered about, and made to work, plant, and do everything else that may be needed, and build towns and be taught our customs.” Returning to Spain with captive Indians, exotic plants, and gold, Columbus was greeted as a hero and secured funding for additional voyages of exploration. Columbus was not the first European to cross the Atlantic, nor was he the first to create a small European outpost in America. The Vikings had sailed from Iceland almost 400 years earlier, establishing small fishing outposts in what is now Newfoundland, Canada. Nevertheless Columbus’s voyage to the Americas brought the two worlds together in ways that Viking ventures had not. Europe’s printing presses would make

 accounts of his voyage widely available, providing a model for later explorers, conquerors, and settlers. Columbus’s voyage also began one of the most complex ecological changes in modern history. The worlds on both sides of the Atlantic were suddenly reconnected, a development that would have far-reaching biological consequences for Europe, Africa, and America. Modern scholars have described the biological encounter between the two sides of the Atlantic as the Columbian Exchange (1.8), a name that acknowledges the crucial role that Columbus played in instigating this transformation. This exchange involved a range of foods, plants, animals, and diseases. Moving from the Americas to Europe by way of Columbus and the Europeans who followed him were a host of foods now closely identified with European cuisine. Before Columbus Italian cuisine had no tomatoes, Irish and German food no potatoes, and Switzerland no chocolate. Moving in the other direction were animals, including the horse, long extinct in the Americas but reintroduced by the Spanish, sheep, cattle, and swine.

 “As soon as I arrived in the Indies, in the first island which I found, I took by force some of them, in order that they might learn and give me information.” CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, 1493

 This table shows the most important crops and animals involved in the Columbian Exchange. A host of pathogens, mostly of Old World origin, were also part of the Columbian Exchange.

 Diseases also crossed the Atlantic. Europeans may have brought back a plague in the form of a more deadly strain of the sexually transmitted disease syphilis that sailors picked up on the Caribbean islands. Far more devastating were the diseases like smallpox brought to the New World. These diseases killed huge numbers of Indian men, women, and children.

European Technology
 in the Era of the Columbian Exchange Columbus and the Europeans who led the exploration of the Atlantic world benefited from technological changes developed in Europe in the fifteenth century. Improvements in map making and the introduction of navigational devices that allowed mariners to calculate latitude more accurately aided exploration. Europeans borrowed technology from the Islamic world and Asia to improve their ships. The Portuguese also made important strides in ship-building with the caravel, a vessel whose lateen (triangular) sails were better suited to catching wind than were those of traditional European ships.

 Watch the Video What is Columbus’s Legacy?

 Europeans enjoyed a clear technological and military advantage over the peoples of America, a disparity that would profoundly affect European interactions with the Aztec, and later with Eastern Woodlands Indian peoples. Foremost among these advantages were the metallurgical techniques that allowed Europeans to forge iron weapons that were stronger than those of the Aztec and other Indians. Domesticated horses allowed Europeans to support their armies with swiftmoving cavalry. Through trade with China, Europeans had learned about gunpowder and developed powerful cannons and firearms such as the arquebus, a forerunner of the musket and rifle. Among the inventions depicted in this engraving, “Nova Reperta,” (“New Discoveries”) (1584), by artist Johannes Stradanus, are the compass, the mechanical clock, cannons and gunpowder, and a saddle with stirrups (1.9).

 regime and the deadly diseases the Spanish brought nearly wiped out these indigenous populations. On the island of Hispaniola (present-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic), 95 percent of the native peoples died within 25 years. Faced with the loss of this indigenous labor force, the Spanish turned to the African slave trade to supply the labor they demanded for the production of lucrative cash crops such as sugar. Spanish conquistadores, lured by rumors of a fabulous empire possessing great wealth, eventually turned their attention to the mainland of what is now Mexico. In 1519, eager to acquire this wealth for himself and Spain, Hernán Cortés, a brash and ambitious protégé of the Spanish governor of Hispaniola, embarked on an expedition to find the famed capital

 of the Aztec Empire and conquer it. Landing on Mexico’s southeast coast with over 500 men and 16 horses, he burned his ships, depriving his men of any opportunity to retreat. He forced his men to push forward to conquer or die in the attempt. Although vastly outnumbered by the Aztecs, Cortés and his men had military advantages. First they possessed horses, firearms, and steel weapons. Second they quickly gained allies among the peoples conquered by the Aztecs. After years of subjugation in which they were forced to provide the Aztecs with victims for human sacrifice, these exploited peoples now willingly sided with the Spanish. Finally the Spanish unknowingly carried with them a host of diseases, in particular the deadly smallpox virus that infected and killed vast numbers of Aztecs. By 1521,

 just two years after his arrival, Cortés had subdued the once mighty Aztec Empire. A decade later other Spanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro toppled the similarly powerful Inca Empire which stretched from present-day Ecuador to what is now Chile. To many people of the Americas, who had never seen anything like firearms before, the Spanish did seem to have god-like power. European firearms left an indelible impression on South American cultures. Created centuries after European contact, this Peruvian painting (1.10) shows an angel carrying an arquebus, the type of firearm used by the Spanish during their conquest of Central and South America. The Spanish took advantage of the existing systems of tribute and taxation created by the Aztec to extract the maximum amount of wealth from the region. Spanish America yielded a glittering array of valuable items from gold to pearls. The Spanish also began exporting prized dyes such as the brilliant red cochineal and indigo. The latter blue dye became closely associated with a type of cloth associated with the Italian city of Genoa. The French name for this cloth “bleu de Gênes” is the origin of the modern word blue jeans. Among the agricultural products exported, cacao, the key ingredient in chocolate, helped spur a Spanish obsession with drinking chocolate. In contrast to the Aztecs, the Spanish preferred to drink their chocolate with an added sweetener, such as honey and eventually sugar. In the 1540s, the discovery of silver in what is now Peru generated what became the most profitable American commodity for export. Silver would become the cornerstone of Spain’s new-found wealth. Silver was a mixed blessing for the Spanish economy. The influx of large amounts of silver into the Spanish economy helped some become rich, but others suffered as prices were inflated as more and more of the precious metal was introduced into the economy.

 CHAPTER 1

PEOPLE IN MOTION: THE ATLANTIC WORLD TO 1590

West African Worlds
 Africa, the world’s second largest continent in terms of land mass, is home to some of the most ancient civilizations in the world. The range of societies in Africa in the sixteenth century rivaled those of the Americas in social complexity and cultural and religious diversity. Africa featured class-stratified urban civilizations alongside more simple egalitarian societies. Monotheistic faiths, including Christianity and Islam, flourished in parts of Africa, as did religions closer in principle to the animist beliefs of Eastern Woodlands Indians. The North African states on the Mediterranean had been trading with Europe since the founding of the great ancient port of Carthage (814 BCE) near modern Tunis. Africans possessed many commodities sought by Europeans, including salt, gold, ivory, and exotic woods. But the development of a direct sea route from Europe to West Africa in the fifteenth century greatly increased trade and contact between Europeans and Africans. The most profound consequence of the sea routes to West Africa was the development of the international slave trade, a process that changed virtually every society in the Atlantic world.

West African Societies,
Islam, and Trade
 The civilizations of Africa south of the Sahara Desert, including those with Atlantic ports, were socially and culturally diverse. The powerful Songhai Empire (1370–1591) extended from the Atlantic inward to the Sudan. Primarily agricultural, the empire included urban centers and a highly organized military and administrative bureaucracy. In the great city of Timbuktu, an Islamic university rivaled many European centers of learning. Other peoples, such as the Igbos of West Africa, lived in smaller, autonomous villages. These simpler, more egalitarian societies were organized mainly around kinship, more like America’s Eastern Woodlands Indians than the empires of Mesoamerica or the rising nation-states of Europe. Local rulers consulted with a council of elders before making decisions affecting the community. Societies such as the Igbos were matrilineal, whereas other African societies traced descent and organized inheritance through the paternal line. Before the seventh century most societies of West Africa practiced animist religions. These polytheistic faiths considered aspects of nature, such as the sun, wind, and animals, to be gods and spirits. Ancestor worship also played a prominent role in many West African religious traditions. But beginning in the mid-seventh century, the faith of Islam,

 What were the major religious traditions of Africa?

 first established in Arabia by Muhammad in 622 CE, began spreading via trade routes through northern, western, and eastern Africa. Islam eventually became the dominant religion in these areas, especially in trading centers. Trade played a key role in the economic life of both North and West Africa. Trade goods included salt, ivory, and precious metals. While salt was an essential ingredient for cooking and preserving food, the other items were sought by artists and artisans who fashioned them into luxury goods such as jewelry. An extensive network of caravan routes linked West Africa to the North African ports of Tangier, Tunis, Tripoli, and Alexandria. But Portuguese exploration of the African coast in the late 1400s soon led to the development of direct trade between Europeans and Africans (1.11).

The Portuguese-African
Connection
 Portugal took the lead in exploring an Atlantic route to Asia, which provided Europe with spices and exotic fabrics such as silk and cotton. Prince Henry the Navigator (1394–1460), a member of the Portuguese royal family, used his wealth and power to encourage exploration of the West African coast. Even after his death Portugal continued to explore the West African coast, leading to Vasco da Gama’s voyage (1497–1499) around the Horn of Africa and arrival on the southwest

 coast of India (1.11). Portuguese traders then established a lucrative trade with India and began to explore trading possibilities with Africa, seeking such prized goods as ivory and gold. After 1470, Portuguese trade with West Africa increased, and within a decade the Portuguese had established forts along the African coasts to facilitate further trading opportunities. At approximately the same time that the Portuguese were exploring the African coast, they were embarking on an ambitious but ruthless plan of conquest and colonization in the Atlantic island groups of the Madeiras, Azores, and Cape Verde, (1.11). These Atlantic outposts were converted into sugarproducing plantation economies. The Portuguese also vied with the Spanish for pre-eminence in the Canary Islands. The Pope eventually brokered a treaty between these two Iberian powers, giving control to the Spanish. The biggest losers were the indigenous populations of the Canary Islands, the Guanche—a North African people who had settled the islands thousands of years earlier. The semitropical climate of the Canaries was ideal for sugar cultivation. The Pope blessed the Guanche enslavement,

 which was entirely justified because the Guanche were, in his words, “infidels and savages.” The model developed in the Canaries foreshadowed European interactions with the peoples of the Americas. With no previous exposure to the diseases carried by Europeans, thousands of Guanche people became ill and died. Unable to rely on an indigenous source of labor, Europeans eventually turned to Africa for slaves to provide the back-breaking labor they demanded for cultivating, harvesting, and processing sugar.

African Slavery
 Slavery was widely practiced in Africa long before the arrival of the Portuguese. Rival tribes usually took slaves as spoils of war; but some prisoners attained privileged positions as petty officials, military leaders, and, in rare cases, political advisors to rulers. In Africa slavery was not always a permanent or hereditary condition, and slaves were sometimes absorbed into the societies that held them.

 What arguments were used to justify the enslavement of the Guanche?



 CHAPTER 1

 plantations, prompted rival European powers to compete with one another for a share of this lucrative trade. As the value of slaves increased, Africans began raiding neighboring territories with the express purpose of obtaining slaves. European involvement in the African slave trade transformed this centuries-old institution into one of the most exploitative labor systems in world history. Europeans developed a racist conception of slavery that declared people of dark skin to be inferior beings for whom slavery was a natural and proper condition. As a consequence Europeans treated slaves as property with few legal rights or protections. Masters were free to extract the maximum amount of labor from them with minimal regard for their humanity. Slaves taken by Europeans to the Americas were often worked literally to death in the sugar fields. Those who survived found that slavery in the New World was a permanent and hereditary condition. They and their descendants faced a lifetime of slavery with no hope of ever obtaining freedom. Some West African nations managed to fend off the ravages of the slave trade. Benin, a well-organized nation-state ruled by a powerful monarch, traded slaves captured during war to the Portuguese in the fifteenth century but gradually withdrew from the slave trade (see Choices and Consequences: Benin, Portugal, and the International Slave Trade, page 23). Benin continued to trade with the Portuguese on its own terms. Among the goods sought by the Portuguese were a type of pepper and ivory; the Benin sought bronze from the Portuguese. Among the most visually impressive uses of this bronze were the finely crafted panels created for the walls of the royal palace. In the panel pictured here (1.12), a Portuguese soldier with a pike is surrounded by five “manilas,” the bronze bars that were among the most important trade goods brought by the Portuguese.

 “[T]hey kidnap even noblemen, and the sons of noblemen, and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the white men who are in our Kingdoms . . . and as soon as they are taken . . . they are immediately ironed and branded with fire.” NZINGA MBEMBA (King Afonso of the Kongo, Central Africa), 1526

Choices and Consequences
BENIN, PORTUGAL, AND THE INTERNATIONAL SLAVE TRADE
The Portuguese took advantage of ethnic and tribal rivalries and the traditional African practice of taking captured opponents as slaves. Africans were eager to trade with the Portuguese who offered highly prized goods such as bronze, cloth, horses, and in limited cases, firearms. The Kingdom of Benin, one of the more powerful West-African kingdoms initially participated in this trade, but by 1516 the Oba (King) faced a momentous decision about whether to continue the slave trade.

Controversies
 What does the kingdom of Benin’s experiences with the slave trade reveal about the nature of African slavery? Few scholars believe Benin’s actions were motivated by humanitarian concerns about the evils of slavery, which the African kingdom continued to tolerate. Scholars disagree over Benin’s motivation for ending its involvement in the slave trade. Some argue that Benin’s economy required a large supply of labor, which meant it could ill afford to export slaves. Others argue that Benin’s rulers wisely calculated that continued expansion and warfare would only weaken their power and lead to political instability.



 Continue to trade with the Portuguese, and participate fully in the expanding international slave trade



 Continue to trade with the Portuguese, but end their involvement in the international slave trade

Decision
 Benin’s king continued to trade with the Portuguese but restricted the trade in male slaves, the most sought after slaves for heavy agricultural labor. Benin allowed women to be traded (eventually prohibiting this trade too) and continued to tolerate slavery within its own kingdom.

Consequences
 Benin’s decision allowed it to prosper and preserve its political autonomy far longer than many neighboring states. Benin obtained the benefits of trade by selling cloth instead of slaves. By refusing to become a major supplier of slaves, Benin avoided the costly and potentially destabilizing warfare needed to obtain large numbers of slaves.

PEOPLE IN MOTION: THE ATLANTIC WORLD TO 1590

European Colonization
 of the Atlantic World By the early sixteenth century, Portugal, Spain, and France had established permanent outposts in the Atlantic world, with England soon to follow. Each of these nations concentrated on a particular region of the Atlantic world (1.13). Portugal focused primarily on West Africa and Brazil, where trade in slaves and production of sugar generated enormous profits. Spain’s massive empire in the Atlantic extended from the tip of South America to southwestern North America. The Spanish Empire’s chief export was silver. Meanwhile France directed its attention northward toward Canada, where the fur trade produced a lucrative commodity for export, and south to the Caribbean islands where plantations could produce sugar and tobacco. Finally England, a relative latecomer to colonization, established its first outposts on the east coast of North America, in present-day North Carolina and Virginia.

1.13 Major European Explorations of the Atlantic
 The European nations that explored the Atlantic took different arcs. The Portuguese turned toward Africa, the Spanish explored Central and South America, and the English and French focused on the North Atlantic.

What was the Black Legend?




 The Spanish had used images of Aztec human sacrifice to justify their conquest and Spain’s rivals, particularly Protestant nations such as England, used the power of images for their own political advantage. Tales of Spanish brutality during the conquest of the Americas gave rise to the “Black Legend.” This indictment of Spanish cruelty toward the native peoples of the Americas first appeared in the writings of the Spanish bishop, Bartolomé de Las Casas, in the 1550s. The new medium of print allowed copies of his scathing critique of Spanish colonialism to be distributed throughout Europe; it was soon translated into French, Dutch, and English. Some of these translations contained gruesome wood-cut images such as those that appeared in the English edition, The Tears of the Indians (1656). The four scenes depicted on the front cover of the book, the “massacre and slaughter” of the Indian inhabitants of the

EUROPEAN COLONIZATION OF THE ATLANTIC WORLD

 Americas, are described in Las Casas’s narrative. The title page shows scenes of torture and punishment, including being hacked to death and burnt alive (1.14). Within two decades the Spanish had conquered much of Central and South America. Inspired by tales of fabulously wealthy civilizations to the north, they launched expeditions to explore the vast continent of North America. Hernando de Soto’s expedition to Florida explored much of the southeastern United States in 1539. Another expedition in 1540, under the command of Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, traversed a huge swath of western America from what is now Kansas to Colorado. Subsequent settlements in Florida and the Southwest greatly extended the Spanish Empire. Within 60 years of conquering the Aztecs and Incas, Spain’s North American colonial empire extended from Santa Fe (present-day New Mexico) in the west, to St. Augustine (present-day Florida) in the east, and then all the way south to what are now Chile and Argentina—an area larger than ancient Rome’s vast empire. The Spanish crown had taken an active role in colonizing these regions, and the government it created to rule its American empire reflected the investment of time, money, and resources. The empire was divided into a series of administrative units and was staffed by a large number of bureaucrats and administrative officials. Of crucial importance was Spain’s board of trade, headquartered in the Spanish port of Seville. It granted licenses for trade with Spain’s colonies, enforced commercial laws, and collected customs taxes and any revenues due the crown. Along with the colonial government, the Roman Catholic Church exercised enormous power and influence in Spanish America. Spain granted the Church sizeable amounts of land and money, and priests and church officials enjoyed a privileged status. They also bore responsibilities such as establishing churches, schools, and hospitals, converting native people to the faith, and enforcing religious conformity through the Inquisition. The Spanish established a network of interconnected urban centers to aid them in the administration of the peoples and territories they conquered. In part this policy reflected the relatively high degree of urbanization the Spanish found among the civilizations of Mesoamerica and South America. However, this model of organization also reflected Spanish values and interests, allowing them to project the power of the church and state in highly visible ways. By 1600, there were 225 towns in Spanish America, all laid out according to Renaissance models of urban



 1.14 Illustration from Bartolomé de Las Casas, The Tears of the Indians This illustration from The Tears of the Indians, the English translation of Las Casas’s work, portrays Spanish cruelty toward Indians.

 planning in a grid-like pattern. The grand central plazas in the larger towns and cities afforded both a place for commerce and a symbolic space for monumental civic and church architecture. This painting of the central plaza in Mexico City (1.15) captures the use of urban planning and monumental architecture to reinforce the power of the state and the church. The cathedral and the viceroy’s (local governor) and archbishop’s palaces tower over the central square, vivid reminders of the dominance of church and state.

 What does the architecture of the central Plaza of Mexico City tell us about Spain’s approach to colonization?

PEOPLE IN MOTION: THE ATLANTIC WORLD TO 1590

 Much of the economy of New Spain was based on a highly exploitive system of labor. Ensuring an adequate labor supply for the arduous mining and agricultural work became a top economic priority of Spanish colonial officials. Rather than enslave the inhabitants of Central and South America as they had done to the native peoples in the Caribbean islands, the Spanish developed a system of forced labor, the encomienda, that was only marginally less exploitive than slavery itself. The crown declared Indians “vassals” who owed their labor to noblemen who in turn were required to provide for the Indians’ spiritual welfare. The system provided labor and in theory demonstrated the Spanish commitment to saving the souls of the Indians by converting them. In reality it led to

 the brutal exploitation of Indians. Criticism of the system by religious reformers such as Las Casas, combined with high mortality among the indigenous population, which easily succumbed to diseases brought by the Spanish, eventually led to the use of other types of labor, including conscript (enrolled by compulsion) labor, wage labor, and slavery.

 rejected the authority of the treaty and sent fleets to take advantage of the abundant cod fisheries in the waters off what is now Newfoundland. In 1524 France dispatched Giovanni da Verrazano, an Italian mariner working for the king of France, to find the so-called Northwest Passage that would allow ships to sail through the waterways of the Americas to Asia. Although Verrazano failed to find such a route (it did not exist), his mapping of the North American coast aroused the interest of the French monarch, who decided to commit additional resources for further exploration of North America. In the 1530s French explorer Jacques Cartier made a more extensive and detailed investigation of the North Atlantic, eventually traveling up the St. Lawrence River, where he encountered a group of Micmac Indians (an Algonquian-speaking Eastern Woodlands Indian nation). Their offer of furs in exchange for European goods such as

 knives, kettles, and beads led the French to recognize the potential of furs as a lucrative commodity. Furs could be sold to Europeans who valued their warmth and treated them as a high-status luxury item. In 1604, the French established Port Royal in Nova Scotia and four years later founded the city of Quebec, now the capital of the province of Quebec, on the banks of the St. Lawrence River. Located on a high ridge at a strategic bend in the river, Quebec was well placed to allow the French to trade with the local Indians, who were skilled fur trappers. The beaver pelts traded to the French fetched a good price in the European markets. The French encounter with Native Americans differed from that of the Spanish and Portuguese in three significant ways. First, the relatively small size of the settlement in New France and the dependence of the French on Indians to provide furs necessitated maintaining good relations with local tribes. Second, the predominantly male French population intermarried with local Indians. Eventually the French government even encouraged intermarriage, believing it would lead to the gradual assimilation of the Indian population into the French culture of New France. Third, the French like the Spanish were committed to converting the Indians to their Catholic faith, but rather than trying to impose Catholicism by force, French Jesuit missionaries lived among Indians and learned their languages and customs. The French Jesuits were just as eager as the Spanish to convert the Indians, but they recognized the need to understand the culture of those they wished to convert. The French also took advantage of religious art and images to help convert the Indians. This early account of life in New France includes an image that shows how religious painting was used to introduce Indians to Christian ideas (1.16).

PEOPLE IN MOTION: THE ATLANTIC WORLD TO 1590

English Expansion:
Ireland and Virginia
 Although England took advantage of the rich opportunities for fishing provided by the Atlantic Ocean, its exploration of the Americas was a relatively low priority for most of the sixteenth century. Three factors explain this lack of interest. First England faced less economic pressure to find export markets because its primary export—wool—was in high demand on the European continent. Second England faced a crisis of leadership after the death of Henry VIII in 1547. He was succeeded by his sickly ten-year-old son, Edward VI, who died in 1553 only six years into his reign. Next came Henry’s daughter Mary I, who tried to reestablish Catholicism, a campaign that included the intense persecution of Protestants. Her reign was also short; she died in 1558. Finally England was bogged down in a colonial venture closer to home, the subjugation of Ireland. Spain easily conquered the last Moors in Spain before moving on to Atlantic exploration in 1492. Irish resistance to English colonization, by contrast, tied up English resources for decades. Yet even as the English struggled to colonize Ireland, these experiences provided a distinctive model for future colonial policy in the New World. While the Spanish set out to conquer and convert the inhabitants of the Americas, absorbing them into Spanish society as a subordinate class at the bottom of the social order, the English took a different approach. Rather than attempt to incorporate the Irish, the English expelled them from their land. They then repopulated the land with colonists from England and Scotland, creating plantations, or fortified outposts dedicated to producing agricultural products for export. Originally the term plantation simply meant any English settlement in a foreign land, but it later became synonymous with a distinctive slave-based labor system used in much of the Atlantic world. One source of this policy of exclusion can be traced to the intense religious animosity between Protestants and Catholics. The English not only detested the Catholic faith of the Irish but they also feared the Irish would support efforts to reimpose Catholicism on England and would assist Catholic nations like France and Spain if they went to war with England. Expelling the Irish and transplanting loyal Protestant farmers from England and Scotland, therefore, promised to boost the English economy

 What lessons did the English learn from their experiences in Ireland?

 and secure control of a potentially troublesome neighboring island. This colonial model developed in parts of Ireland—expulsion and plantation— would shape subsequent English experiments in colonization. Economic pressures eventually impelled England to follow its European rivals and engage in the exploration and colonization of the Atlantic. The profitable wool trade with the continent began to decline in the 1550s, prompting English merchants to seek new commercial opportunities. These merchants founded scores of new companies devoted to overseas trade with Europe, Africa, and the Mediterranean. In 1558 England’s entry into exploration and colonization was also helped when another of Henry VIII’s daughters, Elizabeth I succeeded “Bloody Mary,” as Protestants called her, and quickly established herself as a strong leader determined to project English power overseas. She eagerly pursued an aggressive policy of expansion, challenging Spain’s dominance in the Atlantic. A committed Protestant, Elizabeth viewed Spanish power as a threat to her realm. Her religious convictions and foreign policy objectives eventually brought England into direct conflict with Spain. England’s support for Spain’s enemies on the continent, including the Protestant Dutch, the raids of English pirates, and English antiCatholicism, finally drove King Philip II of Spain to take decisive action. In 1588, Spain launched a mighty Armada, or fleet of warships, to invade England and destroy Europe’s most powerful Protestant monarchy. The Spanish considered their ships invincible, but the Armada was routed by the smaller, faster ships of the English navy. (Weather conditions at sea favored the English and hampered the Spanish fleet.) The defeat of the Armada shifted the balance of power in the Atlantic, as England eventually emerged as the major force in the Atlantic world. To commemorate the stunning victory, Queen Elizabeth commissioned a portrait that symbolized England’s rise to power in the Atlantic world. In the painting Elizabeth’s hand rests prominently on a globe and the crown, a symbol of the monarchy, sits perched above the globe (1.17). In the background the artist includes two scenes depicting the defeat of the Armada, a further reminder of England’s power and naval supremacy. Among the most ardent supporters of expanding England’s role in the Atlantic world were former privateers. These were Englishmen who engaged in

 state-sanctioned piracy in the Atlantic against Spanish treasure fleets returning from South America. A number of them had grown rich and influential from their successes. John Hawkins, for example, earned himself a fortune and a knighthood for his daring seizures of Spanish ships. One of the most dashing of these buccaneers, Sir Walter Raleigh, had participated in the English conquest of Ireland and became a favorite of Queen Elizabeth. Raleigh sought support for a more ambitious plan of colonization in the lands north of Spanish America and south of French Canada. Queen Elizabeth bestowed her blessing on the enterprise, but not money. As a result Raleigh and the colonial ventures that followed had to turn to private capital to finance his plan. In contrast to France and Spain’s state-financed model of exploration and colonization, England adopted a more capitalist model, with private investors forming companies and issuing stock to finance exploration and settlement. Having raised the funds



 to outfit two ships, Raleigh’s expedition arrived in the outer banks regions of what is now North Carolina in July 1585. Naming the new settlement Virginia, in honor of Elizabeth, known widely as the “Virgin Queen” because she never married, England had finally established its first colony in the New World. Unfortunately for Raleigh and the original colonists, the first colony at Roanoke (an Algonquian Indian name for shell money) ended in disaster. To begin with, although the location near the treacherous region of Cape Hatteras protected the settlement from possible Spanish raids, it also deterred passing ships from stopping, which made reprovisioning the colony difficult. Then conflict with local Indians erupted when the colonists accused them of stealing a silver cup. All the while relief for the colonists was delayed by the outbreak of war with Spain. The English required every available ship to repulse the Spanish Armada. When a ship finally arrived three years later, the new settlers found the colony deserted. All

 the residents had disappeared, leaving behind only one clue: the word “CROATOAN” carved into a door-post. The fate of Roanoke remains a mystery, but scholars suspect that the term croatoan was a vague reference to an Indian village some 50 miles south of the settlement that may have been the colonists’ destination before they disappeared. Although the first English attempt to create a fixed settlement was a dismal failure, the information gained by the colonists about the Algonquian tribes who inhabited North Carolina proved invaluable. The governor of the colony, John White, was an accomplished artist who captured scenes from Indian life in vivid paintings (1.18). In his visual representation of the village of Secoton, John White included a scene of Indians engaged in a religious ritual. White includes a brief description in the painting, noting that it was “A Ceremony in their prayers with strange iesturs and songs dansing about post carved on the topps lyke mens faces.” A number of his images were popularized by the Flemish engraver Theodore de Bry, who in some cases made subtle but important alterations to make them more appealing to European tastes. In the case of the village of Secoton, these changes were fairly minor. In other cases, de Bry altered the images in significant ways. Representing America posed a number of challenges for de Bry, for a more detailed discussion of these issues, see Images as History: Marketing the New World: Theodore de Bry’s Engravings of the Americas.

MARKETING THE NEW WORLD: THEODORE DE BRY’S ENGRAVINGS OF THE AMERICAS
Theodore de Bry, an engraver and printer from the city of Antwerp in what is today Belgium, published a multi-volume series, entitled America (1590–1634) that provided many Europeans with their first glimpse of the exotic New World. The first volume of this series was published in English, French, German, and Latin. Subsequent volumes were published only in German and Latin. Although a Calvinist, de Bry cut out material that he believed would offend Catholics to make the Latin edition truly universal and appealing to both Catholics and Protestants. In particular, he eliminated portrayals of Catholic explorers as brutally exploitive of the indigenous populations of the A monstrous pagan sculpture dominates the image, a visible reminder that the inhabitants of the New World were un-Christian savages. 
 Americas. Given the expense of producing copper plate engravings, de Bry concluded it was simply too costly to create separate images for the Latin and German editions of his later volumes in the series. Instead he tried to make the images appealing to Catholics and Protestants by exaggerating the “otherness” of the indigenous populations. The most striking example of this strategy occurred in an engraving in which de Bry conjured up an exotic pagan ritual in which halfnaked Indians parade before a grotesque five-headed, two-tailed deer god, an image that would have struck his audience as the epitome of an unholy and demonic religious practice.

 The natives’ lack of clothing demonstrates that they are primitive peoples, who lack the most basic attributes of a civilized society.

English Colonial Societies, 1590–1710
 Theodore de Bry’s 1619 engraving, The Chickahominy Become “New Englishmen,” from his book America, portrays treaty negotiations between Virginia Indians and the English. Captain Samuel Argall, the Englishman negotiating the treaty, sits on a mat with a tribal elder. Another tribal leader addresses his people, informing them about the terms of the treaty, which was meant to promote trade and peace between the English and the Virginia Indians. As the engraving title, which refers to the Chickahominy as “New Englishmen,” suggests, the English insisted that Indian tribes submit to English rule and accept the English king as their lord. By contrast the Indians believed that negotiating a treaty with the English did not mean that they had given up control of their own political affairs. These differing visions of diplomacy led to conflict between Native Americans and English settlers throughout the seventeenth century. At the dawn of the 1600s, England trailed far behind Spain and France in the race to exploit the wealth of the Americas. By 1700, however, England had become a formidable colonial power in both North America and the Caribbean. In contrast to Spain and France, whose colonization efforts relied on active support from the monarchy and church, England’s first efforts to colonize America relied on joint stock companies, which were privately financed commercial ventures. The two great early English experiments in colonization, in Virginia and New England, faced many challenges in their early years, including how to deal with local Indian populations. The solution for the English was not simply rendering the Indians politically subservient to the king but also segregating themselves from the Indians whenever possible. Relations between settlers and Indians complicated colonial politics for most of the seventeenth century. Bacon’s Rebellion (1676), a popular uprising in Virginia triggered by colonists’ conflict over Indian policy, shook the foundations of the colony. In New England persistent conflict between Indians and settlers exacerbated existing social and economic tensions and contributed to the worst outbreak of witchcraft accusations in colonial America, the Salem witchcraft hysteria (1692). The reassertion of political control by England, whose Glorious Revolution (1688) contributed to the emergence of a new, more stable colonial world, helped facilitate the resolution of the witchcraft crisis. In the years to come, colonists would often invoke the political and constitutional ideas of the Glorious Revolution to defend their liberties.

 “Our first work is expulsion of the savages to gain the free range of the country . . . for it is infinitely better to have no heathen among us, who at best are but thorns in our side, than to be at peace and league with them.” Virginia Governor FRANCIS WYATT, 1623–1624





 CHAPTER 2

MODELS OF SETTLEMENT: ENGLISH COLONIAL SOCIETIES, 1590–1710

The Chesapeake Colonies
 The failure of the Roanoke colony in Virginia (see Chapter 1) between 1585 and 1590 was only a temporary setback for English colonial projects in America. Less than two decades later, a new group of English settlers established a colony, Jamestown, in the Chesapeake Bay area of what is now Virginia. Although the early history of Jamestown was fraught with problems, the colony eventually began to prosper. Tobacco agriculture provided a strong financial incentive to expand into the wider Chesapeake region. By the 1630s, Lord Baltimore had developed an ambitious plan to found another colony in the region, Maryland.

The Founding of Jamestown
 Joint stock companies charted by King James I (r. 1603–1625) funded the English colonial enterprises. Investors bought shares in the company and at the end of a specified period received their investment back plus a percentage of the profits. In April 1606, the king issued a charter to the Virginia Company of London to create a colony in America. In late December 1606, three ships set sail for the Chesapeake, arriving off the coast of Virginia in May 1607. The first settlers were a motley assortment of men; no women traveled on this first voyage. The settlers named the new settlement Jamestown, in honor of King James.

 “Our men were destroyed with cruel diseases, as swellings, Fluxes, Burning fevers and by wars, and some departed suddenly, but for the most part they died of mere famine.” GEORGE PERCY, Colonist, 1607 The colonists scouted a location secure from possible Spanish attack, but still accessible to the sea. They built a fortified palisade to protect them from possible attacks by hostile Indians and Spanish ships. Unfortunately the site they chose turned out to be a public health disaster. On the edge of a swamp, Jamestown was a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes and the pathogens they carried, including malaria. Salt water from the nearby estuary contaminated the wells the colonists dug to supply fresh drinking water. In addition poor drainage meant the

 Why did Jamestown turn out to be such a poor choice for a permanent settlement?

 colonists’ own waste occasionally contaminated the water supply. Many settlers died within a year of disembarking. The Virginia Company’s promotional pamphlets (2.1) deceptively cast Virginia as an “earthly paradise” that would offer opportunities for the settlers to become rich. Almost one-third of the early settlers were gentlemen who were unprepared for the arduous life in Virginia and who viewed manual labor as undignified. Believing that vast troves of mineral wealth existed in the region, settlers wasted time searching for gold and silver instead of planting crops or repairing fortifications. Dissension and a lack of firm political leadership also undermined the colony. Relations between the settlers and the powerful Powhatan Indian confederacy began amicably. Chief Powhatan, the ruler of the confederacy, was eager to trade with the English and acquire manufactured goods, especially firearms and metal tomahawks (a type of hatchet). Powhatan had also hoped to use the English as allies against rival Indian tribes. However once the Indians realized that the English were not temporary visitors merely interested in trade, but were intending to settle permanently in the region, relations between the two peoples deteriorated. In dealing with the Indians, Virginians applied the same principles that the English had developed in the conquest of Ireland: expelling the local population and limiting contact with them as much as possible. The English failed to grasp basic rituals of hospitality and gift giving, essential to establishing cordial relations with Indian peoples. Whereas the French and Spanish encouraged marriage between male settlers and Indian women, the English discouraged such unions. This marriage taboo not only deprived the colony of a means of establishing friendly relations between the two peoples but

THE CHESAPEAKE COLONIES

 also deprived the colonists of cultural go-betweens who could have smoothed out conflicts and misunderstandings. Among the most enduring myths associated with Jamestown and the English settlers’ relations with the Indians is the tale of Pocahontas. Settler-soldier John Smith’s tale of how a beautiful Indian girl saved his life is a foundational myth in American history, one that later writers often cast in romantic terms: an American Romeo-andJuliet story of love at first sight between a beautiful Indian “princess” (a term straight from English aristocratic culture) and a dashing English officer. Smith’s published account of his time in Virginia helped create this mythology. Smith took considerable liberties with the truth, highlighting his role as a romantic hero who saved Jamestown from disaster. The events Smith described in his account almost certainly did not take place as he described them. However, Smith was likely captured and eventually adopted into the tribe, and Pocahontas, then a young girl, may indeed have taken part in the adoption ritual. Among some Eastern Woodland Indian tribes, capture and in some cases ritual torture, followed by adoption into the tribe, was one means of conducting diplomacy. Once adopted into the tribe, prisoners became political intermediaries. Although prone to inflate his achievements, Smith, an experienced soldier who had fought with the French and Dutch against Spain in the 1590s and then against the Muslim Turks in the early 1600s, played a decisive role in helping the colony avert disaster. In 1608, he negotiated an exchange of goods for food with Indians that helped stave off starvation. Smith’s reforms may have staved off immediate catastrophe, but they did not prevent enormous suffering and high mortality during the difficult winter of 1609– 1610, known as the “starving time.” The colonists were so pressed for food that some even resorted to cannibalism to survive the winter. In his history of Virginia, Smith wrote about the “starving time.” Smith reported, with a macabre sense of humor, that one man “did kill his wife, powdered her, and had eaten part of her before it was knowne,” adding “but of such a dish as powdered wife I never heard of.” In 1609, Smith returned to England. After his departure the hostility between the English and the Indians intensified. In 1613, Captain Samuel Argall led a party of Virginians on a mission to capture

Experimenting with various strains of tobacco, Rolfe finally settled on a variety that had been successfully cultivated in the Caribbean. Tobacco was all the rage

Choices and Consequences
THE ORDEAL OF POCAHONTAS
Desperate to force the local Powhatan Indians to negotiate a peace treaty, English settlers embarked on an audacious plan. They abducted a local Powhatan Indian woman they knew as Pocahontas, whose adult Indian name was Matoaka, hoping to force her people to accept a peace treaty. Her kidnappers took her to Henrico, a heavily fortified settlement upriver from Jamestown. The plan was to isolate her from her people. The English placed Matoaka in the household of a minister, who instructed her in the English language and customs and began indoctrinating her in Christianity. At the weekly prayer meetings hosted by the minister, she met John Rolfe, an influential Englishman recently widowed. Within a year of her abduction, Matoaka was baptized a Christian and had adopted a new English name, Rebecca. John Rolfe proposed marriage to the newly Christianized woman. Matoaka now faced three options. 
Choices




 Reject the offer of marriage and remain a captive among the English until her people rescued her or negotiated for her freedom.



 Attempt to escape.



 Marry Rolfe, and through that marriage help her people forge an alliance with the Virginians.

Decision
 Matoaka chose the third option; she married John Rolfe. Two years after their marriage, the couple journeyed to England, where she became something of a celebrity and was even introduced at court.

Consequences
 Marrying Rolfe gained Matoaka (Rebecca) her freedom. In her new role as the wife of a high-status Englishman, she became a mediator between her people and the English. Indeed, had she not become ill and died within a year after arriving in England, she might have been able to expand this important role.

Continuing Controversies
 How do Indian conceptions of gender roles help explain Pocahontas’s decision to marry? Scholars have suggested different explanations for her decision. Some have seen it as an expression of romantic love; others, as sheer expedience. The most recent and perhaps most persuasive explanation of her conversion and marriage to John Rolfe acknowledges the key role of women as cultural intermediaries in Indian

 in Europe, a fact reflected in this humorous painting showing a group of monkeys in a tavern eagerly consuming tobacco (2.2). Playing on the popular notion that monkeys have a great capacity for imitation, the artist ridicules the consumption of tobacco as a bad habit all too easily emulated. Smoking tobacco for pleasure became popular among all classes in European society. Tobacco was also believed to have many medicinal uses; it was recommended as a cure for colds and an aid to digestion. Rolfe sent his first consignment of tobacco to England in 1613. Tobacco proved to be the colony’s economic salvation: Profits from its sale created a boom in the colony, which then led its inhabitants to devote nearly every acre of land to the “sot weed.” Exports increased dramatically in the decades following the introduction of the crop. Although tobacco agriculture made some Virginians wealthy, the pursuit of profits diverted time and other resources from basic tasks, such as planting food crops and



 repairing buildings. As a result of this neglect, settlers in boom-time Virginia continued to die at an alarming rate. Establishing political order in Virginia proved far more difficult than the founders of the colony had expected. In 1618, Sir Edwin Sandys became the Virginia Company of London’s treasurer and instituted reforms to make the government of the colony more effective. A key reform was the creation of a representative body to make laws. The privilege of voting for representatives was extended to free men of property, who were to elect representatives who would then enact laws for the colony. Virginia’s new legislative body, the House of Burgesses (representatives), first convened in July 1619. Rather than take orders from company officials, the colonists gained some control over their own political affairs, a milestone in the evolution of representative government in America. Because laborers continued to be scarce in Virginia, Sandys also introduced a new system to

 provide incentives to attract settlers. The headright system encouraged additional immigrants by giving 50 acres to anyone who would pay his own fare to Virginia and 50 additional acres for each person he brought with him. The year 1619 also marked the arrival of the first Africans in Virginia. An English pirate vessel flying under a Dutch flag sold the Africans, captured from a Portuguese slaving ship in the Caribbean, to the Virginia colonists. Immigrants continued to arrive in Virginia despite the high mortality rates. Approximately two-thirds of the settlers died in the next three years. Deteriorating relations with local Indian communities reached a crisis point in 1622, when Powhatan’s successor launched an assault on the colony that killed 347 colonists. The sensational attack inspired this engraving (2.3), which appeared in England six years later. To contrast the imagined civility of the colonists and the alleged barbarism of the Indians, the engraver included inaccurate details, including tablecloths and a European-style walled city in the distance.

 What was a proprietor?

 Two years after the attack, King James revoked the colony’s charter. Now the king, not the Virginia Company of London, would appoint the governor. Eventually the king recognized the House of Burgesses, giving his royal sanction to the colonists’ efforts at self-rule. Virginia had become England’s first royal colony.

 Lord Baltimore’s Refuge: Maryland James I died in 1625, and his son, Charles I (r. 1625–1649), came to the throne. Having married the French Catholic princess Henrietta Maria, Charles I resolved to make good on his marriage promise to ease the plight of England’s Catholics. Most of England’s aristocracy was Protestant, but a few had remained Catholic. One Catholic nobleman, George Calvert, Lord Baltimore, realized that he might be able to help his fellow Catholics and increase his own wealth by obtaining a royal charter for land in Virginia, making it a haven for English Catholics. After Calvert’s death in 1632, his son Cecil, the second Lord Baltimore, obtained a charter for a colony from King Charles. Maryland began as a proprietary colony under the legal authority of Lord Baltimore. The legal title of proprietor gave its possessor almost king-like authority over his domains. This early map of Maryland (2.4), not only contains the family’s coat of arms in the top corner, but the text underneath proclaims Lord Baltimore “Absolute Lord and Proprietor.” Calvert learned an important lesson from Jamestown: The lure of profits from tobacco agriculture could drive colonists to starve themselves to death to get rich quickly. To avoid this danger, he ordered that settlers first obtain a “sufficient quantity of corn and other provisions of victual” before producing tobacco or other commodities for export. Although he envisioned his colony as a haven for Catholics, Calvert knew that its

 economic success depended on attracting laborers, so the colony would need to be equally hospitable to Protestants. Maryland therefore afforded religious freedom to all Christians. From the start the proprietors and the freemen battled over control of the colony. Colonists challenged Lord Baltimore. The Maryland assembly routinely voted down bills he introduced; Baltimore responded by blocking acts passed by the assembly. Exacerbating the discord was the continuing religious tension between the Catholic proprietor and the overwhelmingly Protestant assembly. Eventually the two sides accommodated each other, and by the 1640s, Maryland had a functional legislature.

Life in the Chesapeake:
Tobacco and Society
 The demands of an expanding tobacco economy in the Chesapeake, an area that included parts of Virginia and Maryland bordering Chesapeake Bay, produced a society that was driven by the profit motive. Tobacco production rose dramatically in the mid-seventeenth century, with exports from Virginia to England growing from over 10,000 pounds in the first years of production and export to well over a million pounds by the end of the 1630s. Attracting laborers to work in the tobacco fields proved difficult. Indentured servants, individuals who contracted to be servants for a specified number of years, usually four to seven years, provided an important source of labor. Employers paid for the voyage of their indentured servants to the colonies and clothed and fed them while they remained bound to their employer. At the end of the term of service, employers usually gave their indentured servants clothes and tools and allowed them to set out on their own. African slaves provided another source of labor, but slavery was not yet the dominant labor system in the region, and slavery had not yet hardened into a fixed status. A few slaves did eventually obtain their freedom. Most planters preferred men for the arduous work of growing tobacco, so immigrants to the Chesapeake society were overwhelmingly male. Scholars estimate that before 1640, men

 out-numbered women by as much as six to one. The lopsided sex ratio meant that the few women who migrated to the region and managed to survive the high mortality rates enjoyed considerable control over their decision to marry. Since women often outlived their husbands, a fortunate woman could make several favorable matches during her life and create a sizeable estate. By 1700, as food supplies, sanitation, and shelter all improved, more children were born in the region, more women migrated there, and sex ratios became less lopsided. Tobacco agriculture shaped the distinctive pattern of settlement in the Chesapeake. Rather than organize themselves into towns, colonists spread out in search of arable land to plant. They prized locations close to navigable rivers that fed into one of the major waterways in the area because that made shipping tobacco easier and cheaper. A few wealthy planters monopolized these choice locations. The demands of tobacco agriculture led to an almost insatiable need for additional land, which exacerbated the tensions with local Indians determined to prevent further encroachments on their territories.

 How did the unbalanced sex ratio of the Chesapeake affect gender roles in this colonial region?

New England
 The same year that the Virginia Company of London obtained a charter to settle what is now Virginia, another group of investors organized a rival company, the Virginia Company of Plymouth, intending to settle north of Virginia. Their charter included lands as far north as modern Bangor, Maine. In 1607, the company established a small plantation at the Sagadahoc River (known now as the Kennebec). The fierce Maine winter, however, proved too much for the colonists, who abandoned the settlement and returned to England. Although the region’s severe winters seemed to have doomed the prospects of settling this region, a group of Protestant religious dissenters known as Puritans expressed interest in migrating to New England. The ascension of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603), who had embraced the Protestant faith and supported the ideals of the Reformation, helped further the progress of the English Reformation. The queen’s support for Protestantism “The name Puritan is very aptly stopped well short of what the most zealous reformers had sought. Elizabeth given to these men . . . because opted to chart a middle path between they think themselves . . . more traditional Catholicism and the pure than others . . . and separate most radical wing of the Protestant Reformation. Those who urged further themselves from all other reform earned themselves the name churches and congregations Puritans because of their desire to purify as spotted and defiled.” the Church of England of all vestiges of JOHN WHITGIFT, Catholic belief and practice. Elizabeth never married and produced Elizabethan clergyman, 1573 no heir, so the royal line passed to her cousin King James VI of Scotland who became James I of England when Elizabeth died in 1603. Although eager to assert his power, James was not particularly interested in pursuing the ideals of the Protestant Reformation. When his son Charles I ascended the throne in 1625 and took a French Catholic woman for his wife, proponents of reform feared the worst—a revival of Catholicism. In response to religious developments in England, two factions emerged within the reformation movement. Puritans continued to believe that reform was possible within the Church of England. Separatists, bent on further reformation, argued for complete separation from the established church.

Plymouth Plantation
 In 1608, a large group of Separatists fled to Holland, renowned for its religious toleration and a haven for Protestant dissenters, including other Calvinists from France and England. Life there proved difficult for the English Separatists. The problem was not persecution, but rather the corrupting influences of the affluent urban culture of the Dutch Republic.

 CHAPTER 2

MODELS OF SETTLEMENT: ENGLISH COLONIAL SOCIETIES, 1590–1710

 English Separatists living in Leiden decided that life in tolerant, worldly Holland posed too many temptations. A group of the Leiden Separatists, resolving to leave sinful Holland, returned to England briefly before setting out for what they believed to be the unspoiled New World. Later called Pilgrims, a term traditionally used to describe Christians on a spiritual quest for salvation, they set sail for Virginia. After a harrowing two-month journey aboard their ship the Mayflower, the Pilgrims found themselves not off Virginia, but rather off the coast of Cape Cod, in what is now Massachusetts, in late fall 1620. William Bradford, their leader, described the experience of arriving safely in America in emotional terms. “Being thus arrived at safe harbor, and brought safe to land,” the Pilgrims then “fell upon their knees and blessed the God of Heaven who had brought them over the vast and furious ocean.” Realizing that their company charter was not legally binding on a settlement outside Virginia, they drew up a new political document, the Mayflower Compact (1620), that stated the principles that would govern their community. The document asserted that its signers did “solemnly and mutually, in the Presence of God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politick, for our better Ordering and Preservation, and Furtherance of the Ends aforesaid.” The agreement also bound those non-Pilgrims traveling to America, including many servants, who promised to abide by the decisions of the community. The Pilgrims named their colony Plymouth after the English port they departed from. Their goal was not religious tolera-

 “For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world.” JOHN WINTHROP, Puritan leader, 1630

 tion, but rather Protestant purity. The Pilgrims fled England to create a community purged of all taints of unreformed Catholic practice. Tolerance for what they considered religious error was inconsistent with the goal of creating a pure form of Christian worship. The world the Pilgrims encountered in Massachusetts had been inhabited by Indians for millennia, but European contact had already irrevocably altered this world. The Indian population of the area had been largely wiped out by the end of the sixteenth century. Contact with European traders and fishing fleets had exposed the Indians of this region to smallpox and other devastating pathogens. Life in America was hard for the Pilgrims. Half of their complement of just over one hundred men and women died within the first year. The Pilgrims would have all perished had not Squanto, a local Indian from the Patuxet, a tribe decimated by European diseases, befriended them. English traders had kidnapped Squanto years before and taken him to England, where he lived as a slave. Through harrowing events involving two further kidnappings, Squanto eventually returned to New England. His skills as an interpreter and knowledge of Indian agricultural practices proved to be indispensible to the Pilgrims.

A
Godly Commonwealth  In 1629, Charles I dissolved Parliament and continued his plans to restore elements of Catholic ritual to the English church, a move that alarmed the Puritans. His disregard of Parliament, which included many Puritan leaders, and his elevation of anti-Puritan bishops in the Church of England struck many reformers as ominous. The same year that Charles I dismissed Parliament, John Winthrop, a member of the Puritan gentry, wrote to his wife that “I am verily persuaded God will bring some heavy affliction upon this land.” A year later Winthrop led a group of Puritans to New England where they hoped to create a church and community freed from the corruption Winthrop saw everywhere in England. By the early 1630s, another twenty thousand Puritans would leave England for America. By 1650, the settlers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony had spread out into the Connecticut Valley.

NEW ENGLAND

 John Winthrop, who became the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, captured the Puritan vision of the world when he reminded immigrants to America that they must become “a city upon a hill,” an example of true reformation that would guide others toward this holy ideal. Winthrop contrasted the holy purpose of New England’s Puritans with earlier colonial efforts in Virginia, which had been driven more by a lust for gold than by love of God. The hardships and failures of Virginia were, according to Winthrop, a direct result of their goals, which were “Carnal and not Religious.” Choosing the right type of colonists was also important. Rather than transport “a multitude of rude and misgoverned persons,” the Puritans in New England would ensure their success by selecting godly persons and establishing “a right form of government” that would promote their religious mission. The settlement of Puritan New England differed significantly from that of the Chesapeake. For one, in contrast to the settlers of Virginia, many immigrants to Puritan New England were married. For another, unlike many first Virginians, who were gentlemen, the Puritans came largely from the middling ranks of society, including farmers. In some cases whole Puritan congregations followed their ministers to America during the Great Migration (1630–1642). When these settlers arrived, they did not scatter in search of better lands or access to navigable waters, as did the colonists in the Chesapeake, but remained clustered in towns. Putting a premium on building stable communities, Puritans settled in towns and villages so that communities would remain cohesive. Typically a Puritan village included a central meetinghouse and a town green. The geographical distribution of population explored in Envisioning Evidence: Patterns of Settlement in New England and the Chesapeake Compared shows the difference between Puritan patterns of settlement and those of the Chesapeake. In New England homes clustered close to the center of town, and fields were arranged at the outskirts of these town centers. The meetinghouse, literally the nucleus of the community, served both a religious and a civic function. A 1635 law required that new houses be built within half a mile of the meetinghouse. Rather than expand the size of towns and allow settlers to spread out and weaken the bond of community, Puritans created new towns and villages. New England’s town structure served two

 critical functions: It enhanced the colonists’ ability to defend themselves against Indian attack, and it facilitated the enforcement of communal norms and beliefs. Deviance and misbehavior were easier to control in the small tight-knit towns of New England than in the Chesapeake. In 1630, New England boasted 11 towns. By 1647, the number had tripled to 33 and would rise to more than 100 by 1700. The family was another building block of Puritan society. Puritans migrated to New England as families, and their conception of the family was designed to further their religious ideals. John Winthrop expressed this view when he noted that “A family is a little common wealth, and a common wealth is a greate family.” The foundation for this set of beliefs was the Fifth Commandment, which enjoined believers to honor their father and mother. Puritans saw this commandment extending well beyond the requirement of honoring parents. Minister John Cotton reminded his parishioners that the Fifth Commandment applied to “all our Superiors, whether in Family, School, Church, and Commonwealth.” In Cotton’s view honor meant more than reverence; it also mandated obedience. Taking these words to heart, in 1648 the Massachusetts colonists made disobedience to parents a crime punishable by death. Although this penalty was never applied, it signaled the seriousness with which the Puritans took the idea of patriarchal authority. The government of the Massachusetts colony evolved out of the joint-stock company used to raise money to fund the Puritans’ voyage to the New World. The charter for the company did not require the governing body to remain in England, so Puritan leaders simply set up their own governing body in America. In contrast to England, where property determined the right to vote, Massachusetts allowed all male church members this privilege. Since many of the first generation of settlers were church members, the franchise in Massachusetts was much more inclusive than that in England. Historians estimate that 40 percent of men may have qualified to vote in the 1630s. Puritan law encouraged sobriety and a strong work ethic and discouraged frivolity. Folk customs that had been traditional parts of religious observances were banned from New England worship. Christmas too was purged of all non-religious

Envisioning Evidence
PATTERNS OF SETTLEMENT IN NEW ENGLAND AND THE CHESAPEAKE COMPARED
Puritan towns were clustered around a meeting house. These buildings served as places of worship and as the political center of the community. The strong pull inward toward a town center with the meeting house at the core is illustrated in the diagram of a typical New England town and the map of Sudbury, Massachusetts (below left). Town ordinances actually forbade settlers from establishing homesteads too far from the meeting house. Settlement in towns helped Puritans preserve their religious mission by enhancing the ability of neighbors to watch one another and report anti-social or religiously disruptive behavior to legal or church authorities. Settlement in the Chesapeake followed a different model. Here the profit motive and the desire to find the most fertile lands and access to navigable rivers pulled settlers outward. The diagram of settlement in the Chesapeake and the map of St. Mary’s County in Maryland shows how settlers in the Chesapeake scattered across the area in search of good land and access to waterways they could use to export their cash crops. The pursuit of wealth pushed Chesapeake settlers outward in search of fertile lands and access to navigable waterways which made it easier to get tobacco to market.

Challenges to
Puritan Orthodoxy
 Massachusetts sought to enforce orthodoxy through its laws, the layout of its towns, and the messages preached by its clergy. Yet, despite these efforts to enforce conformity the Reformation vision that animated Puritanism contained radical ideas that threatened the survival of the city upon a hill. The first great challenge to orthodoxy in Massachusetts came in 1635 from the devout Separatist minister Roger Williams. He attacked



 the government of Massachusetts Bay for using the power of the state to enforce religious orthodoxy. For Williams the goal of creating a purified church led to the conclusion that government ought not to meddle in religious affairs. Williams advocated the complete separation of church and state. Whereas many modern supporters of the separation of church and state seek to prevent government from being influenced by religion, Williams sought the opposite—to protect religion from possible corruption by government. (For additional discussion, see Competing Visions: Antinomianism or Toleration: The Puritan Dilemma.) Williams also attacked the colonists for unjustly seizing Indian lands, a position that proved almost as unpopular as his novel religious views. Although Governor John Winthrop of Massachusetts greatly respected Williams for his intellect and piety, Massachusetts Bay could not tolerate his direct challenge to the state’s authority to enforce religious orthodoxy. Before he could be arrested, Williams fled the colony and headed south. He purchased land from the Narragansett Indians and settled in what is now Rhode Island. Thankful that God had rescued him from his enemies, Williams named his new settlement “Providence.” Eventually he returned to England and in 1644 obtained a parliamentary charter for a new colony, Rhode Island. While the Massachusetts Bay Colony was still reeling from the Williams controversy, a new challenge to orthodoxy emerged. In 1634, Anne Hutchinson, the wife of a prominent merchant, began holding religious meetings in her home. A dynamic speaker and forceful personality, Hutchinson was also a gifted thinker who did not accept the inferior status that Puritan theology accorded women. Although she did not directly question the role prescribed for women, her actions implicitly challenged accepted ideas about gender roles in Puritan society. Hutchinson also openly questioned the theological purity of the colony’s leading ministers. In her view, only one minister, John Cotton, was preaching the true Calvinist idea that only God’s grace alone could bring about salvation. Hutchinson charged the other ministers with sliding backward toward the notion that good works could contribute to salvation. Attacking the religious views of the ministry was bad enough, but for a woman to do so, especially one who attracted a following among both sexes, was too much. The colony’s leaders feared that Hutchinson and her followers had succumbed to the Antinomian

 What do New England’s laws reveal about its culture?



 CHAPTER 2

MODELS OF SETTLEMENT: ENGLISH COLONIAL SOCIETIES, 1590–1710

 heresy. Antinomians took the logic of Calvinism to its extreme: The elect, if possessed of true saving grace, need not follow earthly laws. If good works really had no connection to salvation then why follow earthly laws? Most Puritans feared that the Antinomian heresy would lead to moral anarchy. (For additional discussion, see Competing Visions: Antinomianism or Tolerance: The Puritan Dilemma.) The Puritans also charged Hutchinson with violating the Fifth Commandment by refusing to honor and obey the ministers who were the colony’s patriarchs. In 1637 Hutchinson was hauled before a special court and subjected to a grueling examination. During this ordeal she brilliantly parried virtually all of the questions posed. At the end of her examination, however, she made a serious mistake. When asked how she could be so sure of her actions, she claimed that God spoke directly to her by an immediate revelation. Puritans believed that God spoke to his chosen people only by his revealed word—the Bible—not by direct revelations. For Winthrop and others the claim that God spoke directly to Hutchinson exposed the dangerous Antinomian strain in her thinking. If this was true, anyone, including those who acted immorally, could simply claim to be acting according to a prophetic voice from God. Hutchinson was convicted and banished from Massachusetts Bay Colony. She headed south to Rhode Island, where she and several of her followers sought refuge before eventually settling on what is now Long Island, near the Dutch town of New Amsterdam in the colony of New Netherlands. While Puritans in New England continued striving to build their city upon a hill and protect it from heresy, Puritans on the other side of the Atlantic had been locked in a protracted political struggle with King Charles I. This led to civil war in 1642. Emerging victorious, Parliament tried the king for crimes against his people and executed him in 1649. The commander of parliamentary forces, Oliver Cromwell, assumed the title of Lord Protector of England with nearly monarchical powers. While raising an army against the king, Parliament had decided to lift censorship and allow freedom of the press for the first time in English history. To gain popular support and recruit soldiers for their army, Parliament also inaugurated a new policy of religious toleration for all Protestants. With censorship lifted a host of sectarian religious groups emerged during the Civil War. One of these sects, the Society of Friends, or Quakers, believed each individual possessed a divine spark

 of grace, an inner light that could lead him or her to salvation. The origin of the word Quaker is complex. The leader of the Quakers, George Fox, had earned this name when he reminded a magistrate that the righteous ought to “tremble at the word of the Lord.” The name stuck because of the nature of Quaker worship. As one contemporary noted, men, women, and children would “fall into quaking fits” in response to the workings of grace within themselves. Quakers rejected the need for any ministry at all. At their meetings anyone who felt the spirit move within them was entitled to preach.

Expansion and Conflict
 In contrast to the disease-ridden Chesapeake, New England’s environment was reasonably healthy, and the population expanded owing to natural increase. Infant mortality in New England was lower than in England. Although exact figures are difficult to obtain, historians estimate that just over 10 percent of the children born in colonial New England died before their first birthday. The comparable figure in England was about 15 percent. While few people in England lived past middle age, about 50 percent of New Englanders who survived to age 20 would have lived until their late 60s. New England’s growing population combined with the relative longevity of its inhabitants created enormous pressure to acquire additional land so that children could start their own families. Religious leaders played a prominent role in New England’s early expansion. The Puritan minister Thomas Hooker led a group of Massachusetts settlers in 1636 and founded the town of Hartford, Connecticut; the Reverend John Davenport left Massachusetts and established the town of New Haven, Connecticut, a year later. In 1638, representatives from Connecticut towns drafted a frame of government, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. Expansion into the Connecticut Valley brought New Englanders into direct conflict with the local Pequot Indians, who refused to submit to English authority. In the resulting fierce war against the Pequots, New Englanders exploited intertribal rivalries to gain an advantage over the Pequots. New Englanders aligned with tribes that sought to take advantage of the colonists’ firearms to destroy a rival tribe. The ferocity of English warfare horrified the Narragansett and Mohegan Indians, traditional enemies of the Pequots, who joined forces with the English in the war against the Pequots.

Competing Visions
ANTINOMIANISM OR TOLERATION: THE PURITAN DILEMMA
During the English Civil War, English Puritans embraced the idea of religious toleration for all Protestants. New Englanders who continued to oppose such policies gained a reputation for intolerance. Nathaniel Ward, a Massachusetts Puritan, defended New England’s polices against English criticism. In New England, Roger Williams, championed the new idea of toleration. For Williams, the religious and secular spheres were entirely separate. Freedom in one sphere had no necessary implications for actions in the other sphere. In his pamphlet, The Simple Cobbler of Aggwam, Nathaniel Ward captured the views of Puritan New Englanders who opposed religious toleration. According to Ward, religious toleration invariably led to ethical relativism and moral anarchy. Without religion to guide behaviour, how could one avoid the temptation to indulge the basest passions? Wee have beene reputed . . . wild Opinionists, swarmed into a remote wildernes to find elbow-roome for our phanatick Doctrines and practises: I trust our diligence past, and constant sedulity against such persons and courses, will plead better things for us. I dare take upon me, to bee the Herald of New-EngIand so farre, as to proclaime to the world, in the name of our Colony, that all . . . Antinomians, Anabaptists, and other Enthusiasts shall have free Liberty to keepe away from us, and such as will come to be gone as fast as they can, the sooner the better. That State that will give Liberty of Conscience in matters of Religion, must give Liberty of Conscience and Conversation in their Morall Laws, or else the Fiddle will be out of tune, and some of the strings crack. Experience will teach Churches and Christians, that it is farre better to live in a State united, though a little Corrupt, then in a State, whereof some Part is incorrupt, and all the rest divided. 
 The Ranters, a true Antinomian sect that emerged in the chaos of the English Civil War, believed that salvation exempted one from all earthly law, including laws prohibiting sexual misconduct.

Read the Document “John Calvin: On Predestination”


 Roger Williams followed the logic of Puritanism in a different direction. In his zeal to purify the church, Williams came to believe it was impossible for any earthly power to rid itself of corruption and false piety. To avoid contaminating the purity of religion, he proposed separating church and state. Williams developed the metaphor of the state as a ship. Although passengers were free to worship as they saw fit, this did not exempt them from following the orders of the Captain. Is the metaphor of the ship of state an effective rebuttal to those who feared that liberty would become anarchy? That ever I should speak or write a title, that tends to such an infinite liberty of conscience, is a mistake, and which I have ever disclaimed and abhorred. To prevent such mistakes, I shall at present only propose this case: There goes many a ship to sea, with many hundred souls in one ship, whose weal and woe is common, and is a true picture of a commonwealth, or a human combination or society. It hath fallen out sometimes, that both papists and protestants, Jews and Turks, may be embarked in one ship; upon which supposal I affirm, that all the liberty of conscience, that ever I pleaded for, turns upon these two hinges—that none of the papists, protestants, Jews, or Turks, be forced to come to the ship’s prayers of worship, nor compelled from their own particular prayers or worship, if they practice any. I further add, that I never denied, that notwithstanding this liberty, the commander of this ship ought to command the ship’s course, yea, and also command that justice, peace and sobriety, be kept and practiced, both among the seamen and all the passengers.

 From England’s point of view, the economic jewel in the Atlantic world was not the American mainland, but the Caribbean “sugar islands.” Not long after Columbus landed in the Bahamas in 1492, the Spanish established a firm colonial presence in the Caribbean. By the early 1600s, Spain, France, England, and Holland had colonies in the area. The enormous wealth of the “sugar islands” encouraged warfare among these rival colonial powers that resulted in a continuous redrawing of the map, as islands traded hands between different colonial powers (2.6). During Cromwell’s rule Admiral Sir William Penn seized Jamaica from Spain in 1655, and France took part of Hispaniola (Haiti) in 1664. France and England traded islands such as St. Kitts back and forth for much of the century. Spain conquered the English colony of BAHAMA ATLANTIC OCEAN ISLANDS Providence Island in 1641.

Power Is Sweet
 Although the amount of land that the English cultivated in the Caribbean was small, the region became the richest in the English Atlantic empire. Sugar generated enormous profits for Caribbean planters, exceeding the value of all exports from the mainland colonies. Because of the enormous wealth of the West Indies, roughly two-thirds of all English migrants headed for the Caribbean. By the mid-seventeenth century, the population of this region had reached approximately 44,000, while the population of the Chesapeake was about 12,000 and New England around 23,000. The wealth produced by sugar could be substantial. Seventeenth-century Europe developed an appetite for sugar that seemed limitless. Besides its use in desserts, sugar was sprinkled on cooked food as a condiment, used to preserve food, and used as medicine to treat afflictions. The use of sugar

 could also broadcast wealth, social status, or power. Wealthy Europeans displayed lavish sugar sculptures with intricately carved figurines and scenes on banquet tables for guests to admire. Producing sugar and preparing it for export required a labor force capable of surviving the brutal heat of the Caribbean. Sugar production also entailed backbreaking and dangerous agricultural labor. The multistage process that followed the cutting of the cane required additional labor at every phase.

Visitors to the island often found it “more healthful than any of her neighbors.” By 1660, 26,000 English immigrants had settled there, drawn by the promise of wealth through the sugar trade. Because of the harsh conditions for laborers on Barbados and the high mortality of workers in the sugar fields, maintaining an adequate labor force was a serious problem. During the first decade of colonization, planters in Barbados emulated their countrymen in Virginia, relying heavily on indentured servants as a labor source. Some unfortunate individuals were actually “barbadosed,” to use the seventeenth-century phrase that became a synonym for “kidnapped” but originally meant being abducted and transported to the Caribbean to work in the sugar fields. Desperate for workers, planters even tried convict labor. The need for agricultural labor eventually led English planters to emulate the Portuguese and Spanish and turn to slave labor. Within the first decade of turning to sugar production, Barbadian planters bought 20,000 African slaves. Within the colonies of the English Atlantic world,

 Barbados became the primary destination for African slaves, who outnumbered whites there by 1660. Spanish and Portuguese law had easily accommodated the institution of slavery. But English law had no precedent upon which to draw in framing a law for slavery. The first efforts to deal with slavery occurred in a piecemeal fashion. Early laws dealt with slave theft and other practical problems, such as slaves wandering off their plantations. By 1661, Barbados had enacted a comprehensive set of laws to govern relations between masters and slaves. The Barbadian slave code created a system of legalized segregation in which race defined servitude. Harsh penalties prevented slaves from challenging the authority of their masters. The legal code also minimized penalties for masters’ mistreatment of slaves. Murdering a slave incurred a modest fine, while accidentally killing a slave during punishment carried no legal penalty at all. The Barbadian slave code would provide a model for other areas of the English Atlantic where slavery took hold, including Virginia.

MODELS OF SETTLEMENT: ENGLISH COLONIAL SOCIETIES, 1590–1710

The Restoration Era and the
Proprietary Colonies
 In 1660, Charles II (r. 1660–1685) reestablished the English monarchy. The Restoration, as this period was known, inaugurated a new phase in the evolution of English colonial America. The driving force behind colonization now came from a small group of courtiers, aristocrats close to the king who used their influence to secure colonial charters. In America, building on the model pioneered by Lord Baltimore, these new Restorationera proprietors sought to increase their wealth while advancing their own particular political and religious ideals. The new colonies also experienced the same type of conflicts that had plagued Maryland. Proprietors struggled to impose their vision of government on settlers who demanded representation. Nevertheless, by 1700, England had cemented its control of the eastern seaboard of America from the Carolinas to northern New England (2.8).

What was the Restoration?


 Along with England the other great Protestant nation in Europe was Holland (the Netherlands), which also engaged in trans-Atlantic trade, including sugar and slaves. Although Dutch merchants traveled the entire Atlantic world, the Dutch had established only a modest presence in North America. The Dutch exploration of the Hudson River (1609) laid the foundation for the colony of New Netherland. The Dutch East India Company established fur-trading outposts in present-day Albany (New York) in 1614. About a decade later the Dutch established a settlement at the tip of Manhattan Island that they called New Amsterdam in honor of Holland’s most important city. The Dutch welcomed traders from across Europe and embraced religious toleration. The small but thriving city of New Amsterdam included Dutch, English, Scandinavians, Germans, and Portuguese. By the mid-century, a few Sephardic Jews (Portuguese and Spanish Jews), who had fled persecution in Portuguese Brazil, had also joined the community. The centrality of the fur trade to the economy of New Amsterdam emerges in this early image of

 the city. Although the image (2.9) does not accurately depict the two Indians, it shows that the wealth of the city depended on the cooperation of Indian trappers. The Hudson River made it easy to ship beaver pelts downriver to New Amsterdam from the area around Albany. Merchants shipped these pelts to Europe, where their fur was prized for hats. This image also features the city’s port, a key to its economic vitality. Unhappy that Dutch merchants in New Netherland were getting rich in the fur trade, English merchants urged the crown to seize the Dutch stronghold. The thriving, longlived communities of New England had faced the prospect of running out of land, and splinter communities had sprung up in Connecticut and as far south as Long Island, just southeast of New Amsterdam. The expansion of English settlers into the region claimed by the Dutch increased friction between England and Holland. The prospect of eliminating the Dutch corridor between English settlements in the Chesapeake and New England also appealed to Charles II, and particularly to his brother, James, Duke of York. Charles II gave his brother a charter for the area and dispatched a fleet to seize New Netherland in 1664. Although Peter Stuyvesant, the Dutch governor, tried to rally opposition to the English invasion, Dutch merchants in the city decided that it was better to secure favorable terms from the superior English forces than fight. After their conquest of the Dutch, the English divided the region into two new colonies, New York and New Jersey. James intended to take firm control of New York. He believed that his role as proprietor gave him almost absolute power over his dominions. Protesting their lack of adequate representation, New Yorkers refused to pay taxes. Eventually James relented, and the first New York assembly convened in 1683.

A
Peaceable Kingdom: Quakers in Pennsylvania
 After the capture of New Netherland, James granted land that would become New Jersey to courtiers who attracted settlers by promising representation and religious toleration for all Protestants. One of these men, the Quaker William Penn, saw an unprecedented opportunity for creating a religious refuge for members of his faith and others persecuted for their religious

 beliefs. Penn’s father, Admiral Sir William Penn, had helped wrest Jamaica from the Spanish. The king also owed him a large debt. The king paid this debt with a grant for a large tract of land near New Jersey that became known as Pennsylvania (Penn’s woods). As a result of this enormous gift of land, Penn’s ambitious plans for Pennsylvania, a colony inspired by his Quaker vision of religious toleration, soon overshadowed his involvement in New Jersey. One of the few radical sects to survive the English Civil War, Quakers had been persecuted for their beliefs in the Restoration era. Quakers believed individual congregations could conduct their own worship without priests. The group also refused to abide by social customs that demanded individuals show deference to those who stood above them in society. Thus Quakers refused to doff their hats and refrained from using any form of honorific address, such as sir, lord, or lady. Quakers simply addressed each other as thee and thou, terms that sound odd to the modern ear but that signified their belief that everyone was equal before God. Penn intended Pennsylvania to be a “holy experiment” in which Quakers would live in harmony with those of other faiths. Penn’s “peaceable kingdom” also embraced Indians. True to his Quaker principles, Penn resolved to negotiate for Indian lands and submit disputes to arbitration by a committee composed of Indians and Quakers.

 CHAPTER 2

MODELS OF SETTLEMENT: ENGLISH COLONIAL SOCIETIES, 1590–1710

 “Our worthy Proprietor treated the Indians with extraordinary humanity; they became very civil and loving to us, and brought in an abundance of venison.” RICHARD TOWNSEND, Quaker, 1682

 Penn desired to live beside the Indians as “Neighbors and Friends.” Penn praised the local Leni-Lenape people for their eloquence and honor and tried to learn their language and customs. During the first generation of settlement, when land was plentiful and the immigrant population small, Pennsylvania upheld Penn’s promise to treat the Indians with respect. In formulating a government for his colony, Penn drew on a number of new ideas in English politics, including the writings of the English political philosopher James Harrington, who believed that a stable society depended on a relatively broad distribution of property. In Harrington’s view owning property gave individuals a permanent stake in society and also allowed men to be independent, voting for representatives without being manipulated or intimidated.

The Carolinas
 Influential English courtiers, the Lords Proprietors, founded Carolina as a joint effort, hoping to make money and create a buffer between Spanish Florida and other English settlements on the eastern seaboard. Although the Lords Proprietors sought to shape their dominion according to their own vision, the settlers who migrated there had other ideas. From the outset Carolina’s fortunes were closely tied to those of the West Indies, Barbados in particular. Many of the colony’s first settlers emigrated from the West Indies. Rather than produce goods for export to England, Carolina began as a colony of a colony, providing naval stores such as pine tar resins to waterproof ships and food such as cattle for the West Indian islands.

 How did the Restoration-era colonies differ from earlier colonies on the issue of religious toleration?

 The Lords Proprietors had studied New England and Virginia and had concluded that New England-style towns were superior to the “inconvenience and Barbarisme of scattered Dwellings” that characterized settlement in the Chesapeake. The visions of Lords Proprietors and the interests and aspirations of the colonists clashed. Rather than settle in the New England-style nucleated villages (villages with a town center) as the proprietors had hoped, settlers followed the Chesapeake model, scattering to find the most productive land and, when available, access to navigable waterways. In 1712, the proprietors divided their holdings into two colonies, North Carolina and South Carolina. The crown took over South Carolina in 1719 and North Carolina a decade later. The close economic ties between Carolina and Barbados meant that its early settlers were well acquainted with slavery. But the settlers who tried to impose the West Indies’ slave system on the frontier environment of Carolina discovered problems they had not anticipated. The rude conditions of early Carolina history, its small population and simple economy, made it harder to maintain social distance between slaves and their masters. The Carolinas were at the edge of English America. Their proximity to Spanish-controlled Florida and hostile Indian tribes meant that slaves and masters had to work closely together, including defending settlements against attack. The location of the Carolinas also encouraged a less exploitive form of slavery, as slaves in the Carolinas had more opportunities to run away and might find refuge with Indian tribes. By contrast apart from a few mountainous regions on islands such as Jamaica, the West Indies afforded few sanctuaries for runaway slaves. Relations with local Indian tribes were complex. Conflicts among Indian tribes provided early Carolina colonists with an unexpected economic boon: The sale of Indian slaves became a lucrative enterprise. Indians sold prisoners they had taken during intertribal warfare to the English, who then exported them to other British colonies. Carolinians also traded with Indian tribes for deer hides, which were exported to England. At the start of the eighteenth century these exports were surpassed by a new crop, rice, which was developed with help from agricultural knowledge brought to America by African slaves. Carolina began as a colony of a colony but soon became an integral part of the Atlantic economy, exporting slaves, deer hides, and eventually rice.

THE CRISES OF THE LATE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY



The Crises of the Late
Seventeenth Century
 The last quarter of the seventeenth century was a period of unrest in colonial North America. Religious and ethnic tensions sometimes produced political volatility. In Spanish New Mexico, and in English New England and Virginia, Europeans were pitted against indigenous populations. In Maryland animosities between the Catholic proprietor and a largely Protestant population caused friction. In New York divisions between the Dutch and the English kept old wounds open. In New York and Maryland, the tensions triggered a crisis that led to government reorganization. Other forces were at work as well. Relations between the English and the Indians had settled into a pattern of mutual suspicion and antagonism. Colonial governors became entangled in mediating disputes between land-hungry settlers and tribes eager to fend them off. Seeing the brutality of Anglo-Indian warfare, many witnesses who testified at the Salem witchcraft trials envisioned the devil as a tawny-skinned tormentor whose tortures resembled those used by Indians on their enemies. Finally at the end of the seventeenth century, the political realignment associated with the Glorious Revolution in England helped usher in a new era of political stability in the colonies.

War and Rebellion
 In New England relations with the Wampanoag Indians, who had helped the Pilgrims, had deteriorated since both groups sat down for their harvest feast in 1621. The Wampanoag leader, Metacom, whom the colonists sometimes called King Philip, grew frustrated with English expansion and eventually led the Wampanoags in King Philip’s War against New Englanders. The fierce fighting spread across New England, with hardly a town escaping the conflict. Nearly 3,000 Indians died in the conflict and almost 1,000 colonists. This map shows the devastating impact of the war, which ravaged dozens of towns in New England (2.10). Puritans interpreted the ferocity as a sign of God’s displeasure. Increase Mather, a leading Puritan minister, reported that after the war ended, the government of Massachusetts appointed a committee to promote “a Reformation of those Evils which hath provoked the Lord to bring the sword upon us.” Among the causes of God’s displeasure, Mather listed drunkenness; the presence of “heretical” sects, such as the Quakers; an obsession with material profit; and a loss of modesty demonstrated by attention to fashion, especially “excesses in Apparel and hair.” In the Chesapeake tensions between colonists and Indians also led to violence. In Virginia, Bacon’s Rebellion, a popular uprising named after its leader,

 Nathaniel Bacon, erupted in 1676. The royal governor, Sir William Berkeley, had long played favorites, dealing out lucrative patronage positions and generous land grants to his cronies. The governor had also made a handsome profit from the fur trade with Indians. Frustrated by Berkeley’s policies, Bacon, a relative newcomer to the colony and a distant relative of the governor, decided to challenge Berkeley’s corruption and favoritism. Finding a common enemy, the area’s Indians, Bacon attracted a broad range of Virginians to his cause. He drew some support from planters frustrated with Berkeley’s favoritism and landowners frustrated by the governor’s refusal to adopt a more expansionist policy and acquire additional Indian land for settlement. He drew the bulk of his supporters, however, from the bottom ranks of Virginia society, including indentured servants and slaves. Promising to exterminate Indians and distribute land to all, Bacon exploited the deep class resentments that had smoldered for a long time in the Chesapeake region. The success of Bacon forced Berkeley to flee to the eastern shore of the Chesapeake. Buoyed by popular support, Bacon torched the colony’s capital, Jamestown. Bacon’s rising star faded almost as quickly as it rose when he died from fever, leaving the rebellion leaderless. Berkeley, returning with reinforcements, easily defeated the remnants of Bacon’s followers. A commission investigating the causes of the uprising concluded that the “giddy headed multitude”

 attracted to Bacon’s Rebellion was largely composed of men “lately crept out of the condition of servants.” For the colony’s leaders an especially troubling aspect of the rebellion was the interracial solidarity among servants, including whites serving temporary indentures and Africans slaves. Indeed, one group of rebels was composed of 80 blacks and 20 whites. Slavery in Virginia began as a legally amorphous category. Earlier in the century some slaves had managed to acquire their freedom, either through grants from their master or through their own resourcefulness. One slave who took advantage of the earlier laxity in the law was Anthony Johnson, who became a planter himself. By the eve of Bacon’s Rebellion, Virginia’s laws regarding slavery had hardened into an almost impenetrable barrier preventing slaves from

 achieving what Anthony Johnson had attained— freedom. Bacon’s Rebellion accelerated these changes, driving Virginia to invest more heavily in slaves. The danger posed by a “giddy multitude” of landless laborers, whose frustration so-called rabble-rousers such as Nathaniel Bacon could exploit, hastened the shift away from use of indentured servants to African slaves, who would remain a permanent underclass. Economic and demographic forces also pushed Virginia toward a slave-based economy. Among these the number of immigrants into the Chesapeake declined during the late seventeenth century, reducing the available work-force. As the price of slaves decreased and the high levels of mortality in the region, including of slaves, dropped, purchasing slaves became more economical. Previously there had been little in-

THE CRISES OF THE LATE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY

 centive to purchase a slave for almost twice the price of an indentured servant if the slave was unlikely to live long enough to make the difference in price economically advantageous. At mid-century a mere 300 slaves resided in the Chesapeake. By 1700, there were 13,000. England’s colonies were not the only ones rocked by unrest at the end of the seventeenth century. Other parts of the Atlantic colonial world experienced similar unrest. In Spanish New Mexico disputes culminated in the Pueblo Revolt (1680). In New Spain Indians were pitted against the Roman Catholic Church. Dispirited by droughts and attacks by Apache and Navajo war parties, the Pueblo people sought solace in their traditional religious practices and turned away from the Catholicism of their Spanish conquerors. Fearing a challenge to their authority, the Spanish Catholic missionaries in New Mexico brought the full force of church and state power against these “heretics.” Rather than accept the new wave of repression, Indians rose up against Spanish authority, killing most of the missionaries and more than 400 settlers. The rebellion drove the Spanish from New Mexico for more than a decade. However, divisions within the Pueblo community and continuing drought hampered the ability of the Pueblo people to resist Spanish power indefinitely. When the Spanish returned 13 years later, they easily reconquered New Mexico. The Pueblo revolt forced the Spanish to be more tolerant, at least to Indians who accepted Christianity. They could retain elements of their traditional religious practices and culture, including the use of Shamans, or religious healers. The Spanish also reformed the system of forced labor, which improved the Indians’ economic situation.

The Dominion of New
England and the
Glorious Revolution
 Although the Pueblo Revolt demonstrated that even Spain’s hierarchical colonial empire was not immune from strife, many close to King Charles II of England, including his brother James envied the Spanish model of empire. In 1685, Charles died without a legitimate son, and James II became England’s first Catholic monarch in 127 years. As Duke of York, James had been closely involved in colonial affairs in New York,



 and he hoped to consolidate the English colonies into larger administrative units with powerful governors similar to those in New Spain. He therefore revoked the colonial charters of New York and New Jersey, folding them into New England as a single new administrative and political entity, the Dominion of New England. A powerful English governor and a council appointed by the king would rule this Spanish-style dominion. Representative assemblies were abolished, and a reorganized legal system made it more difficult for colonists to have access to the courts. To extract additional wealth from the colonists, the colonial government raised taxes dramatically and revoked land deeds. To regain title to their own land, colonists would have to obtain new deeds and pay new taxes on land. James II had a bold agenda to strengthen royal power at home as well. He sought to ally England with Catholic France. James supported religious toleration for Catholics and Dissenters, but sought to impose this policy by royal decree, thus alienating potential support among Dissenters who were sympathetic to these policies. Even more troubling was his attempt to weaken the militia and raise a standing army, which included appointing Catholic officers loyal to the crown. Finally, James attempted to bypass Parliament and raise revenues through taxation. When Parliament refused to accept his agenda, James dissolved it. In the autumn of 1688, English opponents of the king allied with the Protestant Dutch Prince William of Orange and ousted James from the throne. William, whose English wife, Mary, was James’s daughter, reestablished a Protestant monarchy. The relatively bloodless revolution that led to the ascension of William III and Mary II was proclaimed a Glorious Revolution and a vindication of English liberty. Indeed, the association between the Glorious Revolution and English liberty was literally cast in metal. The commemorative medallion (2.11) produced for 2.11 Glorious Revolution Commemorative Medal In this medal commissioned to commemorate the ascension of William and Mary to England’s throne and the Glorious Revolution, Britannia, symbol of England, sits under an orange tree, which was the symbol of William of Orange. She grasps a liberty pole firmly in her hand, a reminder that William restored English liberty.

 the occasion depicts Britannia, symbol of England. She sits under an orange tree, the symbol of the Prince of Orange. Britannia grasps a liberty pole and has her hand on the Bible. The Latin inscription announces that “the Prince of Orange restores the law to us.” William and Mary accepted Parliament’s “Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject and Settling the Succession of the Crown,” more generally known as the English Bill of Rights. This act excluded Catholics from the monarchy, affirmed the supremacy of Parliament, protected basic rights, and asserted “That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” It also affirmed that “the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their condition and as allowed by law.” Restricted to Protestants, this particular right was further limited by social class and ultimately subject to Parliament’s right to regulate arms. Taken together the various provisions became an important rallying point for those seeking to limit government power and protect liberty. While official word of the Glorious Revolution took time to reach the colonies, rumors about the ascension of William and Mary arrived in spring 1689. In the colonies the right to have arms for selfdefense was an absolute necessity and the militia was an important local institution. In April 1689, 2,000 militiamen, mostly from country towns, marched on Boston, arrested the governor, and restored their old charter. In late May New York’s militia took control of that colony. In Maryland John Coode marched with 700 militiamen to “vindicate and assert the Sovereign Dominion and right of King William and Mary.” Protestant resentment against the power of the Catholic proprietary government also fueled Coode’s rebellion. The Glorious Revolution in America was a victory for representative government, and the notion that a well-regulated militia under local control was the best protection for liberty.

The Salem Witchcraft
Hysteria

 along the northern border of Massachusetts. Fighting was fierce, and Maine’s proximity to French Quebec led English colonists to see their latest troubles as part of a French Catholic plot against Protestant New England. Colonists in Massachusetts even accused the Indians of using witchcraft against them. Complicating matters, the recent upheavals of the Glorious Revolution had not yet produced a stable government, and a new royal governor had yet to be appointed in Massachusetts. Amid this heightened anxiety came the most serious outbreak of witchcraft accusations in colonial America. The center of the witchcraft hysteria was Salem, Massachusetts, but the accusations spread throughout Essex, the coastal county closest to Maine. Before the witchcraft prosecutions ended, 19 innocent men and women would be executed, and one man who refused to plead either innocent or guilty suffered an archaic penalty, heavy stones were piled on his chest to force him to plead. Rather than enter a plea, he was crushed to death. The Puritans who inhabited this region thought themselves an especially attractive target for Satan, who would, they believed, have been eager to upset their effort to build a city upon a hill. New England’s covenant with God was mirrored in Satan’s own demonic contracts with witches. To seal these contracts, New Englanders believed, Satan made his disciples sign his book, a belief reflected in this seventeenth-century woodcut, which shows the devil offering his disciples his book to sign (2.12). The witchcraft hysteria began in Salem Village, the outlying part of the port of Salem town. The first purported occurrence of witchcraft occurred in the home of Minister Samuel Parris, whose daughter and her cousin, Abigail Williams, began acting strangely. After consulting a physician, who could find no explanation for his daughter’s illness, Parris concluded that the girls were victims of witchcraft. When questioned, the girls accused two Salem women and Tituba, a Caribbean Indian slave whom Parris owned, of practicing witchcraft. Parris forced a confession from Tituba. The accusations eventually engulfed the whole community. The scope of the witch hunt changed dramatically when the accusations spread to another local minister, George Burroughs, who had recently returned from Maine. Much of the testimony from that point forward concerned the Devil taking the shape of an American

 Indian, creating another theme in the witchcraft hysteria. The Puritans even compared the suffering they believed that Satan inflicted on them with how Indians tortured settlers in the brutal frontier war in Maine. Historians have identified a number of patterns in the web of accusations. Witches in New England were more likely to be women, particularly older women who did not live in male-headed households. Women who failed to fit the model of the pious, submissive female, ruled by a benevolent patriarch, an ideal that Puritans esteemed, were particularly at risk. Pressure to stop the trials mounted, particularly after accusations were leveled at more prominent individuals from outside Salem. At the start of the trials, ministers had approved the use of spectral evidence—testimony that witches were using

 magic to torture victims. But as Rebecca Nurse argued during her trial, verifying such evidence was impossible. How, she asked the court, could one know if spectral evidence was genuine? Could not Satan appear at a trial to confound the court and trick them into accusing the wrong person? Doubts began to trouble leading ministers in the colony, including Increase Mather, who had been an early supporter of the prosecutions. Mather delivered a sermon stating a principle that became a bedrock of Anglo-American law: “It were better that ten suspected witches should escape, than that one innocent person should be condemned.” The new royal governor, William Phips. replaced the court that had handled the witchcraft trials with a new court whose guidelines followed more recent English law and disallowed convictions based on spectral evidence.

 What was spectral evidence?



 CHAPTER 2

MODELS OF SETTLEMENT: ENGLISH COLONIAL SOCIETIES, 1590–1710

The Whig Ideal and the
Emergence of Political Stability
 The Massachusetts legal system that produced the Salem witchcraft trials was out of step with legal developments in England, and even more so in light of the events of the Glorious Revolution (1688). The English Bill of Rights adopted by Parliament (1689) not only weakened royal power but also provided stronger protections for individual liberty, including explicit prohibitions on cruel and unusual punishments and a more robust affirmation of the right to a jury trial. In the long struggle between Parliament and the monarchy, Parliament had finally emerged as preeminent in the English political and constitutional system. The group that supported Parliamentary power after the Glorious Revolution became known as Whigs. Their opponents, the Tories, were proponents of monarchical authority. The period after the Glorious Revolution ushered in relative political stability in Anglo-American politics. This new era of stability did not end political debate, but it marked clear boundaries for future discussions.

The Whig Vision of Politics
 Whig theory, put into place after the Glorious Revolution, put a premium on the ideal of civic virtue, placing the public good above personal interest. To promote such virtue, one needed a society in which property ownership was widespread. An agricultural nation, where farming was thought to encourage honesty, frugality, and independence, was less likely to become corrupt than a society dependent on commerce and manufacturing. In an agrarian society politics would be less fractious because everyone’s interest would be similar. In such a society representatives would be equally affected by whatever laws they passed. This would prevent them from tyrannizing over the people by passing oppressive laws. The Whig view of politics was not democratic. It assumed that only men who owned property had a sufficient permanent stake in society to be trusted with the vote. (The few women who owned property, mostly widows, were not allowed to vote.) According to Whig thought, only the best—most virtuous—men would serve as representatives. The notion of frequent elections became a cornerstone of Whig politics. The great danger, however, lay in the potential for electoral corruption, as reflected in this political cartoon (2.13), which shows voters being

 bribed outside a tavern. The fear of corruption became an important feature of Whig political culture, underscoring the need for a virtuous elite and an electorate that could not be manipulated by unscrupulous politicians. The Glorious Revolution also affected English law. England had no written constitution, but the common law, the unwritten rules of law worked out over a centuries by English courts, embodied many of the essential liberties esteemed by Englishmen. To these protections Parliament had added the Bill of Rights of 1689, which would strongly influence the worldview of colonists in America. By asserting the ideal of the rule of law, the Glorious Revolution established the principle that no one, not even the king, was above the law. The revolution also lodged the right to tax firmly in the representative branch of government, Parliament, and it rejected the practice of raising a standing army, which was considered a serious threat to liberty, without the consent of the legislature. Among the other provisions protected by the Bill of Rights were the rights to petition government for redress of grievances, trial by jury, and bail, and a prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. A century later, the U.S. Constitution’s Bill of Rights codified and expanded these ideals.

THE WHIG IDEAL AND THE EMERGENCE OF POLITICAL STABILITY



2.13 English Whig Cartoon
 on Electoral Corruption In this early political satire of an English election, the electorate mill about waiting to be bribed by a candidate. The text below the scene warned of the dangers of “flattery and gold” which cause men to be corrupted and “liberty sold”.

Mercantilism, Federalism,
 and the Structure of Empire In 1651, the Parliament passed the first navigation act designed to limit the profitable Dutch trade with the English colonies. The act required that all goods entering or leaving colonial ports be carried on English or colonial ships and that non-English goods be carried on English ships or ships of the country from which the goods originated. Parliament passed even more restrictive navigation acts in 1660, 1663, 1673, and 1696. These acts required that all goods be transported on American or English carriers, which meant goods from other parts of Europe had to transit through English ports before arriving in the colonies. In 1696, Parliament also created the Board of Trade to help coordinate policy toward the colonies. Three years later Parliament passed the Woolens Act, to protect the English woolen industry from competition from Ireland and the colonies. The act did not ban Americans from making and selling woolens within the colonies, but it prohibited them from exporting woolens to England. The great eighteenth-century Scottish economist Adam Smith called this economic system mercantilism. According to mercantilist theory the wealth of the “mother” country England would

 be increased by heavy governmental regulation of imports and exports to the colonies. Colonies existed to generate wealth for their mother country by supplying it with raw materials and purchasing consumer goods from it. To enforce its mercantile policies, Parliament used legislation such as the navigation acts to control colonial behavior. It also created admiralty courts to try violations of the laws governing commerce. In 1707, the Act of Union united the kingdoms of Scotland and England, creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain. The act also divided power in the new British Empire between local and imperial authority. Colonial assemblies continued to legislate on local matters, and Parliament exercised powers over the whole empire. In essence British government had created a federal system that divided power between a distant central authority and local governments. This system of divided authority paved the way for the modern U.S. division between national authority (seated in Washington, D.C.) and the individual state governments.

 “The encouragement of exportation and the discouragement of importation [of manufactured goods] are the two great engines by which the mercantile system proposes to enrich every country.” ADAM SMITH, The Wealth of Nations, 1776

 Life in the seventeenth-century American colonies, even for the wealthiest, was crude and primitive. Beginning in the eighteenth century, however, a more cosmopolitan and refined culture began to emerge. Prosperous colonists sought out the latest British and European consumer goods, such as finely woven Turkish or English carpets, tea sets, and pattern books of English architectural and furniture styles. Captain Archibald Macpheadris, a fur trader in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, built an elegant new house in 1716, complete with beautifully executed wall murals, signifying his wealth and refinement. One of the most striking murals depicted two Mohawk Indian chiefs. The unknown painter copied these images from an engraving of a group of Indians who had traveled to London to meet with Queen Anne (r. 1703–1714). The engraver and the painter included authentic elements, such as the tomahawk wielded by the Indian on the right. Yet the image of the Indians also reflected the conventions of European painting: The position of the Mohawk “Indian Kings’ ” hands at their hip resembled a common aristocratic pose found in English portraits from this period. Books, newspapers, and letters all were part of the expanding commerce of the Atlantic world, This economy included a lively exchange of ideas on a wide array of subjects, including architecture, fashion, politics, religion, science, and philosophy. One highly influential set of ideas was associated with the Enlightenment and its ideals of reason and social progress. These ideas fostered new social experiments, such as the founding of the colony of Georgia. Religious ideas also crossed the Atlantic. The English evangelical minister George Whitefield crisscrossed the colonies from New Hampshire to Georgia. His tour helped spread the ideas of the religious revival movement known as the Great Awakening. Enlightenment ideals of liberty, human dignity, and progress and new religious ideas led some Americans to question the institution of slavery, despite its growing importance to the colonial economy. The stark contrast between the wealthy planters and wretchedly housed slaves was not the only divide in American life. As the overall wealth of the colonies increased, so did the disparity between the wealthy and the poor. Land itself became scarce by the mid-eighteenth century. Expansion westward was hampered by the Appalachian Mountains, and the French and a host of Indian tribes controlled the rich lands of what is now America’s Midwest. Ultimately the balance of power in North America was decided by the French and Indian War.

 CHAPTER 3

GROWTH, SLAVERY, AND CONFLICT: COLONIAL AMERICA, 1710–1763

Culture and Society in
 the Eighteenth Century As trade expanded with Britain, colonists strove to emulate the culture and sophistication of the mother country. New and grander houses, filled with the latest European-style furnishings, testified to the growing sophistication of the colonies. Yet while the colonies were striving to become more British, they were also developing their own distinctly American political culture and institutions. A native-born elite emerged, an American gentry class whose wealth, confidence, and education inspired them to become leaders in the colonial assemblies. A distinctive American style of politics had begun to take shape.

The Refinement of America
 At the end of the seventeenth century, even the homes of the most prosperous families in colonial America had few imported luxury goods. The sparse furnishing of the Hart Room (3.1), now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, capture the primitive nature of late seventeenth-century American homes. Thomas Hart, a landowner in Ipswich, Massachusetts, built his house in 1639 and furnished it in the ensuing decades. This parlor, the best room in the house, usually served as both a bedroom and a communal living space. Information from probates, a list of goods assembled as part of a will, suggests that homeowners furnished even the best parlor rooms sparsely, with simple tables and cupboards. The furniture’s simplicity and boxy look reflected prevailing styles and the scarcity of skilled craftsmen in the colonies at the time. The walls were generally whitewashed, with no ornamentation; the post and beams used to support the walls and the roof were clearly visible. Colonial culture began to change with the expansion of commerce at the start of the eighteenth century. America became more

 fully integrated into the Atlantic economy, a huge triangle that stretched from Scotland to Africa to the interior of the British mainland colonies (3.2). Trade in the Atlantic world involved a staggering array of goods. Scottish merchants purchased Virginia tobacco, which was sold throughout Europe. Another side of the triangle tied New England merchants to West Indian sugar planters. West Indian sugar was distilled into rum by New Englanders. Some of this alcohol was traded to Indians in the lucrative beaver trade in upstate New York. These beaver furs were often used in hats and sometimes ended up in London or on the European continent. By the early eighteenth century, expanding trade with the British Empire increased the number of wealthy colonists and brought a flood of new luxury goods into affluent American homes.

Note the carved pineapple above the door.

GROWTH, SLAVERY, AND CONFLICT: COLONIAL AMERICA, 1710–1763

 An insight into the range of this far-flung commerce comes from the extensive correspondence of Charleston merchant Robert Pringle with business associates throughout the Atlantic world, from Lisbon, Portugal to London and Barbados to Boston. The entrepreneurial Pringle experimented with a variety of desirable agricultural imports, including pistachios, Seville oranges, and olives, hoping that they might be produced in the Carolinas. None of these imports took hold, but South Carolina did provide Europe with two important products, rice and indigo. For wealthy colonists nothing was more effective at communicating one’s riches and gentility than a formal portrait in the latest English style. Following the conventions of European portraits, men and women struck standard aristocratic poses; elegant ladies dressed in flowing gowns, mimicking the style of their monarch, Queen Anne. Men and even young boys were painted wearing elegant outfits that reflected their wealth, status, and power. The portrait of the young Henry Darnall III, one of the earliest done in the American South, testifies to the growing wealth and refinement of the colonial elite (see Images as History: A Portrait of Colonial Aspirations). Eliza Lucas Pinckney, an affluent South Carolinian, exemplified the new ideal of refined female gentility. Born into a prosperous family of rice planters, Eliza helped introduce the profitable dye plant, indigo, into South Carolina (1738–

•


 1744), which became the colonies’ second most important export crop in the eighteenth century. She eagerly consumed British fashions and ideas, and aspired to create a lifestyle that a visitor from London would have easily recognized. She studied French, was conversant in the ideas of the English philosopher John Locke, and participated in the management of her family’s plantation. Her social life was equally busy. She regularly attended teas, dances, and concerts. Eliza’s beautiful gold silk dress (3.4) was woven from silk produced on her own plantation. After the silk was harvested, she sent it to England to be dyed and woven into a fabric suitable for a gown that might be worn to the most elegant party in either London or Charleston. For women the new customs of gentility were a mixed blessing. A wealthy woman might have servants or slaves to help her entertain in a suitable style, but it took additional time and effort to supervise these activities. Most women did not enjoy the luxury of additional help and had to handle these new responsibilities themselves.

More English,
Yet More American
 The exteriors of American houses also underwent a process of Anglicization. English-style manor houses such as William Byrd’s Westover (1730–1734) (3.5), borrowed ideas from English pattern books (architectural guidebooks of the latest styles) (3.6). The main entrance of this elegant red brick mansion took guests through an impressive doorway that Byrd imported from England. The model for the door and its frame came from a London design. The classical columns and the swan-shaped broken pediment at the top of the doorframe include a carved pineapple. This exotic West Indian fruit created a sensation among the wealthy on both sides of the Atlantic, as both a culinary delicacy and a symbol of affluent hospitality. The pineapple soon became a common architectural motif in the mansions of wealthy Americans.

CULTURE AND SOCIETY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY



Images as History
A PORTRAIT OF COLONIAL ASPIRATIONS
Justus Engelhardt Kühn’s portrait of the young Henry Darnall III (1710) reveals how the aspirations of colonists continued to exceed the bounds of the possible. Although the Darnalls lived a life of luxury compared with most colonists, surrounding themselves with goods that earlier generations of colonists would have envied, they did not quite live up to the standards of the typical British aristocrat. The scene behind Darnall is pure fantasy. An elegant stone balustrade overlooking an elaborate formal garden projects an image of wealth, refinement, and power. Yet neither the fancy garden nor the stone 
 balcony would have existed anywhere in the colonies at the time. Kühn’s decision to include these imaginary elements in the background reflected the aspirations rather than the realities of life in the colonies. The picture symbolized the wealth, power, and gentility that the Darnalls sought to achieve, not their actual condition. The work is also the first known painting of an African American in the colonies. Darnall’s slave wears a silver yoke around his neck, a symbol of his inferior status. Although much younger, Darnall towers over his slave.

 The imaginary garden in the background represents the Darnalls’ desires, but this level of grandeur was not yet attainable in the colonies. The slave, silver shackle around his neck, is situated below his master and looks up at him adoringly. The image of the docile slave clearly reflected the slave owner’s point of view, not the slave’s.

 House reflected the Anglicization of American tastes and the growing wealth of colonial Pennsylvania.

GROWTH, SLAVERY, AND CONFLICT: COLONIAL AMERICA, 1710–1763

 Anglicization transformed churches and public architecture as well. Some of the grandest buildings erected in the colonies during the first half of the eighteenth century were public structures such as the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia, where Pennsylvania’s assembly met. Constructed between 1732 and 1756, the State House’s twoand-half-story red brick structure dominated the Philadelphia skyline. Built in the Palladian style (also known as Georgian, in honor of the British monarch, King George I (r. 1714–1727)), the Pennsylvania State House captured two seemingly opposing trends in the evolution of American society in the eighteenth century. Its architecture testified to the powerful influence of Anglicization. With its beautiful windows and impressive red brick exterior, the State House visibly symbolized the colonists’ esteem for and knowledge of the latest English architectural styles (3.7). The actions inside the State House, however, the debates and votes of the Pennsylvania assembly, were emblematic of the growing power and assertiveness of an American-born colonial elite. The building was later renamed Independence Hall, reflecting its close association with the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the drafting of the U.S. Constitution.

 What does the design of the Pennsylvania State House reveal about colonial society?

Strong Assemblies and
Weak Governors
 The Pennsylvania State House was a potent visual reminder of the power of the colonial assembly. The assemblies had become the preeminent political institutions in the colonies. American ideas about legislative power drew support from seventeenth-century English Whig ideas that triumphed during England’s Glorious Revolution in 1688 (see Chapter 2). Several developments in American colonial history helped reinforce the growth of legislative power. Although voting in America remained restricted to adult white male landholders, the percentage of such individuals in the colonies was larger than it was in Britain. The larger voting population meant that a higher percentage of Americans were politically active than Britons. Additionally none of the colonies had anything like an upper house comparable to Parliament’s House of Lords. The governors’ councils, the closest thing to a colonial upper house, had little power. America’s nativeborn elites were not a titled British aristocracy, with a distinct legislative body, the House of Lords, to guard their privileges and powers. Ambitious young Americans from good families, like the young Thomas Jefferson, expected to enter politics by election to the lower house of the colonial assembly, not by inheriting a place in an aristocratic upper house.

CULTURE AND SOCIETY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY

 In part the actions of colonial assemblies filled a void that the structure of the empire had created. In an age in which a letter could take months to travel from London to the colonies, it was imperative that local assemblies have the authority to deal with a host of governmental responsibilities, from organizing the militia to providing for the poor. Although colonists had gained the right to legislate on local matters, they were also part of the larger British Empire. Most colonies had agents who represented their interests in London and lobbied Parliament. Apart from these agents the colonies had no actual representation in Parliament: No member of Parliament was elected from the colonies or watched over their interests. In this regard the American colonies were no worse off than were other British colonies, including Barbados and Jamaica. Even within Britain newer cities such as Manchester and Birmingham had no representation in Parliament, and at least one town, Dunwich, continued to send two members to Parliament even though the town



 to take a more active role in managing the empire and collecting greater revenues in the 1760s, the colonial practices and British theory collided. Royal governors repeatedly complained that the colonial assemblies had exercised authority that did not belong to them and frustrated their plans. The royal governors’ dependence on the assemblies for their salaries weakened their position with regard to the legislature. By controlling the power of the purse, colonial assemblies were able to frustrate the plans of the most ambitious royal governors: If they wished to collect their salaries, the governors dared not anger the assemblies. Colonial assemblies came to act like and think of themselves as mini-parliaments, with full legislative power over local matters. In 1728 the Massachusetts legislature reminded the governor that it was “the undoubted Right of all English men . . . to raise and dispose of Moneys for the publick Service of their own free accord without any Compulsion.”

 “My Lord Cornbury has and dos still make use of an unfortunate Custom of dressing himself in Womens Cloaths and of exposing himself in that Garb upon the Ramparts to the view of the public; in that dress he draws a World of Spectators about him and consequently as many Censures.” Letter spreading rumors of Lord Cornbury’s cross-dressing, 1709 had literally crumbled into the North Sea. To cast their votes “legal residents” of Dunwich had to row out to the location of the former town hall, which was submerged. According to traditional Whig political theory, members of Parliament were expected to represent the whole nation, not a particular locality. Rather than speak for any local interest, representatives were supposed to act in the larger public good. By the 1760s, the differences between American and British practices had become so great that they prompted a new theoretical defense. Thus, champions of the traditional British practice argued that all Britons, including the colonists, had virtual representation in Parliament, even if they had no actual representatives to guard their interests. As long as Parliament did not meddle much in colonial affairs, a policy of “salutary neglect,” this theory caused few problems. When Parliament began

 Colonial politics could be nasty, and most royal governors lacked the power to tame their legislatures. No governor was more ineffective and despised than Lord Cornbury, Royal Governor of New York and New Jersey (the two colonies shared the same royal governor until 1738). Enemies of Cornbury accused him of parading around the ramparts of New York’s forts in women’s clothing and used these rumors to undermine his authority, a strategy that was extremely effective. Sir Danvers Osborne, another New York governor, became so despondent over dealings with the colonial assembly that he hanged himself. To avoid the fate of Cornbury or Osborne, savvy royal governors understood the necessity of making strategic alliances with members of the assembly. The give-and-take between the governors and the assembly defined colonial politics for much of the eighteenth century.

 Why were colonial governors so weak?

Enlightenment and Awakenings


3.8 The Gaols
Committee of
 the House of Commons In William Hogarth’s painting, members of Parliament involved in prison reform, including James Oglethorpe (second from the left), examine a prisoner. His tattered clothes and shackles reveal the inhumanity of Britain’s prisons.

 By mid-century a British traveler to Philadelphia, the largest city in America, would have been impressed by the fine houses, elegant coaches, and other signs of America’s refinement and gentility. The visitor would also have been struck by the signs of Enlightenment in the city: a fine lending library, the American Philosophical Society, and a new college. The city hosted scientists of international renown, such as Benjamin Franklin, the man who had tamed lightning. A visitor to the colonies might also have encountered the great evangelist George Whitefield, on one of his tours. Even if one missed hearing the “peddler in divinity,” one could read about his exploits in the expanding press. The religious revival movement, known as the Great Awakening attacked traditional styles of worship in favor of a more emotional style of devotion. Communities across America were divided into those who favored the new style of religion and those opposed to it.

 How did Georgia reflect Enlightenment ideals?

ENLIGHTENMENT AND AWAKENINGS

 Georgia’s Utopian Experiment One of the most ambitious Enlightenment endeavors was the new colony of Georgia, founded as an experiment to reform criminals and the poor by transplanting them from England to a more wholesome environment in America. James Oglethorpe, a spokesman in Parliament for humanitarian causes, secured parliamentary support for his plan to use colonization as an alternative to imprisonment. Georgia, named for King George II (r. 1727–1760), was strategically located as a buffer between the Carolinas and Spanish Florida. Life in British prisons in the eighteenth century was harsh. At least half of the prisoners were debtors, whose crime was failing to pay their bills. Oglethorpe became a leading champion for prison reform and was appointed to a parliamentary committee charged with investigating the nation’s jails. The committee’s work attracted the interest of artist and social critic William Hogarth. In this painting of Oglethorpe’s committee, Hogarth presents a stark contrast between the elegantly dressed members of Parliament and a prisoner in rags who was “clamped in irons,” a painful form of physical restraint commonly used in British prisons (3.8). For Oglethorpe, removing prisoners from debtors’ prison and sending them to a colony in America meshed perfectly with his vision for dealing with crime and poverty in Britain. In America the poor would have a fresh opportunity to earn a living and avoid the impoverishment they faced in England. Oglethorpe’s vision for Georgia reflected the views of Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke, who rejected the notion that humans were born depraved and could not be rehabilitated if placed in a healthier environment. The 1732 charter granted Oglethorpe and the trustees of the colony of Georgia enormous power. To prevent the colony from becoming just another slave society in which a few enjoyed great wealth and the majority were poor, the trustees banned slavery. To promote sobriety, the trustees also prohibited the importation of rum. Oglethorpe and the trustees soon confronted the same types of problems that earlier proprietary colonies had experienced (see Chapter 2). Settlers demanded a greater say in their affairs, including the right to import slaves. By 1738, the colony had abandoned much of its original vision,



 including its ban on importing both slaves and rum. Having begun as something of a utopian experiment, Georgia became another slave society in the lower South. Although Enlightenment ideals helped shape the early history of Georgia, defense was never far from Oglethorpe’s mind. His plan for the city of Savannah drew on the ideals of Renaissance city planning that had inspired the design of many other towns in the Americas (see Chapter 1). Reflecting the city’s position on the frontier of Spanish America, the plan looked like a design for a military encampment, a model stretching back to ancient Rome (3.9). Oglethorpe had dreamed of using Georgia as the launching point for the conquest of Spanish America, but his attack on the Spanish town of St. Augustine in Florida in 1740 failed. Two years later when the Spanish retaliated, Oglethorpe repelled them. Georgia did not become a staging ground to root out the Spanish, but it was an effective barrier, protecting the colonies from Spanish attack.

American Champions of
 the Enlightenment The Enlightenment championed the work of Sir Isaac Newton, the great English scientist and mathematician who explored the laws of motion, optics, and gravity. The Newtonian universe was radically different from the world that had produced the Salem witchcraft accusations (see Chapter 2). Rather than looking primarily to the invisible world of the supernatural, Newtonianism

 focused on the visible world of nature, which functioned according to the rules discerned by observation and interpreted by reason. Newtonianism was not antithetical to religion, but the God of the Newtonian universe was different from the traditional Christian notion of God as a patriarch or king. In the Newtonian vision God was the great clockmaker who fashioned the universe to run according to predictable natural laws. In contrast to Newton’s grand theorizing, the Enlightenment in America took a distinctly practical approach. No figure in America more closely approximated this ideal than Benjamin Franklin. Printer, scientist, reformer, and statesman, Franklin became a symbol of the American Enlightenment on both sides of the Atlantic. His international fame derived from his scientific experiments with lightning and electricity, which he published in 1751. Franklin coined the terms positive and negative to describe the nature of

 electrical current and theorized the possibility of creating a battery to store an electrical charge. Franklin also demonstrated that lightning was a form of electrical discharge. This insight led the practical-minded Franklin to develop the lightning rod. The device was designed to attract lightning and then conduct the current safely away from a building. American homes were generally built of wood, a plentiful material in most parts of the colonies that was extremely susceptible to damage by lightning. In a tribute to Franklin, John Adams wrote, “Nothing, perhaps, that ever occurred upon this earth was so well calculated to give any man an extensive and universal celebrity as the discovery of . . . lightning rods.” Franklin’s close association with electricity in general and the lightning rod in particular was captured in this 1762 painting (3.10), which depicts Franklin at his desk with a lightning storm raging in the background and a lightning rod prominently positioned on a building visible through a window. Franklin helped found the American Philosophical Society (1743), a learned society committed to the advancement of knowledge; the College of Philadelphia (1751) (later the University of Pennsylvania); and the Library Company, a private lending library. In addition to these institutions that reflected the Enlightenment’s emphasis on education and the spread of knowledge, Franklin helped found organizations dedicated to improving the lives of Philadelphians, including a fire company and the first public hospital in the colonies. Although Franklin owned slaves, as did many in Philadelphia, he eventually came to regard slavery as a great evil and vigorously opposed it.

Awakening, Revivalism,
 and American Society From 1730 to 1770, the colonies experienced a series of religious revivals that historians group together as the Great Awakening. The resulting religious conflict divided families, split churches, and fragmented communities, forever altering the religious landscape of colonial America. One of the early leaders of the revival movement, Gilbert Tennent, a New Jersey minister, attacked ministers for preaching an empty, “dead form of religion.” Only by accepting the reality of sin and opening one’s heart to grace could one hope to achieve salvation. Tennent also took aim

 at America’s expanding consumer society and the “covetousness” that society had encouraged. The leading intellectual champion of the Awakening was New England minister Jonathan Edwards, who captured the spirit of this movement when he wrote that “Our people do not so much need to have their heads” filled, as much as “have their hearts touched.” Edwards’s fiery sermon, “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” (1741), offered his parishioners a vision of the eternal fires of hell that awaited the unconverted. To shake his parishioners out of their complacency and remind them of the necessity of grace for salvation, Edwards compared their fate to that of a spider dangling above the pit of eternal damnation, with only God’s mercy preventing them from falling in. In 1757, Edwards became the president of the College of New Jersey (which became Princeton University), one of several new colleges founded by supporters of the Awakening to train a new generation of ministers. Princeton, allied to the Presbyterian Church, also had close ties to Scottish universities that were leading centers of Enlightenment thought. Rhode Island College (Brown University) was founded by the Baptists in 1764; Queens College (later Rutgers), by the Dutch Reformed Church in 1766. Dartmouth College was founded by the Congregationalist Eleazar Wheelock in 1769, originally as an Indian mission school. Edwards’s account of his own Massachusetts revival inspired the English Anglican minister George Whitefield to take his evangelical crusade to the colonies. Whitefield’s 1739–1740 tour was America’s first genuinely inter-colonial event. The energetic English preacher traversed most of the eastern seaboard from New Hampshire to Georgia. His tour took advantage of improved roads and the expansion of inter-colonial shipping routes. He traveled the same routes as the merchants who hawked the latest English wares, and his gift for selling the gospel prompted one critic to describe him and other evangelical ministers as “Peddlers in Divinity.” Whitefield attracted such large crowds that much of his preaching was outdoors because few churches were big enough to hold his audience. The Great Awakening changed American society. The evangelical methods employed by gifted preachers implicitly challenged the hierarchical assumptions of colonial society about gender, race, and social status. Individuals exercised greater choice, many choosing to leave their own congregations and find one that better suited their spiritual needs. For some the Awakening provided



 opportunities to step forward as lay preachers. For the first time in American religious history, ordinary people were given a significant public voice. For those whose voices were seldom heard in public— women, blacks, artisans, or poor folk—the opportunity to testify about their spiritual life, often to mixed crowds that included people like themselves or even their social betters, challenged traditional ideas about hierarchy. Mary Cooper, a resident of Long Island, noted in her diary that she heard an astonishing assortment of individuals preach, including a Quaker woman, a “Black man,” and even two Indian preachers. By giving a voice to many groups previously excluded from traditional preaching, the Great Awakening contributed to the growth of a more democratic culture.

 “The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect, over the fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked; his wrath towards you burns like fire; he looks upon you as worthy of nothing else, but to be cast into the fire.” JONATHAN EDWARDS, 1741

 In a few cases women touched by the spirit began preaching, an action that prompted their own ministers to denounce them for flouting the accepted roles assigned to women in colonial society. Testifying to one’s religious experiences was one thing, but assuming the role of preacher, a role traditionally reserved for men, was simply too radical. After Bathsheba Kingsley stole a horse and rode from community to community preaching the gospel, Jonathan Edwards denounced her for perverting the spirit of revival. Edwards, wed to traditional ideas about women’s roles, was horrified that Kingsley interpreted the Awakening’s message as an invitation to become a gospel preacher. Not all ministers approved of the ideas and methods of the revivalist preachers. Opponents of the revival, dubbed Old Lights, attacked the revivalists, or New Lights, for their excessive emotionalism. Old Light ministers ridiculed the revivalists for telling their congregants that “they were damned! damned! damned!” Rather than

 adopt the new, more emotional style, Old Lights continued to favor sermons based on learned explications of biblical texts. In response to this backlash against the Awakening, Gilbert Tennent accused his opponents of lacking “the Courage, or Honesty, to thrust the Nail of Terror into sleeping Souls.” One New Light preacher, James Davenport, took the emphasis on emotionalism to an extreme, urging that books and sermons written by Old Light ministers be burned. As congregations divided between New Lights and Old Lights, many communities were pulled apart.

Indian Revivals
 The Great Awakening also spilled over into Indian country. Indians won over by evangelical efforts often served as cultural mediators between their communities and the colonists. The Moravians, German-speaking evangelical Protestants, were particularly effective at evangelizing among Indian tribes. In 1740, many German Moravians migrated to Pennsylvania, where they settled in a town they named Bethlehem. Moravians also established communities in the Carolinas and Georgia. Unlike the Calvinist faith of many English colonists, which shunned the use of images in their churches, the Moravians were Lutherans and

 embraced art as a means of promoting the gospels (see Chapters 1 and 2). In particular Moravians focused on the redemptive power of Christ’s suffering as the foundation for religious salvation. Their most renowned artist in America, John Valentine Haidt, was well schooled in European styles of religious painting and used these techniques to translate the Moravians’ Christian vision into visually rich images (3.11). The idea of Christ’s suffering resonated with Indian converts, and the Moravians displayed images of the crucifixion to bring the gospel to the Indians. After viewing such pictures in the home of a Moravian missionary, two visiting Indians commented on “how many wounds he has, how much blood flows forth!” For American Indians Moravian religious imagery of Jesus suggested a brave spiritual warrior, an ideal that resonated in the minds of young male Indians, whose conception of masculinity was based on a martial ideal of physical strength, bravery, and the endurance of pain and suffering. Although the Great Awakening touched a small but influential group of Indians, a different type of native religious renewal movement had an even greater impact on American Indians. As early as 1737, reports began filtering back from Indian country, the broad swath of territory from western Pennsylvania to French-controlled land in Illinois, that Indian religious leaders were preaching the need for a return to traditional ways and a complete separation from colonists. The alcohol that Europeans traded with Indians had contributed to rising levels of alcoholism among Indians. In the 1760s, the Delaware Indian prophet Neolin championed the revival of traditional beliefs and the rejection of European influences. He urged his people to “learn to live without any Trade or Connections with White people.” In place of dependency and trade, he counseled “Clothing and Supporting themselves as their forefathers did.” Neolin and other prophets of Indian revitalization traveled as itinerants through Indian territory preaching their message. Indian revivalists attacked Indian involvement with and dependence on the world of trade and commerce with Europeans.

AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE COLONIAL ERA



African Americans
 in the Colonial Era By the eighteenth century, racial slavery had become a central feature of the Atlantic world, with firm roots in British North America. The greatest demand for slaves came from the sugar-producing regions of Brazil and the Caribbean. An additional 300,000 slaves arrived in the British mainland colonies, with the greatest demand for their labor in the upper and lower South. The highest proportion of slaves lived in the lower South, where Africans actually outnumbered Europeans. Slavery in British North America was not an exclusively southern phenomenon. Slaves were an important part of urban life in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. Slavery was also significant in the economies of the mid-Atlantic and New England. Slavery was a brutal and exploitative labor system, but the experience of individual slaves varied greatly from region to region. Regardless of where they were and under what circumstances they lived, slaves found ways to resist their masters’ domination. Occasionally they turned to violent resistance, but more often they used economic sabotage—pretending sickness, destroying tools, mutilating livestock, or running away—to undermine the profitability of slavery. Perhaps even more significant were the slaves’ attempts to assert their humanity and create lives beyond the reach of the master’s dominion. Establishing families despite the ever-present threat of being torn from one’s loved ones and sold, building a viable community, and practicing their own religion gave slaves the cultural resources to survive and denied their masters complete control over their lives.

The Atlantic Slave Trade
 Slaves had been traded internally within Africa for centuries; indeed, it took hundreds of years for the Atlantic slave trade to surpass the internal African slave trade. The demand for agricultural labor in the Atlantic world created a strong market for African slaves and led to a dramatic increase in the transAtlantic slave trade in the late 1600s. The leading participants in the international slave trade in the seventeenth century had been Spain, Portugal, and Holland, but by the eighteenth century, Britain had become the preeminent slave-trading nation in the Atlantic world. As the graphs and figures presented in Envisioning Evidence: The Eighteenth-Century Atlantic Slave Trade show, most slaves in the Atlantic trade ended up in one of the sugar colonies. Portuguese sugar production was centered in Brazil, while Dutch, French, and British sugar production was centered in the Caribbean. Less than 10 percent of the slaves imported from Africa were transported to the American colonies, but the significance of slavery to the British mainland American colonies was enormous.

 The brutality of slavery began far from the Atlantic coast of Africa in the inland regions, where slave catchers acquired most slaves. The captive slaves were then bound by ropes or wooden yokes and marched to the coast, where they were housed in pens. To prevent communication among captives and reduce the chances of slaves organizing themselves to escape or challenge their captors, the slave catchers often separated individuals from the same ethnic or language groups. They also routinely separated family

 “The stench of the hold . . . became pestilential. The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us.” OLAUDAH EQUIANO, The Life of Olaudah Equiano (London, 1789)

Envisioning Evidence
THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE
In the eighteenth century, the slave trade was the economic cornerstone of the Atlantic economy. It supplied indispensable labor necessary to produce plantation cash crops such as sugar and tobacco in the New World, and transporting slaves provided huge profits for those engaged in the brutal, forced migration of Africans to the Americas. The data presented in this map and the accompanying graph bring into focus an important fact about the Atlantic slave trade: Most of the slaves transported to the Americas ended up in the sugar islands of the Caribbean or in Brazil. Less than 10 percent of the slaves went to British North America. The experience of the Middle Passage was horrific, a fact underscored by the mortality rates depicted in the pie chart above.

 members. Slaves might remain housed in these inhumane conditions for months before being boarded on slave ships bound for the Americas. The voyage across the Atlantic from Africa to the Americas, known as the middle passage, was horrific. The cramped conditions on these voyages depicted in this antislavery petition barely convey the ordeal (3.12). Typically their captors forced the slaves to remain in shackles during the voyage. Slaves endured meager rations and unsanitary conditions, a situation that led those who preferred “death to such a life of misery” to drown themselves. Mortality rates during the middle passage exceeded 10 percent. In the seventeenth century most slaves bound for the British mainland colonies in America came first to the Caribbean, where they were “seasoned,” a process of physical and psychological adjustment to the rigors of slavery. Afterward they would make the final leg of the voyage to the American mainland. This pattern changed in the eighteenth century when the demand for slave labor increased dramatically, and many traders chose to bypass the seasoning process. Thus most slaves arriving in British North America in the eighteenth century were “saltwater slaves,” coming directly from Africa. Most slaves arrived at Sullivan’s Island in Charleston harbor, leading scholars to describe it as Black America’s Ellis Island (page 500). After being unloaded and quarantined on Sullivan’s Island, slaves were typically transported for sale in the slave markets of the major ports and cities. This was often the last time family members would see each other. After being subjected to a humiliating inspection, similar to that used by livestock buyers, slaves were auctioned off to their new masters. Even if family members had managed to remain together, they now faced permanent separation from their loved ones. Thus the experience of the auction block further traumatized slaves who had already suffered a multitude of horrors on their perilous journey from Africa to America.

Southern Slavery
 The two regional subcultures in the colonial South—the lower and upper South—had distinctive slave labor systems and cultures. Slavery in the lower South (parts of the Carolina and Georgia low country) had evolved as the region evolved from a frontier settlement to an integrated part of the Atlantic slave economy. In the upper South slavery had gradually replaced indentured servitude (p. 83) as the main source of labor by 1700.



3.12 Tight
Packing
 This abolitionist depiction of tight packing shows the cramped conditions on slave ships, which maximized the number of bodies carried with no concern for the health of the slaves transported.

 The lower South began as a colony of a colony. Carolina was first conceived as a base for supplying food to the Caribbean sugar islands. The colony also traded captured Indian slaves and deer hides. In the 1690s, rice was introduced into this region and eventually became its most profitable export. Many slaves had learned to cultivate rice in Africa, and their knowledge contributed to the increase in rice production from 10,000 pounds in 1698 to 20 million pounds in 1730. In the 1740s, another important cash crop— indigo—was introduced into the region. By the 1730s, when the Carolinas had been divided into North and South Carolina, two-thirds of the region’s population were African slaves. Most blacks worked under a task system that gave them considerable autonomy over their work. Once their tasks were completed, slaves might use the remaining time to hunt, fish, or tend their own gardens to supplement their meager diets.

 The conical design of these slave cabins, including their thatched roofs, drew on West African architectural influences.

GROWTH, SLAVERY, AND CONFLICT: COLONIAL AMERICA, 1710–1763

 The swampy regions of the Carolina low country were fertile breeding grounds for tropical diseases, including malaria. Africans had developed partial immunity to this disease, but whites of European descent were extremely susceptible. Given the unhealthy environment of the coastal lowlands, wealthy planters preferred to spend much of the year at their Charleston homes. The many white absentees and the continuous influx of slaves from Africa helped blacks living in this region preserve aspects of their African heritage despite the deprivations of slave life. The conical-shaped, thatched-roofed huts in the slave quarters on Mulberry plantation (3.13), South Carolina, reflect the influence of African architectural styles. Slavery in the upper South, the Chesapeake region, differed markedly from its practice in the low country Carolinas. While the task system worked for rice cultivation, growing tobacco, the dominant crop in the Chesapeake, demanded more oversight. The plants were easily damaged if not properly tended, so planters preferred to organize their slaves into gangs that worked together under the watchful eye of a white overseer or a black slave driver chosen by the master. Slaves in the Chesapeake were a minority, and they lived on plantations typically smaller than those in the lower South. Although slaves in this region preserved elements of traditional African culture, their smaller numbers and wider distribution made it more difficult to preserve their African cultural heritage.

 What were the main differences between the task system and the gang system of labor?

Northern Slavery
 and Free Blacks Although slavery was less vital to the colonial economy outside of the South, it was important in some areas. For example, in parts of New York and New Jersey, the slave population might range from 15 to 30 percent. Typically slaves in the rural North worked as field hands on small family farms. There were also many urban slaves in the North, who generally worked as domestics in wealthier homes. In seaports, slaves worked in maritime occupations. In Pennsylvania slaves were so essential to iron manufacturing that their masters petitioned the assembly to lower tariffs on slave imports so that they could continue to produce iron. A small community of free blacks emerged and settled in northern cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Slaves gained their freedom by several means. Some were freed by masters who recognized the evil of slavery. One of the earliest groups to condemn slavery was the Quakers. Other slaves, particularly those who had learned a skill such as carpentry, might be able to strike a bargain with their owners and gain the right to work for themselves part time, eventually saving enough money to buy their freedom. Although a few freed slaves became farmers, many ended up in one of the thriving seaports where economic opportunities were greater. Urban settings also provided African Americans in the North with many cultural opportunities. In both New York City and Albany, the African American communities adapted the Dutch religious holiday of “Pentecost” and turned it into a carnivallike festival they named “Pinkster.” The holiday was presided over by an African American figure, “King Charles,” who acted as the political leader of

AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE COLONIAL ERA

 his community during the holiday. During Pinkster African Americans participated in music, dancing, and festive meals; they also paraded as part of their African “different nations,” an explicit demonstration of their African roots. The Great Awakening helped spread Christianity to slaves across America and among free blacks in the North. The Moravians were particularly aggressive in preaching the gospel to slaves in North Carolina. Jonathan Edwards, himself a slave owner, reported that slaves in his own community had embraced the revival. Evangelical groups such as the Methodists encouraged free blacks to attend their revival meetings. The new more emotional style favored by so many Awakening preachers appealed to African Americans because it more closely resembled traditional African styles of religious practice.

Slave Resistance
 and Rebellion The growth of slavery in the late 1600s led colonial governments to ensure that African slaves remained subservient to their white masters (see Chapter 2). Slave codes gave masters almost unlimited authority over their slaves. The codes also legally defined as slaves children born to slave mothers, even when fathered by free whites. Although deprived of any legal means to protect themselves, slaves developed strategies for coping with the horrors of slavery and escaping the domination of their masters. Stealing, shirking responsibility, feigning illness, or breaking tools: all of these actions deliberately slowed the pace of their work and provided temporary relief. Some slaves ran away, simply hiding in the woods, seeking refuge with a family on nearby plantations in the slave quarters. Avoiding the white patrols that were always on the lookout for runaways made this a risky option. In those parts of the South closer to Indian country or Spanish territory, including parts of the Carolinas and Georgia, slaves might try to find refuge in a territory beyond the control of the English colonists. Slaves who took part in South Carolina’s Stono Rebellion of 1739 took advantage of the colonies’ proximity to Spanish Florida. The rebels broke into a storehouse and seized arms, murdered whites, and torched the homes of slave owners. The rebels hoped that other slaves would rally to their standard, and some slaves from the

The slave rebels hoped to find refuge in Spanish Florida. But the Carolina militia intercepted the rebels before they could reach it, and the better organized and armed militia routed the Stono rebels, slaughtering them by the dozens and executing those who survived. In response to the Stono Rebellion, South Carolina passed harsher slave codes and temporarily blocked importation of slaves into the region, a ban that was soon lifted because of the economic importance of slave labor. The Stono Rebellion was the largest African American uprising in the colonial era, but it would not be the last in the history of American slavery.

An African American Culture
 Emerges under Slavery Most slaves did not adopt rebellion as their primary strategy for challenging the authority of their masters. Simply establishing families, building an African American community, and practicing their own religion were more realistic goals for most slaves—but all were difficult to achieve given the constraints imposed by slavery. Forming a family under slavery was not easy. For one thing, the sex ratio among slaves during much of the colonial period was sharply skewed, with many more males than females. During the early years of the slave trade, slave owners preferred males for the backbreaking agricultural work required to produce, rice, tobacco, or sugarcane. So most slaves imported into the Americas were male; the odds of a male slave finding a wife were slim. During the eighteenth century, as more slaves were born in America, the sex ratio became more balanced because roughly comparable numbers of boys and girls were born. But even if the chances of a man finding a mate increased, slavery made

 family formation difficult. Slave marriages had no legal standing. So slaves faced the constant threat of separation from their spouses. The decision to break up slave families rested entirely with the master, and many children were sold from their families. On relatively small plantations slaves usually sought a spouse on a neighboring plantation, which left couples at the mercy of masters who could withhold visiting privileges and prevent husbands and wives from seeing one another. Nevertheless, many slaves did manage to find partners and create stable families. One of the many aspects of traditional African culture preserved by slaves was naming practices. As was customary in many parts of West Africa, slave parents might name their children after the day of the week on which they were born. Plantation records commonly show West African names like Cudjo (Monday) for boys or Cuba (Wednesday) for girls, evidence that slaves continued to honor their ancestral practices.

3.14 Slaves Dancing and Playing Banjo
 This image of slaves dancing in the slave quarters prominently features a banjo. The instrument was modeled on an instrument that was well known in Africa.

 What evidence exists for the persistence of African cultural traits among American slaves?

 Slaves also drew on African traditions in shaping distinctive music and dance forms, which provided an outlet for cultural expression. Using African techniques they constructed musical instruments, including drums and stringed instruments. Masters typically found African styles of dancing and singing exotic and alien to their European sensibilities. One British visitor to Maryland noted that on Sundays, the one day that masters generally allowed slaves to rest, blacks met “to amuse themselves with Dancing,” which was a “most violent exercise.” This rare colonial-era painting of slaves dancing not only illustrates the intensity of African-inspired dance but also shows the importance of an African-style instrument that would become a fixture in American music—the banjo (3.14). Music could serve ulterior purposes as well. Shortly after the Stono Rebellion, South Carolina banned drumming, fearing that slaves could drum and communicate secret messages from one plantation to another.

IMMIGRATION, REGIONAL ECONOMIES, AND INEQUALITY



Immigration, Regional
Economies, and Inequality
 Although distinctions of wealth emerged almost immediately in American society, especially in the cities, the relative abundance of land in the seventeenth century allowed many rural colonists to own their own land, a goal almost unattainable in Europe, where the aristocracy owned most land. Even in cities, those without a farmstead generally earned higher wages than they would have in Europe because labor commanded a higher price in the colonies, where skilled craftsmen were rarer. Although all of these facts contributed to the prosperity of the colonists, population growth (natural increase and immigration) and the dwindling availability of land became serious problems by the mid-eighteenth century. In the colonies’ expanding cities, the gulf between the rich and poor widened, and in rural areas young people faced the prospect that they might not be able to obtain land for their own farms.

Immigration to the Colonies


Regional Economies


 The population of British North America expanded rapidly in the eighteenth century. Between 1700 and 1750, the white population of the colonies rose from around 250,000 to more than a million. In contrast to America’s first predominantly English colonists who arrived in the early 1600s, eighteenth-century immigrants varied in national origin and ethnic identity. As chart (3.15) illustrates, the colonies attracted settlers from elsewhere in Britain, including Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Immigration from the European continent also included many Dutch and Germans. The decision to immigrate to America was a momentous one. The financial and personal costs of immigration could demand heavy sacrifices. The trans-Atlantic crossing, which could take four months, meant enduring cramped conditions on a ship with few amenities. Additionally, the cost of the trans-Atlantic passage was well beyond the yearly wages of the average Englishman and even more expensive for those from the European continent. To finance their passage, many immigrants, men and women alike, contracted to work as indentured servants. In exchange for having their passage paid, indentured servants agreed to work for a specified number of years, usually seven. In some cases the indenture system separated family members, with husband and wife indenturing themselves to different families.

 By the mid-eighteenth century, the British had settled the eastern seaboard, from Georgia to New Hampshire. Although each of the thirteen colonies functioned as its own separate political unit, historians have grouped the colonies into five regions— New England, the mid-Atlantic, the upper South, the lower South, and the back country—reflecting their unique histories, distinctive patterns of settlement, and diverse economies (3.16). Race, ethnicity, and religious composition also lent a distinctive quality to each of the major regions of colonial America.

 Which region of colonial America was the most culturally diverse?

IMMIGRATION, REGIONAL ECONOMIES, AND INEQUALITY

The Upper and Lower South
 The South was most closely tied to slave labor. Actually it was two distinct regions: the upper South, or Chesapeake Region, and the lower South, including parts of South Carolina and the Georgia low country (see 3.16). Each produced different cash crops and employed slave labor in different ways. Immigration into the two regions varied, and the ethnic composition of the upper and lower South was also different. Although more ethnically diverse than New England, the upper South, those areas of Virginia and Maryland tied to the Chesapeake, drew immigrants largely from England and Scotland. The planter elite who dominated this region built great fortunes from tobacco grown on plantations with slave labor. Many of the area’s wealthiest citizens were educated at the College of William and Mary (1693) in Virginia, the nation’s second-oldest college. The lower South was settled later than the Chesapeake, and it benefited more from the growth of immigration and was more religiously diverse than the upper South. In addition to Anglicans the region included Presbyterians, German Moravians, Baptists, and Quakers. The damp, hot climate of the low country bred diseases. To avoid these conditions, for much of the year, the wealthiest planters preferred their second

 homes in Charleston, which became a major cultural and economic center of the region. Nevertheless, Charleston lacked an educational institution comparable to William and Mary, so the wealthiest Carolinians typically headed to England for their education.

The Back Country

 This engraving of New York’s skyline lists a score of churches and one synagogue whose spires dominated the skyline of the colonial town.

 In the early seventeenth century, colonists had hugged the coastline. By the eighteenth century they began pushing westward to areas such as the interior of the Carolinas, and western Pennsylvania, and Virginia (see 3.16). Many new immigrants headed directly for the back country. The Scots-Irish were particularly attracted to the back country of Pennsylvania and the Carolinas, where they settled in large numbers. The back country lacked many of the refinements of the older, more settled regions of the colonies, leading travelers to compare back country colonists with Indians and describe both as savages. Whatever their similarities, relations between back country whites and Indians were generally strained. Rather than seek to trade with Indians and learn their ways, the Scots-Irish wanted to create farmsteads, which required displacing Indians. The simmering tensions between residents of the back

 country region and the local Indians erupted into violence throughout the eighteenth century. Back country settlers farmed, hunted, and raised livestock for their own consumption and local trade and were less connected to the burgeoning Atlantic economy. The economic realities of life in the back country encouraged independence and a strongly egalitarian culture. Courts were rare, and so were tax officials or other representatives of either the colonial or the British governments. A visitor to this region would also have noted a lack of churches, primary schools, and institutions of higher education.

 had more than 100,000 inhabitants by the mideighteenth century. But the growth rates of the cities of colonial British America were impressive. Boston, for example, doubled in size between 1700 and 1760. Larger towns, including Albany (New York), Newport (Rhode Island), and Baltimore (Maryland), became regional centers. Throughout these urban areas eighteenthcentury society became polarized along economic lines. The percentage of wealth owned by the richest Americans increased. In Boston and Philadelphia 5 percent of the population had amassed almost half of their city’s wealth by the last quarter of the eighteenth century. At the same time the number of the urban poor also rose dramatically in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. The graph (3.18) illustrates the dramatic climb in the amount of money Boston devoted to poor relief from the mid-century onward. During this same period many trades and crafts established their own mutual benefit societies to help the poor. The stark inequality between the lives of the destitute and those of Boston’s wealthiest merchants, who lived in fine new mansions and traveled around the city in elegant coaches, grew more pronounced, especially by the 1770s.

 Although most Americans lived in the countryside Land Becomes Scarce during the eighteenth century, cities were growing. 3.18 Poor Relief, Boston Poverty increased in colonial Boston in the late eighteenth century, as did the poor relief needed to deal with this problem.

 Philadelphia boasted 23,000 residents by 1760, making it the largest city in the colonies. Still America was far less urban than either Europe or the Spanish colonies to the south. Compared to London, with more than 700,000 people, Philadelphia was tiny, and Spanish America had half a dozen cities larger than Philadelphia. Mexico City, for example,

 How was American society becoming more unequal toward the end of the eighteenth century?



 By the mid-eighteenth century, many Americans living in the countryside or in small towns in most of the settled regions of the colonies confronted a scarcity of land. The problem Connecticut’s colonists faced illustrates the interconnected issues of population growth and land scarcity. Between 1720 and 1760, Connecticut’s population more than doubled, from 59,000 to 142,000. Beginning in the 1740s, children faced the prospect that their parents would not have enough land to help them establish their own farms when they became adults. Many sons and daughters delayed marriage until they could acquire a farmstead and establish their own independent household. Others moved to nearby towns. Many of Connecticut’s young adults went as far as northern New Hampshire, and others headed to the most western parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, or the Carolinas. Finally, some families simply postponed their dreams of independence, working as tenants on another farmer’s land as they struggled to save enough money to purchase their own farm.

WAR AND THE CONTEST OVER EMPIRE



 War and the Contest over Empire By mid-century, nearly 1.2 million people lived in the British mainland colonies, making it far more densely populated than New France, which numbered well under 100,000. Britain and France had been almost constantly at war since the late seventeenth century. Although these wars generally originated in Europe, control of North America became important to both nations. The British were keen to eliminate French influence in Canada and the Great Lakes. Eliminating France also appealed to American colonists, who viewed the rich agricultural lands controlled by France as a means of alleviating the land shortage they faced. The struggle between the British and the French for control of North America would dramatically alter the map of North America. The relatively small population of New France was spread across a vast territory, from Quebec in the north to New Orleans in the south, and as far west as Illinois (see map 3.19). In the Great Lakes region, French traders lived and worked among the Indians, often marrying Indian women. Unlike the British, who sought to displace the tribes and resettle the land with small farmers, the French developed a complex multiracial society that included Indians.

The Rise and Fall of
 the Middle Ground In 1600, more than two million Indians lived in communities east of the Mississippi River. Lacking immunity to diseases brought by the Europeans, Indian populations who came into contact with Europeans were extremely vulnerable to infection. Tribes east of the Mississippi were repeatedly devastated by epidemics that reduced their numbers to less than 250,000 by 1700. One response to this dramatic decrease in population was “mourning wars,” in which rival tribes raided each other’s villages and took prisoners to bolster their own populations. In these wars men were often tortured and executed, but women and children were typically adopted into the conquering tribes. Indians were also increasingly drawn into the trans-Atlantic economy, exchanging furs for European goods, including beads, fabric, alcohol, metal tools, and even firearms. The growing European demand for furs, and increased Indian desires for European goods, led to conflict among tribes for access to prime hunting and trapping grounds. Intertribal warfare changed as limited mourning wars evolved into “beaver wars,” in which tribes fought one another for control of territory. Further west in the Great Lakes region, France, not Britain, was the dominant power. Here the French and Indians created a middle ground, a

 cultural and geographical region in which Indians and the French negotiated with each other for goods, and neither side could impose its will on the other by force. Indians traded furs for guns, metal tools, and cloth. Although the French colonial government had hoped to regulate and tax this lucrative trade by establishing a series of forts, or outposts, young, fiercely independent French traders, known as coureurs des bois (“runners of the woods”), established their own trading networks beyond the direct control of the French government. Many married Indian women, producing children who became a distinctive group called métis, or people of mixed French and Indian descent. Familiar with both Indian and French customs, and fluent in both Indian languages and French, the métis became critical intermediaries between Indian and French cultures, even when the gulf was difficult to bridge. Like other European societies, French culture was patriarchal: Inheritance passed from father to son, a practice that gave fathers enormous power over their sons. Thus it was natural for the French to cast themselves as fathers to their Indian children in the Great Lakes region. Indians accepted the notion of the French as fathers, but they understood the concept of fatherhood in radically different terms than Europeans. In the Indian cultures of the middle ground region, fathers were not powerful patriarchs. Indeed, one chief tried in vain to explain

 What made the middle ground a distinctive region of colonial America?



 CHAPTER 3

GROWTH, SLAVERY, AND CONFLICT: COLONIAL AMERICA, 1710–1763

 “Go and see the forts our [French] Father has created, and you will see that the land beneath their walls is still hunting ground . . . whilst the English, on the contrary, no sooner get possession of a country than the game is forced to leave; the trees fall down before them, the earth becomes bare.” Contemporary Indian account of the French and English settlement, late eighteenth century to a French colonial official the different views of paternal authority in their respective cultures: “When you command, all the French obey and go to war. But I shall not be heeded and obeyed by my nation in such a manner.” Although a gulf continued to exist between the two cultures, intermarriage between French traders and Indian women nevertheless promoted cultural exchange and mutual understanding. The expansion of British settlement beyond the Appalachian Mountains threatened the middle ground created in the Great Lakes region. Rather than seek to preserve a middle ground, the British hoped to incorporate this region into their colonial empire. As had been true for so much of British colonization, the idea was to eliminate indigenous populations, transplant British agricultural practices, and establish permanent settlements.

The Struggle for
North America
 The great military powers of Atlantic Europe— Britain, France, and Spain—remained locked in a struggle for political supremacy. In 1739, European conflicts once more spilled over into North America when Britain again went to war, this time with Spain. British ships smuggled goods into Spanish America depriving Spain of valuable trade and tax revenues. Spain responded by capturing British ships, seizing their crews and cargos. British outrage over Spanish policy reached a critical moment when Captain Robert Jenkins testified before Parliament that after capturing his ship, the Spanish placed him in custody and cut off his ear as punishment for his alleged smuggling. Jenkins presented his ear in a pickle jar to an outraged Parliament. The resulting conflict between Britain and Spain was dubbed the War of Jenkins’ Ear (1739–1748).

 Why did British expansion threaten the middle ground?

 King George’s War (1744–1748), a conflict in which France joined with Spain against Britain and the American colonies, soon overshadowed the War of Jenkins’ Ear. The most important military victory from the colonists’ point of view occurred at Louisbourg where New England’s militias achieved a stunning triumph over the French and seized the mighty fortress on Cape Breton Island that guarded Atlantic access to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and French Canada. Although the fortress was returned to the French as part of the peace treaty ending the conflict, the victory became a source of colonial pride. The conflict between France and Britain occurred during a period when colonists were particularly eager to settle in the Ohio Valley, a region controlled by the French. The formation of the Ohio Company of Virginia in 1747 facilitated the exploration and settlement of this region, a development that prompted the French to solidify their hold on it by establishing a string of forts (3.19). The most important of these was Fort Duquesne, erected at a fork in the Ohio River at what is now Pittsburgh. In 1754, the royal governor of Virginia dispatched militiamen under the command of an ambitious young officer, George Washington, to seize the strategic fort. Overwhelmed by French and Indian warriors, Washington was forced to surrender. Washington’s defeat proved to be only the first skirmish in a protracted battle to control the Ohio territory. In 1755, the British dispatched General Edward Braddock with a larger force, comprising British regular troops and colonial volunteers, again including Washington, to take Fort Duquesne. The French and their Indian allies routed Braddock’s forces. Washington escaped, but Braddock was killed, and his troops suffered a 70 percent casualty rate. It was a shocking and ignominious defeat for the British and their colonial allies.

 The final phase of the great war for empire, the Seven Years War, what came to be known as the French and Indian War in the American colonies, lasted from 1756 to 1763. In England William Pitt, the ambitious secretary of state appointed by George II to oversee the war effort, believed that the balance of power in Europe hinged on control of America. In 1758, the British embarked on a bold new policy: to root out the French and make a direct assault on the strongholds of Quebec City and Montreal. Pitt promoted young, talented officers including Jeffery Amherst and James Wolfe to lead the campaign against Canada. An army of 10,000 regulars and a sizeable fleet were dispatched to North America. Defeating the French also meant taking on their Indian allies as well, so the conflict was known as the French and Indian War. The British suffered an early setback when the French General Louis de Montcalm seized Fort William Henry on Lake George in northern New York. Although Montcalm had negotiated a traditional surrender that allowed the British to retreat honorably, his Indian allies refused to accept these terms and sought scalps and other trophies of war. “The Massacre of Fort William Henry” alienated

 Montcalm from his Indian allies and stiffened the resolve of both the British and the colonists to defeat the French. British fortunes began to turn when Jeffery Amherst captured Louisbourg again in 1758. A year later British forces captured the city of Quebec. General Wolfe, the British commander, searched for a weakness in the city’s formidable defenses and finally settled on a daring attack. Wolfe approached the city from its poorly guarded rear flank. Rather than risk a frontal assault on the heavily fortified city, Wolfe’s men scaled the heights behind the city and overpowered the small detachment of troops guarding the cliffs. In the battle that followed, Wolfe and Montcalm were both killed. Pennsylvania painter Benjamin West commemorated the assault on Quebec in The Death of General Wolfe (1771) (3.20). West shows the dying general cradled in the arms of one of his officers. Contemporary viewers would have recognized this arrangement from European painting and sculpture: the Pieta, or the image of the dead Jesus sprawled across the Virgin Mary’s lap after the crucifixion. To heighten the drama in West’s painting, a British soldier runs toward the dying Wolfe with

 the news that the French have been defeated, while an American Indian, a symbol of the noble warrior, looks on respectfully in tribute to the heroism of the general. Next to the Indian warrior, West placed a figure whose clothes include elements of Indian and British dress. The figure, Sir William Johnson, played a vital role helping the British forge and preserve their alliances with Indians in the region. For more on Johnson’s role as a cultural and political mediator, see Competing Visions: Sir William Johnson and the Iroquois: Indian Visions versus British Arms. The other important population center in French Canada, Montreal, fell to the British in late 1760, ending French domination in Canada. In 1763, France and Britain signed the Treaty

 of Paris, permanently altering the map of North America. Quebec remained French culturally, but Britain now controlled Canada. Although the British had defeated the French in Canada, relations with Indians along the frontier, particularly in Ohio, remained tense. In 1762, the Indian revivalist prophet Neolin, developed a pan-Indian movement that rallied the tribes of the Midwest against British colonial expansion. A year later the Ottawa Indian chief, Pontiac, led a pan-Indian force against the British garrison at Fort Detroit. In what the colonists called Pontiac’s Rebellion, Indian peoples across the Midwest attacked weakly defended frontier garrisons in what is now Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio and settler communities in western Pennsylvania. Anger over the failure of the colonial

Competing Visions
SIR WILLIAM JOHNSON AND THE IROQUOIS: INDIAN VISIONS VERSUS BRITISH ARMS
In 1762, a delegation of Iroquois leaders met with the British Superintendent for Indian Affairs, Sir William Johnson, at his impressive residence, Johnson Hall, near Saratoga, New York. During the meeting an Onondaga Chief confronted Johnson, revealing a vision that a member of his tribe had received from the “Great Spirit” regarding English expansion into Indian lands. Johnson dismissed Indian visions, and he warned the tribes that Englishmen would not take such claims seriously and that English military power demonstrated that the “Great Spirit” favored the English. What does Johnson’s dismissive view of Indian religion reveal about Anglo-Indian relations? The Onondaga Chief testified to the assembled members of the Iroquois Council and Sir William Johnson about a recent vision to his tribe that revealed the Great Spirit’s displeasure with the British displacement of Indian peoples. The revelation contained a thinly veiled threat about the consequences of continuing this policy. 
 Johnson curtly told the members of the Iroquois Council that the British would not pay attention to Indian religious beliefs, which he dismissed as foolish superstitions. In response to the Onondaga’s oblique threat, Johnson reminded the Iroquois that British arms were superior to Indian weaponry and that resistance would not be tolerated.

Onondaga Chief:
Brother:


Sir William Johnson
Brethren:


 One of our People lately in a vision was told by the Great Spirit above, that when He first made the World. He gave this large Island to the Indians for their Use; at the same time He gave other Parts of the World beyond the great Waters to the rest of his creating, and gave them different languages: That He now saw the white People squabbling, and fighting for these Lands which He gave the Indians; and that in every Assembly, and Company of Governors, and Great Men. He heard nothing scarce spoke, or talk’d of, but claiming, and wanting, large Possessions in our Country. This He said was so contrary to his Intention, and what He expected would be the Consequence at the time when the white People first came, like Children among Us, that He was quite displeas’d and would, altho their Numbers were ever so great, punish them if They did not desist.

 Your romantic Notions, Custom of Dreaming, and Seeing visions, however, usual amongst you, cannot but appear in a very ridiculous Light to White People, who will consider it, only as a Scheme set on foot by some designing Persons to answer their Purposes; and I hope you cannot but be convinced that the Divine Being is satisfied with the Justice of Our Cause, from the great Successes with He has crowned the British Arms—I hope therefore, you will not Suspect us of defrauding you of your Lands.

 Sir William Johnson presented this certificate to the Iroquois for their loyalty to “his Britannic Majesty.” Diplomacy with Indians included many ceremonial exchanges such as the one depicted in the image at the top of this document.

 How did Johnson react to Indian demands that western expansion be halted?

 governments to protect them led to protests by western settlers. In Pennsylvania settlers from the frontier settlement of Paxton sought revenge by attacking friendly Indians and marching against the city of Philadelphia demanding the creation of a militia to fight Indians. The march of the “Paxton Boys” might have plunged Pennsylvania into widespread bloodshed, but violence was averted after leading Philadelphia citizens agreed to present the protesters’ grievances to the colonial assembly. (See Choices and Consequences: Quakers, Pacifism, and the Paxton Uprising, page 93.) The global struggle between Britain and France, the Seven Years War, not only transformed the political map of North America, it irrevocably altered the history of the region, establishing British supremacy once and for all. Colonists described this conflict as the French and Indian War for good reason. For colonists, British victory meant an end to French

 political influence in Canada and a reconfiguration of the balance of power in the vast region of the middle ground that had been a French sphere of influence for generations. Before the defeat of the French in Canada, western Indians could count on a reliable supply of arms and ammunition from Britain’s traditional rival, France. Without this vital support the panIndian alliance collapsed. Still Pontiac’s Rebellion persuaded the British to be conciliatory toward the more powerful tribes along the frontier. The peace treaty that was signed to end hostilities with Indians not only included favorable terms for trade but also placed severe restrictions on westward expansion by colonists. The Proclamation of 1763 (3.21) established a fixed line beyond which colonial expansion westward was prohibited, effectively restricting colonists to territory east of the Appalachian Mountains.

Choices and Consequences
QUAKERS, PACIFISM, AND THE PAXTON UPRISING
Relations between Pennsylvanians and Indians had deteriorated during the eighteenth century as the white population grew. Newcomers, such as the Scots-Irish who dominated the backcountry, began to challenge the Quakers’ political power. The violence associated with Pontiac’s Rebellion only exacerbated these tensions. Western settlers, including the Paxton Boys, petitioned the Quaker-dominated colonial assembly to pass a mandatory militia law and provide arms for western settlers. Quakers, however, were pacifists who continued to believe that it was possible to maintain peaceful relations with their Indian neighbors. Quakers in the assembly faced a difficult decision. 
Choices




 Support a mandatory militia law and create a well-regulated militia, properly trained and armed.



 Continue to oppose the creation of a well-regulated militia and seek peaceful non-violent solutions to Indian–settler conflicts.



 Resign from elected office, so that their pacifism would not prevent the assembly from creating a militia.

Decision
 The legislature chose to continue its pacifist policies.

Consequences
 Pennsylvania was the only colony without a militia law. This issue continued to spark controversy until the American Revolution. The 1776 Pennsylvania Constitution and Declaration of Rights not only created a militia, but it became the first state to expressly protect a right to bear arms.

Continuing
Controversies
 Why were Quakers so obstinately against creating a well-regulated militia? Scholars sympathetic to the plight of the protestors view their challenge to the Quaker government as an expression of the rising tide of democratic sentiment that helped bring about the American Revolution. For those more sympathetic to the Indians, the Quaker government’s policies were as exceptional as they were praiseworthy. Paxton Uprising cartoon

 CHAPTER 4

REVOLUTIONARY AMERICA: CHANGE AND TRANSFORMATION, 1764–1783

Tightening the Reins of Empire
 The British victory in the French and Indian War in 1763 secured North America against French attack. It also forced the British government to chart a new direction for dealing with America. A cornerstone of the new policy was the Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited settlement in lands west of the Appalachian Mountains (see Chapter 3). Having just fought an expensive war against the French, the British were keen to prevent colonists and Indians from starting a new war. Britain also felt a renewed urgency to raise funds to pay off the war debt and cover the costs of administering the colonies.

 Taxation without Representation In 1763, George Grenville, the new prime minister, ordered a detailed investigation of colonial revenues and was unhappy to discover that American customs’ duties produced less than £2,000 a year. The lucrative trade in molasses between British North America and the Caribbean islands alone should have yielded approximately £200,000 a year, apart from all of the other goods traded between North America and Britain, which should also have generated customs duties. To make the colonies pay their share of taxes, Grenville was determined to enforce existing laws and enact new taxes to bring in additional revenue. As the figures in Envisioning Evidence: A Comparison of Annual Per Capita Tax Rates in Britain and the Colonies in 1765 show, compared to the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland, the tax burden on the American colonists in the 1760s was low. Americans and Britons had come to view taxation differently and these different visions of the morality and legality of Britain’s new policies put the two on a collision course.

 “The very act of taxing exercised over those who are not represented appears to me to be depriving them of one of their most essential rights as freemen.” JAMES OTIS, The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved (1764)

 Why is the scale in the cartoon, The Great Financier, out of balance?

 The first step in Grenville’s new program was the Revenue Act (1764), popularly known as the Sugar Act. It lowered the duties colonists had to pay on molasses, but taxed sugar and other goods imported to the colonies and increased penalties for smuggling. It also created new ways for enforcing compliance with these laws. Violators could be prosecuted in British vice-admiralty courts, which operated without jury trials. For some Americans the Sugar Act violated two longheld beliefs: the idea that colonists could not be taxed without their consent and the equally sacred notion that Englishmen were entitled to a trial by a jury of their peers. The Massachusetts lawyer James Otis attacked the Sugar Act as a violation of the rights of Englishmen. Otis had already achieved notoriety for his opposition to the use of writs of assistance by customs officials. Otis insisted that under British law, a court could issue a search warrant only for a specific place where there was probable cause to suspect illegal activity. Rather than require that officials designate where they intended to search, the new general writs allowed customs officials to search any private property without first demonstrating probable cause or seeking the approval of a magistrate. In his pamphlet attacking the Sugar Act, The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved, Otis denied that the British had the authority to tax the colonists without their consent. But Otis stopped short of recommending active resistance to the Sugar Act. Instead he counseled patience, reminding his readers that we “must and ought to yield obedience to an act of Parliament, though erroneous, till repealed.” Whereas Americans viewed the new tax on sugar and other imports as a burden and a

A COMPARISON OF ANNUAL PER CAPITA TAX RATES IN BRITAIN AND THE COLONIES IN 1765*
Given the stridency of colonial opposition to British taxation, one might think that Americans were the most heavily taxed people in the British Empire. In fact, however, they were the least heavily taxed part of the empire. Americans were also generally wealthier than their countrymen across the Atlantic. American grievances were less about the levels of taxation than about the constitutional and political issues taxation raised. Policy makers in Britain had trouble understanding this distinction, which had profound consequences for relations with the colonies.

In British North America, wages and prices varied from colony to colony, but free white American males enjoyed a higher standard of living than comparable workers did in Britain. In 1760, a Philadelphia laborer earned just under £60 a year and a merchant £180.

 violation of their rights, for the British, the taxes were a modest imposition necessary to pay for the cost of eliminating the French from North America and administering the colonies. This political cartoon (4.1), which portrays Grenville holding a balance in which “debts” clearly outweigh “savings,” illustrates Britain’s financial predicament. The British cartoonist who drew it obviously sympathized with Americans. He shows a Native American “princess,” the most common symbol of the colonies in British cartoons, carrying a sack of money and bearing a heavy yoke around her neck. Inscribed on the yoke is the colonists’ complaint: “Taxed without representation.”

 How did colonists react to the Stamp Act?

4.2 Stamp Act
Protests
 This map shows the scope of opposition to the detested Stamp Act. Protest was most intense in the seaports.

The Stamp Act Crisis
 Britain reacted to the colonists’ resistance to the Sugar Act by imposing another, harsher tax, the Stamp Act, which required colonists to purchase special stamps and place them on everything from newspapers to playing cards. A similar tax existed in Britain, and Parliament believed that requiring colonists to pay such a tax at a lower rate than their brethren in Britain was entirely reasonable. Many colonists, however, rejected this notion. For them, taxation without consent was a violation of their rights. Opposition was most intense in the seaports; the map (4.2) shows how widespread anger against this latest tax was. Stamps had to be affixed to virtually all legal transactions and most printed documents, so the new tax act alienated more Americans than had any previous parliamentary tax. The British could hardly have picked a worse target for their new scheme of taxation. Among those most burdened by the tax were lawyers and printers, two of the most vocal and influential groups in the colonies. Protests against the Stamp Act filled colonial newspapers and produced a spate of pamphlets defending colonial rights. The Massachusetts House of Representatives called on other colonial assemblies to send delegates to New York to frame a response to the Stamp Act crisis. Nine of the thirteen colonies

TIGHTENING THE REINS OF EMPIRE

 sent a representative to the Stamp Act Congress, and although framed in respectful terms, the “Declaration of the Rights and Grievances of the Colonies” was an important step toward articulating a common response to British policy, forcing representatives from different colonies to work together for a common goal. Protest against this latest attack on American liberty was not limited to newspapers or legislative chambers. Opposition to the Stamp Act spilled out of doors into the streets of American cities and towns. Angry crowds attacked tax collectors and officials. In a few cases crowds also attacked the homes of British officials, including the home of the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, Thomas Hutchinson. George III dismissed George Grenville in 1765, leaving the task of responding to the American crisis to a young English nobleman, Charles Wentworth, Marquess of Rockingham, the new prime minister. Rockingham shepherded two key pieces of legislation through Parliament to deal with the crisis created by the Stamp Act. The Declaratory Act affirmed Parliament’s authority to “make laws and statutes” binding on the colonies “in all cases whatsoever.” The second piece of legislation repealed the hated Stamp Act. Britain believed that it had reasserted its authority over the colonies, while removing the main cause of colonial protest. British officials misjudged the reaction of colonists opposed to recent policy. For critics of British policy, it appeared that Parliament had embarked on a path that would lead inevitably to the destruction of the colonists’ liberty. Colonial politics had moved from the margins to the center of British politics. The issue of what to do about the colonies would define British politics for the next decade. In the colonies the conflict over British policy also transformed American politics, bringing to the fore a group of Patriots, aggressive supporters of American rights, including the Sons of Liberty, a group devoted to opposing British policy and defending American rights.

An Assault on Liberty
 The resolution of the Stamp Act crisis did not eliminate Britain’s pressing financial need for colonial revenue, nor did it reduce colonial determination to resist further efforts to tax Americans. What good will the repeal of the Stamp Act generated, Britain quickly squandered as it renewed



 its efforts to impose new taxes on the colonies. The Townshend Acts (1767), named for Charles Townshend, an ambitious British finance minister, levied new taxes on glass, paint, paper, and tea imported into the colonies. Townshend misinterpreted the Stamp Act protests. He believed that colonists opposed internal taxes targeted at commerce within the colonies, but that Americans would accept external taxes such as customs duties that affected trade between the colonies and other parts of the British Empire. Again, many Americans saw things differently. The Townshend Acts prompted Americans to clarify their views about taxation. Pennsylvania lawyer John Dickinson’s pamphlet Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania (1767–1768) was an important statement of American views. Dickinson disputed Parliament’s right to tax the colonists at all. Parliament could regulate trade among different parts of the empire, he acknowledged, but only the people’s representatives could enact taxes designed primarily to raise revenues. Since Americans had no representation in Parliament, that institution could not tax them. In response to the Townshend Acts, Americans began a nonimportation movement, an organized boycott against the purchase of any imported British goods. Women took an active role in the boycott, urging that instead of imported fabrics, Americans wear only clothes made from domestic homespun fabrics. The nonimportation movement offered American women a chance to contribute actively to the defense of American rights. It also raised women’s political consciousness. As thirteen-year-old, Anna Green Winslow, wrote in her journal regarding the decision to abandon imported fabrics, “I am (as we say) a daughter of liberty, I chuse to wear as much of our manufactory as possible.” Another import, tea, had become the basis of an important social ritual in colonial society. Amid the growing frustration with British policy, tea drinking took on new political significance. In 1774, Penelope Barker and a group of women in Edenton, North Carolina, organized a tea boycott. Word of the Edenton protest eventually reached England, where a British cartoonist lampooned its support for the American cause (4.3 on page 102). This satire casts the Edenton women as a motley assortment of hags and harlots, whose unfeminine actions and neglect of their proper duties as women demonstrate their lack of virtue. The tea boycott even inspired nine-year-old Susan Boudinot, the daughter of a wealthy Philadelphia family, to demonstrate her solidarity with the

 colonial cause in her own way. When invited to tea at the home of the royal governor of New Jersey, Susan curtsied respectfully, raised her teacup to her lips, and then tossed the contents out of a window. The new duties imposed by the British were only one part of a more aggressive policy toward the colonies. Between 1765 and 1768, the British transferred the bulk of their military forces in America from the frontier to the major seaports, sites of the most violent opposition to the Stamp Act. This increased the already tense situation in these localities. In 1768, the simmering tensions between colonists and the British government came to a head when British customs officials in Boston seized merchant John Hancock’s ship Liberty. Customs officials had long suspected Hancock of smuggling and thought that seizing the Liberty would give them the proof to prosecute him. The decision proved to be a serious blunder. The symbolic significance of the British assault on a ship named Liberty was not lost on Bostonians, who saw this as an assault on the idea of liberty itself. In response to the seizure of the Liberty, Bostonians rioted, driving customs officials from the town. To quell unrest in Boston, the British dispatched additional troops and warships to the area. By 1769, the British had stationed almost 4,000 troops, dubbed redcoats because of their red uniforms, in a city with a population of roughly 15,000.

 How does Revere stage the events of the Boston Massacre to evoke sympathy for the colonists’ cause?

 Relations between Bostonians and the occupying forces were tense. On March 5, 1770, a group of citizens taunted a patrol of soldiers and pelted them with snowballs. In the melee that followed, some of the soldiers fired on the crowd, killing five civilians. The Boston silversmith and engraver Paul Revere published a popular engraving of the Boston Massacre, as the confrontation came to be called, in which he portrayed the British as having deliberately fired on the unarmed crowd (4.4). Revere aligns the soldiers in a formal military pose, and portrays the commanders as giving an order to fire. When the soldiers responsible for the shootings were indicted for murder, John Adams, a vocal critic of British policy, volunteered to defend them. Adams sought to demonstrate to the British that the Americans were not a lawless mob, but a law-abiding people. A gifted lawyer, he secured acquittals for all those accused except for two soldiers, who were convicted of the lesser crime of manslaughter. The evidence presented at the trial revealed that Revere’s version of the event, while excellent propaganda, was not an accurate rendering of the circumstances. The new taxes and pressure for compliance had stiffened the colonists’ resistance. So although Parliament repealed most of the Townshend Acts in 1770, relations between the colonies and Britain remained strained. Colonists continued to demand the traditional rights of Englishmen, such as trial by jury, but American protests had moved in a new

4.4 Boston Massacre
 Paul Revere’s influential engraving of the Boston Massacre takes liberties with the facts to portray the British in the worst possible light.

 though it made tea cheaper, and merchants resented the monopoly it gave to the East India Company. Others saw the act as a subtle way of reasserting Britain’s right to tax the colonies. One group of angry colonists in Philadelphia, calling themselves The Tar and Feathering Committee, warned that they would tar and feather any ship’s captain who landed with British tea. The British found the colonists’ actions thuggish. In this hostile British cartoon, Bostonians Pay the Excise-Man (4.5), a cruel-looking bunch of colonists force a British customs official, covered in tar and feathers, to drink tea until he becomes sick. A form of public humiliation, tarring and feathering involved pouring hot tar onto the victim’s skin and then attaching a coat of feathers. Scraping off the resulting mess was painful and laborious.

 direction, including the view that taxation without representation was a violation of fundamental rights. Resistance to British policy was also becoming more organized. The Sons of Liberty, created during the Stamp Act crisis, continued their criticism and intensified their efforts to coordinate and enforce protests against Parliament's policies. After the repeal of the Townshend Acts, Americans enjoyed a brief respite from Parliament’s attentions, as Britain turned its focus elsewhere in its far-flung empire, especially to India. However, colonists soon faced another effort to tax them.

The Intolerable Acts and
 the First Continental Congress In 1773, Parliament decided to help the flagging East India Company increase its tea sales to the colonies. Many members of Parliament had sizable investments in the company. The new law lowered the price of tea to Americans, but kept the tax on tea, and also gave the East India Company a monopoly on the tea trade with the colonies. Again, British authorities miscalculated American reactions. Colonists resented the new law, even Why did British policy seem to strike at the essence of colonists’ liberty?

4.6 The Able Doctor,
 or America Swallowing the Bitter Draught Paul Revere’s engraving presents America as a partially clad Indian princess. Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, a symbol of British law, holds America down. The prime minister, Lord North, shown with a copy of the Boston Port Bill, one of the Intolerable Acts, protruding from his pocket, forces tea down her throat.

 The most dramatic response to the tea act occurred in December 1773, when Bostonians, dressed as Indians, boarded a British ship and tossed over 340 chests of tea into the harbor in what came to be known as the Boston Tea Party. To punish the colonists responsible for this act of what the British considered vandalism, Parliament passed the Coercive Acts, known to colonists as the Intolerable Acts. This legislation closed the Port of Boston, annulled the Massachusetts colonial charter, dissolved or severely restricted that colony’s political institutions, and allowed the British to quarter (house) troops in private homes. (A generation later Americans adopted the Third Amendment to the Bill of Rights, which forbade quartering troops in civilian homes, a direct response to this detested British practice.) The acts also allowed British officials charged with capital crimes to be tried outside the colonies. Some colonists called the last provision the “Murder Act,” since they feared it would allow soldiers charged with murder to avoid prosecution. Americans were divided over how to respond to the Intolerable Acts. Some saw the Bostonians who dumped tea into the harbor as radicals whose actions besmirched Americans’ reputation as lawabiding subjects of the king. Others expressed outrage at the British policy that had forced Bostonians

 What is the symbolic significance Lord Chief Justice Mansfield’s actions in this political cartoon?

 to resort to such a dramatic protest. This cartoon, The Able Doctor, Or America Swallowing the Bitter Draught (4.6), gives a different view of Bostonians from the lawless ruffians depicted in Bostonians Paying the Excise-Man (4.5). Here the British prime minister, Lord North, brutally accosts America, a half-clad Indian princess, forcing tea down her throat, while Lord Chief Justice Lord Mansfield, the symbol of British law, pins her arms down. The most important consequence of the Intolerable Acts was the decision by the colonies to convene a Continental Congress in Philadelphia in late 1774. All the colonies except Georgia sent representatives. Among the colonial leaders who attended were Patrick Henry, John Adams, and George Washington. Congress endorsed the Resolves of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, which denounced the Intolerable Acts and asserted the intention of colonists to nullify such a manifest violation of their “rights and liberties.” The Congress also recommended that every town, county, and city create a committee to enforce the boycott of British goods. The informal network of committees that had opposed British policy now acquired a quasi-legal status from Congress. Although many Americans hoped that a peaceful solution to the deepening crisis was possible, in March 1774, the brilliant Virginia orator Patrick Henry urged his fellow delegates in the

TIGHTENING THE REINS OF EMPIRE

 Virginia legislature to prepare for the inevitable conflict that loomed between the colonies and Britain. Although no contemporaneous copy of his dramatic speech exists, Henry’s words were recounted many years later, assuming almost legendary status in American culture. In response to British assaults, Henry declared, “Give me liberty—or give me death!” Between the passage of the Sugar Act in 1764 and the meeting of the First Continental Congress in 1774, relations between Britain and America had steadily deteriorated. As the chart (4.7) shows, Britain had tried various revenue measures to raise funds from the colonies. Americans, however, remained opposed to taxation without representation. Rather than subdue the colonies, British policy only strengthened the resolve of Americans to defend their rights.



Lexington, Concord,
 and Lord Dunmore’s Proclamation Living on the edge of the British Empire, colonists had come to depend on their own militias as their primary means of public defense. The laws of the individual colonies regulated these organizations of citizen soldiers. During the colonial period the militia was more than just a force available to protect the colonists from hostile Indians or attacks from the French or Spanish. In an era before police forces, the militia also helped enforce public order, putting down riots, rebellions, and other civil disturbances. In January 1775, Virginia’s George Mason called on the colonists to put their militia in good order.

REVOLUTIONARY AMERICA: CHANGE AND TRANSFORMATION, 1764–1783

 “If we view the whole of the conduct of the [British] ministry and parliament, I do not see how any one can doubt but that there is a settled fix’d plan for inslaving the colonies, or bringing them under arbitrary government. ” Connecticut Minister, the Reverend EBENEZER BALDWIN, 1774

 Mason declared that “a well regulated Militia, composed of gentlemen freeholders, and other free-man, is the natural strength and only stable security of a free Government.” The British, too, understood the importance of the militia to colonial resistance. Not only did they pose a military threat, but they were also indispensable to helping mobilize Americans and organizing their opposition to British policy. Disarming the militias became a priority for the British. Their first target was Massachusetts, which had become a hotbed of resistance; the British dispatched troops to Concord in April 1775 to seize gunpowder and other military supplies. Paul Revere, an outspoken member of the Sons of Liberty, was charged with riding from Boston to Lexington and Concord to warn citizens that British troops were on the march. Revere got as far as Lexington before a British patrol captured him. Fortunately for Revere he had already encountered another member of the Sons of Liberty that night, Dr. Samuel Prescott, who was returning from the home of his fiancée. Prescott agreed to carry word that British troops were marching from Boston. The alarm spread throughout the countryside. When the 700 British regulars finally arrived at Lexington’s town green, they faced 60–70 militiamen. Although the militia agreed to disperse, someone, it is not clear who, fired a shot, and the two sides exchanged fire. The Battle of Lexington marked the first military conflict between Britain and America, and the colonists had demonstrated their mettle. The British then marched to Concord, where they confronted a larger and better organized militia detachment at the North Bridge. The militia stood their ground and exchanged fire with the British

 Why did British regulars choose Concord as their military objective?

 regulars, who were forced to retreat. While the British retreated back to Boston, colonial reinforcements poured into Concord and the surrounding countryside. The British column was an easy target for militiamen, who took up positions along the roadside and in the adjacent woods. A Rhode Island newspaper captured the views of Patriots when it commented that British aggression marked the start of a “War which shall hereafter fill an important page in history.” Although the British had mounted a direct assault on the Massachusetts militia, they opted for a stealthier plan for disarming the Virginia militia. Under cover of darkness a detachment of Royal Marines entered Virginia’s capital of Williamsburg, seized the gun powder, and destroyed the firing mechanisms on the muskets stored in the militia’s magazine (storehouse). When citizens of Williamsburg learned of the assault, they marched on the governor’s mansion to protest. As word of the British raid spread through the colony, militia led by Patrick Henry planned to march on Williamsburg. Lord Dunmore, the royal governor, warned that if the militia entered Williamsburg he would “declare freedom to slaves and reduce the city of Williamsburg to ashes.” At the last moment a compromise was worked out, and the governor made restitution for the stolen powder and damaged guns. Still Dunmore’s threat to free Virginia’s slaves had shocked the colony. Two weeks later colonists learned of Lord Dunmore’s Proclamation. Dunmore offered freedom to any slave who joined the British forces in putting down the American rebellion. Within a month 300 slaves had joined “Dunmore’s Ethiopian Regiment,” whose ranks would swell to 800 or more. The uniforms of this unit included a sash emblazoned with the motto “Liberty To Slaves.” Virginians complained that the British were “using every Art to seduce the Negroes,” while others viewed Dunmore’s decision as “diabolical.” Many Virginians who were wavering on the issue of American independence now concluded that a break with Britain was inevitable, even desirable. Some Virginians recognized that Virginia’s slaves were seeking the same liberty that colonists claimed. For example Lund Washington, who managed his cousin George’s Mount Vernon estate, including his slaves, observed that “there is not a man of them but would leave us, if they could make their escape.”

PATRIOTS VERSUS LOYALISTS



 Patriots versus Loyalists By 1775, the rift between Britain and the colonies had grown precipitously large. Indeed, it was not just colonists who believed that if Britain continued on its present course it would end in disaster. A satirical British cartoon, The Political Cartoon for the Year 1775 (4.8), published in London, vividly captured this view. It depicts King George III riding in a coach heading straight over a cliff. Lord Chief Justice Mansfield holds the reins of the carriage of state, which rides roughshod over the Magna Carta—a legal text closely linked with the Rights of Englishmen—and the British Constitution, another symbol of liberty. The cartoonist’s symbolism suggested a view that was becoming increasingly popular in the colonies: Americans could no longer expect the political and legal system of Britain to protect their liberty. Although some Americans were persuaded that Britain was intent on trampling their liberty, other colonists remained loyal to the crown. For Patriots it was becoming increasingly clear that they could no longer count on the legal protections that had safeguarded their liberty for generations. Loyalists, by contrast, disputed this claim. For those loyal to George III, liberty could be maintained only by upholding English law. Loyalists viewed Patriots’ actions as lawlessness, not affirmations of liberty.

The Battle of Bunker Hill
 Two months after Lexington and Concord, the two sides clashed again in Charlestown, across the Charles River from Boston. American forces had dug in at Bunker Hill and nearby Breed’s Hill, prepared to hold off the British in Boston. The main fighting actually took place at Breed’s Hill, which was closer to the harbor. The British underestimated the colonists’ resolve to hold their ground. Although the British took Bunker and Breed’s Hills, they had purchased their victory at a steep cost in dead and wounded. Even more important, Americans had shown the British that

 they were not the “untrained rabble” the British had portrayed and that they could become a formidable fighting force. The painter John Trumbull immortalized the battle in his painting The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill. For a discussion of this painting and how it reflected the realities of a battle in which neither side won a clear victor, see Images as History: Trumbull’s The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill (page 108). Despite the armed confrontations at Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill, the Continental Congress had not abandoned hope of reconciliation with King George III. In July 1775, Congress drafted the

TRUMBULL’S THE DEATH OF GENERAL WARREN AT THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL
American John Trumbull’s painting The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill (1786), painted eleven years after the battle, captured an important moment in the American war for independence. Like Benjamin West’s The Death of General Wolfe (see page 90),Trumbull’s painting depicts the heroic death of a military figure, but the two paintings differ in a number of fascinating ways. While The Death of General Wolfe portrayed a clear victory for the British, The Death of General Warren showed a more complex event in which neither side was completely victorious.While the Americans lost the battle, they proved themselves an effective fighting force and exacted a high price from the British for their victory. How did Trumbull’s composition reflect the realities of this battle, a struggle in which neither side won a clear victory? Trumbull’spainting The Death of General Warren was part of a series of paintings he began to commemorate the “great events of our country’s revolution.” The artist intended to use his painting as the basis for a set of engravings that he could sell as cheap prints to a popular market on both sides of the Atlantic. With this in mind Trumbull captured the chaotic horror of a battle scene in which both armies displayed heroism and nobility. The American General Warren lies mortally wounded, cradled in the arms of one of his troops, in the same pose in which Benjamin West portrayed British General Wolfe. One element of the painting meant to appeal to British viewers is the depiction of British Major John Small in the center ofthe composition near Warren. Small stays the hand of one of his infantryman poised to bayonet the dying Warren. By placing these two noble gestures—Warren’s sacrifice and Small’s humanitarian intervention—at the center of the painting, Trumbull shifts attention away from the actual outcome of the battle to the idea that virtuous men on both sides performed noble deeds. This 
 decision enhanced the moral complexity of the events while also making it and later engravings based on it attractive to British and American customers— effectively doubling the size of his potential market. Trumbull’s canvas also advanced the democratization of art begun by Benjamin West. In this painting virtue resides neither in one nation nor in any particular class of men. Trumbull portrays a broad range of soldiers heroically— from a gentlemanly British officer to a barefoot colonial soldier. Indeed Abigail Adams, an outspoken supporter of American independence and the wife of the prominent politician John Adams, noted that Trumbull “teaches mankind that it is not rank nor titles, but character alone, which interests posterity.” Trumbull all but ignored African Americans, consigning the two he did include to minor roles in the painting. Trumbull described the African American standing in the lower right corner behind an injured colonial The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill

 officer as a “faithful negro.”At least fourteen African Americans were among the troops defending Breeds Hill and Bunker Hill. The African American Peter Salem played an important role in the actual battle, perhaps firing the shot that killed Major Pitcairn, the British figure collapsing near the center of the painting. The painting’s slighting of that role probably

 reflected Trumbull’s own racial ideas and those of his audience, who were not used to seeing African Americans depicted in anything but a subservient role. For the moment the democratization of art was restricted to those of European descent. African Americans’ treatment in American art mirrored their marginalization in the larger society.

 Trumbull highlights the idea of virtue and honor as universal values by showing a British officer preventing a soldier from bayoneting the dying Warren.

 “Olive Branch” petition, asking George III to intervene on their behalf. The king rejected the American appeal. With that rejection the time for reconciliation passed, and the supporters of American independence in the Continental Congress gained momentum. The push for independence opened a division within colonial society between colonists who supported independence and those who remained loyal to the British.

Common Sense and the
Declaration of Independence
 In January 1776, Thomas Paine, a recent immigrant to America from England, wrote a pamphlet that argued forcefully for American independence. In Common Sense, Paine not only attacked recent British policy, he framed a stinging indictment of monarchy and defended a democratic theory of representative government. After stating the “simple facts, plain arguments, and common sense” of the matter, Paine concluded that separation from Britain was the only action that made sense for America. Paine’s work was printed in a cheap format that allowed artisans, farmers, and others with little money to purchase a copy. He wrote in plain, forceful prose, avoiding literary and classical allusions that would have required knowledge of Latin. The book was a phenomenal publishing success. Common Sense did more than simply fuel Americans’ desire for independence; it helped change the framework in which Americans thought about politics itself. Before Paine’s pamphlet most Americans, even those who believed that reconciliation with Britain was impossible, still maintained a respectful attitude toward George III. Most Americans had grown up in a culture that venerated constitutional monarchy, but Paine’s savage critique of this institution had a liberating impact. Paine called monarchy “ridiculous.” After demonstrating that history proved that monarchy was incompatible with liberty, Paine turned to the current British monarch George III, whom he equated with savagery itself. He denounced the king for his assaults on American liberty, noting that “even brutes do not devour their young.” Those who supported reconciliation with Britain found Paine’s scathing attacks on George III appalling. Paine also gave a voice to many who wished to radically transform American political life. He was unabashedly democratic at a time when many, including those most eager to separate from Britain, viewed democracy as a danger to be avoided What arguments did Paine’s Common Sense present?

 at all cost. Common Sense became a blueprint for those who wished to experiment with democratic government, although not everyone who ardently supported American independence appreciated Paine’s ideas.

 “There is something absurd in supposing a Continent to be perpetually governed by an island.” THOMAS PAINE, Common Sense 1776

 In July 1775, a month after Congress drafted the “Olive Branch Petition,” pleading with George III to abandon the “cruel” policies of his ministers and “such statutes” as “immediately distress” the colonists, the king declared that the American colonists were “in open and avowed rebellion.” The Prohibitory Act, which the British Parliament enacted into law in December 1775, banned all trade with the thirteen colonies. Word of the ban arrived in America in February 1776. Coming on the heels of Paine’s indictment of British tyranny, the policy further inflamed American resentments against Britain. After the adoption of the Prohibitory Act, support for independence gained ground. In May Congress instructed the individual colonies “to adopt such Government as shall, in the Opinion of the Representatives of the People, best conduce to the Happiness and Safety of their Constituents.” Congress added a preamble five days later that affirmed “the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed.” Although Congress had not formally declared independence, it had effectively asserted that the colonies had become independent states no longer under the authority of Parliament or the king. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia introduced a resolution that “these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states.” Congress then debated the Lee resolution and on June 11, 1776, appointed a committee to draft a formal declaration of independence. With John Adams (Massachusetts) as its chair, the committee included Robert Livingston (New York), Thomas Jefferson (Virginia), Read the Document Thomas Paine, Common Sense

PATRIOTS VERSUS LOYALISTS

Roger Sherman (Connecticut), and Benjamin
 Franklin (Pennsylvania). Adams designated Jefferson to take the lead in drafting the formal resolution. On June 28, the committee presented the congressional delegates with the draft. Congress cut about a quarter of the text and made some other revisions to the document. On July 4, 1776, Congress approved the final text of the Declaration of Independence, a public defense of America’s decision to declare independence from Britain that was to be printed and sent to the individual states. Copies of the declaration were then widely distributed. Thomas Jefferson admitted that his text reflected the “sentiments of the day, whether expressed in conversation or letters, printed essays.” The introductory paragraph explained the reasons for separating from Britain. The second paragraph provided a powerful defense of the liberty and



 equality and affirmed that “all men are created Equal” and therefore entitled to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” A long list of grievances against George III took up the bulk of the text. Printed as a single broadside, the indented list of charges against George III was immediately recognizable (4.9). The drafters of the Declaration of Independence aimed it at both a domestic and a foreign audience. It made the case for independence to the American people and announced to the British government the reasons for taking up arms. The declaration also sought to help American diplomacy. If America were to fight the most powerful nation on earth, it would need help from other European powers, such as Holland, Spain, and especially of Britain’s long-time rival, France. Because a powerful monarch then ruled France, the declaration refrained from using the inflammatory antimonarchical rhetoric favored by Thomas Paine in Common Sense. George III’s misdeeds, not monarchy itself, were to blame for America’s demand for independence.

The Plight of
 the Loyalists The division between Patriots, colonists who supported American independence, and Loyalists, those wishing to remain loyal to the king, drove a deep wedge in colonial society. John Adams speculated that Americans were evenly divided among Patriots, Loyalists, and those striving to remain neutral. Although it is difficult to establish hard figures for how colonists divided over

4.10 Magna
Britannia Her
Colonies Reduced
 This image created by Benjamin Franklin plays on the dismemberment of the empire as fatal to both the colonies and the mother country. Franklin used this image early in America’s opposition to British policy. Loyalists later used the dismemberment metaphor to persuade Americans to oppose independence.

 independence, historians estimate that Patriots constituted about 40 percent of the white population, neutrals another 40 percent, and Loyalists probably about 20 percent. Many prominent Loyalists had opposed British policy toward the colonies, but refused to accept the decision for independence. Minister Samuel Seabury captured the view of many Loyalists when he wrote: “To talk of a colony independent of the mothercountry, is no better sense than to talk of a limb independent of the body to which it belongs.” The image of the dismemberment of the empire was a powerful one in the minds of colonials and Britons alike. In the 1760s, supporters of American rights had used such images to persuade Britain to change its policy toward the colonies. At the time Benjamin Franklin was a colonial lobbyist in London, working to repeal British taxes. He designed an engraving, Magna Britannia Her Colonies Reduced, to appeal to Parliament, evoking the horror of a possible separation between the colonists and the mother country (4.10).

 How did the metaphor of dismemberment influence Loyalist thought?

 Seabury’s reassertion of the horrors that would follow from the dismemberment of the empire tapped into powerful fears and anxieties among Americans unsure about independence. Loyalists suffered hardships during the struggle for independence. In some places where Patriot feelings were strongest, individuals could be ostracized for refusing to support the Patriot cause. Legal disabilities were also imposed on individuals who refused to take a loyalty oath, including exclusion from service on juries and disarmament. Many states passed laws seizing Loyalist property. A complicated issue arising from these laws was how to deal with women married to Loyalists. Some women brought property from their own family into their marriage. Was this property also liable to confiscation? The story of Grace Growden Galloway illustrates the rapid reversal of fortune that could befall anyone who opposed the Patriots’ side in the American Revolution. See Choices and Consequences: A Loyalist Wife’s Dilemma. The Loyalist cause appealed to many Americans, not just wealthy men and women like Grace and Joseph Galloway. New York boasted a sizeable Loyalist population, as did parts of the backcountry in the Carolinas. Some religious sects, particularly groups such as the Quakers who were pacifists, opposed the violence of war. Beginning with Lord Dunmore’s Proclamation, many slaves had sensed that a British victory, not independence, offered them the best chance for freedom. As many as 100,000 slaves freed themselves by running away during the dislocation created by the war.

Choices and Consequences
A LOYALIST WIFE’S DILEMMA
Before the struggle for independence, Grace Growden Galloway stood at the apex of Philadelphia society. Her husband, Joseph Galloway, was wealthy and influential in Pennsylvania politics. Throughout the escalating conflict with Britain, Joseph Galloway supported reconciliation, and when war broke out, he became a Loyalist. Realizing that he could no longer count on the goodwill of his former friends and neighbors to protect him, Galloway and his daughter fled Philadelphia—perhaps the most ardent Patriot city outside New England—for British-controlled New York in 1776. The government of Pennsylvania confiscated Galloway’s property, but Grace Galloway was determined to protect the property she had inherited from her own family and had brought into her marriage. She faced a difficult set of choices concerning her property: 
Choices




 Follow her husband and daughter into exile, accepting that neither she nor her husband would probably ever recover their property.

Continuing
Controversies
 What does Grace Growden Galloway’s plight reveal about the situation of Loyalists during the American Revolution? The legal status of the property of a woman married to a Loyalist was complicated. This issue came before American courts in Martin v. Commonwealth (1805). Building on a new conception of women as independent political actors, Massachusetts claimed that a woman’s choice to stay or flee was hers alone. The Massachusetts high court, however, disagreed with this new view of women’s legal autonomy. The court held that the woman’s decision to leave the state had been her husband’s, not her own, and therefore the state did not have the right to seize her land. Although a defeat for women’s rights, the outcome of the case would have certainly pleased Grace Growden Galloway.



 Follow her husband and daughter into exile and use every legal means available to prevent the confiscation of her own property and fight an uphill battle to protect it from afar.



Stay in Philadelphia and use
 every legal option to protect the properties that she had brought into her marriage.

Decision
 Grace chose to stay and fight. She hoped that by remaining in her home she could avoid eviction. She also concluded that the chances of defending her own property against confiscation would be easier if she stayed in Philadelphia.

Consequences
 Grace endured great hardship while defending her rights but was ultimately evicted. Snubbed and shunned by many of her former friends and acquaintances, and driven from her home, she lived in a modest set of rented rooms. In her diary Grace recounts her struggles and the indignities she suffered, including the time she “saw My own Chariot standing at my door for the Use of others while I am forced to Walk.” She never rejoined her family and died alone in 1781. Although evicted from her home, she was more successful at protecting the property she had brought into the marriage, which eventually passed on to her descendents.

 CHAPTER 4

REVOLUTIONARY AMERICA: CHANGE AND TRANSFORMATION, 1764–1783

America at War
 The British had reason to be confident when they contemplated their military advantages over the colonies at the start of the war. Britain’s navy was the most powerful in the world and its army was formidable. The population of the British Isles was more than four times greater than that of the colonies. America began the war with only a citizen’s militia. Fighting a powerful army meant that America would have to create a professional force. Congress appointed George Washington the commander of the new Continental Army. Although Britain’s population was much larger than that of the colonies, the relative size of the two armies in the field was not that lopsided. At the start of the conflict British General Howe enjoyed something like a two to one advantage over General Washington. Numbers alone do not tell the whole story. British supply lines were stretched thin and American forces were supplemented by militia forces which not only increased the size of the Patriot forces, but forced the British to deal with fighting both a conventional army and a nonconventional one as well. Even if the British were able to defeat the American armed forces in the field and gain control of America’s cities, conquering and pacifying all thirteen colonies would be virtually impossible. The British also never grasped that they were fighting a new type of war: not a struggle against another European power, but a battle against a decentralized independence movement.

The War in the North
 Stiff resistance at Breed’s Hill and Bunker Hill had convinced the British military that the colonial militias were not an undisciplined rabble that would retreat if confronted by a well-trained professional army. The creation of a Continental Army under

 To place any dependance upon Militia, is, assuredly, resting upon a broken staff . . . . Men accustomed to unbounded freedom, and no controul, cannot brook the Restraint which is indispensably necessary to the good order and Government of an Army; without which, licentiousness, and every kind of disorder triumphantly reign. To bring Men to a proper degree of Subordination, is not the work of a day, a Month or even a year GEORGE WASHINGTON to the President of Congress, September 24, 1776

 the leadership of George Washington underscored this fact and led the British to change their tactics. Rather than employing the army to subdue a rebel population, the British prepared for a sustained military conflict. Realizing that Patriot sympathies in New England were strong, the British retreated to New York, a colony with many Loyalists. New York not only provided a safer base of operations, but the British also believed that if they could hold New York they would cut New England off from the rest of America. Although determined to defend New York, Washington suffered a major defeat at Brooklyn Heights in August 1776. Washington then retreated to Manhattan, but British Major General Sir William Howe soon drove the Americans from New York. Retreating south through New Jersey, Washington eventually crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. During the winter, however, Washington’s ranks dwindled as many militiamen returned home. These citizen soldiers had repulsed the immediate threat. They would also protect the countryside and prevent Loyalist pockets from forming outside of British-controlled territory, but they were ill suited to sustained battle. Washington lamented their unpredictable coming and going: “come in, you cannot tell how” and “go, you cannot tell when, and act you cannot tell where.” The militia’s lack of discipline

 Why did Washington have Paine’s The American Crisis read to the troops before he crossed the Delaware to attack British and German mercenaries?

AMERICA AT WAR



 “The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot, will in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it NOW deserves the love and thanks of men and women.” THOMAS PAINE, The American Crisis (1776)

 and long-term commitment to fight was a constant source of frustration to Washington and American military leaders. Still the militia remained vital, contributing both to the military and political success of the war effort. Believing that he had decisively defeated Washington, an overconfident Howe established his base camp in New York City and planned to enjoy the winter holidays. Realizing that America desperately needed a victory, Washington launched a surprise attack on Christmas night 1776. He ordered that Thomas Paine’s inspirational essay The American Crisis be read to his troops. Paine enjoined Americans not to abandon hope. Leading his soldiers across the partially frozen Delaware River under cover of darkness, Washington overwhelmed an outpost manned by German mercenaries at Trenton. A week later, Washington won another daring victory at Princeton. Howe had squandered his advantage and allowed Washington to regroup and score two important victories. Washington shrewdly abandoned his early strategy of fighting a conventional war. He now realized that his primary goal was to wear down his opponents and avoid a decisive defeat. Such a strategy played to America’s natural advantages and would eventually force the British to accept that they could not conquer America. To commemorate Washington’s victory at Princeton, the trustees of Princeton College commissioned the eminent American painter Charles Wilson Peale to paint Washington at the Battle of Princeton (4.11). The portrait replaced a painting of George III, damaged during the battle when a cannonball removed the king’s head. British strategy shifted in 1777. Howe decided to make more effective use of British naval power.

 A key element of this plan was a coordinated effort to capture American cities, including the rebellion’s political center, Philadelphia, which fell in September. The British also sought to isolate ardently Patriot New England from the rest of the nation.

British army under General John Burgoyne marched south from Canada. Burgoyne hoped to join forces with Howe moving up the Hudson River from New York City. But Howe moved against Philadelphia instead, and an American force under General Horatio Gates defeated Burgoyne at Saratoga, in upstate New York (4.12). In addition to providing Americans with an important victory and morale boost, the British defeat at Saratoga persuaded the French to commit troops and naval forces to aid the colonists. Despite this impressive victory, the Americans had failed to retake Philadelphia, and the beleaguered Continental Army took up quarters at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania in the winter of 1777–1778.

 The active entry of France in March 1778 changed the dynamics of the conflict. Rather than simply providing money and munitions, France was now at war with Britain and committed to helping America win independence. In 1778, France and America signed a treaty promising to fight until American independence was secured. Spain soon joined France as an opponent of Britain and attacked British outposts in the Mississippi valley and Florida. Within two years Britain declared war on Holland, which had become an important source of supplies for the American war effort. The great Western European powers were now at war.

 Although the British scored impressive victories in the South in 1780, especially at Charleston and Savannah, American forces recovered and forced Cornwallis to move to Virginia in 1781. This proved to be a strategic error, since it allowed the French fleet to cut off Cornwallis and enabled Washington to trap the British at Yorktown.

 mushroomed into a global conflict involving the Mediterranean, Africa, India, and the Caribbean. France attacked Britain’s wealthy Caribbean sugar islands and captured some of them. In the Mediterranean a joint French and Spanish force besieged the British fortress of Gibraltar. Britain had to divert resources from North America to protect these possessions. Fighting a war on multiple fronts drained British resources.

The Southern Campaigns and
Final Victory at Yorktown
 In 1779–1780, the British shifted their attention to the South where there was considerable Loyalist sympathy. They also saw the South, with its cash

 crops of tobacco, indigo, and rice, as more valuable economically than the North. Initially the British strategy seemed to pay off. In 1780, British troops scored impressive victories at Savannah (Georgia), Charleston (South Carolina), and Camden (South Carolina). But they could not consolidate their power in the region. The colonial militias harassed Loyalists and sustained the Patriot cause. The British were especially vulnerable to hit-and-run operations by commanders such as South Carolina’s Francis Marion. Nicknamed the “Swamp Fox,” Marion would attack out of nowhere and then disappear into the swamps before the British could retaliate. The war in the South changed dramatically in 1781 when General Daniel Morgan defeated the British forces at Cowpens (South Carolina). American forces also inflicted heavy losses on the British at Guilford Court House (North Carolina). Although the British still controlled Savannah and Charleston, the British commander, Lord Cornwallis, then moved to Virginia and established a well-fortified base at Yorktown in the winter of 1781 (4.13). Cornwallis’s retreat to Yorktown proved to be a strategic blunder for the British that Washington turned to America’s advantage. Before Saratoga,

 the large French navy had not played a significant part in the war, and America’s own small navy was no match for the superior British fleet. With their naval superiority the British were confident that establishing a base at Yorktown made sense. With the guns of the British navy at their disposal, and new supplies coming from New York and London, Yorktown seemed like a strategic location to regroup. But things went awry for the British when, early in the fall of 1781, the French dispatched a formidable fleet under the command of Admiral Paul de Grasse from the Caribbean to North America. With the arrival of the French navy, the balance of power at sea shifted, giving the Americans a naval advantage. Washington seized the opportunity, asking the large French army in the North under the Comte de Rochambeau to join American troops in an assault on Yorktown. When de Grasse’s fleet forced a British squadron that was supposed to help

 Cornwallis to withdraw, the Americans and French trapped him in Yorktown. Although French support was indispensable, this fanciful French image of the victory at Yorktown, portrays this historic moment as though the Americans hardly figured in it (4.14). Outnumbered and with his land and sea escapes cut off, Cornwallis surrendered in October 1781. Washington then appointed General Benjamin Lincoln to receive the British surrender, offered by a subordinate of Cornwallis. The British defeat at Yorktown provided American diplomats with a strong bargaining position in negotiating a peace treaty with Britain. The Treaty of Paris (1783) officially ended the war between the newly created United States and Britain. The treaty recognized American independence, acknowledged America’s border with Canada, and recognized American fishing rights off Newfoundland.

THE RADICALISM OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION



The Radicalism of
 the American Revolution The American Revolution encompassed two interrelated struggles. The Revolution was both a colonial war for independence and a revolutionary struggle to change American government and society. Thus the war was both a struggle for home rule—the right of Americans to govern themselves— and a war for who should rule at home, a contest to determine the nature of American government and the structure of society. The American Revolution set in motion a social and political transformation that affected nearly every aspect of American society. The Declaration of Independence had articulated the twin ideals of equality and liberty. Some Americans took the Declaration’s bold affirmation of liberty and equality to be an endorsement of more than colonial independence. For them these words were revolutionary. The Declaration inspired them to undertake a radical transformation of American politics and society. The first constitutions drafted by the states in 1776 included language that echoed the Declaration’s affirmation of liberty and equality. Few Americans doubted the importance of this affirmation; how far to take it, however, proved controversial. The Pennsylvania Constitution went further than any other state constitution in embracing a democratic conception of equality—at least for white men. Not every group in America benefited equally from the promise of the Revolution. African slaves, Indians, and women were either excluded from or not included fully in the Revolution’s promise of equality and liberty. Although the promise of the Revolution remained unfilled for many in America, oppressed groups throughout American history would use it to seek the full rights of citizenship.

Popular Politics in the
Revolutionary Era
 British taxation was not the only set of policies that produced violent resistance during the Revolutionary era. Colonists also opposed unfair taxes imposed by their own colonial governments. The colonial elites who dominated government also came under attack. In the Carolinas, a movement sought reform of colonial government. The Regulators, as their name implied, sought to regulate society by eliminating corruption and bringing the rule of law to places that lacked it. The Regulators resented planters and merchants who lived near the coast and were eager to tax western farmers, but were not willing to share political power with them. Thus in backcountry North Carolina, Regulators opposed taxes, including those enacted to pay for a lavish new palace for the royal governor. Some Regulators, such as Herman Husband, combined religious themes with democratic ideas to attack corruption and inequality in North Carolina. Husband fused his religious rhetoric with

 a class-conscious critique of the eastern elites who dominated state politics. He noted that “obedience to just laws, and subjection to slavery” were not the same. Resistance to unjust authority was legitimate because “God gave all men a knowledge of their privileges, and a true zeal to maintain them.” In contrast with Husband’s views, the royal governor and his supporters among the clergy asserted that “subjection to lawful authority,” not resistance, was the “plain and principal doctrine of Christianity.” In 1770, 1,000 Regulators marched on the courthouse in Hillsborough. The protesters not only shut down the court but also publicly whipped a court official who was notorious for charging excessive fees to process legal documents. The angry crowd also punished lawyers whose high fees angered backcountry residents. Such fees fell heavily on poor folk and blocked their access to the courts. The protests prompted the governor to dispatch the militia, which defeated the Regulators and restored order. Although the Regulators were not victorious, their class-conscious rhetoric and critique of power and corruption resonated in the Carolina backcountry. Who were the Regulators?

REVOLUTIONARY AMERICA: CHANGE AND TRANSFORMATION, 1764–1783

Constitutional Experiments:
Testing the Limits
 of Democracy When the Continental Congress directed the states to draft new constitutions, they became laboratories for constitutional experimentation. Different visions of constitutional government were set against one another in this vibrant public debate. Virginia broke new ground by framing a detailed Declaration of Rights that became a model for other states. By contrast virtually every other state apart from Vermont rejected Pennsylvania’s radical democratic experiment. Massachusetts, like Virginia, also became a model for other states, pioneering constitutional developments that became essential features of American constitutionalism, particularly in the separation of powers and checks and balances between the different branches of government. In June 1776, the new state of Virginia drafted a Declaration of Rights and a Constitution. The chief architect of the Declaration of Rights was George Mason, an influential Patriot leader. The Declaration

 What made Pennsylvania’s Constitution so radical for its day?

 asserted that life, liberty, and property were fundamental rights and that “all men are by nature equally free and independent.” Some Virginians worried that this language might encourage slaves to revolt. Another delegate calmed these fears by pointing out that the militia would be more than adequate to protect Virginia from its slaves. Indeed, the Declaration of Rights also affirmed “That a well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided as dangerous to liberty; and that, in all cases, the military should be under strict subordination to, and be governed by, the civil power.” The Declaration also protected other basic liberties: trial by jury, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion. Pennsylvania drafted its constitution not long after Virginia’s. While members of a slave-owning planter elite drafted Virginia’s Declaration of Rights and Constitution, a more democratic coalition that included urban artisans influenced by the ideas of Thomas Paine and backcountry farmers resentful of the old eastern colonial elites, and similar to the Regulators, drafted Pennsylvania’s constitution. Echoing Paine’s Common Sense, the Pennsylvania Constitution created a form of representative government with a single legislature, a system known as unicameralism. Responding to the frustration of frontier settlers, who had sought the creation of a state militia to protect them from Indian attack, and the necessities of fighting Britain, the Pennsylvania Constitution also created a citizens’ militia and became the first state constitution to expressly protect the right of citizens to bear arms “in defense of themselves and the state.” In keeping with Paine’s democratic ideas, the constitution rejected property requirements for voting. Any male taxpayer who resided in the state for a year could vote. Timothy Matlack, who had helped write this radical constitution, commissioned a portrait that reflected its diverse influences (4.15). A powder horn and musket appear in the background. The Pennsylvania Constitution and important British legal texts rest on the table behind him. The Revolution prompted a public debate over how far to take the idea of democracy. Although Pennsylvania went further than most in implementing these ideas, similar debates occurred in the press in other states. The traditional Whig theory of representation assumed that only property owners could exercise the independent judgment necessary to vote. Individuals without property would be at the mercy of the rich and powerful who could influence their votes on election day. Whig theory also viewed

THE RADICALISM OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION

 the possession of property as an essential way of demonstrating that one had a permanent stake in society. According to the Whigs only men with such an interest could act in the long-term interests of society. The Revolution nurtured a far more democratic vision of government. The anonymous author of the pamphlet The People the Best Governors asserted that “the people know best their own wants and necessities, and therefore are best able to rule themselves.” According to this view, a propertied elite was not needed to act as a check on the people. Those who rejected the radical notion of equality implicit in democracy ridiculed the new, more democratic theories. The Reverend Charles Bullman of South Carolina, for example, suggested that if these ideas were not checked, “Every silly clown and illiterate mechanic will take upon him to censure the conduct of his Prince or Governor.” Among the Patriot elite no figure expressed greater reservations about the dangers of too much democracy, and of unicameralism, than John Adams who reluctantly conceded that Paine had helped rally Americans to the idea of independence, but also feared that Paine’s work had “a better hand at pulling down than building” up governments. Indeed, Adams worried that Paine’s “feeble” ideas about government would mislead Americans when the time came to draft new state constitutions. Adams incorporated his own views on the matter into his short, but influential Thoughts on Government, which he wrote in response to a request from North Carolina’s Provincial Congress, the body responsible for framing its new constitution. Most states were unwilling to follow Pennsylvania’s radical model, opting to retain a property requirement for voting and office holding. In general, however, the new property requirements the states adopted were lower than they had been during the colonial period, so on balance, the pool of eligible voters increased. Although not a resounding victory for those who shared the democratic views of Thomas Paine and the author of The People the Best Government, the Revolution clearly led to a greater democratization of politics. Although not the most democratic experiment in government, the Massachusetts Constitution produced interesting innovations. John Adams played a leading role in helping to draft it. Adopted in 1780, it remains the oldest continuously functioning written constitution in the world. Setting the terms for nearly all subsequent constitution-making in America, Massachusetts took revolutionary-era constitutional ideas in new directions. Massachusetts saw a constitution as the supreme law that had to rest on the express consent of the people. Legislative bodies



 had drafted earlier state constitutions, but a special convention drafted the Massachusetts constitution, which it then submitted directly to the people for ratification. Massachusetts also took the unprecedented step of eliminating property requirements for this special ratification process. Thus even those white men who would not meet the property requirements for voting for the legislature under the proposed constitution could vote on the Constitution. The notion that a constitution had to be submitted to the people directly for ratification was a radical innovation that quickly JOHN ADAMS to James Sullivan, became an accepted May 1776 feature of American constitutional life. The Massachusetts Constitution was also the first to implement an effective system of checks and balances. While all the early state governments supported the principle of separation of powers, making the powers of the legislative, executive, and judicial functions of government distinct, these constitutions had not built in the checks and balances that would make this ideal a practical reality. To make separation of powers effective, the different branches of government had to be able to check one another’s power. Massachusetts went further than any other state in achieving this goal. The Massachusetts governor had considerable power, including the right to veto acts of the legislature. This enabled the executive to check the legislature. The legislature could check the governor through its ability to override a veto by a two-thirds vote. Finally, Massachusetts made the governor an office directly elected by the people, not appointed by the legislature as many other states had opted to do. Another important experiment in constitutional government was the Articles of Confederation, the constitution that Congress framed for the new United States of America. Although Congress drafted the Articles in 1777, the states did not ratify them for another four years. The Articles did not create a national government, but rather “a firm league of friendship” among the sovereign states. Thus Article II affirmed that “Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to the United

 “Shall We Say, that every Individual of the Community, old and young, male and female, as well as rich and poor, must consent, expressly to every Act of Legislation?”

 Why did the traditional Whig view of representation oppose democracy?



 CHAPTER 4

 States, in Congress assembled.” Because fighting the British was the top priority, Congress cobbled together the Articles of Confederation without providing many features that the individual states had included in their constitutions. Fear of British-style government also shaped the minds of Congress. Having just cast off a powerful central government with a king, the Articles abandoned the idea of a single unified executive to enforce the law. Nor did Congress have the power to tax, another power that the British had abused. The Articles created a weak government whose ability to raise revenue, engage in military actions, and conduct diplomacy depended entirely on the goodwill of the states.

African Americans
Struggle for Freedom
 The great English literary figure Dr. Samuel Johnson pointed out the hypocrisy of Americans claiming to be champions of liberty while enslaving Africans. Some slaves invoked the ideas of the Revolution explicitly, whereas others voted with their feet and freed themselves. The dislocations associated with America’s Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON, 1775 war for independence provided opportunities for African Americans to escape bondage. For some, fleeing to the British provided the best chance for freedom. Other slaves seized on the ideas nurtured by the broader revolutionary changes that accompanied the war for independence. The ideas of liberty and equality intensified the burgeoning movement for the abolition of slavery. Although the Revolution did not eradicate slavery, it did put it on the road to extinction in New England and the mid-Atlantic regions. Slaves, eager to cast off their own shackles, appropriated the Revolution’s language of liberty. During the Stamp Act protests in South Carolina (1765), slaves staged their own parade chanting “liberty.” White South Carolinians viewed such activities as evidence of a plan for rebellion. To thwart the imagined threat, they mobilized the militia, which also served as slave patrols. Blacks in New England fared better when they invoked the Revolution’s ideals than did blacks in the South. In 1773, 1774, and 1777, slaves petitioned the government of Massachusetts for their freedom using the language of the Declaration of Independence, including the idea of natural rights and the notion that government rested

 on the consent of the governed. They asserted: “We have in common with all other men a naturel right to our freedoms without Being depriv’d of them by our fellow men.” Less than a decade later, another slave, Mum Bett, successfully sued for her freedom. A jury in western Massachusetts based its verdict on the language of the state’s Declaration of Rights, which stated that “All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties.” Mum Bett changed her name to Elizabeth Freeman, worked as a housekeeper for the lawyer who defended her, and became a respected midwife and nurse. Citing this precedent, the state’s highest court abolished slavery in Massachusetts in the 1780s. New England went further than any other region in its support for the abolition of slavery. Vermont’s 1777 Constitution expressly prohibited slavery, the first constitution in the nation to take such a step. In the mid-Atlantic, Pennsylvania and New York adopted gradual emancipation laws.

The American Revolution
 in Indian Country The struggle between Britain and the American colonies had enormous consequences for American Indians. Although neutrality appealed to many Indians, avoiding entanglement in the conflict between Britain and America became impossible. Faced with the need to make a choice, many Indian nations sided with Britain, whose colonial policies, including the Proclamation of 1763, had blocked American westward expansion. An American victory would mean more settlers streaming into Indian country and destruction of the habitats that Indians depended on for their survival. The Declaration of Independence had underscored America’s deep-seated fear and hostility toward Indians. Among the complaints Jefferson leveled against the king was: “He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.” Jefferson’s description of Indians as “savages” engaged in acts of barbarism rallied Americans against the British. One event that whipped up anti-Indian feelings among Americans was the murder of Jane McCrea

THE RADICALISM OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION

 in upstate New York by Mohawk Indians. Jane was traveling to meet her fiancé, a British soldier, when proBritish Mohawks attacked her. McCrea’s political sympathies did not prevent her from becoming a martyr for the Patriot cause. Colonial newspapers lamented her fate, which was also memorialized in poetry. In 1780, a novel about her demise appeared, and the painter John Trumbull made several sketches of McCrea’s murder for a possible painting before moving on to other projects. Joel Barlow, a close friend of Jefferson and important literary figure in early America, memorialized the event in one of his poems, and John Vanderlyn portrayed the event in this dramatic painting (4.16), which was displayed in 1804. Vanderlyn’s representation of the light-skinned McCrea and the dark-skinned Indians underscores the role of the painting as a morality tale between good and evil. The Indians are depicted as cruel savages about to murder McCrea. Pro-British tribes scored notable victories on the western frontier during 1782. After these successes, many Indians were stunned to learn that the British had surrendered at Yorktown. Indians were excluded from the negotiations that ended the war. Many viewed the Treaty of Paris (1783), which ceded Indian country between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River to America, as a betrayal.

 and virtuous American Patriots, whose names, Brutus and Honestus, signified their commitment to ancient Roman republican virtue. Women also served in the war effort. When mustered into service, the militia often depended on support from women. An eyewitness to such a mobilization in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1774 noted that women “surpassed the Men for Eagerness & Spirit in the Defense of Liberty by Arms.” Women not only provided moral support, “animating their Husbands & Sons to fight for their liberties,” but also helped “making Cartridges.” Some women became “Molly Pitchers,” who hauled water and carried supplies to soldiers. Deborah Sampson, disguised herself as a man and served in the Continental Army. A physician discovered Sampson while treating her for fever. The Continental Army also had camp followers—women, including the wives of soldiers, who washed, cooked, nursed, and tended to other needs of soldiers. The Revolution’s emphasis on liberty and equality boosted notions of gender equality. Abigail Adams, wife of John Adams, demanded that her husband “remember the ladies” and work toward greater legal equality for women (see Competing

 Liberty’s Daughters: Women and the Revolutionary Movement Women took an active role in the revolutionary cause. One of the most outspoken female Patriots was Mercy Otis Warren, wife of Patriot leader James Warren and sister of James Otis. Warren’s gifts as a poet, playwright, and eventually historian allowed her to champion the American cause in literary endeavors. Her satirical plays mocked British policy and leading British politicians and military figures. The fictional names of the characters in her plays communicated Warren’s disdain for the British. Her scathing satire mocked the actions of General Hateall, Secretary of State Dupe, and Governor Rapatio. These sinister plotters against American liberty were matched by talented

 4.18 (right) Cadwalader Family Charles Wilson Peale’s portrait of the Cadwalader family evokes the ideal of companionate marriage, in which husbands and wives enjoyed an intimate and egalitarian relationship within marriage.

 Visions: Remember the Ladies). A few women even demanded a measure of political equality, at least for women who owned property. One supporter of this idea was Hannah Corbin, sister of Patriot leader Richard Henry Lee. While Abigail Adams was a model of female propriety, Corbin’s unconventional lifestyle made her acutely aware of the inferior legal status of women. After her husband died at age 35, Corbin managed their plantation. Her husband’s will stipulated that if she ever remarried, Corbin would lose control of the estate. Corbin was unwilling to accept the choice of remaining a widow or losing control of her property. Rejecting contemporary moral codes, she began a common-law relationship with another man (living together as husband and wife without being legally married). The fact that they were not legally married allowed her to preserve control of her estate. The defiant and independent Corbin later asked her brother why women who owned property were prohibited from voting. Lee could provide no reasonable response. He even conceded that in theory, allowing such women to vote was plausible, but noted that “it has never been the practice either here or in England” and speculated that “Perhaps ‘twas thought rather out of character for women to press into those tumultuous assemblages of men.” Every state, except New Jersey, limited suffrage to men. It is not clear if New Jersey’s omission was deliberate or accidental. Still New Jersey women who fulfilled the state’s property requirements took full advantage of this omission and voted in elections until the state legislature revoked this right in 1807.

 Was Hannah Corbin’s argument for women’s suffrage consistent with Whig theory?

 Although the Revolution did not usher in the legal or political changes sought by Adams and Corbin, the ideas of equality espoused by the Revolution did influence marriage and family life. Lucy Knox, wife of General Henry Knox, told her husband a year after the Declaration of Independence to “not consider yourself as commander in chief of your own house,” but recognize that “there is such a thing as equal command.” She viewed marriage as an egalitarian relationship between husband and wife in which the two lived together as companions. Scholars describe this as companionate marriage. The Revolution not only altered ideas about marriage but also changed attitudes about patriarchal authority, a fact reflected in the portraiture of the day. These changes are evident if one compares the pre-revolutionary-era painting of the Winslow Family (4.17) and the Revolutionaryera portrait of the Cadwalader Family (4.18). In his painting of the Cadwalader family, Charles Wilson Peale gives a model of a companionate marriage. A comparison of the portraits shows how ideas of family relations, including the relationship between husband and wife, and parents and children, had changed. In Peale’s painting John and Elizabeth Cadwalader look directly at one another. His hand rests on hers, and their young child reaches for the peach held by her father. The intimacy of the family is evidenced in the physical closeness of its members. By contrast the portrait of the Winslow family reveals little of this closeness. The husband has no physical contact with his wife or his children.

REMEMBER THE LADIES A
strong supporter of independence, and an articulate and forceful personality, Abigail Adams believed that the American Revolution provided an opportunity for women to gain much-needed legal reform. This was particularly needed in property law, where women were considered legally dead once they married. In this spirited letter written shortly before Congress declared independence from Britain, Abigail made her displeasure with the inferior legal status of women clear to her husband. 
 In a dismissive reply, Adams nevertheless revealed how the Revolution’s ideas about equality permeated American society.

Abigail Adams to John Adams, 31 Mar. 1776
 I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we are determined to foment a Rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation.

John Adams to Abigail Adams, 14 Apr. 1776
 As to your extraordinary Code of Laws, I cannot but laugh. We have been told that our Struggle has loosened the bands of Government every where. That Children and Apprentices were disobedient—that schools and Colleges were grown turbulent—that Indians slighted their Guardians and Negroes grew insolent to their Masters. But your Letter was the first Intimation that another Tribe more numerous and powerful than all the rest were grown discontented.— This is rather too coarse a Compliment but you are so saucy, I wont blot it out. Depend upon it, We know better than to repeal our Masculine systems.

A
Virtuous Republic Creating a Workable Government,
1783–1789
 In 1776, Patriot leader John Adams wrote that “public virtue is the only foundation of Republics. There must be a positive passion for the public good, the public interest.” Adams echoed many Americans’ views when he wrote that republican government depended on the concept of civic virtue, which meant pursuing the public good and placing it ahead of personal interest or local attachments. Men were expected to serve in the militia, sit on juries, and, if they were truly virtuous and wise, take on the burden of public service as elected representatives. Women, too, were expected to play a major role in the political life of the new republic, assuming the role of republican mothers and wives who would instill patriotism and virtue in their children and spouses. Americans of the revolutionary generation took their cues from the lessons of history, particularly the example of the Roman Republic and its ideal of public virtue. When Dr. Joseph Warren, physician and Patriot leader, addressed Bostonians on the fifth anniversary of the Boston Massacre in 1775, he literally donned a Roman toga, the long flowing gown that symbolized a free, adult Roman man’s freedom and citizenship. Warren’s dramatic gesture, linking himself with Roman republicanism, was mirrored in the pages of nearly every American newspaper of the day, where letters and essays on political matters were signed with pen names drawn from the history of the Roman Republic, such as the senators Brutus and Cato and the general Cincinnatus. To mold a new generation of virtuous citizens, Americans looked to education, religion, and even architecture. No American was more enthusiastic about architecture’s capacity to instruct than Thomas Jefferson. Public buildings, Jefferson wrote, “should be more than things of beauty and convenience, above all they should state a creed.” Rather than emulate contemporary Georgian-style buildings such as the Pennsylvania State House (see Chapter 3), where the Declaration of Independence was drafted, Jefferson argued for a return to the “purity” of Roman architecture. In his design for the Virginia State Capitol (pictured here), Jefferson recreated the simple beauty of Roman architecture. He believed that the Capitol would inspire citizens to emulate the ideals of the ancient Roman Republic, which included an emphasis on civic participation and public virtue. In the decade following independence, Americans’ faith in their ability to create a virtuous republic was challenged. An aborted coup led by disgruntled Continental Army officers, conflicts between debtors and creditors, and an uprising in western Massachusetts drove the nation to a political crisis. The postwar period tested America’s faith in republicanism and led some leaders to abandon traditional republican theory, with its emphasis on virtue, and to embrace a new approach to constitutional government that relied on a balance of conflicting interests and a system of checks and balances. The culmination of this struggle between the two competing visions of constitutional government was the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

 “We may look up to Armies for our Defense, but Virtue is our best Security. It is not possible that any State should long remain free, where Virtue is not supremely honored.” SAMUEL ADAMS, 1775





 CHAPTER 5

A VIRTUOUS REPUBLIC: CREATING A WORKABLE GOVERNMENT,1783–1789

Republicanism and
 the Politics of Virtue The American Revolution marked a decisive break from ideas and values that had defined British culture for centuries. Monarchy and aristocracy were swept away. America was now a republic. Republicanism placed a premium on the ideal of virtue. As the poet, playwright, and historian Mercy Otis Warren observed, Americans needed “to cherish true, genuine republican virtue.” The postwar period would test this commitment in a host of ways.

George Washington:
The American Cincinnatus
 No individual in America was more closely identified with the ideal of virtue than George Washington. A symbol of the virtuous citizen–soldier, responding to the summons of his nation and retiring to private life once his service was no longer needed—Washington was a model of civic virtue. His reputation for public virtue and ability to command the respect of his troops had helped the beleaguered Continental Army during some of its more dire campaigns. In 1783, Washington faced a different challenge. This time it was not the threat of enemy troops, but the rumors of a military coup by the Continental Army’s officers. Washington wielded his personal authority to win over disgruntled members of the corps and made an impassioned appeal to “reason and virtue,” crushing the revolt without firing a shot. Washington had learned of rumors that the army’s leadership would no longer tolerate Congress’s failure to deal with complaints about their pay and pensions. An anonymous essay had circulated among officers suggesting that the time might soon come to turn their arms against Congress itself. The officers’ anger had been simmering for some time. Frustration with the Confederation Congress was widespread; Washington was well aware of the officers’ grievances. He had complained about the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of Congress on many occasions. With no power to tax, Congress had to depend on voluntary contributions from the states. Without reliable revenue, it was difficult to wage war or conduct the routine business of governing. Faced with a possible rebellion by his own officers, Washington resolved to

 address his men in person and persuade them of the folly of their plan. On a dark wintry day in March 1783, Washington traveled to Newburgh, New York, to address the officer corps. The assembled officers met in a makeshift building that some of them had dubbed the “Temple of Virtue.” Washington prepared to read a letter that he hoped would persuade the officers that their demands would be met. Fumbling to find a pair of glasses he had recently acquired, he paused, and then addressed the hushed crowd: “Gentlemen, you must pardon me. I have grown grey in your service, and now find myself growing blind.” The impact on his audience was dramatic. “There was something so natural, so unaffected in his appeal,” Major Samuel Shaw later wrote, “as rendered it superior to the most studied oratory, and you might see sensibility moisten every eye.” Washington’s own wartime sacrifices had already provided a powerful role model for the officer corps. Now the figure of their beloved commander growing gray and blind in the service of his country struck a resonant chord. He exhorted his men to give posterity “proof of unexampled patriotism and patient virtue.” Civic virtue had triumphed over corruption, and the Newburgh conspiracy was crushed without a shot being fired. Another event that enhanced Washington’s reputation as the embodiment of republican virtue was the public ceremony of turning over his military commission to Congress after the war. In Annapolis, Maryland, where Congress was convened, Washington addressed a room crowded with congressional delegates and a gallery packed with well-wishers. “Having now finished the work assigned me,” he informed his audience, many of whom were brought to tears, “I here offer my commission, and take

 my leave” of “the employments of public life.” By abandoning public life and returning to his plow, Washington was seen as placing the good of the nation ahead of personal glory. In the public’s view, Washington had transformed himself into the modern Cincinnatus, an allusion to the ancient world’s great symbol of public virtue, the Roman general Cincinnatus. After serving the Roman Republic as its supreme commander, Cincinnatus had returned to his farm. After resigning, Washington went on a triumphal tour of the nation. In Philadelphia, he was saluted by cannons and ringing bells from the city’s steeples. He sat for portraits by America’s leading painters and enjoyed listening to commemorative verses that compared him to Cincinnatus. Well schooled in the history of the ancient Roman Republic, Americans understood that a popular military leader’s decision to emulate Rome’s dictatorial



 general Julius Caesar rather than Cincinnatus would lead to despotism. Years later the Virginia legislature commissioned the French sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon to create a life-sized statue of Washington as the modern Cincinnatus (5.1). Washington stands before a plow, the symbol of the virtuous farmer, the ideal embodied by Cincinnatus.

 “No free Government, or the blessing of liberty, can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue . . .” Virginia Declaration of Rights, 1776

The Politics of Virtue:
 Views from the States The republican emphasis on virtue suffused American culture. The first state constitutions drafted after independence used their declarations of rights to outline the rights of citizens and also instruct citizens in the premises of republican government. In these declarations of rights, the ideal of virtue was literally written into American law. The Virginia Declaration of Rights (1776) asserted that free government could not survive without a virtuous citizenry, a point echoed by the Massachusetts Constitution four years later. Educating citizens in the importance of republican ideals became a priority for the new nation. Art, architecture, and even fashion were pressed into service to mold the character of a new generation of citizens. Jefferson’s design for the new Virginia Capitol was the most ambitious visible symbol of instilling republican values by reforming architecture. (See the chapter opening image, p. 129.) The impact of the Revolution was even seen in home furnishings. Before the Revolution, decorative elements on American furniture copied British fashions, including fanciful designs such as the scrolled pediment with rosettes on this chest of drawers

 symbols that represented the republican values of the new nation replaced some of these purely decorative elements. A beautifully crafted example of this adorns a chest of drawers made in Salem, Massachusetts (5.3). The broken pediment is a simple classical design. Gone is the fancy carving in the pediment of the late colonial chest (5.2). In its place is the goddess of liberty herself. To reinforce the ideal of Roman republicanism, the chest has two classical columns. These flank another set of carvings that illustrate the prosperity that republicanism will bring to the new nation. Education was another means of inculcating virtue. The Massachusetts Constitution expressly linked republicanism, virtue, and education. The state achieved this by providing public primary education for boys and girls. Several of the larger towns also provided secondary education for boys. Thomas Jefferson framed the most ambitious proposal to create a public system of education in 1778. In “A Bill for the more General Diffusion of Knowledge,” he proposed

 that Virginia adopt a publicly funded system of education. White children, including boys and girls, would be educated at public expense for three years. The best male students would then be selected for secondary education, and a small select group from among this cohort would later attend the College of William and Mary. Jefferson introduced his bill in the state legislature several times, although it never passed. Jefferson’s faith in education reflected his debt to the ideals of the Enlightenment, the international philosophical movement based on the notion that reason and science would improve humanity. (See Chapter 3.) Following the English philosopher John Locke, Enlightenment thinkers believed that people were born a blank slate upon which society could write its own moral code. Many American Founders, including Jefferson, were also influenced by other Enlightenment ideas. Philosophers of the Enlightenment believed that humans had an innate moral sense, akin to the five physical senses. In the same way that people see different shades of the color spectrum, so the moral sense helped people see the difference between right and wrong. One need only cultivate this inborn sense to produce enlightened citizens. Taken together, Lockean psychology and Enlightenment moral theory led many Americans to put enormous faith in education’s ability to shape morality and mold character. Inspired by Enlightenment ideals about education and the American Revolution’s faith in representative government, Americans founded new educational institutions to help create an enlightened citizenry. Ezra Stiles, the president of Yale College, wrote in 1786 that “the spirit for Academy making is vigorous.” The charter for one of these new academies in North Carolina declared that “the good education of youth has the most direct tendency to promote the virtue, increase the wealth and extend the fame of any people.” North Carolina was one of the states that founded a university. Georgia and Vermont also established public institutions of higher education. Among the new private colleges were Williams (Massachusetts), Transylvania (Kentucky), the College of Charleston (South Carolina), and Bowdoin (Maine). Educators also published new republican materials to instruct children in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Spellers and readers included patriotic lessons with illustrations that reinforced their republican message. In a book of alphabet rhymes, for example, the bald eagle from the Great Seal of

 America, the new nation’s official symbol, represented the letter “E” (5.4). The design of the great seal had gone through many versions before Congress finally approved one that included an American eagle clutching an olive branch and thirteen arrows, symbolizing the new government’s power to make war and negotiate peace. The thirteen states are represented by the same number of stars, stripes, and arrows. Charles Thomson, the secretary of Congress, observed that the eagle bore a shield to symbolize that “the United States ought to rely on their own Virtue.” The expansion of education opened up possibilities for white women. Whereas Jefferson’s plan for educational reform called for basic education for women, other reformers recommended more ambitious plans to educate the nation’s female population. Jefferson’s friend, the eminent Philadelphia physician Benjamin Rush, offered a robust statement of the importance of education in a republic, but also framed a bold call to educate women for their role as republican citizens. Women needed to be familiar with the political ideas of republicanism. As the mothers of future citizens of the republic, women had a special role to play. Rush was not alone in championing female education. The Philadelphia Young Ladies Academy (1787) was typical of the new institutions for educating women. In addition to music, dance, and needlework, these new schools taught girls subjects, such as rhetoric, oratory, and history, once exclusively taught to boys. Martha Ryan, a student at one of the new schools in North Carolina, inscribed the phrase “Liberty or Death” in her cipher book (5.5). Although influenced by republican ideas, her book also revealed the continuing importance of traditional ideas about women’s roles. Bound into the book were penmanship exercises that intoned such traditional moral injunctions as “Honour Father and Mother.” Images as History: Women’s Roles: Tradition and Change explores the effects of republican ideas on women’s roles (page 134). Supporters of Enlightenment ideas such as Rush and Jefferson believed that education would help nurture the virtue necessary for the survival of republicanism. Other Americans, however, looked to religion to foster virtue. One minister reminded his parishioners that although the “civil authority have no right to establish religion,” it was still true that “religion is connected with the morals of the people.” Another minister noted that by “instilling good sentiments into the tender minds

WOMEN’S ROLES: TRADITION AND CHANGE
Although republicanism allowed some women to transform the roles assigned to them, it retained the traditional view that a woman’s primary duties were to her family. In the engraving Keep Within the Compass, the woman who stays within the compass enjoys a life of harmony and prosperity. Stepping outside it carried grave consequences. Republican ideals of womanhood were stitched into a needlework sampler prepared by a school girl, Nabby Martin of Providence, Rhode Island. Samplers were a standard part of a young woman’s education. Nabby included images of young couples, flowers, and domestic animals, common to pre-revolution samplers, but republican themes also show through. The home, the symbol of domesticity, traditionally 
 the heart and center image of a young girl’s sampler, has been replaced by the Rhode Island State House. Politics, not home, is the center of this piece. Nabby also showed her respect for the republican emphasis on education by including the College of Rhode Island (Brown University). As a female, Nabby Martin was barred from the world of the State House and the College of Rhode Island, but the inclusion of their images in her sampler is significant. Although working with an art form closely tied to women’s roles, Martin turned her gaze to the wider world both buildings represented. The republican message of the sampler is clear: Let Virtue be a Guide to Thee. How is virtue represented visually in Martin’s needlework?

 The text that accompanied this image advised: “Keep within Compass and You shall be sure to avoid many troubles which others endure.”

 of children and youth, you will teach them to stand fast in their liberty.” Post-revolutionary America remained a predominantly Protestant culture in which religious dissent was tolerated only within limits. Some states continued to bar Catholics and Jews from public office. The assumption behind such laws was that only Protestants could be counted on to have the necessary virtue to seek the public good. Although excluded from the full benefits of citizenship, religious dissenters were allowed to worship according to the dictates of conscience. Most state bills of rights and constitutions guaranteed the free exercise of religion. Revolutionary ideas of liberty and equality slowly led states to abandon the notion that only Protestants could be trusted to hold public office. Religious tests requiring potential office holders to swear a belief in the divinity of Jesus as a requirement for holding public office were abolished in Virginia (1785), Georgia (1789), Pennsylvania (1790), South Carolina (1790), Delaware (1792), and Vermont (1793). Before the Revolution, many colonies provided direct government support to religion or followed the English practice of having an official church. Spurred by Revolutionary ideals America moved toward the separation of church and state. The post-revolutionary era witnessed a move to disestablish the Anglican Church in those places where it enjoyed public funding. Two different justifications for the separation of church and state emerged. For champions of the Enlightenment, such as Jefferson, separation of church and state was inspired by the fear that religion might use the power of government to oppress citizens of different religious views or that religion might corrupt government. Dissenting Protestant sects, notably the Baptists and Methodists, opposed state support for religion for a different reason. These groups had long felt oppressed by the state-supported Anglican Church, particularly by taxation to support that church. For Virginia’s Baptists, separation of church and state was a means to protect the purity of religion from corruption by government. Evangelicals and supporters of the Enlightenment came together in Virginia in 1785 when the state legislature considered a bill for non-preferential aid for ministers of the Christian religion. Since the scheme was non-preferential, it would not establish an official state church but rather provide funds to all Protestant churches in a nondiscriminatory



 fashion. Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, two of the state’s leading politicians, campaigned in favor of the bill. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, champions of Enlightenment values, led the opposition. Madison and Jefferson outlined their case against state support for religion in The Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments (1785). This essay not only was instrumental in defeating the bill, it also became a landmark in American church–state relations.

Democracy Triumphant?
 According to traditional republican theory, citizens were expected to defer to their betters, who were assumed to be the most virtuous members of society. Before the American Revolution, the state legislatures were dominated by men of wealth. As one legislator noted, “it is right that men of birth and fortune, in every government that is free, should be invested with power, and enjoy higher honours than the people.” Virtue, according to this view, required one to have the wealth supposedly necessary to cultivate wisdom and knowledge. One newspaper writer captured this traditional conception of virtue when he wrote that representatives “should be ABLE in ESTATE, ABLE in KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING.” The Revolution, however, challenged this ideal, substituting a more democratic theory of virtue. A writer calling himself “Democritus” captured the essence of this new theory when he urged that citizens vote only for “a man of middling circumstances” and “common understanding,” not members of a wealthy or educated elite. In nearly every state a new type of politician emerged who embodied the more democratic version of republicanism: men such as New York’s Abraham Yates, a shoemaker, and Pennsylvania’s William Findley, a weaver. Supporters of the elitist republican view of politics mocked the humble origins of the new politicians and questioned their ability to function as legislators. One contemporary political satirist took aim at Findley’s humble origins as a weaver: “It will be more honourable for such men to stay at their looms and knot threads, than to come forward in a legislative capacity.” The post-revolutionary debate over the meaning of virtue and democracy shaped politics. When William Smith, a prosperous Baltimore

 flour merchant, ran for office in 1789, his enemies attacked him by claiming that “Mr. Smith has distilled RICHES from the tears of the POOR; and grown FAT upon their curses.” Smith’s supporters viewed his independence as one of his main qualifications for office. In their view he was “a Man of great commercial Knowledge, of known integrity, and possessed of a Character and independent Fortune which place him above Temptation.” Smith’s support for this traditional idea of virtue

 was reflected in this portrait (5.6) painted by Charles Wilson Peale. Rather than include symbols that reflected Smith’s life as a prosperous city merchant, Peale depicted Smith as a simply dressed country gentlemen. The books that the artist included, poetical works on rural life, reinforce this notion. Peale also placed Smith in front of a Roman column, another visual cue to symbolize his virtue. The debate over what made a good representative in part reflected a process of democratization in American culture. The Revolution greatly expanded the number of white male voters eligible to participate in the political process. Most states lowered property requirements for voting, and Pennsylvania abandoned such requirements entirely. Taken together, the expansion of democratic ideas and changes in suffrage requirements changed the character of politics in America. As this graph (5.7) reveals, the impact on the composition of state legislatures was profound. After the Revolution the percentage of wealthy citizens elected to the legislature dropped, and the numbers of those of the “middling sort,” or middling classes, increased. One Boston newspaper writer complained that “since the war, blustering ignorant men” had unfortunately pushed “themselves into office.” Not everyone saw the rise of these new politicians in negative terms. For those who believed in democracy, these trends were a positive development. Now government included “a class of citizens who hither to have thought it more for their interest to be contented with a humbler walk in life.” 5.6 William Smith and His Grandson The new democratic politiIn this portrait of William Smith, the artist conjures up an image of a country cians favored policies designed gentleman who devoted himself to contemplation.

 participate in government. They introduced, for example, higher salaries for elected representatives, encouraging ordinary people to serve in government. They also made efforts to relocate state capitals inland, so that travel to them would be easier for backcountry farmers.

 Debtors versus Creditors Economic issues proved particularly contentious in post-revolutionary America. Spokesmen for these new politicians favored policies to ease the burdens of farmers and artisans. “Stay laws” created generous grace periods for the recovery of debts and protected farmers from having their farms seized for nonpayment of debts. “Tender laws” allowed farmers to pay debts with goods rather than hard currency. Merchants generally opposed these policies. The lack of specie, silver and gold currency, hindered economic exchange. Spokesmen for debtors argued that government had an obligation to use paper money to ease the shortage of currency. By expanding the money supply and printing more paper currency, the government encouraged inflation. Increasing the amount of money in circulation facilitated commerce. When done cautiously, this type of inflationary policy provided a means of pumping up the economy. As long as the government did not flood the

These changes were pronounced in parts of the mid-Atlantic and New England, and are reflected in the data regarding property holdings of legislators elected in New York, New Jersey, and New Hampshire.

 market with paper, driving down its value, debtors and creditors could adjust their behavior to take into account the effects of modest inflation in prices for various commodities. By encouraging economic activity, paper money could provide an important tool for economic growth. Farmers were especially fond of this system because they could repay their debts with depreciated currency— money that was worth less than the amount of the original debt. This system, however, could function only if merchants did not dramatically raise prices to compensate for the declining value of paper money. A rapid rise in prices could lead inflation to spiral out of control. Most merchants, however, viewed paper money as a bad policy that hurt their interests. No state was more aggressive in using paper money to solve its financial problems than Rhode Island. Unfortunately, however, the decision to print large amounts of paper money never won the support of merchants in Providence and Newport. When presented with paper money, merchants increased prices and eventually refused to accept depreciated paper currency. In response, the state legislature imposed a steep fine on any merchant who refused to accept paper currency. One writer lampooned the situation of “Rogue Island” in verse: “Hail! realm of rogues, renow’d for fraud and guile All hail, ye knav’ries of yon little isle.”

 How did the composition of the state legislatures change after the American Revolution?



 CHAPTER 5

A VIRTUOUS REPUBLIC: CREATING A WORKABLE GOVERNMENT,1783–1789

 Life under the Articles of Confederation From the outset, the Articles of Confederation, America’s first federal constitution, was plagued by problems. Without the power to tax or coerce states to follow the treaties it had negotiated, the Confederation Congress could not resolve the nation’s economic problems and diplomatic issues. Leaders also worried that the Confederation lacked the military power to deal with rebellions or foreign foes.

 No Taxation with Representation

5.8 Continental
Paper Currency
 The value of Continental paper currency dropped precipitously as Congress printed more money, and faith in the value of the currency dwindled.

 Americans resented British efforts to tax them prior to the Revolution. Given their fears of strong government and hostility to taxation, the Articles of Confederation, the weak constitution created by the Confederation Congress, did not empower the new central government to tax Americans. Instead, the Articles relied on requisitions made to the states to fund government business. Few states bothered to comply with these requisitions in a timely manner, and the new government of the United States was plagued by shortages of funds. Although it lacked the power to tax, Congress had to fund the war. To help pay for the war effort, Congress printed almost $250 million in paper currency that was not backed by gold or silver and led to staggering inflation. By 1781, it took more than 150 Continental dollars to purchase what had cost one dollar in 1777. This dramatic drop in the value of Continental currency led to the phrase “As worthless as a Continental” to describe something with no value. As 5.8 illustrates, it would take a pile of Continentals to purchase what a single dollar might have paid for less than five years before. The Treaty of Paris (1783) formally ended hostilities between Britain and the new United States of America. Peace did not, however, solve the economic problems that the new nation faced. Indeed, the end of the war ushered in new economic

 problems. Boycotts of British goods and the disruption of trade during wartime meant that consumers had been denied access to luxury items, including china, textiles, and wine. Demand for British goods surged after the war, and the new nation was flooded with imports. British merchants encouraged Americans to buy goods on credit. American merchants by contrast, now faced a host of new obstacles to trade with Britain. In particular, the loss of the lucrative trade with the British West Indies was a severe blow to the American economy. America’s trade deficit with Britain drained what little gold and silver reserves were available to the nation. American banks had to curtail loans. When merchants were forced to call in debts to satisfy their British suppliers, they included the debts individuals owed them. This constriction of credit sent the economy into a tailspin. The combination of restricted access to trade with Britain and its empire, falling agricultural prices, and mounting debt produced the new nation’s first economic depression.

Diplomacy: Frustration
 and Stalemate The new nation also faced military challenges. British troops were still garrisoned in parts of the Ohio Valley. Relations with the Indian tribes along the frontier remained tense. Farther from the nation’s borders, Americans faced different problems. Without a powerful navy to protect American commerce, ships were easy prey for pirates. Piracy was particularly rampant in the Mediterranean where the North African states of Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, known as the Barbary States, sanctioned it. The Barbary pirates extorted money from merchant vessels in exchange for safe passage. Failure to pay resulted in the seizure of ships and imprisonment of sailors.

 Barbary pirates languished in North African prisons or were sold into slavery. In July 1785, when pirates captured two American ships, Algiers demanded nearly $60,000 in ransom to release the vessels and their crews. The American navy was too weak to challenge these pirate fleets. While the loss of Claimed by trade burdened the nation’s Spain, Russia, fledgling economy, the sad and England fate of American captives became a source of national humiliation. Frustration with the inability to defend its interests on the high seas grew, but America faced even more serious problems closer to its borders. Defending the nation’s interests in the Mediterranean would have to wait while America dealt with the threats posed by PACIFIC Indians and the British OCEAN and Spanish in North America. The map (5.9) shows the British and Spanish presence along America’s England borders, a fact that increased Spain American anxiety. Russia Congress had little power United States to compel the states to live British-held forts up to the nation’s treaty obligations, including provisions requiring Americans to pay prewar debts and compensate Loyalists for property confiscated during the war. Britain used America’s failure to comply with these provisions as a pretext for retaining control of its forts in the Old Northwest, the region of the new nation bordering the Great Lakes (5.9). These outposts allowed the British to continue their lucrative fur trade with the Indians. The war against Britain had strained relations between America and its Indian neighbors. Many Indian peoples, such as the Iroquois in New York and the Creeks in Georgia, had sided with the British.

 CHAPTER 5

 George III had “no right whatever to grant away to the States of America their rights or properties without a manifest breach of all justice and equity.” Given the absence of Indian representation in the treaty that ended hostilities between the United States and Britain, it is hardly surprising that the interests of Indian peoples were not reflected in the final terms. The Treaty of Paris ceded the entire Old Northwest territory to the United States. American diplomats were not sympathetic to the claims of Indians. Operating under a theory of conquest in which Indians were “a subdued people,” American negotiators assumed that defeated tribes had to relinquish all claims to Western lands. Rejecting this view, Indians organized to resist incursions. Rather than mark the start of an era of peace, the period after the Revolution was one of continued conflict between Indians and Americans. Those tribes that were best organized politically and militarily were better able to defend their interests against American expansionism. The Indian population east of the Mississippi numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 and was divided into 85 different nations. The white population of the new United States was approximately 2.4 million. Pressure to open up Indian lands for white settlement created conflict. Indians had no illusions about the goal of American policy. The insatiable desire for Indian land led the Creeks to bestow the name “Ecunnaunuxulgee” on Georgians: “people greedily grasping after the lands of red people.” When confronted with the determination of Indians to defend their lands, Americans were forced to negotiate more fairly. American leaders soon realized that missionary work and trade were more likely to secure harmonious relations than conquest and military confrontation. By 1787, Congress had shifted both its tone and strategy for dealing with Indian policy. In place of the theory of conquest, Congress recommended “the utmost good faith” in dealing with the Indians. The Spanish presence in the Old Southwest was another threat. Navigation of the Mississippi River was crucial for the economic development of this region. Goods traveling down the Mississippi needed to be unloaded at New Orleans and placed on ocean-bound vessels. Spain denied Americans free access to the Mississippi and New Orleans. Congress authorized Secretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay to negotiate with the Spanish. Spain proposed opening its empire to trade with America if the United States renounced its claim to navigate the

 Mississippi. The terms would have been a boon to New England merchants, who would have benefited from new trade opportunities with Spanish America, but alienated Southerners, particularly those in the Southwest, who viewed the Mississippi as their pipeline to world markets.

Settling the Old Northwest
 The most important achievement of the Confederation period was the plan Congress devised for Western settlement. A committee chaired by Thomas Jefferson devised the initial plan for settling the West (5.10). This proposal imagined a rational mathematical scheme for carving out as many as 16 new states from the Northwest Territory. Jefferson’s plan combined republican theories of self-government with Enlightenment ideas about geography. Boundaries would be drawn along an orderly grid after being surveyed. Reflecting his debt to classical republicanism, Jefferson’s chose names for the new territories such as Polypotamia, “land of many rivers.” Republicanism guided this plan in other ways. In his Ordinance of 1784, Jefferson proposed that new territories be incorporated into the union as states on an equal footing with the original thirteen. Jefferson also sought local selfgovernment for settlers almost immediately. When the free population reached 20,000, a constitutional convention would set up a permanent state government. The plan banned slavery after the year 1800 and recommended that land be made available in parcels small enough for average Americans to purchase. Jefferson envisioned the Northwest Territory populated by white yeoman farmers. The Land Ordinance of 1785 adopted by Congress departed from Jefferson’s original proposal. It called for the creation of townships of 36 square miles. Land was to be sold for no less than one dollar an acre in hard currency. Ordinary citizens would have had trouble raising this amount of cash and therefore had little chance to purchase land directly from the government. Jefferson’s hope that Western land could be sold directly to citizens and create a republic of small independent farmers was jettisoned in favor of a plan that favored speculators. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 was the final plan for the governance of the new territories. This act was considerably less democratic than Jefferson’s original proposal but maintained

LIFE UNDER THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION

 his orderly model for dividing up the territory. Governors appointed by Congress would rule the Northwest Territories. When the population reached 5,000 adult males, settlers could elect their own territorial legislatures. When the population reached 60,000 free inhabitants, including women, the territories could seek admission to the Confederation. The language of the Northwest Ordinance echoed the republican ideals of the Revolution. Congress proclaimed that “fundamental principles of civil and religious liberty” were the foundation for the new states to be created from the territories. In keeping with the republican ideas about virtue and the need for an educated citizenry, the Ordinance declared: “Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.” Most important, the Ordinance rejected slavery in the new states to be carved out of the Northwest Territories.

 Shays’s Rebellion The postwar economic downturn hit farmers in Massachusetts particularly hard. As farm foreclosures increased, and families saw their farms seized by their creditors, frustration mounted. Revolutionary War veterans marched on the town of Northampton to shut down the local courts

 and prevent further foreclosures. The armed crowd prevented the judges, dressed in formal judicial attire, long black robes and gray wigs, from entering the courthouse. The protestors, dubbed Shaysites, after their leader, Daniel Shays, believed they were protecting the “good of the commonwealth” and opposing the “tyrannical government in the Massachusetts State.” Governor James Bowdoin condemned the court closings as “fraught with the most fatal and pernicious consequences” that “must tend to subvert all law and government.” Shays’s Rebellion had begun. When angry farmers in Great Barrington, another town in western Massachusetts, closed their local court, the governor dispatched the state militia. One member of the crowd sympathetic to the Shaysites



 5.10 Jefferson’s Plan for the West Jefferson’s gridlike map for the settlement of the West was influenced by the ideas of Enlightenment thinkers. The names that Jefferson proposed for these territories were inspired by classical antiquity. Thus, one potential state was named Sylvania, “a forested region.”

 in Springfield. The failure of Shays’s Rebellion, the most serious challenge to government authority in the new nation, gave additional impetus to those eager to reform the structure of the Articles of Confederation and create a more powerful central government. George Washington was among the most alarmed by events in Massachusetts. The one figure among the nation’s Patriot elite who seemed relatively unfazed by the rebellion in western Massachusetts was Thomas Jefferson who learned of the rebellion while living in Paris and serving America as a diplomat.

THE MOVEMENT FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM



The Movement for
Constitutional Reform
 The economic, political, and diplomatic problems faced by the Confederation government, including Shays’s Rebellion, inspired a small but talented group of politicians to advocate reform of the Articles of Confederation. As nationalists—men who believed in the need for a stronger national government—they regarded constitutional reform as imperative. Rather than continue to put their faith in virtue, nationalists sought to create a powerful central government to protect American interests abroad and deal with internal threats, such as Shays’s Rebellion. For the nationalists the postwar era was a time of crisis that demanded decisive action if America were to survive. Nationalists proposed a new model of government to protect individual liberty and promote the common good. The Federal Constitution created by this group relied on a system of checks and balances, not virtue, to protect liberty.

The Road to Philadelphia
 Delegates from Maryland and Virginia gathered at George Washington’s home in Mount Vernon (1785) to discuss economic matters. A year later in Annapolis, Maryland (1786) delegates from five states discussed the problems of the Confederation. Finally, in 1787, delegates from 12 of the 13 states gathered in Philadelphia to reform the Articles of Confederation. The 55 delegates in Philadelphia included an impressive cast of characters. Virginia sent James Madison and George Mason, two of its most esteemed political figures. Pennsylvania’s representatives included the oldest delegate, Benjamin Franklin, then aged 81, and James Wilson, the nation’s premier legal mind. New York’s delegation boasted the brilliant, but brash, Alexander Hamilton. The delegates chose George Washington to preside over the meeting. Lawyers dominated the convention, and nearly all the delegates were wealthy men. A strict rule of secrecy was imposed on the proceedings, a decision that facilitated a more frank debate among the delegates, but only intensified rumors about their activities. The rule of secrecy was stringently enforced: The windows of the Pennsylvania State House were nailed shut and a guard posted at the door. Writing from France, where he was serving as American minister, Jefferson described the assembly as a meeting of “demigods”—men of such impressive accomplishments that they seemed like the

 mythical heroes of antiquity, part human and part divine. Some contemporaries, however, were suspicious of the convention’s secrecy. One Pennsylvania newspaper warned of the “monster” being fashioned behind a “thick veil of secrecy.” Later generations of Americans have tended to echo Jefferson’s observations: that the convention was composed of extraordinarily talented politicians, a view illustrated by this mid-nineteenth-century painting by Thomas Rossiter (5.12) in which the Founders are bathed in light, not shrouded in secrecy.

 Large States versus Small States Instead of arguing over reforming the Articles of Confederation, as originally intended, the Philadelphia Convention took up a bold proposal offered by the Virginia delegation. The Virginia Plan, drafted mainly by James Madison, abandoned the federal system created by the Articles, in favor of a new

 model of government that had both federal and national features. The states would retain power, but the new national government would be supreme in those areas in which it was given authority. The Virginia Plan created a new government composed of a single executive (the branch of government charged with, among other things, the execution of laws), a two-house legislature (Congress, the lawmaking body), and a separate judiciary (courts). The lower house of Congress would be directly elected by the people, and the upper house would be elected by the lower house from a list provided by the state legislatures. Under the Articles of Confederation, small states such as Maryland had the same vote as large states such as Virginia. Rather than this one-state one-vote principle, each state would have representation in proportion to its population. The new Congress would have the power “to legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent” or “in which the harmony of

 the United States may be interrupted by the exercise of individual [state] legislation.” Although this did not explicitly address nettlesome issues such as the power to tax, such powers were clearly within the purview of this broad grant of authority. The authors of the Virginia Plan, especially James Madison, thought that a more general grant of authority, rather than a long list of enumerated powers, would be more politically acceptable to the delegates. Representatives from the small states opposed the Virginia Plan. Two weeks after the Virginia Plan was introduced, William Patterson of New Jersey made a counterproposal, often dubbed the New Jersey Plan. It called for a modified federal system based on the existing Articles of Confederation. It proposed a single legislature in which each state would have one vote, which would maintain the parity between small and large states. In contrast to the Articles of Confederation, the new national legislature would be the supreme law

 of the land and would be binding on the states. The national legislature would have the power to tax and regulate interstate commerce. Although the New Jersey Plan was defeated, it had revealed the difficulty of reaching a consensus without accommodating the concerns of the small states, which feared that the new system would give larger states inordinate influence over the new government. The figure (5.13) shows the differences between the Virginia and New Jersey plans and how each differed from the Articles of Confederation. Although both of these plans would have given the new central government broad new powers, particularly over economic matters, representatives from the large and small states remained divided over how the legislature would be structured. On June 29, 1787, Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut reintroduced an earlier compromise that he and Roger Sherman (also of Connecticut) had devised. The plan provided for equal representation for large and small states in the upper house and a lower house in which representation would be apportioned on the basis of population. On July 16, 1787, the convention adopted the Great Compromise (sometimes known as the Connecticut Compromise because of Ellsworth and Sherman’s role in framing it). The Great Compromise solved one of the most difficult issues facing the convention: the struggle over representation based on population versus equal representation among the states.

 Conflict over Slavery Although the Connecticut Compromise solved one of the most difficult problems faced by the convention, it also focused attention on another equally contentious issue: whether to count slaves in the apportionment of the new lower house. The Southern states, seeking sufficient representation in the new legislature to protect slavery, were determined that their slaves be counted. Opponents of slavery, by contrast, wished to see slaves taxed as property but did not wish to count them when calculating representation in the new lower house. The convention settled on a solution in which slaves were counted as three-fifths of a person for purposes of taxation and legislative apportionment. (The threefifths ratio had been worked out by the Confederation Congress earlier, when it faced another issue pertaining to slavery.) Conflict flared over the slave trade. One of the most intense attacks on the slave trade was voiced by Virginian George Mason, the largest slave owner in the convention, who warned his fellow delegates of the threat to the republic of the institution of slavery: “Every master of slaves is born a petty tyrant…slavery discourages arts & manufactures.” Mason recommended ending the slave trade as a first step toward eliminating slavery. Several delegates viewed Mason’s actions cynically. Virginia had an excess of slaves and would profit enormously from an internal slave trade if the external trade with Africa were abolished.

 CHAPTER 5

A VIRTUOUS REPUBLIC: CREATING A WORKABLE GOVERNMENT,1783–1789

 “The states were divided into different interests not by their difference of size but by other circumstances; the most material of which resulted partly from climate, but principally from the effects of their having or not having slaves.” JAMES MADISON, 1787

 Charles Pinckney argued that all the great republics of the ancient world had accepted the necessity of slavery. His cousin, General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, another delegate from South Carolina, told delegates that his state would never accept the Constitution if the slave trade was banned. Again compromise held the convention together. The new Congress was denied the authority to ban the slave trade until 1808. Although the word slavery never appears in the Constitution, a number of clauses in the document protected it. Article IV, Section 2, prevented fugitive slaves, defined as any “person held to service or labour in one state,” from fleeing to another state to seek asylum and freedom. Article I, Section 8, prohibited the national government from taxing the exports of any state, a provision that prevented the products of slave labor, such as rice, indigo, tobacco, or sugar, from being singled out for sanctions by those hostile to slavery. In James Madison’s view, the greatest division in the convention was not the conflict between large states and small states, but slavery.

Filling out the
Constitutional Design
 After sorting out the structure of the legislative branch of government, the convention struggled over the executive branch. George Mason argued for a three-man executive. A plural executive, he argued, could better represent the different regional interests of the nation. Rejecting this proposal, the convention settled on a unitary executive. There was also disagreement over how to choose the executive. James Wilson wanted to see the executive elected by the people, whereas Mason argued that the people lacked the wisdom to make such a decision. Roger Sherman’s plan to have the national legislature pick

 How did the electoral college strengthen the powers of the states and further the ideals of republicanism?

 the executive was challenged as a threat to the separation of powers. Eventually the convention settled on an “electoral college” composed of men chosen by each state in a manner to be determined by the individual state legislatures. By giving the states some control over selection of the president, this system provided another way of strengthening the power of the states within the new federal system. The electoral college also reflected the ideals of republicanism held by the delegates. By creating a filtering mechanism for the selection of the president, the electoral college was designed to help ensure that the men chosen were drawn from the ranks of the leading citizens, men renowned for their knowledge and virtue. Delegates also clashed over the term of office that the executive would serve. Alexander Hamilton proposed that the executive have a life term, but this leaned too close to monarchy for most delegates. Some delegates favored a single term of as much as seven years, while others argued that a shorter term with the possibility of reelection would provide a greater check on the president. The convention ultimately settled on a four-year term with no limits on the number of terms a president might serve. The final structure of the executive branch was detailed in Article II of the Constitution. Throughout August the convention sketched the barest outline for the third branch of government, the federal judiciary. A new Supreme Court was created, and Congress was authorized to create such inferior courts as it deemed necessary. The Supreme Court’s authority extended “in all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under the Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made under their authority.” Although a number of delegates assumed that the courts would exercise the power of judicial review, the power to declare acts of Congress

THE MOVEMENT FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM

 unconstitutional, the Constitution failed to make such power explicit. Two delegates from New York, Robert Yates and John Lansing, left before the document was completed and therefore did not sign it. Three other delegates—Edmund Randolph, George Mason, and Elbridge Gerry—refused to sign the Constitution because of their reservations about its final draft. Despite these protests, Benjamin Franklin captured the feelings of many delegates when he wrote that despite its faults, it was doubtful “whether any other convention we can obtain may be able to make a better Constitution . . . it therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching as near to perfection as it does.” After the convention concluded its work and the text of the Constitution was made public, a woman asked Franklin, “‘Well Doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy?’ ‘A republic,’ replied the Doctor, ‘if you can keep it.’” The Constitution reflected the give and take and the spirit of compromise that prevailed at the Convention. The new Constitution was a radical departure from the Articles of Confederation (5.14). The powerful national legislature created by the Constitution was given authority to enact all laws “necessary and proper” to carrying out responsibilities delegated by the Constitution.



 The new national legislature had two houses, a House of Representatives and a Senate. Each state had two senators. Representation in the House of Representatives was based on population, with slaves counting as three-fifths of a person. Amendments to the Constitution would require the approval of three-quarters of the states, not the unanimous consent required under the Articles. Although executive power under the Articles of Confederation had been weak, the new president could veto legislation, negotiate treaties, and issue pardons. The ill-defined powers of the new Supreme Court left some wondering if the judiciary would be the weakest of the three branches, not co-equal with the legislature and the executive. The new federal Constitution also broke with well-established precedents that had shaped the state constitutions drafted after the Revolution. Unlike the typical state constitution, the federal Constitution did not include a declaration of rights stating the basic rights and liberties retained by the people, nor did it reassert the basic republican principles upon which government rested. Most state constitutions created relatively weak executives, another marked contrast with the new Federal Constitution and its strong executive branch.

 CHAPTER 5

A VIRTUOUS REPUBLIC: CREATING A WORKABLE GOVERNMENT,1783–1789

The Great Debate
 The publication of the Constitution inaugurated one of the most vigorous political campaigns in American history. In taverns and town squares, Americans argued over the new Constitution. As one contemporary remarked, “the plan of a Government proposed to us by the convention—affords matter for conversation to every rank of beings from the Governor to the door keeper.” Soon two sides emerged in the debate over ratification.

 Federalists versus Anti-Federalists The supporters of the Constitution described themselves as Federalists, thus saddling their opponents with the name Anti-Federalists. Never entirely happy with this name, opponents of the Constitution complained that they were the true supporters of federalism and attacked pro-Constitutional forces as “consolidationists” who wished to consolidate the union into a single national government and rob the states of their power. Looking back on the bitter struggle over ratification, one Anti-Federalist quipped that because the issue before the nation was ratification of the Constitution, the two sides were more aptly described as “rats and anti-rats.” Citizens paraded, raised their glasses to toast, or attacked the new government. Some even rioted to express their sentiments. Anti-Federalists in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, burned an effigy of Federalist James Wilson to express their disapproval of the new Constitution. Wilson, a renowned lawyer and a recent immigrant from Scotland, was one of the most important supporters of the Constitution in Pennsylvania. He was also an easy target for ridicule, since he spoke with a thick Scottish accent that his enemies mocked. The supporters of the Constitution also took to the streets to defend it and occasionally to intimidate their opponents. A Federalist crowd wrecked the printing presses of Anti-Federalist publishers in New York City. These disturbances were the exception, however, not the rule. The debate could be heated, but Americans typically confined their passions to the printed page. Hundreds of columns of newspaper text were devoted to the debate over the merits of the Constitution, and dozens of pamphlets were written for and against it. The Federalist, for example, a sophisticated defense of the Constitution written by John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison, was first published as newspaper essays in New York. It is now regarded by many scholars as America’s most important contribution to Western

 Why did Federalist and Anti-Federalist authors adopt names such as Publius and Brutus?

 political philosophy. Writing under the pen name Publius, a hero of the Roman Republic, the authors hoped to cloak themselves in the toga of Roman virtue. This strategy was designed to focus the public’s attention on the ideas, not the men responsible for, the essays. The Federalist not only responded to Anti-Federalist criticism, it also provided a sophisticated analysis of republican government and a point-by-point discussion of the merits of the Constitution. Although its influence on the outcome of ratification was modest, The Federalist soon became the favorite text of judges, legislators, and others interested in interpreting the meaning of the Constitution. It continues to be the text most often cited by the Supreme Court when trying to identify the original understanding of the Constitution. Anti-Federalists produced no single text comparable to The Federalist. However, the writings of Elbridge Gerry and George Mason, prominent Anti-Federalists who had participated in the Philadelphia Convention but had refused to sign the Constitution, were widely reprinted. Authors who adopted the pen names Brutus and Federal Farmer each framed sophisticated critiques of the Constitution. Brutus invoked the same ideal of Roman virtue that Publius had appropriated for the supporters of the Constitution. The name Federal Farmer traded on the association of republican ideals of simplicity associated with the ideal of the yeoman farmer. Both texts developed an alternative vision of republican government. Rather than accept the need for a powerful central government, Anti-Federalists clung to the idea of a system in which the bulk of governmental functions would continue to reside in the states. (See Competing Visions: Brutus and Publius Debate the Nature of Republicanism.) Although the struggle over ratification produced some of the most intellectually sophisticated writings in American history, in other respects it was a textbook example of negative campaigning. If Publius and Brutus provided an example of dispassionate reason, metaphorically invoking Roman ideals of virtue by their pen names, other authors, on both sides, were not above

Federalists, Publius, The Anti-Federalist author Brutus defended the traditional idea that a free republic could survive only in a small area in which the people shared the same values, culture, and history. When a republic became too large, he argued, it became contentious, and the common good was sacrificed as competing factions vied to promote their own narrow interests. In short, Brutus was confident that history demonstrated the impossibility of a nation the size of the new United States remaining a free republic without a confederation-style government. If respect is to be paid to the opinion of the greatest and wisest men who have ever thought or wrote on the science of government, we shall be constrained to conclude, that a free republic cannot succeed over a country of such immense extent, . . . as that of the whole United States. . . . History furnishes no example of a free republic, any thing like the extent of the United States. The Grecian republics were of small extent; so also was that of the Romans. . . . in a republic, the manners, sentiments, and interests of the people should be similar. If this be not the case, there will be a constant clashing of opinions; and the representatives of one part will be continually striving, against those of the other. This will retard the operations of government, and prevent such conclusions as will promote the public good. If we apply this remark to the condition of the United States, we shall be convinced that it forbids that we should be one government. 
Writing as Publius, in The Federalist, James Madison
 disputed the traditional theory of republicanism advanced by Brutus and other Anti-Federalists. By increasing the number of factions and expanding the size of the republic, Publius argued that it would be less likely for any one faction to further their agenda and dominate politics. According to this new theory, politics would become a kaleidoscope of ever-shifting alliances. Moreover, in a larger republic politics itself would act like a filter and be more likely to select leaders of skill and talents. Finally, Madison noted that the federal system would act like a fire-wall, isolating factions within individual states and preventing them from spreading their wicked agendas to other states. Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages, and then betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is, whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public . . . . The smaller the society, . . . the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party . . . the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other. . . . The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States. In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government.

 Why did Brutus and Publius differ about the relationship between size and republicanism?

 slinging mud when it served their interests. Federalists, for example, denounced their opponents as Shaysites, a charge repeated in the satirical print, The Looking Glass for 1787 (5.15). In this cartoon, Connecticut appears stuck in the mud, a cart laden with debt is dragged in opposite directions by Federalists and Anti-Federalists. The artist who created this pro-Federalist political cartoon stooped lower than most: One Anti-Federalist character has his trousers pulled down around his ankles and his bottom exposed to his Federalist opponents. Anti-Federalists charged that Federalists were part of an aristocratic elite who wished to dominate common folk. Amos Singletary from Massachusetts warned his fellow citizens that the lawyers and rich merchants who backed the Constitution favored the interests of the aristocratic few over those of the democratic many. In his view, the new Constitution would undo the democratic reforms of the Revolution, returning control to powerful economic groups. Although Anti-Federalism attracted supporters of democracy such as Singletary, it also appealed to wealthy planters such as Virginia’s George Mason, who was less concerned about the Constitution’s antidemocratic features and more worried about the centralization of power. Mason feared that liberty would be annihilated if a central government gained too much power. Although Anti-Federalists did not agree about everything, they shared important objections to the Constitution. The essential Anti-Federalist critique emerged early in the debate. At the top was the fear of consolidation, the concern that the federal government would absorb all power into its orbit. Anti-Federalists believed that there would be too few representatives in Congress to represent the diverse interests of the American people. Representatives would also live far from their constituents and lose touch with the concerns of those they served. The extensive powers of the president and the potentially vast jurisdiction of the Supreme Court also worried Anti-Federalists, who feared that the federal government would become tyrannical. The absence of a bill of rights proved to be one of the Anti-Federalists’ most effective criticisms. In their view history demonstrated that once in power even the most virtuous rulers were tempted to increase their powers at the expense of popular liberty. A written declaration stating clearly the rights and powers retained by the people was therefore an essential safeguard for liberty. Rather than accept that the omission of a bill of rights was a serious flaw in the Constitution, Federalists argued that it was unnecessary. James Wilson defended the absence of a bill of rights by noting that the new government was one of delegated power only, and hence all powers not ceded to it were retained by the

 people and the states. “It would have been superfluous and absurd,” he observed, to stipulate “that we should enjoy those privileges, of which we are not divested either by the intention or the act that brought that body into existence.” In The Federalist, Publius argued that the inclusion of a bill of rights would be dangerous. By listing exactly which rights were protected, the new government would by implication exclude other rights that it did not explicitly include among those reserved to the people. Since it would be impossible to create a list of all the rights enjoyed by the people, it was better not to list any. For an overview of disagreement between Federalists and Anti-Federalists see 5.16.

Ratification
 Federalists realized that Anti-Federalists would try to block unconditional ratification and seek prior amendments to the Constitution. Early and decisive Federalist successes in Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Connecticut established a momentum that Federalists capitalized on to achieve their goal of unconditional ratification. Eventually in Massachusetts Fed-

 such as Massachusetts. Had the Federalists maintained a hard-line, sticking to James Wilson’s argument that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Constitution might never have been ratified. If states with powerful, wellorganized Anti-Federalist coalitions, such as Virginia, had held ratification conventions earlier, the Constitution might have been defeated or been radically altered by amendments. New Hampshire’s vote to ratify on June 21, 1788 gave Federalists the nine states needed to ratify the Constitution. Although the Constitution was now the new law of the land, it was vital to persuade Anti-Federalists in Virginia and New York to accept it. Despite opposition from Anti-Federalists like Patrick Henry, Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25. That left only New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island outside the new Union. In New York City Federalists staged a “grand federal procession” to show that the Constitution enjoyed broad support, particularly among the city’s artisans, who saw a strong government as a way to protect their economic interests from foreign competition. The parade drew members from virtually all of the city’s crafts and included dozens of floats. Printers, for example, marched alongside a printing press mounted on a horse-drawn cart which churned out an ode that praised the Constitution. A banner with the name Publius, the author of The Federalist, flew proudly above the press, and the printers sported caps with “Liberty of Press” written in large letters. Another group of artisans carried this banner (5.17), which celebrated their work with pewter, an alloy of tin and lead that was widely used to make tableware. Their banner carried the following verses: The Federal Plan Most Solid And Secure Americans Their Freedom Will Ensure All Arts Shall Flourish in Columbia’s Land And all Her Sons Join as One Social Band New York Anti-Federalists had a dilemma: Should they continue to oppose the Constitution or work within the new system of government? To understand how they made their decision, see Choices and Consequences: To Ratify or Not. New York’s ratification dashed the last hopes of opponents of the Constitution to secure prior amendments. Federalists had secured unconditional ratification of the new frame of government. Most Americans probably opposed the Constitution when it was first proposed, and the vote on ratification was close in many states. Several factors helped account for the Federalists’ victory. Supporters of the Constitution organized themselves around a well-defined goal: ratification. By contrast,

A VIRTUOUS REPUBLIC: CREATING A WORKABLE GOVERNMENT,1783–1789

Choices and Consequences
TO RATIFY OR NOT
By the time New York’s ratification convention met in Poughkeepsie, nine states had already ratified the Constitution, making it the new law of the land. Could Anti-Federalists continue to oppose the Constitution and thereby place New York outside the new nation? Many Anti-Federalists considered such a prospect unrealistic, so they turned to the question of amending the Constitution. The outcome of the convention depended on the decisions of moderate Anti-Federalists, led by the merchant Melancton Smith. New York Anti-Federalists faced a momentous decision: continue to oppose the Constitution or work within the new system of government. 
Choices




 Support the Constitution with the promise that the First Congress would amend it.



Support the Constitution
 provisionally until it was amended, but consider seceding from the Union if amendments were not made.



 Block ratification and continue to oppose the Constitution.

Decision
 Smith opted for the first choice, making New York the eleventh state to ratify the Constitution on July 25, 1787. In a powerful speech in the New York convention, he reiterated

 his hope for future amendments but recognized the need to work through the “mode prescribed by the Constitution.”

Consequences
 If Smith and other swing Anti-Federalist delegates in the Convention had opposed ratification, New York would have remained outside the Union, and the new nation might have split into separate confederacies. If Smith and other moderates had insisted on amendments before ratification, Federalists would likely have stood their ground and the convention might have failed to ratify the Constitution. As it was, Smith’s decision put more pressure on Rhode Island

 and North Carolina to accept the new Constitution. It also gave impetus to the move to amend the Constitution after ratification. Federalist newspapers seized on the visual image of a Roman-style temple to represent the nation and added a new column for each state that voted to ratify the Constitution. The pillars and temple metaphor, like Jefferson’s model for the Virginia State Capitol, evoked Roman ideals of virtue and liberty.

Continuing Controversies
 Why did New York Anti-Federalists accept the Constitution and wait for amendments? Although the Anti-Federalists were defeated in 1788, many of their fears and ideals about government still resonate in American politics. Were the Anti-Federalists backward-looking politicians who failed to grasp the genius of the new Constitution, or visionaries who predicted that the growth and centralization of American government might pose a threat to liberty? Americans still argue over the legacy of Anti-Federalism.

 Why did New York Anti-Federalists compromise on the question of amendments?

5.17 Pewterers’ Banner
 In a New York City parade celebrating the Constitution, Federalist artisans carried a banner that included the U.S. flag and depicted artisans crafting objects of pewter. The verse at the top proclaims the bright future for America under the new Constitution.

 Anti-Federalists could not provide a clear alternative. Some favored a new convention to revise the Constitution. Others favored amending the Constitution prior to ratification, and some were content to amend the new document later. Finally, Federalists were more effective at getting their message into print. Many newspaper editors refused to print Anti-Federalist materials. The dynamics of ratification were complex. No single theory accounts for why individuals and regions supported the Constitution, but the map shows several patterns in voting (5.18). Geography, economics, and individual experiences all shaped the vote on the Constitution. Merchants and artisans in regions tied to commerce, such as seacoasts and inland areas close to navigable rivers, looked to a stronger union to protect their economic interests and became Federalists. Inhabitants of frontier regions that faced Indian threats also supported a stronger central

 government because of these security concerns. Except for Rhode Island, small states supported the Constitution. Officers of the Continental Army who had dealt with a weak Congress under the Articles also supported the Constitution. Anti-Federalists drew together an equally diverse coalition that opposed any effort to centralize authority and lessen the power of the states. Backcountry farmers, particularly those less closely connected to major commercial markets, opposed the Constitution. State politicians, especially the newly empowered men of moderate wealth and more humble origins who dominated politics in states such as Pennsylvania and New York, were strongly Anti-Federalist. Finally, wealthy planters in parts of the South who feared that a distant and powerful government would not represent their interests became Anti-Federalists.

The Creation of a
Loyal Opposition
 Despite the intensity of the struggle over ratification, Anti-Federalists did not continue their opposition to the Constitution once the nine states needed to ratify adopted it. Indeed, rather than choose to become an anti-Constitutional party, Anti-Federalists accepted having to work within the framework provided by the Constitution. Continued opposition to the Constitution would only have led to anarchy, which most Anti-Federalists wished to avoid as much as did their Federalist opponents. Anti-Federalists turned their attentions to campaigning for election to the First Congress and to securing amendments to the Constitution.

The articles created a weak decentralized form of government that lacked the power to tax and compel state obedience to treaties it negotiated. Old Northwest The region of the new nation bordering on the Great Lakes. Northwest Ordinance of 1787 One of several laws adopted by the Confederation Congress designed to provide a plan for the orderly settlement of the Northwest Territory (the area north of the Ohio River and west of Pennsylvania). In addition to providing for a plan for self-governance, the Ordinance also prohibited slavery from the Northwest Territory. Shays’s Rebellion Uprising in western Massachusetts in which farmers organized themselves as local militia units and closed down courts to prevent their farms from being seized by creditors. Virginia Plan A plan framed by James Madison and introduced in the Constitution Convention by Edmund Randolph that

 called on delegations to abandon the government of the Articles and create a new, strong national government. New Jersey Plan Proposal made by William Patterson of New Jersey as an alternative to the more nationalistic Virginia Plan that would have retained the principle of state equality in the legislature embodied in the Articles of Confederation. Great Compromise Compromise plan proposed by Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut that called for equal representation of each state in the upper house and a lower house based on population. Federalists The name adopted by the supporters of the Constitution who favored a stronger centralized government. Anti-Federalists The name applied to opponents of the Constitution who insisted that they, not their opponents, were the true supporters of the ideal of federalism. Anti-Federalists opposed weakening the power of the states and feared that the Constitution yielded too much power to the new central government.

 Why did Federalists enact the Sedition Act and was it constitutional?

 The adoption of the Constitution did little to lessen the divisions in America that had arisen during ratification. The Federalist supporters of the Constitution splintered into two opposing groups. One side rallied around Alexander Hamilton, who became the chief theorist and driving force for an ambitious Federalist agenda. For Hamilton and his allies, the adoption of the Constitution was simply the first step in creating a powerful central government. These Federalists envisioned America as a great commercial empire that would, inspired by Britain’s lead, develop a strong military and pursue economic development aggressively. Opposing this bold agenda was a group that coalesced around Thomas Jefferson, who, with his friend James Madison, a former ally of Hamilton, helped define the core of the Republican opposition. This movement, although lacking the coherence and formal organization of a modern political party, battled its Federalist opponents over political, economic, and constitutional issues. Republicans sought to limit the powers of the new federal government and opposed the creation of a powerful financial and military state. The radicalism of the French Revolution further polarized American political life, and political passions intensified during the turbulent 1790s. Federalists denounced the excesses of revolutionary France even as Republicans affirmed their support for France. By the end of the 1790s, the partisan animosities had grown intense, as reflected in this pro-Federalist political cartoon, The Times, A Political Portrait. A group of American volunteers rides out to confront an invading French Army. As they march forward, they trample a Republican printer, while a dog urinates on his newspaper. The artist shows Republican James Madison attempting to block the progress of America’s troops with a giant pen, while Republicans Albert Gallatin and Thomas Jefferson work from behind to achieve the same goal. The text at the bottom announces the triumph of American government and warns traitors that they will receive their just punishments. After a decade of Federalist domination, Americans in 1800 turned to Thomas Jefferson, head of the Republican opposition, as their leader. In a close election, power was peacefully transferred from the Federalists to their opponents, and Jefferson became the nation’s third president.

 CHAPTER 6

THE NEW REPUBLIC: AN AGE OF POLITICAL PASSION, 1789–1800

Launching the New Government
 Although intense partisanship had characterized American politics during the colonial and revolutionary eras, the republican ideas championed during the Revolution stressed the need for a virtuous citizenry. The Constitution created a system designed to check the dangers of factionalism. Leaders were expected to put the good of the nation above any factional interest. Fortunately for America, the nation’s first president, George Washington, was such a figure, a leader who tried to remain above partisanship. Appointing Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson to his cabinet demonstrated his commitment to this ideal. These were men whose views on government were almost at opposite extremes, and from them, Washington sought policy alternatives to deal with the pressing issues facing the new nation.

 The Constitution had created an electoral college, a group of electors appointed by the states who had the responsibility of picking the president. On February 4, 1789, electors from all the states that had ratified the Constitution met in their state capitals and unanimously selected George Washington to be the nation’s first president. John Adams, another prominent revolutionary leader, received half that number of votes, becoming the first vice president. The remaining votes were split among ten other candidates. The nation celebrated Washington’s election in a grand style. He traveled from his home at Mount Vernon in Virginia to the site of his inaugural in New York City, feted along the way. Many towns erected triumphal arches, such as this one near Trenton (6.1). Although leading men in the community typically greeted Washington, giving him a military salute, in Trenton he met the local women who had erected the arch and who serenaded him. A placard on the arch proudly proclaimed that “The Defender of the Mothers will also Defend the Daughters.”

The First Federal Elections:
Completing the Constitution
 Although there had been little doubt that Washington would be America’s first president, the divisions

 between Federalists and Anti-Federalists influenced the first congressional elections. The issue of constitutional amendments was among the most contentious issues debated in the first federal elections. Federalists were eager to have James Madison run for Congress. Madison agreed to run, but he balked at actively campaigning for a seat, believing that behaving in such a partisan fashion was inconsistent with republican ideals. Fortunately, Madison’s supporters persuaded him that if he did not take his case directly to the people, Virginia would send an Anti-Federalist–dominated delegation to Congress. Madison set aside his reluctance to appeal for votes, and won election to Congress. One group critical to Madison’s success were the Baptists, who were eager to obtain explicit protection for freedom of religion in the Constitution. The task of shaping a set of amendments thus fell to Federalist James Madison. Madison recognized that if properly framed, amendments might go a long way to eliminating lingering Anti-Federalist suspicions of the new federal government. Thus, although he had originally opposed Anti-Federalist calls for amendments during the struggle over ratification, Madison now recognized their political necessity. He accepted what he described as “the nauseous project of amendments,” knowing that the process would be deeply politicized and that the few ardent Anti-Federalists in Congress would agitate for weakening the federal government. Still, Madison pared down the

LAUNCHING THE NEW GOVERNMENT

 dozens of amendments proposed by the state ratification conventions to seventeen. The Senate then whittled these down to twelve provisions and sent them to the states to ratify. The states did not adopt the first two proposed amendments, which dealt with legislative apportionment and congressional salaries. (More than 200 years later, the states finally adopted what became the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, which prohibits raises for Congress from taking effect until a new House of Representatives has taken office, a restraint that makes it more difficult for Congress to vote itself frequent salary increases.) The first ten of the original twelve amendments to the Constitution, eventually became known as the Bill of Rights, and included protections for both basic individual liberties and for the states. The First Amendment protected freedom of the press and religion. The Second Amendment guaranteed that the people would have a right to keep and bear arms in a well-regulated militia. (This right has since been expanded to include private arms used for individual self-defense within the home.) The Third Amendment forbade the government to quarter troops in the homes of private citizens. Several amendments protected the procedural rights associated with jury trial. The Ninth Amendment declared that enumeration of some rights did not mean the denial of others retained by the people. Finally, lest the new government try to expand its powers by exploiting the vague clauses of the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment stated that those powers not delegated to the federal government were reserved to the states and the people. These amendments assuaged the concerns of most moderate Anti-Federalists even if they did not placate the most ardent opponents of federal power who wished to restrict the powers of the new central government to those expressly delegated by the text of the new Constitution. Their adoption resolved the most important issue remaining from the struggle between Federalists and Anti-Federalists, clearing the way for new issues to come to the fore.

Filling Out the Branches
 of Government The Constitution created a blueprint for the new federal government, but Congress and the president still had to work out important details, including the structure of the executive and the judiciary departments. Congress took almost six months to work out a structure for the new federal courts. Lingering fears about the power of the federal government complicated drafting legislation to set up the federal courts. Senator William Maclay of Pennsylvania warned, for example, that the federal



 courts would “swallow all the State Constitutions by degree.” Eventually Congress created a three-tier system of district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court. Each state would have at least one district court. “Circuit courts” composed of a district court judge and two members of the Supreme Court were supposed to “ride circuit” (travel) to hear appeals from the district courts and to have primary jurisdiction in certain types of cases, such as those between citizens of different states. For the executive branch, Congress created new cabinet positions for a secretary of state to advise the president on foreign affairs, a secretary of the treasury for economic policy, a secretary of war to oversee the army, and an attorney general to be the chief legal advisor to government. For his cabinet Washington assembled an impressive group of leaders who had distinguished themselves in American public life. Henry Knox, the secretary of war, was a leading general; Edmund Randolph, the new attorney general, had introduced the Virginia Plan in the constitutional convention; Thomas Jefferson, the secretary of state, had been the primary author of the Declaration of Independence; and the first American minister to France; the first secretary of the treasury, Alexander Hamilton, had been one of the co-authors of The Federalist along with John Jay, who became the first chief justice of the Supreme Court. Although none of these men had been Anti-Federalists, Washington’s choices cut across a wide section of the political spectrum, with Hamilton representing the extreme nationalist position and Jefferson far more sympathetic to state power. During ratification Anti-Federalists had expressed fear that the Constitution would create a large, expensive government with a vast bureaucracy. In reality the federal government was far less imposing. Scattered among buildings near New York City’s Wall Street, the temporary home of the new government, the government offices bore slight resemblance to the nightmare that Anti-Federalists had predicted. The scale of the new government was modest, and its bureaucracy small, about 350 officers. Jefferson’s State Department employed two clerks, two assistants, and a part-time translator. (The modern State Department employs 8,000 people in Washington, D.C., and 11,000 overseas.) The largest department was Hamilton’s Treasury. Within a year of its creation, it boasted nearly ten times the number of employees of the Department of State. Its budget was more than triple the combined budgets of the State and War Departments. Apart from his close relationship to Washington, his role as secretary of the Treasury ensured that Hamilton was a figure to be reckoned with in the new government. Why were some ardent Anti-Federalists not satisfied with the Madison’s proposed amendments?



 CHAPTER 6

THE NEW REPUBLIC: AN AGE OF POLITICAL PASSION, 1789–1800

 Hamilton’s Ambitious Program In 1789, Congress requested that Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton issue a report on the new nation’s economy. Between 1790 and 1791, Hamilton responded with a series of reports, each corresponding to a major part of his overall plan to bolster America’s economy. These included reports on public credit, a national bank, the establishment of a mint to coin money, and manufactures. Hamilton saw a strong national government as a necessity to promote American prosperity and protect the young nation’s economic interests against foreign threats. In his view the Constitution had created a central government with considerable power over the economy. In his reports he urged Congress and the president to use this authority to encourage economic growth. To accomplish this, Hamilton looked to Britain as a model. With a robust manufacturing and financial section, and the powerful Bank of England to energize its economy, Britain had the most diverse and sophisticated economy in Europe.

 Hamilton’s Vision for the New Republic Alexander Hamilton envisioned America as a powerful nation with a strong government and a vigorous commercial economy. Before he could implement his ambitious program to realize this vision, however, Hamilton would have to overcome opponents at nearly every turn. Hamilton’s bold program not only frightened former AntiFederalists but also alarmed strong supporters of the Constitution, notably James Madison, who did

 “In place of that noble love of liberty and republican government which carried us triumphantly through the war, [a pro-British] monarchical aristocratical party has sprung up, whose avowed object is to draw over us the substance, as they have already done the forms, of the British government.” THOMAS JEFFERSON, 1796

 Why did Hamilton believe that America needed to create a national bank?

 not wish to see the new government become a powerful state modeled on that of Britain. Hamilton’s economic vision also clashed with Thomas Jefferson’s vision of a nation of small farmers. The new opposition to Federalist efforts to create a powerful centralized government, who called themselves Republicans, united former Anti-Federalists and those Federalists who shared the concerns of Madison and Jefferson. Republicans believed that liberty could flourish only if the states remained powerful enough to protect their citizens from the new federal government. The leader who conceived this audacious Federalist agenda, a vision that would transform America, was a self-made man who lacked the aristocratic upbringing of his chief opponents, Virginians Jefferson and Madison. Hamilton came from a modest background. Born in the West Indies, the illegitimate son of a Scottish merchant and a planter’s daughter, Hamilton was orphaned at an early age but became an apprentice clerk in a merchant firm. At age 14, he wrote “my Ambition is so prevalent that” he loathed the “Grov’ling condition of a Clerk or the like, to which my Fortune etc. condemns me, and would willingly risk my life, tho not my Character, to exalt my station.” Hamilton was talented, ambitious, and hard working. The proprietor of the merchant firm recognized his talent and helped him finance his education. Hamilton attended Kings College (now Columbia University) in New York City. During the American Revolution, he rose rapidly through the ranks of the Continental Army to become

 Washington’s personal aide. Marrying into a prominent New York family, he became an important political figure in that state. A successful lawyer, he had many friends and allies within New York’s merchant community. New York merchants commissioned this portrait (6.2) of Alexander Hamilton to honor his contribution to their prosperity. It provides one measure of his power and influence, particularly within the new nation’s financial world. Yet the painting is as notable for what the artist omitted as for what he included. Hamilton insisted that no references to his important political accomplishments be included, something that commissioners of the portrait had requested. Realizing that his political life was controversial, Hamilton directed the artist to avoid such references. Rather than depicting the complex, often contentious quality of his life, the painting presents the image of a disinterested republican statesman and writer. Hamilton was an unabashed American nationalist and an elitist who viewed democracy with suspicion. He believed that there would always be class divisions. To survive and prosper, the new nation had to win the allegiance of the rich and powerful, binding their interests to those of the new federal government.

 considerable debt financing the American Revolution. This debt consisted of many different types of paper currency and securities that the Confederation government and the individual states had issued. The new nation owed $75 million, a figure that alarmed some, but not Hamilton, who saw the debt as a means of bringing America into the modern era in which debt was an essential tool of state finance.

 How does Hamilton’s own life help explain his vision for America’s future?



 CHAPTER 6

THE NEW REPUBLIC: AN AGE OF POLITICAL PASSION, 1789–1800

 Hamilton proposed consolidating the debt of the individual states and the federal government. His scheme called for the assumption of the state debts, by which the federal government would fund any outstanding debts that the states owed. Creditors who held state paper would exchange it for a new type of paper that promised to pay interest until the bearer redeemed the original value of the note. Hamilton’s “Second Report on Public Credit” focused on financing this scheme and included a plan for taxing whiskey. He envisioned a permanently funded national debt in which income from taxes would service the interest, allowing the federal government to pay its other expenses. The most controversial feature of Hamilton’s plan dealt with the problem posed by speculation in these paper notes. The value of state- and

 would become a potential source of corruption. Republicans favored paying the full value of the debt to the original holders but not to the speculators. The Republicans would have given speculators a reasonable return on their investment, but not a huge profit. Hamilton argued that this policy would violate the sanctity of contracts and undermine the credit of the new government. Eventually he defeated his opponents, and state debt certificates would be exchanged for federal ones at full face value.

 Madison’s Opposition Hamilton was shocked to find his former ally James Madison leading the opposition to his policies. During ratification Madison had sided with Hamilton and together with John Jay wrote

 “In an agricultural country like this, therefore, to erect and concentrate and perpetuate a large moneyed interest . . . must . . . produce one or other of two evils: the prostration of agriculture at the feet of commerce, or a change in the present form of Federal Government fatal to the existence of American liberty.” Virginia’s remonstrance against the assumption of state debts, 16 December 1790 Confederation-issued paper had declined steadily by the 1790s as the hard-pressed states and the fledgling national government simply printed more paper to pay their debts. After the adoption of the Constitution, a few financial speculators had purchased large amounts of this devalued paper, hoping that the new government would redeem it at face value and net them a huge profit. Believing it was vital for the new nation to maintain excellent credit with investors, Hamilton insisted that government had an obligation to honor the debt at full face value. Republicans feared that Hamilton’s funding scheme would give a windfall to speculators. Besides being unjust, they argued, such a plan would create a powerful financial interest that

 The Federalist. Madison had also supported Hamilton’s efforts to create an effective Treasury Department under the Articles of Confederation. Why did Madison change his position and oppose Hamilton in 1789? Madison was motivated by his desire to preserve the constitutional system he had labored so hard to create. The speculative frenzy caused by Hamilton’s policy of assumption shocked Madison, who came to believe that Hamilton’s program would undermine the republican values that the Constitution was designed to protect. Although Hamilton dreamed of a powerful state that might rival Britain, Madison was more interested in preserving his constitutional vision. In Madison’s view, Hamilton’s system would create vast

HAMILTON’S AMBITIOUS PROGRAM

 inequalities of wealth, encourage corruption, and undermine republican government. Hamilton believed that Madison had been unduly influenced by Jefferson; indeed, Madison had always shared with his fellow Virginian a similar republican vision of an agrarian republic. Hamilton, by contrast, the product of New York’s commercial ethos, believed that America’s future depended on creating a powerful fiscal-military state. The split between Hamilton and Madison reflected a profound shift in American political life. A few years before, Madison had decried faction in Federalist No. 10. Now faced with the rise of Hamilton’s Federalist agenda, Madison revised his thinking about factions and politics. In an essay in the National Gazette, “A Candid State of Parties,” he conceded that America had become divided into a Republican party and an anti-Republican party (the Federalists). Opposition to his plan of assumption took a personal toll on Hamilton. Indeed, Jefferson described him as “somb[er], haggard, and



 dejected beyond comparison.” Jefferson invited Hamilton to dinner with Madison, where the three worked out a deal to break the impasse over assumption. In exchange for support for his economic program, Hamilton agreed to move the new capital of the United States from New York City to a site on the Potomac River. Southerners such as Jefferson and Madison feared that keeping the nation’s capital in New York City invited domination by commercial and financial interests. Although Hamilton might gain in the short run, Madison and Jefferson believed that the bargain they struck would lessen the influence of financial interests over the government. Meanwhile, the government temporarily relocated to Philadelphia. This cartoon (6.3), which shows Congress embarked on the ship Constitution as it sails to its eventual home on the Potomac, captures the Republicans’ association of urban commercial centers with corruption. The devil lures the ship to its clear doom on the rocky falls leading to Philadelphia.

 CHAPTER 6

THE NEW REPUBLIC: AN AGE OF POLITICAL PASSION, 1789–1800

The Bank, the Mint, and the
Report on Manufactures
 In his “Report on a National Bank,” Hamilton recommended that the federal government charter a national bank. The Bank of the United States would serve as a depository for government funds, bolster confidence in government securities, make loans, and provide the nation with a stable national currency. The government would own part of the stock in the new bank, but would allow private investors to buy the majority of stock. At the time of his proposal, there were only three private banks in the United States. A national bank would help stabilize the economy of the new nation and link the interests of the wealthy to the prosperity of the new nation. Again Madison opposed Hamilton’s plan. Much of the debate on this proposal focused on its constitutionality. Madison wanted to see the Constitution interpreted according to the original understanding of the states that ratified it in 1788. Arguing for the narrow interpretation of congressional power, he denied that the Constitution authorized Congress to charter a national bank. Ultimately, however, Hamilton’s ideas prevailed, and the Federalist-controlled Congress chartered the Bank of the United States. Republicans then hoped for a presidential veto. Washington sought advice from his cabinet about the constitutionality of the bank. Attorney General Edmund Randolph and Thomas Jefferson both agreed with Madison. Jefferson took advantage of the occasion to articulate his own views on how to interpret the new Constitution. He acknowledged that the Constitution empowered Congress to enact laws that were “necessary and proper.” However, although the creation of a bank was convenient and useful, it was not in his view necessary for Congress to fulfill its obligations to raise revenues. This theory of strict construction approached the text of the Constitution in an almost literal manner. If the Constitution did not grant a power, then, according to the theory of strict construction, the Tenth Amendment reserved that power to the states and the people. Madison and Jefferson designed their slightly different theories of constitutional interpretation to protect the rights of the people and the powers of the states against encroachment by the federal government. With the weight of Randolph, Madison, and Jefferson’s opinions weighing heavily in favor of a veto, Hamilton set out to refute his critics and

 How did Hamilton and Jefferson differ in their interpretations of the phrase “necessary and proper?”

 in the process frame his own alternative theory of how to interpret the Constitution. Hamilton’s theory of loose construction interpreted the language of the Constitution broadly. Hamilton believed the federal government enjoyed enormous latitude in determining the appropriate means for accomplishing any legitimate constitutional end. Even if a specific power was not listed, such as the power to charter a bank, Hamilton believed the Constitution implied such a power. Hamilton argued that Jefferson’s reasoning would restrict the powers of Congress to enact only those laws that were absolutely “necessary and proper.” In response to Madison and Jefferson’s suggestion of consulting the original intent of the state ratification conventions, Hamilton argued that “the intention is to be sought in the instrument itself.” Interpreters of the Constitution should follow well-established legal rules for understanding statutes and apply them to the Constitution. In other words, the actual text of the Constitution, not the arguments of Federalists, Anti-Federalists, or state ratification conventions, ought to be given primary consideration in constitutional interpretation. The struggle over the proper way of interpreting the Constitution had emerged as a major political battlefield in the new republic. Indeed, the proper interpretation of the Constitution is still controversial and arguments over its original meaning are as contentious today as they were more than 200 years ago. As he would throughout his first term in office, Washington sided with Hamilton against Madison and Jefferson. The chartering of the Bank of the United States was Hamilton’s second major victory in the struggle to define the character of the new republic. Hamilton’s report on the necessity of a federal mint was the one part of his program that Jefferson enthusiastically endorsed. Hamilton proposed a currency that would include a variety of coins in different denominations emblazoned with patriotic symbols. Jefferson not only recognized the need for a federal currency, but as a part-time inventor, he was also fascinated by the mechanics of minting money. Hamilton’s “Report on Manufactures” detailed the remaining part of his plan to reshape the American economy. He called for a comprehensive program to encourage domestic industry by providing incentives for industrial development and tariffs to help American industry compete against imported foreign goods, which were cheaper. Congress refused

 to follow Hamilton’s recommendation to raise these tariffs sharply. Hamilton’s more grandiose scheme to encourage industrial development generated little interest in Congress. Congress did enact new taxes, including one on whiskey. In the struggle to shape the new nation’s economy, Hamilton’s Federalists had defeated Jefferson, Madison, and the Republican opposition at nearly every turn. Hamilton was largely successful at implementing his visionary economic program.

Jefferson and Hamilton:
Contrasting Visions of
 the Republic Jefferson and Hamilton were a study in contrasts. Their backgrounds varied greatly: Jefferson was a southern slave owner; Hamilton, a northerner with abolitionist sympathies. Jefferson grew up a Virginia aristocrat, with every advantage; Hamilton was a self-made man who confessed that he was determined to escape his humble origins at almost any cost. Over several of the most important issues facing the new American nation, the two men found themselves in separate camps, as summarized in the table (6.4). In general, Hamilton sought to endow the national government with additional powers;

 Jefferson sought to limit the powers of the federal government and protect state authority. The two men also approached the economy from radically different philosophies. Hamilton’s idea of a thriving commercial republic was diametrically opposed to Jefferson’s vision of a nation of independent yeoman farmers. “While we have land to labour,” Jefferson wrote, “let us never wish to see our citizens occupied at a work bench.” Hamilton believed that America needed to emulate the powerful, diversified economy of Britain and foster commerce and manufacture. A gulf separated the two men over constitutional law as well. Hamilton believed in a broad, or loose, construction of the Constitution: The federal government had to have wide latitude to choose whatever means was best suited to accomplish its legitimate objects. Jefferson, by contrast, believed in a strict construction of the Constitution, so that the powers of the new government would be limited to those clearly established by the Constitution. In foreign affairs the two men also opposed one another. Hamilton was an Anglophile who believed that Britain’s path to economic power ought to guide America. Jefferson savored all things French, from wine to pastry. He thought America’s interests were better served by supporting France.

 CHAPTER 6

THE NEW REPUBLIC: AN AGE OF POLITICAL PASSION, 1789–1800

 Partisanship without Parties The idea of political parties was inimical to the republican values of the post-Revolutionary era. In the struggle over ratification in 1788, Madison had written in Federalist No. 10 that “the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties.” The partisan struggles that dominated American politics after ratification forced Madison to rethink his view of parties. In 1792, Madison conceded that in “every political society, parties are unavoidable.” Although Americans increasingly used terms like party to describe the bitter conflicts of the 1790s, the partisan alignments they described had not yet achieved the organized structure of modern political parties. Political conflict in the 1790s was a transitional phase in the evolution of a modern two-party system. Some historians describe this period as that of the first party system, but many characterize it as a proto-party system that set the stage for the later developments of modern parties. Indeed, although Americans were deeply divided politically, neither Federalists nor Republicans functioned as disciplined modern political parties. Neither group organized loyal supporters around well-defined messages at a national level. Nor did either side create permanent political structures that brought local and state politics under the umbrella of a coherent national organization. The partisan conflicts of this era produced two proto-parties, the Federalists and the Republicans.

A
New Type of Politician  Although the aristocratic Thomas Jefferson and James Madison dominated the Republican movement, its success owed much to a new type of politician whose expertise lay in mobilizing voters and creating effective political organizations. The most influential of these new politicians was Virginia’s John Beckley. In contrast to Jefferson and Madison, who were connected to the gentry elite that dominated political life in Virginia, Beckley rose from the status of an indentured servant to become the clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives. He became indispensable in advancing the Republican cause. Indeed, although aristocratic politicians such as Jefferson and Madison continued to view themselves as members of a virtuous elite who were not motivated by party spite, Beckley and others of this new class of professional politicians immersed themselves in the sometimes sordid task of coordinating campaigns and attacking their opponents. Beckley and other Republicans who did much of the grassroots organizing were more at home in taverns and coffee houses than they were in the elegant dinner parties that Jefferson and Madison attended. Having worked as a clerk, Beckley felt a kindred spirit with the artisans and merchants of New York

 City and Philadelphia. He felt a particular kinship with other self-made men, many of whom joined the Republican movement. Beckley’s life more closely resembled Hamilton’s than Jefferson’s. Yet Beckley threw himself into promoting Jefferson’s fortunes and attacking Hamilton. Gossip became one means of political warfare that Beckley developed to a fine art. He leaked information about an adulterous affair Hamilton was having with the wife of a shady financier. When the press reported rumors that Hamilton had provided sensitive financial information to his lover’s husband, Republican politicians pounced on Hamilton, who was forced to admit the affair but denied any financial improprieties. Beckley’s efforts weakened Hamilton but did not destroy the New Yorker’s influence among Federalists.

The Growth of the
Partisan Press
 The expansion of the press facilitated the rise of partisan politics. The number of newspapers increased, from around 100 in 1788 to well over 200 in 1800. While eastern ports still supported the majority of papers, many interior market towns also boasted papers by the 1790s. Many of these papers aligned

PARTISANSHIP WITHOUT PARTIES

 themselves with one or the other main political movements in the country. John Fenno’s Gazette of the United States, which he established “to endear the General Government to the people,” articulated the Federalist point of view. To combat Fenno’s influence, Jefferson and Madison persuaded the poet Philip Freneau to found the National Gazette, which rallied opposition to Hamilton and the Federalists. The resulting battle of words between the two publications intensified the already charged political atmosphere. Federalists and Republicans recognized that political success meant managing public opinion. “All power,” Madison noted, “has been traced to public opinion.” A free government, therefore, calls for “a circulation of newspapers through the entire body of the people.” Partisan rancor in the press grew during the 1790s. No person was sharper in his attacks than Federalist William Cobbett, who often wrote under the pen name Peter Porcupine, a choice that reflected his prickly personality and barbed writing. Jefferson lamented that “a single sentence got hold of by the ‘Porcupines,’ will suffice to abuse and persecute me in their papers for months.” Cobbett lambasted the Republicans as atheists and radical democrats who sought to destroy government. He compared the leading Republican newspaper, the Aurora, to “a lewd and common strumpet” whose illegitimate offspring were falsehood and slander. The Republicans replied with their own stinging attacks. This Republican political cartoon (6.5) casts Cobbett, literally represented as Peter Porcupine,” doing the devil’s work as he is encouraged by Great Britain, represented as a lion.



 Society asserted that public opinion “is the foundation of all our liberties, and constitutes the only solid groundwork for all our Rights.” In addition to publishing their sentiments about political issues, the societies staged celebrations, gave festive dinners, and sponsored public orations. Republicans viewed the societies as a way to improve understanding of political issues and refine public opinion. Federalists denounced these “self-created societies” for sowing the “seeds of jealousy and distrust of the government.” For Federalists, the societies not only sapped the people’s confidence in their government but also fomented radical ideas. Federalists viewed the role of elected representatives differently from Republicans. Federalists supported a more traditional republican ideal of virtue in which citizens deferred to the wisdom of their leaders once they had been placed in office. Republicans embraced a more democratic ideal in which the voice of the people could be brought to bear on public questions through organizations such as the Democratic-Republican Societies. 6.5 Peter Porcupine Liberty sits forlorn, while Federalist William Cobbett, “Peter Porcupine,” scribbles attacks and insults. The devil and the British lion (wearing a monarch’s crown) urge on the Porcupine. A Jay bird, symbolic of Jay’s Treaty, perches on the lion.

 The DemocraticRepublican Societies The emergence of a new type of political organization helped transform the political life of the new nation. Between 1793 and 1794, 35 Democratic-Republican Societies sprouted up across America. Although not official organs of the Republican movement, most of the societies had close ties to local Republican organizations. Their goal was to influence public opinion. The New York Democratic-Republican

THE NEW REPUBLIC: AN AGE OF POLITICAL PASSION, 1789–1800

Conflicts at Home and Abroad
 The French Revolution, the bloody toppling of the monarchy followed by the rise of a radical republican government, shocked Europe and profoundly affected American politics. Republicans supported the Revolution. Federalists quickly came to see it as the embodiment of evil and denounced its excesses. Revolutionary France soon became embroiled in conflict with Britain, and the two nations went to war with one another in 1793. Although Republicans and Federalists continued to support Washington, the contest over the vice presidency in 1792 demonstrated how divided America had become. Federalist John Adams defeated his Republican rival, the former Anti-Federalist George Clinton, but the Republicans carried the entire South. The line separating foreign affairs and domestic matters in the new Republic was often thin. America still needed to secure its borders against potentially hostile European powers. The British continued to occupy forts in the Old Northwest (the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan) and engaged in trade with Indians, including the sale of firearms. The Spanish presence in Florida and Louisiana gave them control of the Mississippi, a vital artery for Western trade. American shipping no longer enjoyed the protection of the British Navy. In the Mediterranean pirates based in North Africa harassed American ships and captured American sailors and cargoes. Resistance to Hamilton’s economic program erupted into violence in western Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Angry over the tax on whiskey, farmers turned to violence to vent their frustration. Washington felt compelled to call out the militia to quell the rebellion. The new federal government had survived its most serious test, but the repression of the rebellion did little to heal the divisions in American political life. 6.6 Revolutionary plate.

 mankind.” Republican James Madison added that events in France were “so glorious to this country, because it has grown as it were out of the American Revolution.” Pro-French Republicans began addressing each other as “citizen,” a custom borrowed from revolutionary France. Republican women followed suit, some using the term citizen and others citizeness or citess among themselves. When the French Revolution turned more radical and violent, however, many Americans began to re-examine their support for it. The execution of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette in 1793 outraged Federalists. This commemorative plate (6.6) showing the execution of the king captures the zeal of the French

 Revolution. The hand-painted plate prominently features the guillotine, a new device for executions developed in revolutionary France that used a heavy blade to decapitate its victims. The executioner proudly displays the king’s lifeless head as a trophy, a chilling reminder of the French Revolution’s radicalism. The French Revolution became a symbol for both Republicans and Federalists. The former championed the democratic ideals of the Revolution and excused its violence as a small price to pay for liberty. The latter decried its violence and radicalism. France’s new minister to the United States Edmund Genêt arrived two days after word of the execution of Louis XVI reached the U.S. in the spring of 1793. Philadelphia’s Republican women turned out in red, white, and blue to welcome him. Although Republican men wore the tricolor red-white-and blue cockade, a small rosette-like decoration, on their hats, women attached tricolor pins to their chests to affirm support for France. One sarcastic Federalist commentator described “these fiery frenchified dames” as “monsters in human shape.” (For additional discussion see Competing Visions: Jefferson’s and Hamilton’s Reactions to the French Revolution, page 171.) Federalists not only opposed the French Revolution, but events in France intensified their desire to align America with Britain. When revolutionary France declared war on Britain in 1793, Americans found themselves reluctantly drawn into European affairs. Attitudes toward France became a political lightning rod, concentrating and focusing political feelings for both Republicans and Federalists. The French Revolution came to symbolize many of the hopes and fears of Americans struggling to come to terms with their own revolutionary heritage. Republicans defined the Revolution by its ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity; Federalists focused on the Revolution’s bloody policies and saw it as confirmation of the danger of taking liberty and equality too far.

 Adams versus Clinton: A Contest for Vice President By 1792, Washington feared that partisan conflict might tear apart the political fabric of the nation. Although Hamilton and Jefferson’s mutual antagonism had hardened, both men agreed that Washington was the one figure who could



 rise above partisan squabbles and unite the nation. Hamilton implored Washington “to make a further sacrifice of your tranquility and happiness to the public good.” Although Republicans did not wish to challenge Washington directly, they decided to run the popular former Anti-Federalist Governor of New York, George Clinton, against John Adams for vice president. Republican newspapers praised Washington but charged that Adams was an avowed supporter of monarchy and aristocracy. Invoking recent events in France, one radical newspaper editor even suggested that the time had arrived in America to “lop off every unfruitful branch, and root out of the soil of freedom all of the noxious weeds of aristocracy.” Although Adams defeated Clinton by a comfortable margin, the sectional character of politics was evident in the electoral college. Clinton carried the entire South, the most solidly Republican region.

Diplomatic Controversies
 and Triumphs The new American nation had many diplomatic challenges, some arising from the French Revolution, but others stemming from unresolved issues with Britain. American ships no longer enjoyed the protection of the British navy. Closer to home, the British retained control of their forts in the Northwest, defying the Treaty of Paris (1783), which required them to relinquish them. Spain’s control of the Mississippi River and New Orleans, both of which were vital to the prosperity of the old Southwest (modern Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi), was another concern (6.7). War between France and Britain opened opportunities for American merchants, who traded with both sides. Although Britain remained America’s chief trading partner, trade with France was increasingly important. Britain hoped to use its naval advantage to cut off trade between France and other nations, including America. The British navy impounded more than 250 ships and cargoes of American merchants who violated the British blockade against France. Angry Republicans proposed an embargo on trade with the British. Federalists, however, argued that American economic wellbeing depended on good relations with Britain, not with France. President Washington appointed

 the respected Federalist from New York and chief justice of the Supreme Court, John Jay, as a special envoy to travel to London to negotiate a settlement. In 1783, Jay had helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris, ending conflict between America and Britain. Now in 1794, he negotiated a treaty (called Jay’s Treaty) by which Britain agreed to compensate America for cargoes seized in 1793–1794 and to vacate forts in the Northwest Territory. However, the British refused to accept the right of neutral nations to trade freely with belligerents. When the details of Jay’s Treaty were leaked to the press, Republicans were outraged, finding the treaty too generous to the British. Across the mid-Atlantic and South where Republican sympathies were strongest, protesters burned effigies of Jay and copies of the treaty. The treaty also provoked a fierce debate in Congress over the role of the House of Representatives in foreign affairs. Republican Congressmen demanded to see Jay’s negotiating instructions, believing that Federalists had never intended to exact major concessions from the British. The House

 even threatened to withhold funding to implement the treaty until the instructions were published. Federalists denounced this as an unconstitutional intrusion on the treaty-making powers of the president and the senate. Jay had negotiated with Britain from a position of weakness, but the American envoy charged with obtaining concessions from Spain was in a stronger position. The U.S. minister to Britain, Federalist Thomas Pinckney, traveled to Spain to begin negotiations about American access to the Mississippi and New Orleans. The result was Pinckney’s Treaty (1795), which secured America’s right to navigate the Mississippi River and use New Orleans. It also settled the boundary between America and Spanish Florida. Spain had feared that America might try to acquire Florida and Louisiana by force, so it was more than willing to cede favorable terms over trade and negotiate the boundary dispute between the two nations.

JEFFERSON’S AND HAMILTON’S REACTIONS TO THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
Thomas Jefferson and his Republican allies embraced the cause of the French Revolution. At the outset, even Alexander Hamilton, saw the Revolution as a victory for American ideals of liberty. The radical turn of the Revolution, however, particularly its zealous embrace of violence, caused Hamilton and other Federalists to abandon their support. Despite the increasingly bloody turn of events in France, Jefferson retained his faith in the essential justice of the Revolution’s goals. He believed that the Revolution’s accomplishments—the destruction of the old regime and of the institutions of aristocracy and monarchy—were worth the cost in blood. Federalists not only denounced France, but they took great pains to contrast Anglo-American concepts of ordered liberty with the licentiousness of the French Revolution. 
 For Jefferson, the Revolution’s contribution to the destruction of tyranny justified whatever means were necessary to accomplish its worthy ends. He compared the innocent victims of “revolutionary justice” to the casualties of war. What does Jefferson’s dogged support for the French Revolution reveal about his vision of politics?

Thomas Jefferson to William Short, Philadelphia Jan. 3. 1793


 In the early periods of the French Revolution, a warm zeal for its success was in this Country a sentiment truly universal. The love of Liberty is here the ruling passion of the Citizens of the United States pervading every class animating every bosom. As long therefore as the Revolution of France bore the marks of being the cause of liberty it united all hearts and centered all opinions. But this unanimity of approbation has been for a considerable time decreasing. The excesses which have constantly multiplied, with greater and greater aggravations have successively though slowly detached reflecting men from their partiality for an object which has appeared less and less to merit their regard.

DEAR SIR
The tone of your letters had for some time given me pain, on account of the extreme warmth with which they censured the proceedings of the Jacobins of France.... In the struggle which was necessary, many guilty persons fell without the forms of trial, and with them some innocent. These I deplore as much as any body, and shall deplore some of them to the day of my death. But I deplore them as I should have done had they fallen in battle. It was necessary to use the arm of the people, a machine not quite so blind as balls and bombs, but blind to a certain degree. A few of their cordial friends met at their hands, the fate of enemies. But time and truth will rescue and embalm their memories, while their posterity will be enjoying that very liberty for which they would never have hesitated to offer up their lives. The liberty of the whole earth was depending on the issue of the contest, and was ever such a prize won with so little innocent blood? My own affections have been deeply wounded by some of the martyrs to this cause, but rather than it should have failed, I would have seen half the earth desolated [and].... an Adam and an Eve left in every country, and left free....

 dealing with the Indian nations that occupied much of this land. The government also faced resentments from farmers over federal taxation of locally distilled whiskey. Settlers streamed into Western territories, invariably resulting in conflicts with the indigenous populations. In the Old Northwest, the Shawnee, Delaware, and Miami confederated to defend their lands against settlers’ incursions. In 1790, Little

 Turtle, a war chief of the Miami, led a pan-Indian force of twelve different tribes that defeated an American army led by General Josiah Harmar in Ohio. A year later Indians in Ohio dealt an even more crushing blow to an army led by General Arthur St. Clair. More than 900 American soldiers were killed or wounded, and St. Clair barely escaped with his life. These demoralizing defeats prompted a reorganization of the War Department. In 1794, a new, more professional army under General Anthony Wayne decisively defeated Ohio’s Indian tribes at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. In 1795, the Treaty of Greenville stipulated that the twelve Ohio tribes relinquish their claims on most of Ohio. In Indian cultures the signing of treaties was a ceremonial occasion in which certain rituals were observed, including the exchange of gifts. Indians gave this wampum belt (6.8), an important ceremonial item, to American negotiators at the Treaty of Greenville ceremony. Chippewa Chief Mash-i-pi-nash-i-wish explained the meaning of this gift: “When I show you this belt, I point out to you your children at one end of it, and mine at the other. . . . Remember, we have taken the Great Spirit to witness our present actions; we will make a new world, and leave nothing on it to incommode our children.” Wayne and the other American negotiators, however, did not understand the gift of wampum in the same way as the Chippewa did. For Americans, Indians had joined the American family as dependents, not equals. The most serious test of the new Republic’s ability to govern came in 1794, when anger over Hamilton’s economic policies turned violent. Resentment against the hated whiskey tax had festered since its enactment in 1791. The Whiskey Rebellion erupted when farmers from Pennsylvania and Kentucky took up arms to protest the whiskey excise tax. Distilling had long been important economically in western Pennsylvania and Kentucky, where farmers distilled grain into whiskey. Farmers could transport the alcohol more cheaply than the bulky and heavy grains from which it was produced. Whiskey also

 sold at a higher price than grain, so Western farmers could earn a higher profit on their crops. Protest against the whiskey tax began peacefully. Opponents of Federalist policy sought repeal of the law, and attacked it in the local press. As anger intensified, angry farmers drew on the rich traditions of protest that Americans had used during the Revolution, such as the one depicted in this contemporary cartoon (6.9). The scene shows angry tax protesters who have executed and burned in effigy a local tax collector. By July 1794, frustration turned violent. Five hundred western Pennsylvania farmers, many armed with muskets, marched on the home of a tax collector, John Neville, to intimidate him. Two protestors were killed in the attack and Neville’s house was burned to the ground. Two weeks later 6,000 armed men threatened to attack

 Pittsburgh if the government did not repeal the tax. Federalists and Republicans differed over the causes of the rebellion and how to respond to it. Federalists blamed the Democratic-Republican Societies for fomenting discord and favored a swift and decisive military response. Republicans faulted Hamilton’s economic program and counseled moderation and patience. For an analysis of Washington’s decision in dealing with this rebellion, see Choices and Consequences: Washington’s Decision to Crush the Whiskey Rebellion. After negotiations failed, Washington dispatched the militia and resistance to government authority crumbled. One hundred and fifty people were arrested, and two obscure figures were convicted of treason. Rather than see them become martyrs, however, Washington pardoned them.

THE NEW REPUBLIC: AN AGE OF POLITICAL PASSION, 1789–1800

Choices and Consequences
WASHINGTON’S DECISION TO CRUSH THE WHISKEY REBELLION
The armed resistance of Western farmers to the detested whiskey tax posed a serious dilemma for Washington. Should the president negotiate with the rebels or use force to put down the rebellion? Washington’s cabinet members differed over the best course of action. The Whiskey Rebellion tested the new government created by the Constitution. The situation was complicated by uncertainty over the militia. Even if Washington wished to use it, it was not clear if the militia would respond. During Shays’s Rebellion (Chapter 5), the militia had refused to fire on other citizens and sided with the rebels. Washington had to consider this issue and the larger question of how the new government ought to respond to a direct challenge to its authority. Washington had three choices: 
Choices




 Call up the militia and dispatch them to western Pennsylvania and crush the rebellion swiftly.



 Adopt a conciliatory posture, make concessions to the rebels, including repealing the tax, and thereby avoid an armed response.



 Offer the rebels a chance to end their protest; mobilize the militia and have it ready to march if the offer was rejected.

Decision
 Republican leaders outside the administration had hoped Washington would adopt a conciliatory posture and recognize that since an unjust tax was the root of the problem, it would make sense to accede to the rebels’ demands. Hamilton and other Federalists counseled a decisive show of force. Washington opted instead for the

 third choice. After efforts to peacefully persuade the rebels to stand down failed, he acted decisively to put down the rebellion. Concerns that the militias of neighboring states might side with the rebels proved unfounded. The rebels were no match for the militia, and the rebellion fizzled once troops marched westward.

Consequences
 Washington’s decision to put down the rebellion ended it in western Pennsylvania. In other parts of the nation, however, such as Kentucky, where support for tax resistance was more pervasive, resistance proved effective. In Kentucky few citizens were willing to act as tax collectors and juries were unlikely to

 convict people who refused to pay the taxes. One consequence of the rebellion was the undermining of the authority of the Democratic-Republican Societies, who were blamed for stirring up opposition to the government and fanning the resentments of the Whiskey Rebels.

Continuing Controversies
 Why were some Federalists reluctant to use force to put down the Whiskey Rebellion? Washington’s decision to use force has prompted controversy. Supporters of his actions argue that he wisely sought to demonstrate that armed resistance to government authority was not an affirmation of liberty, but threatened to undermine liberty and the rule of law. Detractors of Washington’s actions argue that Pennsylvania’s own government felt that it was unnecessary to mobilize the militia and that a peaceful resolution to the crisis was possible.

CULTURAL POLITICS IN A PASSIONATE AGE



Cultural Politics in a Passionate Age
 Politics seeped into every aspect of popular culture after the adoption of the Constitution. Even fashion became a political battleground, so much so that sporting the wrong color badge could lead to violence. The bitter political disputes of the day were also woven into the fabric of a new literary art form, the novel. Novels were particularly important to women, who were among the main readers of novels. In a few exceptional cases women even became successful authors of novels. The way the nation confronted race and slavery were influenced by the political conflicts of the era. The slave uprising in the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti) focused renewed attention on abolitionism and slavery.

Political Fashions and
Fashionable Politics
 Nearly every aspect of American culture was swept up in the political passions of the age. In the politically charged 1790s, political debates spilled over into the new nation’s streets and town squares. Ordinary citizens read newspapers or attended political meetings to keep abreast of the latest developments. They also used taverns to host political meetings where Federalists and their Republican opponents toasted everything from the militia to the French Revolution. Even the simple act of hoisting a glass of ale could become a political gesture, particularly when the press reported the accompanying toasts. Citizens marched in parades and even rioted to express their frustrations with political developments. Even fashion was swept up into the political conflicts. Americans signaled their political allegiances and foreign policy preferences by adopting the latest Paris or London styles. Republican supporters of the French Revolution adorned their hats with a tricolor cockade. Federalists favored a black cockade, a decoration soldiers had used during the American Revolution. By the end of the decade, sporting the “wrong” type of ornament on one’s hat in the streets of Philadelphia could easily trigger a riot.

Literature, Education,
 and Gender By the 1790s, Americans could choose from a staggering range of printed materials. In addition to the expansion of newspapers, books, magazines, broadsides, and pamphlets proliferated. The market for books increased dramatically in the 30 years between

 the American Revolution and 1800. The number of booksellers in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston almost quadrupled in that time. In the 1790s, 266 new lending libraries opened across America. The new libraries were not restricted to prosperous coastal cities, but as one contemporary noted, “in our inland towns of consequence, social libraries have been instituted composed of books designed to amuse rather than to instruct.” Although the cost of books may have been beyond those of modest means, a subscription to one of these libraries was often not. Americans could also turn to magazines for education and amusement. The titles of new magazines suggested an effort to appeal to both men and women. For example, The Gentlemen and Ladies Town and Country Magazine began publishing in 1789. The Lady’s Magazine and Repository of Entertaining Knowledge, founded in 1791 in Philadelphia, targeted the growing audience of female readers. The rise of a new literary form, the novel, in eighteenth-century England and France helped to spur the enormous expansion in America’s publishing industry. Some novelists wove political themes prominently into their tales. Americans eagerly consumed imported novels, and new works written by American authors also appeared. Women became an important audience for the novel; they also wrote many of the most successful early novels. Susanna Rowson’s Charlotte Temple, first published in England (1791), was reprinted in America in 1794, where the first edition quickly sold out. The story’s American setting made it particularly popular in the new republic. The moral of the novel was unmistakable. The heroine, Charlotte Temple, foolishly leaves England for America, where she elopes with a knave who reneges on his promise to marry her.

 How did fashion become politicized in the 1790s?



 CHAPTER 6

6.10 Allegory of
Female Education
 In this needlework, young Maria Crowninshield, a student at the Ladies Academy in Dorchester, Massachusetts, depicts a young student receiving instruction from a female teacher.

THE NEW REPUBLIC: AN AGE OF POLITICAL PASSION, 1789–1800

 Charlotte is abandoned, suffers physical and mental depredations, and dies soon after giving birth to a child out of wedlock. Immigrating to America in 1793, Rowson fared much better than Charlotte. After a brief career as an actress, Rowson established the Young Ladies’ Academy, in Boston (1797). Her curriculum included reading, writing, arithmetic, and needlework. Another female author, Judith Sargent Murray, became an outspoken advocate of equality and education for women. Her essay “On the Equality of the Sexes,” published in the Massachusetts Magazine in 1790 under the pen name “Constantia,” argued that women’s intellectual abilities were equal to those of men and that if properly educated women could equal men in accomplishment. Murray also used the novel to spread her ideals about the equality of the sexes. Her novel, The Story of Margaretta (1798), recast the conventions of sentimental novels such as Charlotte Temple to reflect her views of female education. Rather than fall prey to seduction, abandonment, and ruin, a fate typical of many female

 characters in popular novels, Margaretta uses her intelligence and superior education to avoid these perils. Murray helped found the Dorchester Ladies Academy in Massachusetts. A 15-year-old student at the academy, Maria Crowninshield, produced this allegory of female education (6.10). Although at one level this fine needlework conformed to the traditional ideas of female education, which included sewing skills, the subject matter signals the artist’s commitment to a modern expansive conception of female education. The young girl depicted is reading a copy of English author Hannah Moore’s Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education (1799). Moore’s book, which advocated an expansion of educational opportunities for women, was one of many tracts defending women’s education. The most radical voice demanding changes in women’s roles was Mary Wollstonecraft, an English writer whose A Vindication of the Rights of Women (1792) sparked a lively debate on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1790s about the need for equality of education for men and women.

Federalists, Republicans,
 and the Politics of Race The political passions and divisions of the age also extended to the politics of race. This became a major concern as a result of events in the Caribbean, where slaves in Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti) rose up against their French masters and seized control of the colony in 1791. Federalists and Republicans were divided over how to respond to events there. Toussaint L’Ouverture, a former slave, forged an all-black fighting force that routed the planters. America was forced to decide between supporting this slave revolution and siding with France which sought to repress it. At first the Washington administration supported the ruling white elite, but as L’Ouverture’s forces solidified their hold over Saint-Domingue, the American government accepted the need to establish stable relations with the new government. Indeed, as relations with France worsened, many Federalists began to urge Washington to strengthen relations with SaintDomingue, hoping to renew the lucrative trade with the former French colony. However, whereas Federalists supported recognition of SaintDomingue, Republicans in Congress opposed it.

CULTURAL POLITICS IN A PASSIONATE AGE

 Their opposition was motivated in part by their loyalty to France, which was eager to recapture the colony, but also reflected the party’s commitment to protecting slavery. Republicans feared that American slaves might emulate their oppressed brethren in the Caribbean. Saint-Domingue conjured up a nightmare for slave owners, such as the depiction of bloodletting during the revolution produced by a German engraver (6.11). Although fears of slave insurrection were most keen in the South, Northern Republicans also voiced concerns.



Congressman Albert Gallatin of Pennsylvania
 warned that supporters of L’Ouverture’s ideas might “spread their views among the Negro people there [in America] and excite dangerous insurrections among them.” Even among those most opposed to slavery, few were willing to support racial equality. Racist attitudes were found among ardent supporters of abolitionism. Images as History: Liberty Displaying the Arts and Sciences explores the tensions within early abolitionist thought.

LIBERTY DISPLAYING THE ARTS AND SCIENCES
In the 1790s, the Library Company of Philadelphia, a premier cultural institution founded in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin, commissioned Samuel Jennings’s painting Liberty Displaying the Arts and Sciences. The painting was to represent the ideals of the new American nation. What symbols does the artist include to show the cultural achievements of the new nation? How does he portray African Americans? The Library Company directors asked Jennings to include the goddess of liberty along with “Symbols of Painting, Architecture, Mechanics, Astronomy,” including a broken chain at the feet of the goddess, a symbol of the painting’s abolitionist sentiments. Although Jennings added his own ideas, he followed the directors’ suggestions. The painting reflected the influence of the classical world, including copies of the writings of Homer and Virgil, two of its greatest authors, but 
 The goddess of liberty holds a liberty pole topped by a liberty cap.

 Jennings did not slight the intellectual and cultural achievements of the modern world. He used books by John Milton and Shakespeare to represent modern literary achievements, at least of the English-speaking world. A telescope, symbol of the advancement of science, appears in the lower righthand corner. Finally, as instructed by his patrons, Jennings included the goddess of liberty with a liberty pole and cap, two symbols linked with the American Revolution. Jennings included a “Group of Negroes, who are paying Homage to Liberty, for the boundless Blessings they receive through her.” Cast in the subservient pose of bowing to liberty, the African Americans do not appear as masters of their own destinies. Nor does Jennings’s treatment suggest that African Americans created any of the cultural achievements of the new nation. Although abolitionist in sympathy, the painting does not endorse racial equality.

THE STORMY PRESIDENCY OF JOHN ADAMS



The Stormy Presidency of
John Adams
 George Washington did not seek a third term, a decision that set a precedent for subsequent presidents. (The unofficial two-term limit that Washington established bound presidents until 1940 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt won a third term.) In the election of 1796, the Federalist congressional caucus selected John Adams and Thomas Pinckney as candidates, while Republicans put forward Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. Party discipline, however, was lax. When the electoral college met and voted for president and vice president, 52 of the 136 electors voted for men not selected by either the Federalist or Republican congressional caucuses. Adams won the most votes and became president, and Jefferson polled the next most votes and became vice president. Although Adams defeated Jefferson, the bitter electoral contest intensified the partisan divisions within America. Conflict in Europe only exacerbated these tensions. Events in Europe threatened to drag America into war. Fearful that America was threatened from abroad and concerned that domestic radicals were undermining American interests, Federalists passed repressive measures that prompted Republicans to intensify their opposition to Federalist power and rally around their leader, Thomas Jefferson. In 1800, Jefferson again faced Adams in a presidential election. This time Jefferson won, but the election resulted in a tie between Jefferson and his vice-presidential running mate, Aaron Burr. The Constitution provided that under these circumstances, the House of Representative would determine the outcome. After a flurry of politicking, Federalists agreed to select Jefferson, who became president. In Richmond, Virginia, the debate over liberty inspired a slave named Gabriel to lead a rebellion to liberate Virginia’s slaves. Although the rebellion failed, it highlighted the inescapable conflict between American ideals of liberty and the realities of racial slavery.

 Washington’s Farewell Address Washington never wavered in his belief that he acted above party, but by the middle of his second term in office he had adopted most of Hamilton’s Federalist agenda, which prompted the most outspoken Republican editors to attack Washington. Rather than respond to these attacks directly, Washington used his Farewell Address, a written statement widely printed in newspapers across the nation in September 1796, to reiterate his political ideals. In his Farewell Address Washington attacked the growing factionalism, partisanship, and regional tensions in American politics. He warned the nation “in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the Spirit of Party, generally.” Recognizing

 that foreign policy disputes had been particularly divisive, he advised that America “steer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world.” Washington was not counseling strict isolation, but rather suggesting that America enter only into temporary alliances that served its interests. Above all, he wished to see America pursue a policy free of irrational hatreds or allegiances to foreign nations. The address sought to fuse idealism and realism into a workable approach to foreign policy. In this famous portrait of Washington done at the end of his presidency (1796), Gilbert Stuart created a painting filled with symbolism that captured the central role of Washington’s presidency in launching the new nation (6.12). When the painting was first displayed publicly, the announcement noted that Washington was “surrounded with allegorical emblems of his public life in the service of his country,

 which are highly illustrative of the great and tremendous storms which have frequently prevailed” but made clear that “these storms have abated, and the appearance of the rainbow is introduced in the background as a sign” of America’s bright future. Although Stuart’s portrait suggested that the nation had weathered its worst storms, the period after Washington’s retirement from politics was even more contentious. The election of 1796 was closely fought and bitterly divisive. John Adams defeated Thomas Jefferson by only three electoral votes. Intrigue had marred the election. Alexander Hamilton sought to undermine Adams’s candidacy by backing Thomas Pinckney, who was running with Adams. When Adams learned of Hamilton’s plan, he arranged to have his supporters in New England divert votes from Pinckney. The Constitution did not anticipate the rise of parties, nor did it envision the idea of presidential tickets with a designated candidate for president and vice president running together. The Founders’ system was simpler: The president was the candidate with the most votes, and the vice president was the runner up. In accordance with republican theory, this system would ensure that the executive contained the two men best qualified to lead the nation. When Federalist plots diverted votes from Pinckney, Jefferson received the second most votes and hence became the new vice president. The most obvious pattern in the election

 was regional. John Adams carried New England and most of the mid-Atlantic. Jefferson took the entire South and Pennsylvania (6.13).

The XYZ Affair and
 Quasi-War with France Adams, pictured in 6.14, assumed the presidency just as a crisis with France was coming to a head. In 1796, the French government, still angry over what it viewed as a pro-British tilt in American foreign policy, had recalled its diplomatic envoy. France began seizing American ships trading with Britain. Hoping to avert war, Adams sent three American envoys to France to negotiate a settlement: Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, John Marshall of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. At first, the French Directory, the revolutionary committee that ruled France from 1795 to 1799, snubbed the American delegation. When three French officials, identi-

 fied simply as “X,” “Y,” and “Z,” demanded a bribe from America’s diplomats as the price of beginning negotiations, public furor erupted over what was dubbed the XYZ Affair. These officials Popular Vote sought a bribe of $250,000 for Unknown themselves, a loan of over $10 million to France, and an ofUnknown ficial apology from President Adams for unflattering remarks Unknown he had made about the French government. In a contemporary Unknown political cartoon (6.15) the fiveheaded “monster” of the French Directory (it had five members) demands a bribe from America’s Unknown ambassadors. The XYZ Affair galvanized Americans, who united behind Adams’s decision to prepare for war by increasing allocations for the military. “Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute,” became the rallying cry. Hamilton’s allies among the Federalists sought a declaration of war against France, but Adams resisted them. Instead an undeclared naval war broke out between France and America. This QuasiWar lasted almost two

 years from 1798 to 1800. In addition to creating a new Department of the Navy, Congress tripled the size of the regular army and created a special provisional army numbering 50,000 men. Washington reluctantly agreed to head the provisional army if Hamilton were appointed his second in command, a request that would have given Hamilton authority over many military leaders more experienced than he. Hamilton’s bold effort to elevate himself above so many other qualified officers angered many Federalists who aligned themselves with Adams. Federalists were now divided into Adams and Hamilton factions.

 Why did the Federalists believe it was vital to American security to restrict immigration?

The Alien and Sedition Acts
 Federalists enacted a broad program to deal with the threats posed by the Quasi-War. To pay for the enormous expansion of the military, the Federalistcontrolled Congress passed a new property tax on land, slaves, and buildings. Federalists in Congress then proposed laws, the Alien and Sedition Acts, to protect America from foreign and domestic subversion. The Alien Acts, which included three separate laws, made it more difficult to become a citizen and gave the government far-reaching powers to

THE STORMY PRESIDENCY OF JOHN ADAMS

 deport resident aliens. The Sedition Act made it a crime to “combine or conspire together with the intent to oppose any measure or measures of the government of the United States.” The act criminalized any attempt to “write, print, utter, or publish” statements “false, scandalous, or malicious” against “the government of the United States, or either house of Congress of the United States, or the President.” Conspicuously absent were penalties for attacking Republican Vice President Thomas Jefferson. The Federalist press was free to hurl whatever invectives it chose at Jefferson with impunity. Federalists used the Sedition Act to prosecute 25 people, all Republican sympathizers, including printers, outspoken politicians, and other prominent figures. Federalists even prosecuted one drunken Republican for declaring that he did not care if a cannon salute to President Adams “fired thro’ his a—.” The harshest sentence, a $400 fine and an 18-month prison sentence, went to David Brown, an itinerant preacher and political agitator who had raised a liberty pole in Dedham, Massachusetts, with a placard that read “No Stamp Act, No Sedition, no Alien Bills, no Land Tax: downfall to the Tyrants of America, peace and retirement to the President, long live the Vice-President.” Republicans had tried to use every constitutional means at their disposal to protest the Sedition Act. They first sought to petition Congress to repeal it and then tried to use the courts to challenge its constitutionality. When both of these means failed, Republicans cast about for a new strategy. In 1798, Madison and Jefferson articulated such a strategy in two separate documents, the Virginia Resolution (by Madison) and the Kentucky Resolution (by Jefferson) Both documents defended the rights of the states to judge the constitutionality of federal laws and if necessary to protect their citizens against the federal government. Republicans based this idea on the notion that the Constitution was a compact among the people of the states who not only retained all powers not delegated to the new government but also retained a right to judge when acts of the federal government violated the Constitution. Neither Madison nor Jefferson took the next logical step and asserted a right of the states to actively nullify an unconstitutional act of the federal government. Both men hoped that the states would use persuasion, not force, to challenge an unconstitutional exercise of federal power. In keeping with this notion, Virginia

 and Kentucky distributed their resolutions to the other state legislatures hoping that other states would also rally against the Sedition Act. However, legislatures in the Federalist-dominated New England states attacked the resolutions as dangerous and unconstitutional assertions of state power. Federalists argued that the final arbiter of the constitutionality of acts of Congress ought to be the federal courts, not the state legislatures. Angered by the northern Federalist legislatures’ reactions, Jefferson authored a second set of Kentucky Resolutions (1799). In these, he introduced the constitutional doctrine of nullification, which asserted that states could nullify unconstitutional laws. Jefferson did not explain how a state would accomplish the goal of constitutional nullification. The Virginia and Kentucky resolutions became the foundation for subsequent arguments about states’ rights, the theory that the Constitution was a compact among the states and that the individual states retained the right to judge when the federal government’s actions were unconstitutional. The Alien and Sedition crisis also led to the development of a new theory of freedom of the press. This new theory, the basis for modern theories of freedom of the press, argued that political opinions were not subject to government control. Rather than try to limit dissenting ideas, the new view embraced the idea of a marketplace of ideas. More speech, not less, was the antidote to the threat posed by dangerous ideas.

The Disputed
Election of 1800
 The Quasi-War with France, which was winding down by 1800, had split Federalists into two factions. Although Adams supported a military build up, he never abandoned hope of a negotiated settlement. Hamilton, by contrast, believed that war with France provided an opportunity to crush domestic opposition and forge an alliance with Britain. Adams had little interest in such grandiose schemes, which may have included vague plans for a joint Anglo-American conquest of Spanish America. The president also resented Hamilton’s meddling in his administration. Changes in the French government now made a peaceful solution likely. The radical phase of the French Revolution ended when Napoleon

 Bonaparte, an ambitious general, seized control of France in 1799. Eager to gain U.S. support for his military campaigns against Spain and Britain, Napoleon negotiated a treaty with Adams that ended the naval conflict. However, Adams’s statesmanlike effort to seek peace angered Hamiltonians. Adams also privately attacked Hamilton’s “British faction.” In turn, believing that Adams lacked the resolve to deal with France or the Republicans, Hamilton published a pamphlet denouncing the president. The split among Federalists could hardly have come at a worse time: The election of 1800 loomed. The election of 1800 presented a clear choice between Federalist Adams and Republican Jefferson. Each party indulged in more rancorous campaigning than either side had experienced in previous elections. Federalists attacked Jefferson as an atheist and radical supporter of the French Revolution, themes captured in this political cartoon (6.16), which shows Jefferson in league with the devil. One Connecticut minister declared, “I do not believe that the Most High will permit a howling atheist to sit at the head of this nation.” Republicans, in

 turn, prayed for deliverance from “Tories; from Aristocrats.” Despite dire predictions about the dangers of electing Jefferson—some New Englanders hid their family Bibles, fearing that President Jefferson might confiscate them—Republicans garnered enough votes to win. Still, the election was close. As the map (6.17) shows, support for Adams was strongest in New England, while Jefferson carried the South and parts of the mid-Atlantic. Only eight votes marked the margin of victory between the two sides. The Republican victory triggered a constitutional crisis that few would have predicted. The actual vote in the electoral college had produced a tie between Jefferson and the Republican candidate for vice president, Aaron Burr. The Constitution did not direct electors to cast separate ballots for president and vice president. A tie meant that the sitting House of Representatives, dominated by Federalists, would decide the election. The new Republican-dominated House would not take its seats until March 1801. The political situation was tense. Rumors of deals and conspiracies circulated widely. Pennsylvania and Virginia both mobilized their militias, a clear message that they would not sit by while scheming politicians in Congress cast aside the will of the people. The politicians indeed schemed and negotiated, thus making resolution of the deadlock time consuming. Many Federalists believed that Jefferson was a fanatic, viewing Burr as a safer alternative. Alexander Hamilton, however, who had been Burr’s rival in New York politics for more than a decade, disagreed. Rather than see Burr win, Hamilton persuaded Federalists that Jefferson was the lesser of the two evils. Jefferson had also assured Federalists, including Hamilton, that he would not undermine all hard-won Federalist policies of the previous decade. With Hamilton’s support and assurances from Jefferson, a deal was finally struck. It took five days and 35 ballots before the House finally elected Jefferson. Jefferson’s victory averted another constitutional crisis. Despite the mobilization of the Virginia and Pennsylvania militias while the House was voting, the election of 1800 peacefully transferred power from Federalists to Republicans, a notable achievement given the tense political atmosphere of the 1790s. To avert future deadlock in presidential elections, the Twelfth Amendment, adopted in 1804, required that electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president.

Jeffersonian
America
An Expanding Empire of Liberty,
1800–1824
 In 1800, Republican Thomas Jefferson won the presidential election against his Federalist opponent John Adams. After nearly a decade in opposition, Republicans celebrated their presidential triumph with toasts and songs about “Jefferson and Liberty.” Federalists, however, feared that the new president—whom they had denounced as an atheist, a tool of the French, and a supporter of Thomas Paine’s radical democratic ideas—would undo all their work of the previous decade. In this Federalist political cartoon from 1800, Mad Tom in a Rage, Jefferson’s ally Thomas Paine and the Devil tear down the federal edifice created by Washington and Adams. The Federalist fears captured in the cartoon were not only unfounded, but President Jefferson turned out to be a very different person from Vice President Jefferson, the leader of the Republican opposition during the Adams administration. Rather than mount a full-scale attack on Federalist policy, Jefferson adopted a less confrontational approach. In his presidential inaugural, he struck a conciliatory tone and reminded Americans: “We are all republicans—we are all federalists.” Jefferson also promised the nation “a wise and frugal government.” Implementing this, however, proved difficult as he took over the reigns of power in his first term. The opportunity to purchase the Louisiana Territory and double the size of the new nation, led him to cast aside constitutional strict construction, which restricted the powers of the federal government to those explicitly delegated by the Constitution. By the end of Jefferson’s second term in 1809, some Americans believed that the Jeffersonian Republicans had become indistinguishable from their Federalist opponents. Jefferson’s anointed successor, James Madison, made additional compromises that some of his supporters believed betrayed the ideas he had championed as a member of the Republican opposition in the 1790s. Foreign affairs proved especially vexing for both Jefferson and Madison. Each man had tried to prevent American entanglement in the war between Britain and France. Despite their efforts, however, America was dragged into the European conflict, eventually going to war against Britain in 1812. Although the war was fought against the British, the conspicuous losers in the conflict were the Indian tribes in the Northwest and Southwest, who lost a valuable ally in Britain and suffered defeats by American troops. The demands of fighting the war also forced Republicans to reconsider the necessity of much of Hamiltonian economic policy. By the end of the presidency of James Monroe in 1825, the fourth Virginian to become president, the old political labels of Republican and Federalist had become nearly meaningless, and were soon to be supplanted by two new political parties.

 “The revolution of 1800 was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form; not effected, indeed, by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people.” THOMAS JEFFERSON to Judge Spenser Roane, 1819





 CHAPTER 7

JEFFERSONIAN AMERICA: AN EXPANDING EMPIRE OF LIBERTY, 1800–1824

Politics in Jeffersonian America
 Jefferson’s presidential triumph in 1800 ushered in a new era in American political life. After a decade of Federalist rule, and despite the courts remaining bastions of Federalist power, Republicans now controlled the presidency and Congress. Despite Jefferson’s efforts to avoid the bitter partisanship that had characterized politics during the previous decade, American politics remained deeply divisive. In an age when gentlemen lived by a code of honor, political insults could easily turn into personal affronts, and might result in tragic results. Before the end of his presidency, Jefferson’s vice president, Aaron Burr, would slay Jefferson’s longtime opponent, Alexander Hamilton, in a duel, and Burr would become a fugitive from justice. Former president John Adams sarcastically observed that his fellow citizens had made great strides in the “arts of lying and libeling and the other arts which grow out of them, such as wielding the cudgel and pistol.”

Liberty and Small
Government
 Jefferson set out his views of government in his inaugural address on March 4, 1801. Although he invoked shared values, including faith in representative government and the rule of law, Jefferson also made clear how his idea of government differed from that of his opponents. Throughout the 1790s, Federalists had worked to endow the new government of the United States with sufficient power to become a great nation, modeled on Britain’s commercial and military might. Following Hamilton’s lead, Federalists had increased the size of the central government and military and had also used their expansive view of federal power to crush political opposition. By contrast, Jefferson hoped to reduce the size of the federal government. Jefferson invoked the ideal of liberty, not power. He described the state governments as the proper defenders of liberty. In contrast to Federalists, who supported a national bank and enacted a host of taxes, including the unpopular whiskey tax, Jefferson sought to reduce the burdens government placed on the people. Rather than favor commerce he emphasized the “encouragement of agriculture” with “commerce as its handmaid.” To achieve “economy in public expense,” he would scale back the size of government. An alert citizenry, a vigorous militia, and strong state governments were the foundation upon which to build America’s future. Finally, opposing laws such as the Sedition Act, Jefferson praised freedom of the press, reminding Americans that political conflict was a testimony to the vitality of American life, not a sign of weakness.

 What does Monticello reveal about Jefferson’s values?

The Jeffersonian Style
 Jefferson’s inaugural not only set out his philosophical differences with Federalists but also gave him the occasion to dramatize them. Jefferson’s vision had always melded democratic ideals to aristocratic tastes. He labored to create a different presidential style from those who came before him. Jefferson loathed the pomp and ceremony that Washington and Adams had used to exalt the presidency. Rather than ride to his inaugural in an elegant coach, Jefferson walked behind a small band of Maryland militia. Instead of delivering his annual address to Congress from a monarch-like throne as his predecessors had done, he had a clerk read them. Jefferson also rejected the elegant balls that Federalists had staged during the Washington and Adams presidencies as smacking too much of European-style monarchy. Abandoning the pomp and aristocratic style of his predecessors and replacing it with a more democratic style defined the public face of Jefferson’s presidency. Yet, Jefferson remained a rich Virginian slaveholder whose tastes were anything but common. Although Jefferson dispensed with much of the formality of his predecessors, his presidency still reflected his aristocratic tastes. Dinner with Jefferson involved an unusual mix of informality and aristocratic style. He dressed informally when he entertained guests, wearing a pair of worn leather slippers, which shocked those used to the formality of Washington and Adams. Yet those invited to Monticello, the home Jefferson designed himself, in the mountains of western Virginia (7.1), found themselves in an architectural masterpiece that confidently proclaimed its owner’s wealth and exquisite

 taste. The food and wine served at these dinners were equally impressive. Jefferson regaled his dinner guests with the sensual delights of his table and the dazzling brilliance of his conversation, which ranged over everything from philosophy to agriculture. A connoisseur of fine wines, Jefferson’s annual wine bill for his first term in office came to $2,400, almost ten times the yearly income of a typical artisan.

Political Slurs and the Politics
 of Honor Literate and urbane, Thomas Jefferson was deeply influenced by the Enlightenment, particularly its emphasis on reason and science. One of his many interests was fossils. Jefferson wrote about mammoths in his book Notes on Virginia. Four months after his inauguration, his friend, the artist Charles Wilson Peale, set out to exhume the remains of a mastodon in upstate New York. President Jefferson, enthusiastically supporting Peale, even authorized the use of U.S. military equipment to aid in the dig. The expedition proved to be a monumental undertaking, as reflected in Peale’s painting of the event (7.2). The disinterment of the giant fossil testified to American ingenuity. To Jefferson, the expedition was a symbol of the new nation’s commitment to the values of the Enlightenment. His interest in fossils and mastodon bones, however, provided an easy target for his enemies, who mocked him as “the mammoth philosopher” or the “mammoth of democracy.” In response, his supporters attempted to turn Jefferson’s passionate interest in

 mastodons to his advantage. The president was presented with a “mammoth cheese” weighing more than 1,200 pounds. The delivery of the cheese to the president became a sensation and filled newspaper columns for months. Mammoth jokes, however, were among the milder partisan attacks leveled at Jefferson. His lavish home at Monticello also prompted sarcastic comments. Federalists pointed out the obvious contradiction between the president’s support for democracy and his own aristocratic tastes in architecture, food, and wine. His enemies also highlighted the contradiction between Jefferson’s impassioned defense of liberty and his life as a slaveholder. Monticello was a large working plantation and was therefore home to a sizable African American slave community. Indeed, as the chart and illustration in Envisioning Evidence: The World of Slavery at Monticello show, slaves vastly outnumbered Monticello’s free white population, which included Jefferson’s family and white laborers on the mountaintop.

THE WORLD OF SLAVERY AT MONTICELLO
As the pictogram below illustrates, at Monticello, Thomas Jefferson and his family were surrounded by a large community of African American slaves who worked in the kitchens and gardens, and served as skilled craftsmen. Jefferson owned as many as 150 slaves and he employed them in a variety of occupations at Monticello and on the other lands he owned. Slaves worked the fields, built furniture, manufactured nails, cooked Jefferson’s meals, and worked in a variety of other occupations that made it possible for him to maintain his aristocratic lifestyle. Compared to the splendor of the main house at Monticello, the typical dwelling of a slave was extremely humble. Who Lived at Monticello? Thomas Jefferson and his family lived at Monticello with enslaved African Americans and free European and American craftsmen.

 What role did slavery play in life at Monticello?

POLITICS IN JEFFERSONIAN AMERICA

 Jefferson’s slaves were housed in cramped and primitive dwellings. The contrast between these humble slave shacks and the mansion inhabited by Jefferson and his family provided a striking visual contrast to anyone who visited Monticello. Attacks on the president became intensely personal. One of Jefferson’s former supporters, the disgruntled newspaper editor James Callender, accused Jefferson of taking Sally Hemings, a Monticello slave, “as his concubine.” This political cartoon (7.3) portrays Jefferson as a cock courting the hen Sally Hemings. The press charged that the president had a slave mistress, and tales of Jefferson’s “Monticellan Sally” appeared in newspapers. Although Jefferson ignored these accusations, the Sally Hemings scandal persisted long after he left the presidency. Among the descendents of Monticello’s slaves, the belief that Jefferson had fathered children with Sally Hemings became part of a family oral tradition that persisted for more than two centuries. Many descendents of Jefferson and modern scholars doubted the truth of these rumors until modern forensic DNA testing provided strong evidence that a male in Jefferson’s blood line was the likely father of at least one child by Sally Hemings. Although not everyone has been persuaded, many scholars now believe that Jefferson did have a sexual relationship with Hemings. Federalist attacks on Jefferson went well beyond slurs on his character. His most vocal critics charged that had white Southerners not been entitled to count three-fifths of their slaves in apportioning electoral votes in 1800, (part of the compromise worked out in the Constitutional Convention, see Chapter 5) Jefferson would have lost to Adams. However, the charge that Jefferson was a “Negro President” was not entirely true, since he won clear majorities in the North and mid-Atlantic and his margin in the Electoral College would have been even greater if presidential electors from those regions had more accurately reflected the popular vote in the states that supported Jefferson. Jefferson was not the only politician whose reputation was dragged through the mud. Attacks on character were frequent, and in a culture in which honor played a central role, they demanded an appropriate response. If an apology or retraction were not forthcoming, a man might demand satisfaction on the field of honor, resulting in a duel. Leading politicians participated in duels, and gentlemen typically owned dueling pistols. Often, friends intervened and prevented a duel from reaching its deadly conclusion. Efforts to avert tragedy

Burr’s candidacy for governor of New York in 1804 was undermined by Hamilton’s attacks. A newspaper reported that Hamilton had described the vice president as “a dangerous man and one who ought not be trusted with the reins of government.” Hamilton also insulted Burr’s personal integrity and honor. Burr demanded an apology. When Hamilton refused, Burr challenged him to a duel. On July 11, 1804, the two men met across the river from New York City in Weehawken, New Jersey, and Burr fatally shot Hamilton. Authorities in both New York and New Jersey immediately charged Burr with murder, and he fled to Philadelphia, where he remained a fugitive. News of the duel spread through the country. In Baltimore, angry citizens burned the vice president in effigy. Eventually, the charges against Burr were dropped; although dueling was still illegal in most states, duelers were rarely prosecuted.

An Expanding Empire of Liberty
 Many of Jefferson’s supporters hoped that the new president would radically restructure the balance of power between the states and the federal government. Mandan w They would be disappointed. Rather than a wholesale assault on the Hamiltonian Cheyenne Sioux system, Jefferson opted for a more modest, less confrontational approach. The exception was the judiciary. The Federalists had expanded and seeded it with opponents of Jefferson, presenting him with a major challenge. Still Jefferson believed that his election had ushered in a revolutionary change that altered the course of America’s future. Jefferson’s vision for the future depended on preserving his ideal of a yeoman republic. Perhaps his greatest challenge was posed by the unexpected opportunity to purchase the entire Louisiana Territory from the French Emperor Napoleon. To justify this purchase, which required an enormous and unprecedented exercise of federal power, Jefferson would need to accept a Hamiltonian view of the Constitution. Jefferson’s vision of an expanding “empire of liberty” peopled by independent yeoman farmers came into conflict with his vision of limited government. ouri R.

Dismantling the
Federalist Program
 Jefferson’s approach to change in government was moderate and conciliatory. Instead of purging all Federalists, he dismissed only those who were corrupt, inept, or who posed serious obstacles to his agenda. Similarly, although Jefferson had contemplated declaring the Sedition Act unconstitutional, he simply refused to bring forward any new indictments, pardoning individuals prosecuted by Federalists and allowing the law to expire. Jefferson remained committed to the ideal of a republican system in which the states, not the federal government, retained most authority. The powers of the federal government pertained to “the external and mutual relations only of these states.” The

 states were responsible for the “principal care of our persons, our property.” With states’ rights in mind, Jefferson reduced the size of the federal government. He directed Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin to eradicate the national debt created by the Federalists. Gallatin severed the connection between the Bank of the United States and the federal government, using the sale of the government’s interest in the bank to lower the national debt. To make up for the loss of income from the repeal of unpopular taxes, Jefferson relied on the sale of Western lands and tariffs on imports. Convinced that the militia could protect America’s peacetime interests, he slashed the budget of the navy and the army, sharply reducing the size of both. This decision would create problems for Jefferson in his second term. Without a powerful navy to protect American merchant ships, France and Britain could threaten the new nation’s commerce.

AN EXPANDING EMPIRE OF LIBERTY

 justices from six to five. (The reduction would take effect upon the death or retirement of one of the sitting justices.) By reducing the number of Supreme Court justices, Federalists hoped to minimize the likelihood that Jefferson would appoint a justice during his tenure. Jefferson instructed Secretary of State James Madison to withhold any of the new appointments that arrived after he was to be sworn in as president. A disappointed office seeker, William Marbury, sued Madison, seeking a court order to compel Jefferson to turn over his commission. In what became a landmark in American constitutional law, Marbury v. Madison (1803) strengthened the powers of the federal judiciary, fixing the doctrine of judicial review as a cornerstone of American constitutional law. See Choices and Consequences: John Marshall’s Predicament on page 196.

The Louisiana Purchase
 In his first Inaugural Address, Jefferson described America as a “chosen country, with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation.” To remain a republic of virtuous yeoman farmers and keep alive the ideal of an “empire of liberty,” the nation, he argued, would have to expand westward. Jefferson’s vision of an expanding empire of liberty, however, had little room for African Americans and demanded that Indians either assimilate or perish. The first test of the limits of the President’s vision, especially his concept of liberty, became apparent in his response to news of Gabriel’s Rebellion, the slave uprising in Virginia, in 1800 (see Chapter 6). The uprising prompted soulsearching by white Virginians, including a proposal to emancipate slaves and settle them on Western lands. Virginia’s Governor James Monroe took this proposal seriously and sought the president’s advice. Jefferson opposed the plan, however, because he viewed such lands as vital to America’s future. He did not wish to see land that could go to whites and help preserve his vision of a yeoman republic set aside for blacks. The West was essential to Jefferson’s vision of the nation. When he took office, more than 500,000 Americans lived west of the Appalachian Mountains; access to the Mississippi River had become crucial to their prosperity. Agricultural produce destined for New Orleans traveled on large flat boats down the Mississippi. Pinckney’s Treaty (1795) with Spain provided navigation rights to this vital economic corridor. When the Spanish ceded



 Louisiana to France in 1800, they also turned over control of the Mississippi to Napoleon Bonaparte, France’s ambitious military ruler. Napoleon’s decision to close New Orleans to American shipping alarmed many in Congress. Some Americans advocated seizing the city. Preferring a negotiated settlement, Jefferson sent a delegation to France to purchase the port from Napoleon. When they arrived in Paris, the envoys were astounded to learn that Napoleon was willing to sell all of Louisiana to the United States. Acquisition of Louisiana would double the size of the United States; but the Constitution did not authorize the president to purchase new territory. To fulfill his dream of securing enough land for the nation to remain a yeoman republic, Jefferson had to abandon his constitutional philosophy of strict construction, which limited the powers of the federal government to those expressly delegated by the Constitution. Although Jefferson contemplated amending the Constitution to enable such a purchase, he feared that Napoleon might withdraw his offer before an amendment could be ratified. So Jefferson abandoned his constitutional ideals to achieve his political objective. With the Louisiana Purchase, the United States acquired the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803, thereby securing control of the Mississippi River and virtually doubling the size of the new nation (7.4 on page 197).

 “There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans, through which the produce of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market, and from its fertility it will ere long yield more than half of our whole produce and contain more than half our inhabitants.”

Choices and Consequences
JOHN MARSHALL’S PREDICAMENT
The case of Marbury v. Madison pitted President Jefferson against the new Federalist Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Marshall. Jefferson, a champion of states’ rights, resented the Federalist-controlled judiciary and, in particular, Marshall, an ardent nationalist who supported a strong central government and a powerful judiciary. Marbury v. Madison presented Marshall with a tremendous opportunity to enhance the power of the court, but it also set up the possibility of a serious conflict between the court and the executive branch. Could Marshall compel Jefferson to deliver the commission against his will? What if Jefferson refused the court order? Although Marshall sought to strengthen the power of the court, a direct confrontation with Jefferson might have the opposite effect if Marshall ruled against the president and Jefferson ignored the court’s ruling. Marshall had three possible options. 
Choices




 Give Marbury his commission.

Continuing
Controversies
 What role should judicial review play in a democracy? The power of unelected judges to overturn acts of the legislature struck many Americans in Jefferson’s day as undemocratic and inconsistent with representative government. Modern critics still argue that judicial review is undemocratic. Supporters of judicial review argue that the courts serve a necessary countermajoritarian role. By protecting minorities against overbearing majorities, a strong judiciary with the power of judicial review safeguards individual liberty. The controversy that began with Marbury v. Madison continues to this day.

 How did John Marshall avoid a showdown with Jefferson in Marbury v. Madison?



 Deny Marbury the commission.



 Acknowledge the legitimacy of Marbury’s claim, while somehow avoiding a showdown between the court and the executive branch.

Decision
 Marshall stated emphatically that Marbury was entitled to the commission. But he asserted just as strongly that he could not order Madison to deliver the commission because the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. Thus, Marshall used a technical legal issue to avoid a showdown between the executive and the judiciary. To arrive at this result, Marshall declared part of an earlier law, the Judiciary Act of 1789, unconstitutional.

John Marshall


Consequences
 Legal scholars usually regard Marbury v. Madison as one of the most important and brilliant opinions in Supreme Court history. Marshall gave all the parties in the case a partial victory. By affirming that Marbury was entitled to the commission, Marshall gave him a moral victory, while also handing Jefferson a practical political victory. His ruling strengthened the concept of judicial review, the notion that courts might overturn acts of the legislature when they conflicted with the Constitution, thus giving the biggest victory to the Supreme Court, whose power was enhanced.

7.4 Louisiana Purchase
 Jefferson acquired approximately 827,000 square miles of Western territory, doubling the size of the United States. One of the primary goals of the Lewis and Clark expedition was to map this region.

Lewis and Clark
 In January 1803, six months before news of the purchase of Louisiana, Jefferson had requested funds from Congress for an expedition to explore and map the Western parts of the continent. Meriwether Lewis, Jefferson’s private secretary, headed the expedition. Lewis invited Captain William Clark, an army officer with experience in mapmaking, to join him in commanding a “Corps of volunteers for North Western Discovery.” Beginning their heroic trek westward in the frontier town of St. Louis, the intrepid explorers set out on keelboats, long narrow boats that could carry ten tons of supplies. The expedition traveled up the Missouri River. Progress was slow and the explorers sometimes had to wade along the bank to pull the boats forward by ropes.

 Still, if all went well, they could travel 14 miles on a good day. The purchase of Louisiana added a new element to the mission. In addition to gathering information about native plants, animals, and geography, Lewis was charged with negotiating commercial treaties with Indian tribes and informing the European and American traders inhabiting the Louisiana Territory that they were now subject to the laws of the United States. The small band of explorers included a French interpreter, Toussaint Charbonneau, and his Shoshone wife, Sacagawea, who served the corps ably as a translator. Her presence also signaled the Indians that Lewis and Clark’s intentions were peaceful. An armed group of men might have easily been viewed as a war party. The inclusion of

 7.5 Jefferson’s Indian Hall at Monticello Jefferson’s main entrance hall contained many Indian artifacts, including a Mandan buffalo-hide robe which hung from the balcony (far right). The images painted on these robes often depicted heroic exploits of the warriors who wore them.

 Sacagawea and her young child—neither could be perceived as a warrior—helped the Corps of Discovery avoid conflict. Clark stressed the importance of this when he wrote in his journal, “a woman with a party of men is a token of peace.” Enduring incredible hardship, including temperatures as low as 45 below zero, the Corps of Discovery traversed almost 4,000 miles. The trek took more than two years. The map (7.4) shows the path of Lewis and Clark. The Corps provided invaluable information about the geography, biology, and peoples of the West. Jefferson had instructed Lewis and Clark to obtain information about the indigenous cultures they encountered, including their languages, traditions, and occupations. Although gathering intelligence would prove invaluable for future diplomatic negotiations and trade with these peoples, Jefferson’s instructions also reflected his lifelong interest in Indian cultures. Many items that Lewis

 and Clark collected were displayed in Jefferson’s “Indian Hall” at Monticello. Many Indian artifacts were on view in this space, including an impressive Mandan buffalo robe which hangs above the entrance to the room (7.5).

Indian Responses to
Jeffersonian Expansionism:
Assimilation or Revivalism
 Jefferson’s interest in the Indians was motivated by a paternalistic regard for Indians and Indian cultures. He believed that Indian societies, although inferior to Western culture, had a primitive nobility worthy of respect. In choosing to view Indians this way, Jefferson carried forward a much older notion of noble savagery that had warped European views of Indians since their first encounters more than 300 years earlier.

Watch the Video Video Lecture: Lewis and Clark:
 What were they trying to accomplish?

AN EXPANDING EMPIRE OF LIBERTY

 A student of the Enlightenment, Jefferson also believed that environment shaped culture. Taken together these two beliefs led him to be cautiously optimistic in his view of the future of AmericanIndian relations, a noticeable contrast with his deeply pessimistic view of future relations between enslaved African Americans and white Americans. Indians simply needed to abandon their traditional ways, and adopt Western agriculture and cultural values. Once they shed their traditions, Indians could then freely intermarry with whites. Assimilation and absorption would solve America’s Indian problem. Once Indians were amalgamated into American society, their lands could be made available for settlement, which would help sustain the ideal of a yeoman republic, and thereby ensure the viability of Jefferson’s political vision for America. Jefferson supported trade with Indians, including granting them generous terms of credit which would encourage indebtedness and force Indians to sell their lands to pay off their debts. Jefferson also hoped to teach Indians Western agricultural practices and to promote western-style gender roles in the division of labor. The goal was to have Indian women abandon work in the fields and take up tasks more typical of Western women, including spinning. In 1803, he encouraged Georgia Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins to help the Creeks pursue “agriculture” and “household manufacture.” Although some tribes followed the path of assimilation, others rejected Western ways entirely. In the 1790s, a cultural revival occurred among the Iroquois in western New York and the Shawnee, Creeks, and Cherokees on the trans-Appalachian frontier. The revival aimed at revitalizing Indian religious beliefs and cultural practices. The revivalists also attacked the European and American practices that had been incorporated into Indian cultures. One leader in the Indian revival movement was Handsome Lake, who led a revitalization movement among the Seneca of New York beginning in 1799. Among the values he championed was abstinence from alcohol. Traders during the colonial period had introduced alcohol among Indian peoples, creating a serious problem for many indigenous communities. Handsome Lake had himself battled with his own alcohol addiction. A key turning point in his life occurred when he experienced religious visions



 that led him to revive aspects of the Iroquois Great Law of Peace. This ideal was central to the Great Iroquoian Confederacy and enjoined members of the confederacy to seek diplomatic, not military, solutions to conflicts. In 1801, Handsome Lake traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with President Jefferson to defend the land claims of his people against encroachment from settlers. Another effort at religious and cultural revival took place among the Shawnee and other tribes of the Great Lakes region. The leader of this movement, the Prophet Tenskwatawa, also battled with alcohol addiction. His plan for a revival of traditional culture also came to him in religious visions. The Prophet instructed his people to reject Western influences and return to traditional Indian ways. In contrast to Handsome Lake’s evocation of peace, Tenskwatawa adopted a more militant stance. He joined his brother, the military leader Tecumseh, in organizing rival Indian nations to work together to resist American expansion into Indian lands. This pan-Indian resistance movement united six tribes to repel white encroachments in Ohio and Indiana. Rather than seek peaceful accommodation with the United States, this movement resolved to defend Indian lands by force.

 “To promote this disposition to exchange lands. . . . we shall push our trading uses, and be glad to see the good and influential individuals among them run in debt, because we observe that when these debts get beyond what the individuals can pay, they becoming willing to lop them off by a cession of lands. . . . In this way our settlements will gradually circumscribe and approach the Indians.” THOMAS JEFFERSON to WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON, 1803

JEFFERSONIAN AMERICA: AN EXPANDING EMPIRE OF LIBERTY, 1800–1824

Dissension at Home
 In 1804, Jefferson easily defeated his opponent, the Federalist Charles Pinckney, by 162 electoral votes to 14 to start a second term as president. The margin of victory was a tribute to the achievements of his first administration, during which he had overseen a peaceful, relatively smooth transition from Federalist to Republican rule. Jefferson had dismantled parts of the government bureaucracy, overseen a robust economy, and preserved the ideal of a nation of yeoman farmers by acquiring the vast new territory of Louisiana. In contrast to the successes of his first term, however, challenges at home and abroad marred his second four years in office. Divisions within the Republican movement plagued Jefferson’s second term. Meanwhile, his effort to avoid entanglement in European conflicts would lead him to institute an embargo against foreign trade that proved extremely unpopular in New England and seaport towns and cities dependent on foreign trade.

 Jefferson’s Attack on the Federalist Judiciary

7.6 Portrait of
Aaron Burr
Artist John
 Vanderlyn, a protégé of Burr, painted this striking portrait of the controversial politician during Burr’s tenure as vice president.

 The final element in the Republican strategy to rein in the Federalist judiciary involved using the constitutional power of impeachment to remove two of the most controversial Federalist judges. Toward the end of his first term, Jefferson scored a victory by removing Judge John Pickering of New Hampshire, a notorious drunk. Although he had clearly been unqualified to hold office, many of Jefferson’s supporters were worried about using impeachment as a partisan tool. Some Republicans doubted that Pickering’s deplorable behavior qualified as “high crimes and misdemeanors,” the Constitution’s criteria for removal from office. Still, Jefferson managed to persuade enough members of the Senate to convict Pickering. Buoyed by his victory in the election of 1804, Jefferson next turned his attention to Samuel Chase, a federal judge who had used the bench as a pulpit to denounce Jefferson and his ideas by delivering long-winded speeches to juries. Few Republicans would have disputed the charge that Chase was partisan and obnoxious, but neither of these was an impeachable offense if one construed the Constitution according to Jefferson’s rule of strict construction. Ardent Republicans argued that impeachment was the only tool to check the excesses of unelected judges. More moderate Republicans and Federalists insisted that an impeachable offense had to be a criminal act; stridency and

 partisanship were simply not impeachable offenses. The Senate failed to convict Chase, and the episode drove a wedge between the radical and moderate wings of Jefferson’s coalition.

The Controversial Mr. Burr
 The duel between Hamilton and Burr ended the latter’s public political career, but not his political scheming. Burr was soon charged with conspiracy and treason. The exact details of his plot are sketchy, but he appears to have planned to raise a private army to conquer Mexico. The evidence that he intended to invade American territory is less compelling. In any case Burr was certainly one of the more flamboyant personalities of the early Republic, a quality his friend and protégé, painter John Vanderlyn, captured in this portrait (7.6). Jefferson pushed hard to prosecute Burr for treason. Chief Justice John Marshall refused to construe the treason clause in more broad terms, forcing the government to produce two witnesses who could testify that Burr had waged war against the United States. Under this more precise definition of treason, the prosecution was unable to convict Burr. Marshall’s decision to read the treason clause in such narrow terms infuriated Jefferson, who on this occasion seemed to embrace a theory of constitutional interpretation at odds with his own preferred theory of strict construction. In essence, when it came to Burr, Jefferson argued that one ought to construe the Constitution’s definition of treason in Hamiltonian terms. Having avoided the charge of treason Burr went into exile in Europe after the trial but eventually returned to New York to start a lucrative law practice.

 Why did Jefferson target the federal judiciary and seek to limit its power?

AMERICA CONFRONTS A WORLD AT WAR



America Confronts a World at War
 In 1803, within two weeks of its sale of Louisiana, France was again at war with Britain. Although Napoleon’s armies dominated the European continent, Britain’s navy commanded the seas and defeated the French fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. During the early phases of the European conflict, American merchants reaped enormous profits by trading with both the French and the British. However, both Britain and France, eager to exert economic pressure on their enemies, set out to blockade the ports of their adversaries. The United States argued that neutral nations had a right to carry on nonmilitary trade with both sides in the conflict, but neither Britain nor France honored this idea. The British navy boarded and searched American ships and seized cargoes without providing compensation. Even more galling to Americans was the British practice of impressment, forcing merchant seamen to serve in the British navy. Many American sailors had once served in the British navy but now claimed American citizenship. The British refused to recognize these claims, arguing that the men were deserters still subject to British law. Between 1803 and 1812, the British navy abducted and impressed 6,000 Americans. The tense environment on the high seas reached a crisis in 1807, when the British warship the Leopard fired at an American navy ship, the Chesapeake. Three Americans were killed and 18 wounded. The British abducted four American sailors whom they charged were deserters from the Royal Navy. People in America’s seaports clamored for revenge for the Chesapeake Affair. Citizens of Norfolk, Virginia, were particularly outraged because the Chesapeake had been built in the town’s shipyards. Norfolk passed a resolution denouncing this outrageous assault on American liberty and honor. One British diplomat noted that “the lowest order of the Americans are much irritated and inclined for violent measures.” Mobs took to the streets to protest in many of the nation’s ports. President Jefferson instructed the governors of the states to be prepared to call up 100,000 militia men.

The Failure of
Peaceable Coercion
 Hoping to avoid war with the British and French, Jefferson proposed a policy of “peaceable coercion.” “Our commerce,” Jefferson wrote, “is so valuable to them, that they will be glad to purchase it, when the only price we ask is to do us justice.” The Embargo Act of 1807 became the cornerstone of “peaceable coercion.” By keeping America’s ships out of harm’s way and depriving Britain and France of the economic benefits of American trade, Jefferson hoped to pressure both sides to respect the rights of neutrals on the high seas. Smugglers flouted the ban, and it proved unpopular in New England and seaports, where it hit the shipping business hard. American exports fell from $108 million in 1807 to $22 million in 1808. To enforce the embargo along the Canadian border, Jefferson had to send troops, a policy he had decried during the Whiskey Rebellion a decade earlier. Federalists in New England, whose political fortunes had been flagging,

 now regained their voice, rallying against Jefferson and his “dambargo.” As this cartoon (7.7) lampooning Jefferson’s efforts to avoid foreign conflict suggests, the embargo did not intimidate Britain or France, but it weakened the American economy.

 Madison’s Travails: Diplomatic Blunders Abroad and Tensions on the Frontier The presidential election of 1808 marked the first time that Republicans split over who should lead them. James Madison, who had been Jefferson’s closest advisor during the turbulent 1790s, was Jefferson’s choice. Quiet, almost scholarly in temperament, Madison had impressive accomplishments. He had been an architect of the Constitution, had drafted the Bill of Rights, and had served as Jefferson’s secretary of state. Other choices were former Anti-Federalists George Clinton and James Monroe.

 What was peaceable coercion?

Impartial Dealings

JEFFERSONIAN AMERICA: AN EXPANDING EMPIRE OF LIBERTY, 1800–1824

 Clinton’s candidacy fizzled, but Monroe gained support. Borrowing from a practice begun in 1800, congressmen met in a caucus to decide on a presidential and vice-presidential candidate. The Republican caucus decided that Madison would carry forward Jefferson’s mantle. Jefferson’s Embargo Act not only divided Republicans but also strengthened the fortunes of the Federalists in places such as New England, where the economic impact of the embargo hit hardest. The Federalist candidate, Charles Pinckney, received three times as many votes as he had in 1804, doing particularly well in New England. Despite the strong Federalist showing in New England and New York, Madison defeated Pinckney by 122 to 47 electoral votes to become the fourth president of the United States. Unfortunately for Madison he had inherited a major foreign policy crisis from Jefferson. The embargo had not forced Britain and France to change their policy. The main casualties from this policy had been Southern agriculture and New England commerce. Madison’s faith in a peaceful solution received a boost when Britain’s ambassador opened talks about ending the embargo. Britain even accepted Madison’s insistence that it pay reparations for the Chesapeake incident and offered to stop

 searching and seizing American vessels in neutral waters. However, the British government repudiated the generous terms negotiated by the British ambassador, dashing hopes for peace. Frustrated by the diplomatic impasse, Congress sought another solution to the problem. A House select committee headed by Nathaniel Macon proposed to provide muchneeded customs revenue by allowing British and French goods back into American harbors if they were transported on American ships. Although the measure failed, a second proposal, Macon’s Bill No. 2, did pass. The most important provision of Macon’s Bill No. 2 stipulated that when either Britain or France repealed its restrictions on neutral trade, America would reinstate sanctions against the other nation. Seizing on this law, Napoleon promised that France would honor the rights of neutrals. Napoleon, who had little intention of keeping his word, thus used Macon’s bill to drive a wedge between the United States and Britain. The British pointed out that Napoleon’s promise was hardly sufficient proof to meet the terms set by Macon Bill No. 2 to lift commercial sanctions. Britain complained that America’s new posture toward France and continuing hostility to Britain were not justified. Rather than provide a means to normalize relations with both France and Britain, American policy heightened tensions with Britain. The repeated violation of their neutrality was not the only American grievance against Britain. As American settlers streamed into the new state of Ohio (1803) and the Indiana Territory, many of them blamed the British for instigating Indians to attack them. Britain’s lucrative trade with these Indians included the sale of firearms, and these weapons proved especially useful to Tecumseh, whose pan-Indian resistance movement was gathering followers as Indians faced further encroachments on their land. Although Tecumseh’s brother, the Prophet, exhorted his followers to reject all aspects of white civilization, European military technology proved too useful to abandon. Tecumseh worked to convince various tribes to unite to oppose further American expansion. Indigenous peoples’ resolve to resist Western expansion intensified after a series of treaties

AMERICA CONFRONTS A WORLD AT WAR

 signed at Fort Wayne (1809), in which the United States wrested three million acres of land from the Delaware and Potawatomi in Indiana. To squash resistance, William Henry Harrison led a military expedition against Tecumseh and his supporters in 1811. Harrison’s expedition burned to the ground the village of Tippecanoe, the center of Tecumseh’s pan-Indian movement. After this attack Tecumseh entered into a formal alliance with the British, who supplied further arms to the Indians. Confident that their alliance with the British would help defeat American forces, Tecumseh and his allies stepped up attacks on American settlements along the frontier.

The War of 1812
 Frustrated by the inability of peaceable coercion to force Britain to respect American rights on the high seas and angered by British support for Tecumseh, Madison began preparations for war. He called Congress into an early session in fall 1811. Republicans dominated Congress but were divided over war against Britain. Many Republicans from the mid-Atlantic, especially New York, were reluctant to take on the most powerful navy in the world. “Old Republicans,” the more radical states’ rights wing of the Jeffersonian coalition who were particularly strong in Madison’s home state of Virginia, feared that war would lead to the creation of a large military establishment and new taxes. Madison drew his strongest support from a group of War Hawks, young Republican congressmen from the South and West who were intensely nationalistic, resented British attacks on American rights, and favored an aggressive policy of expansion into Indian-occupied territory and the annexation of Canada. The two leading War Hawks were Henry Clay, a first-term congressmen from Kentucky, and John C. Calhoun, an up-country South Carolinian educated at Yale. The House voted to declare war by 79 to 49. The margin in the Senate was 19 to 13. No single pattern accounts for all the votes, but enthusiasm for the war ran high in many parts of America. Regional, economic, and party identities shaped the final vote. British involvement with western Native American tribes, particularly in the supply of guns, angered Westerners. Northeastern Republicans who favored war were motivated by anger against this latest threat to American freedom from British tyranny. They saw a struggle that had begun during

 the Revolution and would not end until America was truly free of British power. Federalists viewed the vote as another example of the Republicans’ distorted vision of the world. For Federalists, France, not Britain, was the true enemy. Federalists were unanimously opposed to the war, a sentiment which intensified when they learned that the British had been prepared to yield on some points of contention. Anger over Federalist opposition to war led to violence. One Baltimore Federalist newspaper editor who criticized the war was targeted by a mob of angry Republicans, who attacked his office and destroyed his printing press. His attempt to resume printing after the incident triggered a full-scale riot that plunged the city into chaos and was put down only when the militia was called out. The resulting destruction of property and loss of life were the worst instance of public unrest in the young nation’s short history and earned Baltimore the nickname “Mob Town.” The war pitted the United States against Britain for the second time in less than a half century. As this political cartoon shows (7.8), the primary justification for the War of 1812 was Britain’s violation of American neutrality and seizure of American sailors. In the cartoon, Columbia, the symbol of America, reminds France and Britain that they must respect free trade and seamen’s rights or face retribution. The other issue, British support for Indian attacks on frontier settlements, also galvanized popular support for the war effort, particularly in the West. For a better understanding of the division over entering the war, see Competing Visions: War Hawks and Their Critics.

JEFFERSONIAN AMERICA: AN EXPANDING EMPIRE OF LIBERTY, 1800–1824

Competing Visions
WAR HAWKS AND THEIR CRITICS
Americans were deeply divided over the War of 1812. In the Southwest support for the war was motivated by concern over Britain’s Indian policy. Representative Felix Grundy, a prominent War Hawk from Tennessee, charged that the British had instigated Indian violence against Americans. Indians killed three of Grundy’s brothers in the conflict along the frontier. By contrast, the sharp-tongued, Virginian conservative John Randolph, a prominent “Old Republican” became a vocal critic of the war. Fiercely independent, Randolph dismissed Grundy’s suggestion of an Indian–British conspiracy, instead putting the blame for Western conflicts squarely on the settlers who violated Indian land claims. How did Grundy’s experiences as a Westerner color his decision to support war? Was Randolph’s response likely to attract political support (why or why not)? Why would Randolph opt to frame his opposition in these terms? In this impassioned speech, Felix Grundy accused the British of arming and inciting American Indians to take up arms against Americans. “It cannot be believed, by any man who will reflect, that the savage tribes, uninfluenced by other powers, would think of making war on the United States. They understand too well their own weakness and our strength. They have already felt the weight of our arms; they know they hold the very soil on which they live as tenants in sufferance. How, then, sir are we to account for their late conduct? In one way only; some powerful nation must have intrigued with them, and turned their peaceful dispositions towards us into hostilities. Great Britain alone has intercourse with those Northern Tribes.” 
 John Randolph’s response to Grundy dismissed the notion of a conspiracy. The source of conflict along America’s frontier, Randolph argued, was the greed of Westerners who encroached on Indian lands. Session after session, their table had been piled up with Indian treaties, for which the appropriations has been voted as a matter of course, without examination. Advantage had been taken of the spirit of the Indians, broken by the war which ended in the treaty of Greenville [1795]. Under the ascendancy then acquired over them, they had been pent up by subsequent treaties into nooks, straightened in their quarters by a blind cupidity seeking to extinguish their title to immense wilderness, for which (possessing, as we do already, more land than we can sell or use) we shall not have occasion for half a century to come. It was our own thirst for territory, our own want of moderation, that had driven these sons of nature to desperation.”

 Rather than challenge Britain on the high seas, the American war effort concentrated on Canada (7.9). Attacking the British in Canada appealed to the War Hawks. Canada was poorly defended, and Americans mistakenly believed that Quebec’s large French-speaking population would eagerly join Americans to expel the British from Canada. Seizing Canada would also deprive Tecumseh of his primary source of arms. Given the power of the British Empire, particularly its naval superiority, the focus on conquering Canada, or at least holding it hostage to force Britain to respect neutral rights on the high seas, seemed a promising strategy. American efforts to wrest Canada from Britain, however, failed miserably as British troops beat back incursions into Canada along the U.S. border. The British also harassed America’s coastal settlements and blockaded its ports. In the most audacious move of the war, in August 1814, the British captured Washington, D.C., and burned the capital. The British assault forced President Madison and his wife Dolley to flee. British troops feasted on an elegant dinner that had been set out for the president and his wife and took many items from the executive mansion,

The British next bombarded but failed to take Fort McHenry in Baltimore harbor. An eyewitness to the attack, Francis Scott Key, composed a patriotic poem, “The Star Spangled Banner,” that became America’s national anthem in the 1930s. Although the American navy was no match for the British Navy in the Atlantic, it did defeat the British on the Great Lakes, at Put-in-Bay and Niagara Falls. While diplomatic efforts to end the war intensified, the British suffered a crushing defeat when they assaulted New Orleans in January 1815. Andrew Jackson, the American commander at New Orleans, led a mixture of regular troops, militia, free blacks, and a few Indians. Jackson even accepted help from French pirates. The victory made him a national hero celebrated in ballads such as the Hunters of Kentucky. “Old Hickory” (Jackson’s nickname) became a symbol of steadfastness and bravery. Newspapers proclaimed the victory a symbol of the “Rising Glory of the American Republic.” Neither side in this battle knew that the two nations had already signed a peace treaty. It took two weeks for word of peace to reach Louisiana,

 What were the main military consequences of the War of 1812?



 CHAPTER 7

JEFFERSONIAN AMERICA: AN EXPANDING EMPIRE OF LIBERTY, 1800–1824

 “Nothing was adjusted, nothing was settled—nothing in substance but an indefinite suspension of hostilities was agreed to.” JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, describing the Treaty of Ghent (1815) arriving after the battle was over. The Treaty of Ghent in 1814, named for the Belgian city where the negotiations were conducted, ended the fighting but failed to settle the long-standing

 issues between the two nations. Indeed, if judged by the terms of the peace treaty, the War of 1812 accomplished little. The issues at stake at the beginning of the war, including the impressment of American sailors and the rights of neutral trade, remained unresolved. In private, some Americans, including John Quincy Adams, who negotiated the treaty, felt it did little more than end hostilities. The American public generally regarded the war as a victory, calling it the Second War for Independence. At least America had defended its honor, forcing the most powerful nation in the world to treat the new republic with respect, a perception reflected in this painting celebrating the treaty (7.10); America, represented by Columbia, reaches out the hand of friendship to Britannia. While the British and Americans had fought to a draw, the most conspicuous losers in the war were the Indians living along the frontier, who lost an important ally when the British withdrew and were forced to make major land concessions to Americans. Pan-Indian nationalists such as Tecumseh suffered a severe setback at the hands of William Henry Harrison and Andrew Jackson, whose military successes secured the transAppalachian frontier, the Western territory beyond the Appalachian Mountains, for settlement.

The Hartford Convention
 While many Americans celebrated Jackson’s victory over the British at New Orleans, Federalists in New England convened at the Hartford Convention in Hartford, Connecticut, to protest the War of 1812. Although some Federalists in New England had flirted with secession, the delegates to the Hartford Convention stopped well short of advocating the breakup of the Union. Although New

7.11 The Hartford Convention or Leap, No Leap
 In this cartoon George III beckons to Federalists in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island to jump off the cliff and join him, promising them “titles, nobility,” and other rewards for abandoning their fellow states.

 England Federalists had denounced the radical states’ rights ideas that Jeffersonians had espoused in response to the Alien and Sedition Crisis in 1798, they now echoed many of those ideas. The convention delegates proposed constitutional amendments that would strengthen New England’s influence in the Union. In particular, they sought to require a two-thirds majority for commercial regulations, declarations of war, and the admission of new states. To weaken the South’s influence in Congress, the Hartford Convention also called for a repeal of the three-fifths compromise, which allowed Southerners to count a percentage of their slaves for the purposes of determining a state’s

 representation in the House. The Hartford Convention’s proposals were publicized at the same time as news of the Treaty of Ghent and the victory at New Orleans were fueling a new sense of national pride. In this political cartoon ridiculing the Hartford Convention (7.11), leading New England Federalists appear ready to leap off a cliff into the welcoming arms of Britain’s king. Federalists’ narrow sectionalism appeared out of step with the public’s new patriotic fervor. Even in their New England stronghold, Federalists saw themselves irreparably damaged as a movement. The War of 1812 facilitated the demise of the Federalists as a viable political organization.

 How are the actions of New England states represented in the political cartoon on the Hartford Convention above?



 CHAPTER 7

JEFFERSONIAN AMERICA: AN EXPANDING EMPIRE OF LIBERTY, 1800–1824

The Republic Reborn:
Consequences of the War of 1812
 The War of 1812 transformed America, its politics, economy, society, and relations with other nations. The postwar era inaugurated a period of nationalism that was evidenced in diplomacy, economic policy, and law. There was broad popular support for a stronger central government, one capable of dealing with foreign challenges and spurring domestic economic growth. Thus the partisan squabbling of the Jeffersonian era gave way to the necessities of fighting a war. These realities forced leading politicians to unite the best aspects of Jeffersonian politics with Hamiltonian economics. John Quincy Adams, secretary of state under James Monroe, proved to be an effective diplomat, skillfully negotiating important treaties for the United States. The demands of the wartime economy not only spurred economic and technological innovation but also increased demand for manufactured goods, such as firearms and textiles for uniforms. The new nationalist ethos and a more sympathetic attitude toward economic development were evidenced in the decisions of the Supreme Court after the war.

A
View of  the President’s House in the City of Washington after the Conflagration of the 24th of August, 1814 Repairs to the damaged executive mansion included a new coat of white paint. The residence became known as “the White House.”

 The war radically transformed Republican political and constitutional ideas. In his annual message to Congress in 1815, the first after the Treaty of Ghent, Madison suggested that the nation expand the size of its military and reaffirmed his support for a national bank and for protective tariffs for American industry. Seeking to push beyond this nationalist agenda, Madison floated the idea of chartering a national university and even considered amending the Constitution to give the federal government the power to promote internal improvements such as roads and canals. Madison clung to one traditional republican idea. He believed that to exercise such powers required a constitutional amendment. Although on this one point of constitutional theory Madison reasserted the traditional Republican view of the limited scope of federal

 power, as a practical matter he had aligned himself with much of the old Hamiltonian agenda. Indeed, John Quincy Adams, son of the former president and a staunch Federalist, believed that Madison and “the Republicans had out-Federalized Federalism.” The collapse of Federalists after the War of 1812 led to a shift away from the rancor that had characterized politics during the Jeffersonian era. Following Madison as president, James Monroe sought to unite the political ideals of Jeffersonianism with aspects of Hamiltonian economic theory. For a brief period he managed to create an administration free of the partisan divisions that had characterized American politics since Washington’s second term. As a gesture toward nonpartisan politics, the Republican Monroe named the brilliant Federalist John Quincy Adams as his secretary of state and appointed men from different regions to heal old sectional tensions. He also took a lesson from Washington, the other president who seemed most successful at rising above party, and embarked on a goodwill tour of the nation. Monroe began his tour in Boston, a city with strong Federalist sympathies. Praising the gesture, a Boston newspaper proclaimed an Era of Good Feelings to describe the absence of bitter partisan conflict during Monroe’s presidency. Monroe also restored luster to the presidency. He became noted for his stylish entertaining in the executive mansion. To repair the smoke damage to the executive mansion (7.12), a result of the British

THE REPUBLIC REBORN: CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR OF 1812

 attack on Washington during the War of 1812, Monroe had its exterior painted a brilliant white. The official residence of the President of the United States has been known as the White House ever since. Monroe not only sought to reconcile Federalist and Jeffersonian ideals. He also served as a bridge between the political cultures of two different centuries, the eighteenth and nineteenth. Monroe was the last president with ties to the generation that fought the Revolution and wrote the Constitution. His roots in the eighteenth century appear in the clothes he wore at his inauguration. Most men had abandoned their wigs and replaced breeches and silk stockings with trousers. But Monroe retained the ideals and dress of eighteenth-century gentility. In this portrait, he wears breeches and silk stockings (7.13). If Monroe’s personal style and values harked back to the eighteenth century, many of his policies as president reflected newer ideas including the idea that it was vital to encourage the expansion of the nation’s “domestic market” encouraging “an active intercourse between the extremes and throughout every portion of our Union.” One aging Federalist remarked that “the Party in Power seems disposed to do all that federal men ever wished.”



Diplomatic Triumphs
 After the war, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams resolved outstanding border disputes with Britain. In the Rush-Bagot Treaty of 1817, the United States and Britain limited naval armaments on the Great Lakes. An accord reached the following year set the new boundary between the Louisiana Territory and Canada at the 49th parallel. The British also recognized American fishing rights off Labrador and Newfoundland, and America and Britain agreed to continue to occupy jointly the Oregon Territory in the Pacific Northwest. These diplomatic successes effectively normalized U.S.-Canadian relations and created a peaceful border between the two countries that has persisted for more than 200 years. Adams was now free to address the southern boundary disputes with Spain. America had long been eager to wrest Florida from Spain. In March 1818, Andrew Jackson led a raid into Spanish Florida to attack the Seminoles. Under the pretext of protecting American settlements against Indian attack, he captured two Spanish forts, thereby further weakening Spain’s bargaining position. Rather than risk war, Spain ceded all claims to Florida and recognized U.S. sovereignty in Louisiana in the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819. Spain’s empire in the Americas had been crumbling for two decades. In 1811, Paraguay and Venezuela declared independence from Spain. In 1818, Chile declared its independence, and Peru followed suit in 1821. Building on the goodwill generated by the resolution of the northern boundary issue between the United States and Canada, Britain’s foreign minister suggested in 1823 that the United States and Britain issue a declaration that neither intended to annex the newly liberated states in Spanish America. Although Monroe was tempted to accept the British offer, Adams advised against it, and Monroe followed his advice. In his annual message to Congress in 1823, he presented a general policy for Spanish America. This statement, the Monroe Doctrine, reiterated the policy outlined in Washington’s Farewell Address that America would not meddle in European affairs. It also warned European powers that the United States would view intervention in the affairs of the newly independent states of Spanish Americas as a threat to its security. 7.13 Portrait of President James Monroe This image captures Monroe’s role as a transitional figure between the eighteenth-century world of the Founders and a new era in American politics. He appears without the wigs favored by eighteenth-century gentlemen, but his silk stockings and knee breeches reflected the fashions of the founding generation.

Economic and Technological
Innovation


7.14 Slater Mill
 The earliest factories were not imposing structures belching forth smoke, but small water-powered mills. Slater’s first water-powered mill resembled the clapboard wooden structures that had been used to grind grain or saw logs and that easily blended into their rural settings.

 The War of 1812 not only led to a renewed political commitment to economic development but also spurred a remarkable period of technological development. America’s embargo against foreign goods and the demands of the wartime economy provided incentives for economic innovation. Firearms production was improved, steam engines powered new modes of transportation, and new agricultural technology led to a boom in cotton production. Artist and inventor Samuel Morse captured the age’s search for political consensus and fascination with technology in his painting of the House of Representatives. See Images as History: Samuel Morse’s House of Representatives and the National Republican Vision. Not surprisingly the war spurred innovation in the production of firearms. The federal arsenals at Springfield, Massachusetts, and Harpers Ferry, Virginia, played a pivotal role in advancing these developments. Indeed, by the mid-1820s, Harper’s Ferry had pioneered a mass production technique for manufacturing firearms. In place of older artisan methods, in which master craftsmen handcrafted items for production, the system used new power machinery to cut and shape standardized parts. By 1820, John H. Hall had perfected the manufacturing techniques for “fabricating arms exactly alike and with economy by the hands of common workmen.” Hall began producing a new breech-loading rifle, an improvement over the traditional muzzle-loading muskets.

 A simple, but far-reaching technological improvement in agricultural production transformed the American economy. The cotton gin, an invention by Eli Whitney, an industrious Connecticut Yankee working as a tutor on a Southern plantation, easily removed the seeds that adhered tenaciously to short staple cotton, a hearty plant well suited to Southern climate and soil. Whitney’s cotton gin revolutionized cotton agriculture. Before his invention, an adult slave needed a whole day to clean a single pound of cotton. Whitney’s cotton gin allowed a single slave to clean 50 pounds of cotton a day. In 1790, the South produced 3,000 bales of cotton. By 1810, the cotton gin facilitated the production of 178,000 bales. (Each bale weighed approximately 480 pounds.) Immediately after the War of 1812, cotton production almost doubled again to 334,000 bales. Cotton would provide huge new economic incentives for slave-based agriculture by making it much cheaper to produce cotton for market. Although cotton exports to Britain consumed much of this new cash crop, some of the cotton was purchased for domestic textile manufacturing. In 1793, Samuel Slater established a mechanized spinning factory in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. His mill was a relatively modest structure whose size and architectural style fit the scale of a small New England village. The first mills depended on water power and took advantage of natural waterfalls to power water wheels (7.14). Slater pioneered the mill village model of

THE REPUBLIC REBORN: CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR OF 1812



Images as History
SAMUEL MORSE’S HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN VISION
In 1819 Samuel Morse began his ambitious painting of the House of Representatives. The painting not only reflected the political ideas of the Era of Good Feelings, it projected a nationalist vision of America’s bright future. How did Morse’s emphasis on architectural grandeur convey the values of Monroe and Nationalist Republican belief? Although the crowded chamber bustles with activity, Morse presented a scene of cordiality and harmony. The painting captures the time before formal political business began, a decision that allowed Morse to create a scene free of conflict or tension. Morse chose a rare evening session of the House to illustrate. This decision allowed him to further shift the focus away from the actions of politicians. Occupying the dramatic center of the painting is the House of Representative’s doorkeeper, who is lighting a large chandelier to illuminate the evening’s activities. The painting thus pays tribute to America’s technological progress. It links America’s political institutions symbolically to light and progress. 
 Benjamin Henry Latrobe, the architect responsible for rebuilding the Capitol after the War of 1812, chose multicolored stones for the columns supporting the roof of the House. This particular architectural element became a visual symbol of the idea of federalism, in which the different states, represented by the stones, blended together in a single harmonious republican structure, a classical column. A number of distinguished guests are in the House chamber, including the entire Supreme Court, and a number of guests occupy the gallery. The inclusion of the Pawnee chief, Petalesharo, signifies America’s inevitable subjection of Indians. Morse’s painting idealizes a brief moment in American politics that was already on the wane by the time his painting was displayed. Monroe’s vision of a National Republican consensus and the “era of good feelings” was being supplanted by rising sectional tensions over slavery and a new era of partisan conflict. Morse highlighted the multicolored stone columns, which symbolized the ideal of federalism. The Indian figure in the gallery symbolized Monroe’s diplomatic achievements and the inevitable subjugation of America’s indigenous population.

 industrial production. Others later adapted his model by creating entirely new mill villages in which the company owned the adjacent farmland and rented it to men whose families worked in the mills. This Rhode Island or “family” model of the mill village was an important economic development in manufacturing.

 “The present moment is every way favorable to the establishment of a great national policy and of great national institutions, in respect to the army, the navy, the judicial, [and] the commercial … interests of the country.” Justice JOSEPH STORY [1816]

Judicial Nationalism
 No figure captured the new nationalist spirit more fully than the young Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story. A brilliant lawyer, Story was only 32 when James Madison appointed him to the Court. Madison hoped that Story, an anti-embargo Republican from Massachusetts, would check the nationalism of Chief Justice John Marshall. Madison would not be the last president to be shocked and disappointed by one of his Supreme Court appointments. Story proved to be as nationalistic as Marshall. Story’s decisions on the court supported the power of the federal judiciary and limited that of the states. In landmark decisions, Marshall and Story helped strengthen the federal government and the courts and paved the way for economic growth. The most famous case dealing with federalism was McCulloch v. Maryland. The case arose when the state of Maryland levied a tax on the Baltimore branch of the Second Bank of the United States. Most Republicans had made their peace with the idea of a bank, but some continued to resent this highly visible symbol of Hamiltonian federalism. Marshall declared the Maryland state tax unconstitutional and affirmed an essentially Hamiltonian view of the powers of the federal government. According to Marshall the federal government enjoyed broad powers under the

 “necessary and proper” clauses of the Constitution, which allowed it to charter a bank. Marshall further argued that the power to tax was also the power to destroy and allowing the state to tax a federally chartered institution would have allowed Maryland to undermine an act of the federal government. While Marshall conceded that the powers of the federal government were not unlimited, he affirmed that within its sphere of authority it enjoyed enormous latitude to accomplish any legitimate constitutional objective. In contrast to many Republicans who accepted the Jeffersonian idea that individual states could judge the constitutionality of federal acts, the Marshall Court insisted that only the Supreme Court could determine when the federal government had exceeded its authority. No other decision rendered by the Court generated so much controversy as that of McCulloch v. Maryland. For radical opponents of the Marshall Court, McCulloch seemed to realize the Anti-Federalists’ most dire predictions. Anger over McCulloch led many Republicans, particularly in the South, to develop a more aggressive version of states’ rights. They challenged the authority of the Supreme Court to decide arguments between the states and the federal government. For nationalists such as Marshall and Story, however, the creation of a more powerful central government was essential to the survival of the United States. The Marshall Court also decided cases dealing with the law and the economy. One of the most important cases dealing with economic development also expanded the scope of federal power over commerce. In Gibbons v. Ogden (1824), a case involving steamboats, the Court grappled with the scope of federal powers over interstate commerce. In that case Marshall construed the word commerce broadly to encompass “every species of commercial intercourse.” The Court also held that federal power over interstate commerce did not end at the borders of each state, but extended within states when that commerce was intermingled with economic activity that crossed state lines. Although in the nineteenth century the federal government did not exploit its power over interstate commerce to the fullest, the power to regulate interstate commerce is currently one of the most far-reaching possessed by the federal government.

CRISES AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONSENSUS



Crises and the Collapse of
 the National Republican Consensus The patriotic sentiments stirred by the War of 1812 and the emergence of a new consensus around a Hamiltonian economic vision contributed to a period of prosperity and optimism. The new consensus, however, proved fragile, and a severe depression soon followed the postwar economic boom. Slavery also vaulted to national attention when Missouri sought admission to the Union as a slave state. The hope that Monroe’s creative synthesis of the Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian visions might usher in a new Era of Good Feelings proved short lived as economic and political crises again divided the nation.

The Panic of 1819
 Economic expansion, in part driven by the demand for cotton, led to a growth in the financial sector of the American economy. States chartered new banks, so that the number of banks doubled between 1815 and 1818, from just over 200 to more than 400. In 1816, Congress chartered a Second Bank of the United States, which further fueled economic expansion and land speculation. Between 1815 and 1818, land sales more than tripled. However, the price of cotton and other agricultural products exported by America dropped in 1819, leading to a severe economic downturn that affected nearly every aspect of the American economy. Since much of the expansion in credit by American banks was tied to agricultural production, the crisis spread to financial institutions. The value of land purchased on credit dropped sharply, and when these loans came due, speculators were unable to repay the banks that had loaned them the money to buy these properties. The American economy, now heavily dependent on cotton, sank into depression. As speculators defaulted on their obligations, banks collapsed. Nearly every region of the country was affected. The Panic of 1819, the economic crisis triggered by the drop in agricultural prices and bank failures, produced unprecedented economic hardship. While the sudden downturn in the economy hurt Western land speculators and cotton producers in the Deep South, it also devastated the growing urban centers of the Northeast. In Philadelphia three out of four workers

 lost their jobs. In New York the number of people classified as paupers increased from 8,000 to 13,000 in a year.

The Missouri Crisis
 The economic downturn was soon overshadowed by another crisis. In 1819, Missouri applied for admission to the Union as a slave state. Congressman John Tallmadge from New York demanded that Missouri ban further imports of slaves and agree to eliminate slavery before joining. Public meetings across the Northeast protested Missouri’s proposed admission as a slave state. Slavery now came to the center of American politics.

 “Agricultural languishes— farmers cannot find profit in hiring labourers... mechanics are in want of employment” JAMES FLINT, comments on the Panic of 1819 in Letters from America (1822) The growth of cotton agriculture and the prospect of large swathes of territory in the West entering the Union as slave states prompted a political crisis. Whereas Northern congressmen denounced slavery as a violation of the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, Southerners defended the institution, invoking the

 language of the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions to support the right of the states to decide the slavery question. A Georgia congressman warned that Tallmadge had “kindled a fire which all the waters of the ocean cannot put out, which seas of blood can only extinguish.” The New Yorker’s amendment passed the House, where the Northeast enjoyed a significant majority, but was defeated in the Senate, where the North and South were more closely balanced.

 What were the main provisions of the Missouri Compromise?

 To avert a constitutional crisis, Congress worked out a compromise. Henry Clay, one of the most influential figures in Congress, was a key player in negotiating this solution. The Missouri Compromise called for the admission of Missouri as a slave state. Maine, which had been part of Massachusetts but had been seeking independence for some time, entered as a free state, thus preserving the balance between free states and slave states in the Senate. The Missouri

 Compromise drew an imaginary line across the territory acquired through the Louisiana Purchase at 36° 30ʹ latitude (7.15). Land below this imaginary dividing line would be slave territory; land above it would be free. Thomas Jefferson wrote to a friend that the crisis struck him as a “fire bell in the night.” Being awakened from a sound sleep by a fire alarm, the metaphor chosen by Jefferson, evoked the magnitude of the Missouri crisis. For Jefferson the Missouri crisis had etched the issue of slavery onto the map of the United States and would make any resolution of it in the future impossible. The debate over Missouri prompted John Quincy Adams to write in his diary that “Slavery is the great and foul stain upon the North American Union.” For the moment, however, most politicians seemed unwilling to contemplate erasing the great stain.

 Denmark Vesey’s Rebellion The problem of slavery resurfaced in summer 1822. Newspapers from Charleston to Boston and as far west as the Illinois Territory carried the sensational story of Denmark Vesey, a free African American artisan from Charleston, South Carolina, who had been arrested, tried, and executed for—so the charges went—leading a slave insurrection. A talented and charismatic man, Vesey had won a lottery jackpot in 1799 and used his earnings to purchase his freedom and set up a small carpentry shop. A natural leader, he became a prominent member of an African American church that became an important



 meeting place for free blacks and slaves. Rumors of a slave revolt led authorities to arrest him and charge him with plotting an insurrection, the so-called Denmark Vesey Uprising, said to have been aimed to free slaves in Charleston by violence. Modern historians differ over how to interpret the evidence that was used to convict Vesey and his alleged followers. Some historians deny that Vesey was a revolutionary figure bent on leading an uprising and see him instead as an unfortunate victim, a vocal free black leader who became a scapegoat for paranoid Charleston whites ever fearful of slave insurrection. Others believe that there was a plot, although its scope remains uncertain. Whether the proposed insurrection was real or imagined, the evidence gathered to convict Vesey provides a window into the way whites perceived slave culture in the Charleston region. According to the trial records, urban slaves and free blacks conspired with the many slaves who worked on the plantations surrounding Charleston. The rebels, the records suggest, were poised to take advantage of the mobility enjoyed by African Americans in this region, an area in which travel was less restricted than in other parts of the South. Charleston’s slaves were often hired out by their masters and often traveled without direct supervision. The task system employed by Carolina plantation owners also provided slaves with considerable autonomy and mobility. After finishing their day’s tasks, slaves could work their own small plots of land, hunt, or fish. Slaves not only used this surplus food to supplement their

 “I went up to the Capitol and heard Mr. King in the Senate, upon what is called the Missouri question. . . . He laid down the position of the natural liberty of man, and its incompatibility with slavery in any shape. He also questioned the Constitutional right of the President and Senate to make the Louisiana Treaty . . . .[later] We attended an evening party at Mr. Calhoun’s, and heard of nothing but the Missouri question and Mr. King’s speeches. The slave-holders cannot hear of them without being seized with cramps. They call them seditious and inflammatory, when their greatest real defect is their timidity.” JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, Reflections on the Missouri Question (1820)

 meager rations but also often sold it in Charleston’s markets. The ease of travel facilitated communication between slaves and freedmen. Free black churches provided places for African Americans, both slaves and free blacks, to discuss ideas, including perhaps revolution. The prosecution claimed that Vesey, an active member of Charleston’s African Methodist Episcopal Church, had used the church as a place to recruit others to his cause. The alleged insurrection was planned for the summer, when many whites left the city for cooler climates. If Vesey’s plan was real and not invented by his prosecutors, his conception was a bold one. After seizing the city arsenal, Vesey and his followers allegedly planned to burn the city and sail to Haiti. (In 1804, Saint Domingue became the independent country of Haiti.) The Caribbean island’s own revolutionary experience might have inspired Vesey, who saw the Haitian uprising as a model for toppling slavery in America. When

 South Carolina’s governor heard about the plot, he ordered out the militia. The authorities arrested Vesey and others alleged to have been engaged in his conspiracy. The trial record portrays Vesey as an articulate man, well aware of the recent debates over the Missouri Compromise, including the speeches of antislavery congressmen from New England. The rise of abolitionist sentiment in the North was a sign that the time for revolution was ripe. The plot that emerges from the evidence presented at the trial also demonstrates the persistence of African religious and cultural traditions among both free blacks and slaves. One of Vesey’s chief co-conspirators, for example, a slave named Gullah Jack, had a reputation as a conjurer who would provide Vesey’s followers with magical charms to protect them from harm. There is also evidence that African American culture had developed its own distinctive approach to Christianity. African Christianity highlighted themes taken from the

 plight of the ancient Israelites. Thus Vesey was said to have reminded his followers that God had delivered the children of Israel out of bondage in Egypt and would surely deliver slaves to freedom now. As this page from the published trial records shows, (7.16), Charleston’s authorities sent 34 blacks, including Vesey, to the gallows. For the Charleston white elite who prosecuted Vesey, one lesson of the trial was that “the indiscreet zeal in favor of universal liberty, expressed by many of our fellow-citizens in the States north and east of Maryland; aided by the Black population of those States” threatened the institution of slavery. The sectional tensions caused by slavery and the growing animosity between Northern abolitionists, black and white, and Southern defenders of slavery would only turn more bitter.

Jeffersonian America and the
Politics of Compromise
 Jefferson’s election in 1800 ushered in a new era in American politics. Although Jefferson did not usher in a revolution, he did scale back the size of government. By shrinking the government, Jefferson effectively eliminated the threat posed by Hamilton’s fiscal and military programs, but without having to repudiate all the accomplishments of the two previous administrations. Indeed, Jefferson discovered that he could put a powerful federal government to good Republican use. The purchase of Louisiana was difficult to reconcile with Jefferson’s own theory of strict construction,



 but Jefferson put his constitutional scruples aside to make the purchase. By the time James Madison became president, leading Republicans had adopted much of the Hamiltonian economic agenda. America’s difficult experiences during the War of 1812 seemed to underscore the wisdom of many of Hamilton’s proposals. The next president, James Monroe, took these lessons to heart; his administration sought a nonpartisan synthesis of Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian values. The press hailed Monroe’s presidency as an Era of Good Feelings, a time in which partisan rancor gave way to consensus and a new wave of nationalism. This brief respite from partisanship proved short-lived, however. Within a decade, partisan divisions resurfaced and laid the foundation of a new two-party system. If there were conspicuous losers in the Jeffersonian era it was American Indians and slaves. The former faced a more powerful and well-organized American government eager to expand westward. The War of 1812 had a disastrous impact on Western tribes, who lost an important ally, Britain, in their struggles against the United States. Finally the cotton boom and introduction of land well suited to cotton agriculture meant that the institution of slavery became stronger. The issue of slavery, particularly its expansion, would play an increasingly important role in American public life. The Missouri Compromise demonstrated the potentially divisive nature of the issue of slavery. For the moment, American politics had resolved this crisis, but rather than diffuse this problem, slavery would remain a potentially explosive issue in American politics.

 “The cession of that kind of property [slaves] ... would not cost me a second thought; if in that way, a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected.... But, as it is, we have the wolf by the ears, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation is in the other.” THOMAS JEFFERSON to JOHN HOLMES, 1820

Democrats
 and Whigs Democracy and American Culture, 1820–1840 George Caleb Bingham’s painting, Stump Speaking or the County Canvass (1853), captures the drama of a new democratic style of politics that transformed American life starting in the 1820s. The term stump speech referred to politicians’ practice in some remote parts of the nation of addressing the electorate by using the nearest tree stump as a rough-hewn platform from which to speak. Bingham, a Whig opponent of the Democratic Party, used the painting to express his reservations about what he considered the dangers posed by too much democracy. Bingham wrote that the politician on the platform in the painting was a “wiry” fellow who had “grown grey in the pursuit of office and the service of his party” and literally bends to the popular will. Across from the speaker, seated amid the crowd, a man in a top hat and light-colored suit listens thoughtfully, refusing to be swayed by the politician’s words. Bingham described this figure as an “outstanding citizen” whose noble features not only set him apart from the crowd but also contrast noticeably with the shifty look of the Democratic politician standing at the rostrum. The painting suggests that the “outstanding citizen,” a true Whig leader, refuses to pander to the mob. As this scene reveals, democracy did not yet embrace all Americans; it excluded women, African Americans, and Indians. The crowd Bingham depicts is overwhelmingly male and, apart from a lone African American in the background, all white. Although the white men participate in the political life of the nation, the lone black figure labors on a wagon selling refreshments to the crowd. No figure better personified this new age than Andrew Jackson, the country’s leading Democrat. Jackson’s 1828 election changed American politics, forcing his opponents to make more effective use of the tools of democratic politics and the symbols of democracy in their campaigns. Eventually adopting the name, Whig, by 1840 they outdid the Democrats, portraying their candidate William Henry Harrison, as a simple man born in a log cabin who drank hard cider like an ordinary farmer. Although the Whigs may have learned valuable political lessons from the Democrats about how to campaign, their party steadfastly opposed Jacksonian policies on every major issue of the day. From economic issues to American Indian rights, the two parties offered the American people competing visions and clear choices. Political participation in this period rose as Americans responded to the messages of the two parties and voted in unprecedented numbers.

 “American society is essentially and radically a democracy…. In the United States the democratic spirit is infused into all national habits, and all the customs of society.” French traveler MICHAEL CHEVALIER, Society, Manners, and Politics in the United States (1839)





 CHAPTER 8

DEMOCRATS AND WHIGS: DEMOCRACY AND AMERICAN CULTURE, 1820–1840

Democracy in America
 Between Thomas Jefferson’s election in 1800 and Andrew Jackson’s victory in his presidential bid in 1828, American culture and politics were transformed. Travelers to America during this period consistently remarked about the democratic character of its society. Democracy appeared to suffuse every aspect of culture and politics. Whereas in 1800 most states had some type of property requirement for voting, within three decades most of these restrictions had been swept aside. Many of the new Western states that entered the Union in the intervening years adopted constitutions with no property requirements. As population shifted westward, the nation’s center of political gravity also shifted. Many of the politicians who dominated the national scene came from Western states such as Tennessee and Kentucky, not the older, settled regions such as Virginia and Massachusetts.

Democratic Culture
 In 1835, a young French nobleman, Count Alexis de Tocqueville, published an account of his recent trip to America. “No novelty in the United States struck me more vividly during my stay there,” he wrote, “than the equality of conditions. It was easy to see the immense influence of this basic fact on the whole course of society.” Democracy in America (1835), Tocqueville’s analysis of the influence of democracy on American life, remains one of the most important books ever written about American society. The young French aristocrat was hardly the only foreign visitor drawn to America. In the 1820s and 1830s, America attracted the interest of many other foreigners who were impressed by the democratic character of American life. “The term democrat, which elsewhere would fill even republicans with terror,” Michael Chevalier, another French visitor, noted, “is here greeted with acclamations.” Frances Trollope, an English observer, was shocked to see Americans talking to complete strangers “on terms of perfect equality.” Democracy nurtured a more egalitarian culture that astonished Europeans. In colonial America a bow or doffed hat and lowered head were all signs of deference to one’s social betters. Many of these customs persisted in Europe. Americans, however, had abandoned most of them by the 1830s, preferring to shake hands, a far more egalitarian form of greeting. One English commentator complained that in America he had to “go on shaking hands here, there, and everywhere, and with everybody.” Another Englishman confessed his astonishment that travel in America meant mixing with men and women of different classes: “There is but one conveyance, it may be said, for every class of people—the coach, railroad, or steamboat, as well

 as most of the hotels, being open to all; the consequence is that the society is very much mixed.” A significant political consequence of the growth of democracy was the expansion of suffrage to include virtually all white men. As the maps (8.1) show, most of the new Western states that entered the Union after the War of 1812 adopted democratic constitutions that rejected property qualifications for suffrage. Their constitutions generally embraced this ideal from the beginning. When older states such as New York revised their constitutions in the 1820s, the question of suffrage became one of the most contentious. See Competing Visions: Should White Men Without Property Have the Vote? on page 224.

Davy Crockett and
 the Frontier Myth Tocqueville commented that “in the Western settlements we may behold democracy arrived at its utmost limits.” He may well have been thinking of figures like the legendary frontiersman and politician Davy Crockett (1786–1836) when he made that statement. No figure in American public life did more to associate the West with democracy than Davy Crockett. Born in Tennessee, Crockett served under Andrew Jackson during the Creek Wars (1813–1814), where he distinguished himself as a soldier. His home state voters elected him to the Tennessee state legislature and to Congress, where he supported his former commander, Andrew Jackson, another symbol of frontier democracy. Crockett’s achievements in the state legislature and Congress paled in significance to the stories about his exploits as a frontiersman and Indian fighter, myths that Crockett helped shape and market to

 a growing audience of readers eager to learn of his daring exploits. As one contemporary English magazine noted: “Democracy and the far west made Crockett: he is a product of forests, freedom, universal suffrage, and bear hunts.” In his own colorful account, Crockett becomes a politician almost by accident. When coming to town to sell his pelts and furs, he exchanges a few words with local politicians, who immediately recognize him as a natural leader and draft him for the state legislature. Crockett’s career in Congress was brief, but his fame grew as literary treatments recounted stories about his exploits. Crockett’s Almanac, for example, a cheap magazine-like publication, vividly described the frontiersman-politician, whose honesty as a stump speaker and legendary adventures wrestling alligators, hunting bears, and fighting Indians captivated audiences. For Crockett delivering a stump speech meant literally standing on the nearest tree stump, as shown in this illustration from the A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett (8.2). Although Crockett was a big hit on the stump and celebrated in popular literature, the most important

 political figure to make use of the association of the West with democracy was Andrew Jackson. The Tennessee-born Jackson earned a reputation as a fierce Indian fighter during the Creek Wars and distinguished himself as the victor of the Battle of New Orleans. He also served as both a United States representative and senator from Tennessee. A supporter of Jackson described his political style as typical of the Western United States, where democratic values and egalitarian ideals flourished: “In Europe” custom “decreed that kings shall rule and the people submit. In this wilderness, as if by magic, a new and different order of things has appeared.” Jackson’s effort to link his Western origins with his democratic values became a key component of his political message for the rest of his career in public life.

Competing Visions
SHOULD WHITE MEN WITHOUT PROPERTY HAVE THE VOTE?
In 1821, New Yorkers gathered to revise their state’s 1777 constitution. The issue of property requirements for elections proved to be one of the most heated in the convention. James Kent, a conservative lawyer and judge who began his career as a Federalist, defended property requirements. His vision of politics was deeply hierarchical, which led him to oppose an expansion of suffrage. Kent was opposed by a group of younger politicians. Nathan Sanford, a man who entered politics fully a decade later than Kent, began his career as a Jeffersonian democrat. Jefferson’s election to the presidency in 1800 had not ushered in the reign of terror that his Federalist enemies predicted, and Sanford embraced the growing enthusiasm for democracy that marked politics in the early nineteenth century. Which man has a more optimistic view of human nature? Which theory of politics seems closer in spirit to the ideas behind the Federal Constitution? The most eloquent champion of retaining property requirements was James Kent, a former State Supreme Court judge and Chancellor of the State of New York (an English-style judicial office that no longer exists). Kent warned that an unchecked democracy in which the property-less and working classes enjoyed the same power as the propertied would threaten political stability and the rights of private property. The tendency of universal suffrage is to jeopardize the rights of property and the principles of liberty. There is a constant tendency in human society, and the history of every age proves it; there is a tendency in the poor to covet and to share the plunder of the rich; in the debtor to relax or avoid the obligation of contract … there is a tendency in ambitious and wicked men to inflame these combustible materials. The notion that every man that works a day on the road, or serves an idle hour in the militia, is entitled as of right to an equal participation in the whole power of government is most unreasonable and has no foundation in justice… . Society is an association for the protection of property as well as life, and the individual who contributes only one cent to the common stock ought not to have the same power and influence in directing the property and concerns of the partnership as he who contributes his thousands. 
 Nathan Sanford was a lawyer from Long Island who entered politics as a Jeffersonian, holding various state offices before being elected as a U.S. senator from New York. Rather than focus on the need to protect property, Sanford argued that those who bore the burdens of government had earned a right to have a say in it. The question before us is the right of suffrage—who shall, or who shall not, have the right to vote … the principle of the scheme now proposed, is, that those who bear the burthens of the state, [paid taxes, served in the militia, or consented to volunteer to work on public works projects such as roads] should choose those that rule it… . To me, and the majority of the committee, it appeared the only reasonable scheme that those who are to be affected by the acts of the government, should be annually entitled to vote for those who administer it.

ANDREW JACKSON AND HIS AGE



Andrew Jackson and His Age
 The new democratic spirit of American politics helped elevate Andrew Jackson’s political career, and he in turn did everything in his power to promote his vision of democracy. Jackson’s democratic ideas stopped well short of the most radical egalitarian ideas of his day. Indeed, Jackson’s vision of democracy had no room for blacks, Indians, or women. Still his invocation of the will of the people marked a turning point in American political development. After Jackson, politicians from across the political spectrum would outdo each other in affirming their commitment to democracy and praising the wisdom of the people. Jackson’s long road to the presidency began with his narrow defeat in 1824, which led to his decisive victory in 1828. Unlike earlier presidents who were drawn from the nation’s elite, Jackson was a self-made man. An orphan who became a rich planter and influential political figure in his home state of Tennessee, Jackson became a symbol for American democracy. Indeed, one of his supporters characterized the presidential election of 1828, in which Jackson squared off against John Quincy Adams for the second time, as a struggle in which “the Aristocracy and Democracy of the country are arrayed against each other.” Others viewed Jackson’s democratic leanings in a less positive light, however, seeing his election as the start of the “reign of King Mob.” Jackson’s presidency was marred by deep divisions within his own administration and challenges from outside. In particular South Carolina’s decision to respond to federal tariff policy by calling a convention to nullify federal law forced a showdown between Jackson and a new radical version of the theory of states’ rights.

The Election of 1824 and
 the “Corrupt Bargain” James Monroe, the fourth Virginian to occupy the presidency since the adoption of the Constitution (1817–1825), anointed no political figure to be his successor and carry forward his policies and ideas. Following Washington’s model Monroe had sought out a talented but diverse collection of men for his cabinet who represented a broad spectrum of political and economic views. Three of these cabinet ministers sought the presidency in 1824: William Crawford, secretary of the treasury; John Quincy Adams, secretary of state; and John C. Calhoun, secretary of war. A fourth candidate was Henry Clay, Speaker of the House of Representatives. Andrew Jackson, hero of the Battle of New Orleans, also joined the race. Jackson had served in Congress, as a judge in Tennessee, and as the appointed governor of the Florida territory. Crawford, born in Virginia but raised in Georgia, was heir to the old Jeffersonian republican vision of politics with its emphasis on states’ rights and strict construction of the Constitution. Crawford opposed Monroe’s National Republican synthesis

View the Image 1824 Election Cartoon


 of Jeffersonian politics with Hamiltonian economics (see Chapter 7). In contrast to the other candidates in the crowded field, Crawford opposed using federal power for economic development. Public expenditures for internal improvements, such as roads and canals, and charters for banks were government functions that the Constitution, Crawford argued, had wisely left to the individual states. John Quincy Adams, the son of President John Adams, was a New Englander who had been a professor at Harvard and spent considerable time in Europe as a diplomat, serving in Holland, Prussia (part of modern Germany), Great Britain, and Russia. As secretary of state he had not only negotiated the Treaty of Ghent that ended the War of 1812 but also was largely responsible for formulating the Monroe Doctrine (see Chapter 7). A short, balding, intellectual figure, Adams was neither charismatic nor politically astute; he even admitted that he could seem dogmatic and pedantic. Before entering the race for president, his primary experience had been in foreign, not domestic, politics. John C. Calhoun, the other Southerner in the race, had been a prominent War Hawk during the War of 1812. An astute politician, Calhoun

 decided to withdraw from the crowded race and soon emerged as the strongest candidate for vicepresident. Calhoun expected to bide his time until the moment was more auspicious to mount another try for the presidency. Henry Clay, the vivacious speaker of the house from Kentucky, began his career as a War Hawk during the War of 1812. On economic issues Clay had the most clearly developed vision of America’s future. Clay built on Monroe’s neoHamiltonian policies, pushing them in a more nationalistic direction. As a matter of policy, Monroe favored federal support for internal improvements such as roads and canals, but he maintained some of the same constitutional reservations about such policies that his predecessors Jefferson and Madison had articulated. Clay was an unapologetic champion of aggressive federal involvement in economic development. The American System, Clay’s plan for using the power of the federal government to encourage American industry, included tariffs to

 help protect American industry by keeping cheap foreign goods from undermining American producers, continuing support for a national bank, and an ambitious program of federal funding for internal improvements. Clay’s theory sought a harmonious interplay among agriculture, industry, and commerce. Adams endorsed the essence of Clay’s American System. This election broadside (8.3) reflects his support for Clay’s economic policies. The central image of a ship symbolizes commerce, while the two smaller figures depict a farmer at the plow and a worker at a loom. The name of the ship, John Quincy Adams, symbolizes Adams’s claim to be a proven leader who could pilot the nation to a prosperous future. Of the major candidates for the presidency in 1824, Andrew Jackson’s agenda was the least defined. Clay and Adams sought to portray Jackson as an opponent of the American System, and Jackson tried to finesse the issue by stressing that he wished to support commerce, agriculture, and industry. His campaign focused less on issues and more on character and underlying political values. Jackson fashioned himself as a frontier democrat whose honesty and courage were his primary credentials for the presidency. In the divided field Jackson won 44 percent of the popular vote and the most electoral votes, but he fell short of the majority in the Electoral College necessary to win the election (8.4). Under such circumstances the Constitution directed that the House of Representatives choose from among the top five candidates. Clay had only come in fourth, but as speaker of the house, he was a key player in determining the outcome. Given the choice among Crawford, an old-style Jeffersonian who opposed Clay’s vision for America’s future; Jackson, whose support for a more nationalist economic program was lukewarm at best; and Adams, who was sympathetic to Clay’s American System, the choice was easy for Clay. With Clay’s support Adams won. Having secured the presidency, Adams then chose Clay to be his secretary of state, which in this era functioned as the stepping-stone for aspiring future presidential candidates. (Since World War II, the vice presidency has sometimes served the same function.) Jackson and his supporters charged that Clay had traded his support for the office of secretary of state in a “corrupt bargain” that deprived

Adams proudly proclaimed his intention to “discard every element of rancor” and “yield to talents and virtue.” One exasperated supporter complained that “the friends of the administration have to contend not only against their enemies,” but “against the Administration itself, which leaves its power in the hands of its own enemies.” Adams sought to move beyond partisanship at a time when America was becoming more politically polarized.

 This pro-Adams broadside dubbed the “Coffin Handbill” features the images of coffins prominently. It casts Jackson as a brutal despot whose military record demonstrated that he was unfit to be president. The coffins symbolized militiamen Jackson executed for desertion during the Creek Wars (1813–1814).

DEMOCRATS AND WHIGS: DEMOCRACY AND AMERICAN CULTURE, 1820–1840

 At a more fundamental level, Jackson rejected the antiparty sentiments of Monroe and Adams. Jackson set out to win the presidency in 1828, forming an alliance with Crawford and Calhoun to defeat Adams and Clay. New York’s Martin Van Buren formulated the strategy for this new alliance. Van Buren was an influential Republican who had served both as a state senator and a U.S. senator. His supporters were nicknamed “Bucktails” because they wore deer tails on their hats instead of feathers. Van Buren embraced the idea of party with a passion. His goal was to re-create the old Jeffersonian coalition, which united “the planters of the South and the plain Republicans of the North.”

 How did the “Coffin Handbill” attempt to discredit Andrew Jackson?

 Jackson felt personally aggrieved by the result of the election of 1824. Charges that Adams had “stolen” that election colored the rhetoric of the 1828 campaign, which marked a new low in the use of personal attacks and negative campaigning. Jackson’s campaign portrayed Adams as an aristocrat of dubious morality, pointing out that Adams had installed a billiard table in the White House. Although now considered a popular recreation, originally billiards was an aristocratic pastime. Perhaps the most sensational claim the Jackson campaign made was that during Adams’s time as a diplomat in Russia he had “made use of a beautiful girl to seduce the passions of the Emperor.” The Jacksonians charged that Adams was a licentious aristocrat with perverse sexual values. The attack on Adams’s character was more than matched by the ferocious assaults on Jackson’s morality. The smear campaign also charged Jackson with sexual immorality, challenging the legality of his marriage. Supporters of Adams claimed that Jackson had seduced a married woman and lived with her in “open and notorious lewdness” before she had divorced her first husband. Jackson, they claimed, was a violent, brawling frontiersman who could not be trusted with the nation’s highest office. The Adams campaign even attacked Jackson’s military record. Philadelphia printer John Binn’s “Coffin Handbill” (8.5) detailed the “bloody deeds of General Jackson,” who had in fact executed six militiamen during the wars against the Creek Indians. Binn warned Americans against putting “at the head of our government, a man who was never known to govern himself.” In Jackson’s defense his supporters cast the general as “Old Hickory,” a rough-and-tumble democrat and latter-day George Washington whose plain frontier code of ethics contrasted with Adams’s elitist eastern values. To call attention to Jackson’s reputation as the hero of the Battle of New Orleans, his supporters gathered on the anniversary of the victory to plant hickory trees and raise liberty poles made of hickory wood. They ridiculed Adams’s bookish temperament, chanting “Adams can write” but “Jackson can fight.” Adams’s supporters answered the smears by praising “his long and varied public services, his great experience, his talent, his learning.” To get out their message, Jackson’s supporters developed a sophisticated campaign apparatus. A central committee in Nashville directed local and state Jackson committees, who in turn worked with

ANDREW JACKSON AND HIS AGE

 local “Hickory Clubs.” In addition to these innovations in campaign organization, Jackson’s supporters created a network of pro-Jackson newspapers to get out the word about their candidate. Eighteen new pro-Jackson newspapers sprouted up in Ohio alone. The Jacksonians also pioneered new fundraising tactics to pay for their campaign, including public banquets and other ticketed events in which supporters celebrated the achievements of their candidate. They developed an astonishing range of campaign knick-knacks, and mementos, including badges, plates, sewing boxes, and ceramics. Jacksonians also used rallies and parades to spark enthusiasm for their candidate. The tactics of Jackson and his supporters galvanized the electorate. In 1824, only about one-fourth of the eligible voters had participated; in 1828, more than half of the electorate turned out to vote. In the end Jackson garnered more than twice as many electoral votes as Adams.

The Reign of “King Mob”
 Andrew Jackson’s inaugural in 1829 captured the new democratic spirit of the age. His supporters poured into Washington for the event, shown in this contemporary print of the crowds who thronged the White House (8.6). Margaret Bayard Smith, a Washington socialite, described the scene in detail: “Thousands and thousands of people, without distinction of rank, collected in an immense mass around the Capitol.” She was shocked not only by the composition of the crowd but also by its rowdiness. The boisterous attendees, she recounted, broke “glass and bone china to the amount of several thousand dollars.” Smith was clearly ambivalent about the inauguration of the “people’s president.” She was impressed by the “majesty” of the people assembled at the swearing-in ceremony but disturbed by the rude and disorderly behavior of Jackson’s supporters at the reception that followed at the White House. This print of the inaugural confirms Smith’s impressions that



 Jackson’s inaugural was a popular affair, drawing a much more diverse crowd than previous inaugurals. Not everyone was as impressed by the people’s majesty. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story complained that Jackson’s inaugural had ushered in the “the reign of King Mob.” In contrast to Adams, who refused to use his powers of appointment to reward his political supporters, Jackson was unabashed in appointing his supporters to office. In his first inaugural Jackson defended the need for rotation in government offices. Jackson rejected the traditional republican notion, advanced by John Quincy Adams, that government offices were best reserved for a small elite, typically drawn from the ranks of the wealthy and well educated. “The duties of all public officers,” Jackson maintained, were “plain and simple.” One Jackson supporter proudly proclaimed that he saw “nothing wrong in the rule that to the victor belong the spoils of the enemy.” Opponents mocked Jackson’s appointments as “men of narrow minds” who were “hardly gentlemen” and attacked Jackson’s system of replacing government officeholders with those loyal to him as the spoils system.

 8.6 “President’s Levee, or all Creation going to the White House” This image of the boisterous crowd in front of the White House during Jackson’s inaugural reception, or levee, captures the fear that his presidency would usher in the “reign of King Mob.”

8.7 Office Seekers
 In this attack on the spoils system, a demonic Andrew Jackson dangles the spoils of victory before eager office seekers.

 This cartoon (8.7) shows Jackson dangling the spoils of victory before eager office seekers. Jackson’s practices, however, were less radical than his rhetoric. Only 20 percent of federal officeholders lost their jobs because of his new policy. Apart from his appointment of Martin Van Buren as secretary of state, Jackson’s cabinet comprised undistinguished men selected for their loyalty to him. Shortly after Jackson had assembled his cabinet, a sexual scandal engulfed his administration. The controversy swirled around his new secretary of war, John Eaton, a close friend of the president. Washington society, prone to gossip, began spreading rumors that Eaton’s wife, Peggy, the daughter of a Washington tavern keeper, was a promiscuous woman who had engaged in a clandestine affair with Eaton before their marriage. That Peggy’s first husband had allegedly committed suicide further besmirched her reputation. Still angry over the attacks on the legitimacy of his own marriage (his wife died before Jackson took office), the president defended Peggy Eaton’s reputation and ordered his cabinet members to do likewise. The Eaton scandal, which some contemporaries described as “Eaton Malaria,” consumed Jackson’s presidency for months, preventing him

 from focusing on pressing public matters. Because Floride Calhoun, the wife of the vice president had been one of the most prominent women to snub Peggy Eaton, the Eaton affair also strained the already tense relations between Jackson and Vice President John C. Calhoun. The disruption forced the president to ask most of his cabinet to resign in 1831.

States Rights and the
Nullification Crisis
 Even if Jackson and Calhoun had not fallen out over the Eaton affair, the two men were on a collision course. The rift between them widened as the politics of states’ rights divided the nation. Calhoun’s home state of South Carolina became a hotbed of radical states’ rights doctrine, and Calhoun had to embrace the doctrine or retire from public life. Choosing to take up the cause, Calhoun became one of its leading spokesmen. The issue that vexed South Carolina was federal tariffs on imported goods. In 1828, Congress enacted high import duties on a variety of goods, including textiles. The South objected to the tariff, believing that Britain would retaliate by raising tariffs on imported cotton, which would hurt Southern

Read the Document South Carolina Refuses the Tariff


ANDREW JACKSON AND HIS AGE

 agriculture. The objections of the South Carolina legislature were outlined in A Protest, and the underlying political and constitutional theory was elaborately described anonymously by Calhoun in his manifesto, the Exposition. Calhoun took the theory of states’ rights to a new level, defending South Carolina’s right to nullify, or make legally void, the 1828 tariff. His manifesto developed ideas first articulated by Jefferson and Madison in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions into a radical theory of states’ rights (see Chapter 6). According to Calhoun the Union was a sovereign compact among the people of the states. When the states and the national government disagreed over the constitutionality of a federal law, he asserted, the states were entitled to judge the constitutionality of federal laws. This position challenged both the supremacy of the federal government and the power of the federal courts to be the final arbiter on the constitutionality of federal laws. Asserting that a state could call special conventions to nullify federal laws, Calhoun’s doctrine of nullification went further than either Jefferson or Madison’s earlier defenses of states’ rights. The issue of states’ rights resurfaced in 1830 when Congress debated a proposal to limit sales of Western lands. Samuel Foot, a senator from Connecticut, proposed to slow Western expansion by cutting back on the public sale of Western lands, a decision that would have also robbed the government of revenues and made it even more dependent on tariffs. Prompting Foot’s resolution was a report from the land office that 72 million acres of land already surveyed remained unsold. Senators Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri and Robert Hayne of South Carolina denounced Foot’s resolution. Benton and Hayne saw an opportunity to forge a Southern and Western alliance against New England’s commercial interests. Benton saw Foot’s proposal as a means for New England’s industrialists to maintain their supply of cheap labor by making it harder for laborers to settle on Western lands. Hayne took a different tactic; framing the issue in terms of South Carolina’s theory of states’ rights, he moved beyond the specifics of Foot’s proposal to suggest that federal control over Western lands was itself a source of danger since it encouraged the growth of federal power. Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts attacked the South Carolinian’s theory of states’ rights. The ensuing debate between Hayne and Webster was a brilliant display of oratory. One observer



 “Every seat, every inch of ground, even the steps, were compactly filled, and yet not space enough for the ladies—the Senators were obliged to relinquish their chairs of the State to the fair auditors who literally sat in the Senate.” MARGARET SMITH’S recollections of the Senate Chamber during Webster’s reply to Hayne recalled: “It was a day never to be forgotten by those who witnessed the scene in the Senate Chamber and a day destined to be forever memorable in the Annals of the Senate.” In a riveting speech Webster denounced the theory of states’ rights and asserted the supremacy of the Union over the individual states: “Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.” Building on ideas developed by Hamilton and John Marshall (see Chapters 6 and 7), Webster’s constitutional nationalism denied that the states could judge the constitutionality of federal laws and rejected the theory of nullification. Webster’s speech was widely reprinted and became an instant classic; schoolchildren would recite it throughout the Northeast for generations. This meticulous historical painting by George Healy (8.8) immortalized the debate. Webster,

 pausing for a moment’s reflection, stands in a hushed Senate chamber. Onlookers crowd the galleries, transfixed by his oratory. Although senators had given up their seats in the chamber to accommodate the many women who attended to hear the speech, Healey placed all the women in the Senate gallery, a decision likely motivated by his belief that viewers would have been shocked to see women on the floor of the Senate. With the Webster-Hayne debate fresh in everyone’s memory, supporters of states’ rights gathered in Washington to honor the memory of Thomas Jefferson. Hayne and Calhoun both attended this dinner as did President Jackson. When Hayne concluded a long defense of states’ rights, attention turned to Jackson, who was expected to propose a toast to Hayne’s pro-states’ rights sentiments. Having always been a moderate supporter of states’ rights, Jackson would surely support Hayne, the crowd thought. They were shocked, however, when he lifted his glass and proclaimed, “Our Federal Union. It must be preserved.” Rather than support Hayne, the president appeared to echo Webster. Vice President Calhoun, who had become an outspoken defender of states’ rights, responded with his own toast, “The Union, next to our liberties, the most dear.” Realizing that he could not effectively defend South Carolina and promulgate the cause of states’ rights from the vice presidency, Calhoun

 resigned. South Carolina promptly elected him to the Senate. The issue of states’ rights and nullification moved to the center of American political life as the controversy over tariffs heated up again. Congress intended the Tariff Act of 1832, which President Jackson signed, to be a conciliatory gesture to South Carolina. Although the new act lowered import duties, South Carolinians continued to view tariffs as an effort by one section of the nation to wage economic war against another. South Carolina called a convention and issued a declaration nullifying the tariff. Jackson denounced these actions as “subversive of the Constitution.” Privately he warned that if South Carolina spilled a drop of blood in “defiance of the laws of the United States,” he would, “hang the first man of them I can get my hands on to the first tree I can find.” Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, warned that when President Jackson “begins to talk about hanging, they can begin to look out for ropes.” This contemporary cartoon attacking nullification (8.9) highlights Jackson’s tough stance. The president, restraining one of Calhoun’s supporters, declares, “Stop you have gone too far. Or by the Eternal I will hang you all!” Congress passed a Force Bill that gave the president the power to use military force to collect revenues, including tariffs. While Jackson was adopting a public tough stance, Henry Clay was working behind the scenes to avert a confrontation. On the same day that Congress passed the Force Bill, it also scaled back tariffs. In response to this conciliatory gesture, South Carolina rescinded its act of nullification, but not before nullifying the Force Act. Clay’s compromise had narrowly averted a constitutional crisis in which the states and the federal government had nearly come to blows. For the moment the conflict between states’ rights and a more nationalist vision of the Constitution had been settled in favor of the latter. Although Jackson adopted a hard line with South Carolina, he would prove to be far more flexible when federal and state power collided over other issues, notably Indian rights. Jackson’s democratic nationalism had little room for anyone but white men. Its narrowness would become increasingly clear during his two terms as president.

WHITE MAN’S DEMOCRACY



 White Man’s Democracy The democratic ideas that swept Andrew Jackson into the presidency were premised on a vision of society that was not truly inclusive: It excluded blacks and Indians, and showed little interest in women’s rights. The new state constitutions drafted in the Jacksonian era expanded rights for nonproperty-owning white men but stripped voting rights from propertyowning African Americans. The plight of American Indians also became a major issue during Jackson’s presidency. Jackson and his supporters sought to restrict Indians’ rights and expropriate their lands. Although the revised state constitutions systematically stripped away rights from free blacks, African Americans created a network of thriving communities in the free states of the North and the old Northwest (the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois). However, harassment of African Americans in the nation’s cities also increased during the Jacksonian era. Indeed, the struggles of African Americans to achieve economic and social respectability prompted vicious attacks in the popular press and might even lead to violence. Pressure to find more land for white settlers also intensified, which increased tensions with American Indians who were eager to defend their lands against further encroachments. Jackson and his supporters showed little regard for the rights of Indian peoples. The Cherokee fought a valiant effort to defend their rights within the rules established by the Constitution and learned that the rule of law provided scant protection against racism and a rapacious desire for Indian land.

Race and Politics in
 the Jacksonian Era While many states were expanding the suffrage for white men, other states were imposing new restrictions on black men. The 1821 New York state constitutional convention that had abolished property requirements for white men adopted a high property requirement for African Americans that effectively disenfranchised most blacks. Thus, while the state’s African-American population numbered some 30,000 in 1825, fewer than 300 black men were eligible to vote. New York’s actions were part of a broader pattern of racial exclusion that limited the rights of African Americans throughout the North and West. African Americans lost the right to vote in Rhode Island in 1822 and Pennsylvania in 1838. Most of the new states that entered the Union after 1819 denied suffrage to African Americans. Many states also regulated the conduct of free African Americans. In 1831, Indiana required that “Negroes and mulattoes emigrating in the state” be required to post a bond (much like prisoners awaiting trial) or be deported. Illinois not only barred blacks from voting but prohibited them from testifying in court or bringing civil suits. Ohio barred

 African Americans from access to the courts in “any controversy where either party to the sale is a white person” and declared that African Americans “have no constitutional right to present their petitions to the General Assembly for any purpose whatsoever.” Gradual emancipation schemes increased the number of free blacks in the North and West. In part the intensification of racism reflected concern over economic competition from the growing number of free blacks. Yet despite the legal barriers placed in the way of African Americans’ economic progress, vibrant communities grew in the North. The most obvious measure of the success of these communities was the rise of a rich array of African American cultural and economic institutions, including churches, fraternal organizations, and benefit societies. African Americans published their first newspaper, Freedom’s Journal, in New York in 1827. The efforts of free blacks in the North and West to improve their conditions became a subject of widespread comment in the press. Typically the press lampooned the efforts of African Americans to attain cultural and economic respectability. Exploiting this popular racism, artist Edward William Clay

 published 14 cartoons ridiculing Philadelphia’s African-American community. In A Black Charge (8.10), Clay mocks a black church official who must attempt to discipline a disorderly member of his community. As was typical in this era, the artist has exaggerated the physical appearances of African Americans and caricatured their speech, suggesting that blacks could only speak a distorted form of English. Jackson’s vision of white man’s democracy had tragic consequences for American Indians. His dealings with Indian peoples during his presidency were also consistent with his view that they were culturally inferior to whites, and that their civilization was on the path toward extinction. In Jackson’s political calculus white settlers’ need for land was paramount and the rights of Indians carried little if any weight. These beliefs shaped his response to the conflict between the state of Georgia and the Cherokees. The President’s views of Indians had been formed during his early military career, in which he was well known as an Indian fighter. At the conclusion of the Creek Wars (1812–1813), he had seized 23 million acres of Creek land, more than half of present-day Alabama and part of Georgia. Jackson treated the Indians as conquered subjects, not as a sovereign people. Rather than continuing to mount violent resistance, a number of Indian tribes adopted American ways. The Cherokee were among the Indian peoples who white Americans described as

 the “Five Civilized Tribes:” Cherokees, Choctaws, Seminoles, Creeks, and Chickasaws. These five tribes had to varying degrees chosen the path of cultural assimilation rather than resistance to America’s expansionist policies. These tribes together numbered some 75,000 people spread out over the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Adopting the agricultural practices of their white neighbors and converting to Christianity were two major efforts the tribes made to accommodate to American culture. No tribe was more committed to accommodation than the Cherokee. They converted to Christianity, established schools, and practiced American-style agriculture; a few prosperous Cherokees even kept slaves to work on their cotton plantations, mimicking their white neighbors in Georgia. They also abandoned their traditional tribal governance, declared themselves an independent republic, and adopted a constitution modeled on the Federal Constitution. As a sovereign nation they claimed to enjoy all the legal privileges that all nations enjoyed and were therefore not subject to the laws of the state of Georgia. However, the Cherokee effort to become an independent nation within the territorial confines of Georgia did not sit well with the government of the state. When Georgians discovered gold on Cherokee land in 1828, a horde of white prospectors tried to stake out claims on Indian lands, a clear violation of tribal authority and law. Declaring tribal law null and void, Georgia passed a law that stripped the tribe of any legal authority over their lands. Henceforth Georgia law, not Cherokee law, would govern the Cherokee. The state also created a special police force, the Georgia Guard, to patrol Indian territory. The tribe lobbied sympathetic opponents of Jackson and turned to the federal courts for protection, arguing that Georgia’s actions violated treaties between the Cherokee and the United States. While the Cherokee awaited their day in court, Jackson turned up the pressure on them. The president refused the Cherokee’s plea for federal troops to protect them. Because Indians could not testify in Georgia courts, the Cherokee were left without any legal means of defending their rights under the laws of Georgia. Jackson seized the opportunity provided by the crisis to advance a plan to remove the Cherokee from Georgia and relocate them beyond the Mississippi River. He cast himself as benevolent father, intervening to rescue the Cherokee from extinction. His program would not force Indians to leave, but it made it very unattractive for anyone to remain

 behind. Indians who refused to relocate were relegated to the status of free blacks, who had only minimal legal rights under Georgia law. Jackson presented the Cherokee with two equally disastrous choices: accept the legal destruction of their tribal identity and live as second-class citizens in Georgia, or relocate to a distant territory far from their ancestral homes. Jackson’s opponents in Congress, many of whom had close ties to Protestant churches and missionary societies that had helped convert the Cherokees to Christianity, attacked his proposals. New Jersey’s Senator Theodore Frelinghuysen wondered if “it is one of the prerogatives of the white man, that he may disregard the dictates of moral principles, when an Indian shall be concerned.” Others attacked the president’s proposal as a sham that offered Indians no legal protections if they stayed and allocated few resources to allow them to make a safe journey west. In this cartoon critical of Jackson’s Indian policy (8.11), the president leads a parade that includes the devil and caged Indians. The Protestant clergymen who led the opposition to Jackson’s policy and who opposed removal were not great champions of Indian culture. Indeed, the religious defense of Indian rights shared many of the racist assumptions about Indians and their cultures that Jackson and others eager to dispossess them espoused. Yet these supporters of

 Indians’ rights believed that the supposed “inferiority” of Indian culture did not sanction unjust treatment or the violation of Indian rights. Women’s reformers also rallied to the cause of Indian rights. Women’s groups touted themselves as disinterested guardians of public morality who were not subject to the “blinding influence of party spirit.” Jackson’s aggressive removal policy threatened the ongoing effort to Christianize and civilize the Indians. Building on a tradition that extended back to the Revolutionary era (see Chapters 4 and 5), women invoked their moral authority as the guardians of the Republic’s values, and opposed Jackson’s policies as an affront to church, school, and the family. Such appeals were so effective that Martin Van Buren, Jackson’s chief lieutenant, was shocked that his own niece opposed Jackson’s policy and hoped that the president would lose his bid for reelection in 1832. The Jacksonians passed their removal bill by a narrow margin. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 gave President Jackson the authority to exchange Indians lands within the borders of the existing states for land west of the Mississippi. Federal officials put substantial pressure on Indian tribes to accept this offer and stressed that the federal government would not be able to protect Indian rights against state action if Indians did not agree to relocate. In essence, the federal government

 “We wish to remain on the land of our fathers. We have a perfect and original right to remain without interruption or molestation.” Address of a council of the Cherokee nation to the people of the United States, written in July of 1830.

 informed Indians that if they chose to remain, the government would tacitly allow the states to run roughshod over Indian rights. Although some tribes reluctantly accepted the inevitability of relocation, others resisted. The Cherokee eloquently protested against their forced relocation. Their leaders stated their desire to remain on the land of their ancestors and reminded Americans that their existing treaties with the United States guaranteed them this right. Rather than concede to the unfavorable terms presented by the federal government, or accede to the pressure from state governments, the Cherokee decided to seek a legal remedy in federal court. When Georgia violated Cherokee rights, the tribe sued, and the case ended up in the Supreme Court.

The Cherokee Cases
 The struggle between Georgia and the Cherokee raised important constitutional questions. The Cherokee claimed to be a sovereign nation not subject to the laws of the state of Georgia. As was true of any sovereign nation, they claimed the right to govern themselves by rules that their own legislature enacted and to deal with the United States as a sovereign power. Georgia argued that Indians were subjects of the United States and that the idea of an independent Indian state within Georgia was an absurdity. The status of Indian nations in American constitutional law came before the Supreme Court in two separate cases related to the claims of the Cherokee nation. In the Cherokee Cases, Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1830) and Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the Supreme Court determined that Indian tribes retained certain rights traditionally associated with sovereign nations, including the right to govern themselves by their own laws, but lacked other rights, such as the ability to sue the state of Georgia. The latter case came to the Supreme

 What do the Cherokee cases reveal about the limits of judicial power?

 Court because Georgia had imprisoned two Protestant missionaries, Samuel Worcester and Elizur Butler, charging them with residing on Indian land without obtaining a license from the state. As both men were citizens of the United States, clearly they were entitled to sue in federal courts. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice John Marshall found that the missionaries had been wrongly imprisoned and were entitled to protection by the federal courts. Moreover, Marshall gave the Cherokee an important victory when he held that “the laws of Georgia can have no force” on Cherokee territory. Although the Cherokee did not enjoy all the privileges accorded foreign nations by U.S. law, they did retain the right to make laws within their own lands. One Cherokee leader, Elias Boudinot, greeted Marshall’s ruling in Worcester enthusiastically. Andrew Jackson was dismissive and wrote a supporter that the decision was unenforceable. Georgia refused to accept the Court’s ruling and did not release the imprisoned missionaries. President Jackson was unwilling to antagonize Georgia, and was ill-disposed to Indians rights, so he refused to enforce Marshall’s decision. The case might have precipitated a major constitutional crisis: A president refusing to follow a Court decision would have undermined the legitimacy of the entire federal judiciary. To avoid such a showdown, Jackson persuaded the governor of Georgia to simply pardon Worcester and Butler. Once the men were freed, the legal issue vanished, and Jackson and Marshall were no longer pitted against one another.

Resistance and Removal
 The release of the two missionaries eliminated any legal issues and cleared the way for the Jackson administration to pursue its policy of removal. The Cherokee now faced the painful choice of accepting the inevitability of removal or continuing to resist Jackson and the state of Georgia. (See Choices and Consequences: Acquiesce or Resist? The Cherokee Dilemma.) In 1835, a minority of the Cherokee leadership signed a treaty agreeing to relocate west of the Mississippi. Many Cherokee denounced the treaty and hoped that their leaders could avert relocation. In 1838, federal troops began rounding up Cherokee and placing them in stockades to await deportation. The squalid conditions in the stockades took a heavy toll, and many of the most outspoken Cherokee

Choices and Consequences
ACQUIESCE OR RESIST? THE CHEROKEE DILEMMA
Should the Cherokee have resisted Jackson’s removal policy? The Cherokee nation faced a difficult decision regarding how to deal with the increasing pressure to abandon their land and relocate to what is now Oklahoma. The tribal leadership was divided. Most Cherokee supported Principal Chief John Ross, who believed that there was enough support among Jackson’s political opponents to block relocation. A minority within the tribe supported Elias Boudinot, who argued that it was better to relocate than oppose the inevitable. 
Choices




 Agree to the treaty and relocate; seek the best possible terms from the U.S. government to facilitate the removal process.



 Reject the treaty and resist removal, by force if necessary.

Decision
 A small but vocal minority of the Cherokee, including Elias Boudinot, believed that continued residence in Georgia would only result in further harassment. They reasoned that it would be more prudent to try to obtain the best deal from the United States and relocate west. However, most Cherokee supported John Ross, who believed that it was still possible to rally support among

 religious groups and other whites sympathetic to Indian rights. Ross also recognized that Senators Daniel Webster and Henry Clay, two of the most powerful figures in the Senate opposed Jackson and were eager to use the plight of Indians to attack him. Most Cherokees refused to participate in the referendum held on the treaty. Supporters of the treaty accepting relocation won, but the treaty was not widely accepted by most Cherokee who had boycotted the vote.

Consequences
 Bolstered by popular opposition to the treaty among the Cherokee, John Ross lobbied the Senate hard to reject it and came within one vote of defeating it. Having won a narrow victory, Jackson signed the treaty and the Cherokee

 Was it realistic for the Cherokees to think that they might win support for their cause? Most scholars agree that Jackson’s Indian policy was racist and unethical, particularly the violation of existing treaties. There is, however, disagreement over how to make sense of the Cherokee response to the dilemma Jackson’s policy created. Supporters of John Ross note that he was a savvy politician whose calculation that opposition to Jackson and sympathy for the plight of Indians made continued resistance a reasonable strategy. Opponents of Ross argue that Boudinot and others who voted in favor of the treaty were more realistic in their assessment of the political situation.

 Was resistance to removal a viable strategy for the Cherokee?

 opponents of removal recognized that further resistance was futile. Indian leaders who had continued to protest were joined by a broad coalition that included clergymen, women reformers, and constitutional nationalists such as Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, who were horrified at Jackson’s behavior toward the Cherokee. The two men were particularly outraged by Jackson’s disregard for treaty obligations, and his disrespect for the authority of the federal courts.

 of opponents who believed Jackson had become a tyrant who showed little regard for justice or the rule of law. During the long and arduous march westward to what is now Oklahoma (8.12), thousands of Cherokee men, women, and children died. Harsh weather, a shortage of supplies, and poor sanitation contributed to a staggering death toll. Estimates vary but as many as 4,000 of the 12,000 Cherokee who were relocated perished in the trip. For the Cherokee and their descendants, the move west became known as “the Path Where They Cried,” or the “Trail of Tears.”

DEMOCRATS, WHIGS, AND THE SECOND PARTY SYSTEM



Democrats, Whigs, and the
Second Party System
 Unlike previous partisan movements Jackson’s Democratic Party operated as an efficient and nationally integrated political organization. The new party organization called for a new party name. In the election of 1828, Jackson’s supporters had described themselves as Democratic-Republicans, whereas Adams’s supporters opted for the name National Republicans. These two labels testify to the transitional nature of the election. Both names harked back to political labels that were associated with the partisan struggles of Jefferson’s and Monroe’s administrations. By the election of 1832, Jackson supporters were simply calling themselves Democrats. By contrast Jackson’s opposition was still defining itself. A third political party, the AntiMasonic party, organized in response to the undue influence of the Masonic Order—a fraternal organization whose members included many of the nation’s most prominent politicians—capturing the imagination of voters briefly, but then disbanded. During Jackson’s second term a new political party, the Whigs, rose out of the ashes of the old National Republicans, stressing the need for a talented, virtuous elite to shape the nation’s future. Evoking the name of the seventeenth-century English opponents of absolute monarchy and the Patriot leaders who had opposed George III during the American Revolution, the Whigs saw themselves as defenders of the Constitution against executive despotism. Opposition to Jackson’s Indian policy provided a common issue around which many disaffected groups had rallied early in Jackson’s presidency. Economic policy, as defined by Clay’s American System (which included support for the national bank), and a general opposition to the new vision of executive power personified by Jackson, particularly his Bank Veto, helped define the core issues of the new Whig Party. Once voters aligned with one of the two main parties, they tended to remain loyal to it during their lifetimes. This intensified the divisions between the two new parties.

Third Party Challenges:
Anti-Masonic and
 Workingmen’s Parties In the election of 1832, Andrew Jackson, aiming at a second term as president, faced Henry Clay, who still saw himself as the heir to James Monroe and John Quincy Adams’s National Republicans. Another candidate, William Wirt, a talented lawyer who had argued the Cherokee cases before the Supreme Court, entered the fray as the choice of the Anti-Masonic party. The presence of a third party worked against Clay, splitting the anti-Jackson vote. The Anti-Masons emerged in New York state as a reaction against the power of the Masonic Order, a secret fraternal organization that included many of

 the nation’s most powerful figures, including Jackson and Clay. Freemasonry had a long history in America. Many members of America’s founding generation had been Freemasons, including George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. The Freemasons championed Enlightenment ideals, but they also drew some of their rituals and symbols from mystical traditions. The best-known Masonic symbol, an eye suspended over an unfinished pyramid, appears on the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States (and also on the modern dollar bill). Several characteristics of the Freemasons made them a target of popular suspicion. Secret handshakes, rituals, passwords, and other Masonic practices aroused unease. That so many prominent politicians were Masons encouraged conspiracy theories about the organization. Freemasonry’s support for the Enlightenment also angered

DEMOCRATS AND WHIGS: DEMOCRACY AND AMERICAN CULTURE, 1820–1840

 religious groups, especially evangelicals, who believed that Masons were anti-Christian. These suspicions and resentments provided the backdrop to a sensational crime involving the Freemasons. In 1826, a disgruntled ex-Freemason, William Morgan, threatened to expose the order’s secret rituals. When Morgan was kidnapped and disappeared, a clamor arose against the order. The Anti-Masonic party capitalized on this sensational crime. Meanwhile, the Freemasons did not remain silent. In this image emblazoned on an apron, the Anti-Masons are cast as the mythical monster the hydra. The image also links Anti-Masons with a host of vices. Freemasons, by contrast, are associated with Enlightenment values, such as science and equality. The apron also makes use of a pyramid, a common Masonic symbol (8.13). The Anti-Masons proved to be innovative politicians, building an effective popular political movement. Although short-lived, their party, the first third-party movement in American history, helped pioneer new political techniques that mainstream parties soon adopted. The Anti-Masonic party used

 What lasting contributions did the Anti-Masons make to American politics?

 “As long as property is unequal: or rather, as long as it is so enormously unequal, as we see it at present… those who possess it, will live on the labor of others.” THOMAS SKIDMORE, The Rights of Man to Property! 1829 a national nominating convention to select a presidential candidate. It was also the first party to adopt an official platform, so that voters could judge the party’s position on important questions. This party also energized religious voters who were drawn into public life and politics by the party’s efforts. At the same time that the Anti-Masonic party was organizing, workers in Philadelphia (1828) and New York (1829) formed their own political parties. The Workies, as they were called, won seats in the state legislatures. Among the political reforms they achieved was the abolition of imprisonment for debt. In this pro-Workie cartoon (8.14), an honest working man exercises the ballot freely, while a corrupt tool of the moneyed interest serves the devil. The most radical voice of working class radicalism was that of the artisan Thomas Skidmore, who advocated a comprehensive program to use inheritance taxes to equalize wealth. In his book The Rights of Man to Property! (1829), Skidmore tackled the problem of economic inequality head on by proposing that wealth be subject to a huge inheritance tax. Although citizens would be free to accumulate as much wealth as they could during their lifetime, they would not be able to pass it on to their children. The goal was to prevent the creation of a monied aristocracy. Revenue from this inheritance tax would be used by the government to provide each new generation of citizens with a basic economic stake, so that each citizen would start life with the same economic advantages. This radical proposal to redistribute wealth went nowhere.

 But although the Workies were unable to create a national labor party, some of their proposals were popular enough to be picked up by mainstream Democrats. In particular the Workies’ attack on banking resonated with Jackson and his followers. The class-conscious rhetoric of the Workies would affect how Democrats framed their message for the American people.

The Bank War and the
Rise of the Whigs
 Jackson’s growing opposition to Clay’s American System, including a visceral hatred for the Bank of the United States, emerged as a defining feature of his presidency. The political war that arose over the Bank helped Jackson’s opponents to define their identity and create a new political party, the Whigs. Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, two influential figures within the anti-Jackson National Republican party, believed that the president’s hatred for the Bank could be used to defeat him in the election of 1832. Clay reasoned that Jackson’s opposition to the Bank would alienate most voters because they would recognize the importance of a national bank. Clay approached Nicholas Biddle, the head of the Bank of

 the United States, to petition Congress for an early renewal of the Bank’s charter in 1832. Clay knew that Jackson was opposed to the Bank and might veto the new charter, which Clay believed would turn the public against the President. Jackson confided to Martin Van Buren his intention to destroy the Bank. “The Bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me, but I will kill it!” When Congress renewed the Bank’s charter in 1832, Jackson vetoed it, and Clay lacked the votes to override the veto. The Bank then became the central issue of the presidential campaign of 1832. Although the Bank had many supporters, including some in Jackson’s administration, the veto turned out to be popular. Jackson had managed to convert opposition to the Bank into support for democracy itself. In his Bank Veto Speech, Jackson not only explained why he opposed re-chartering the Bank of the United States but also laid out his own vision of American democracy and constitutional government. Jackson attacked “the rich and powerful” who “too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes.” His speech appealed to “the humble members of society—the farmers, mechanics and laborers.” Jackson portrayed the Bank as a tool of the rich and powerful, who had obtained a charter by corrupting Congress. Thus, while the Bank Veto Speech sounded

 How did Jackson use democratic rhetoric to rally support for his Bank Veto?

 democratic themes, it avoided the most combative class-conscious rhetoric radicals in the Workingmen’s movement had employed. Jackson did not attack wealth or the wealthy, but only those who used their wealth and influence to gain unfair advantages. Democratic newspapers echoed Jackson’s view of the Bank: “The Jackson cause is the cause of democracy and the people against a corrupt and abandoned aristocracy.” Jackson also used the Veto Speech to defend his view that federal courts were not the final judges of what the Constitution meant. In his view each branch of the federal government had an obligation to interpret the Constitution for itself. Opponents attacked the veto as an assault on the Constitution. The press charged that Jackson had become “a DICTATOR.” His veto, one newspaper claimed, was the act of a tyrant who had contempt for Congress. Rather than a victory for democracy, Jackson’s recklessness was a sign of his corruption. For his opponents Jackson became the embodiment of tyranny. Jackson’s war against the Bank of the United States inspired a rich assortment of political cartoons, both critical and supportive of his policies. Democratic cartoonists cast Jackson as the champion of the common man, while supporters of the bank depicted him as a reckless tyrant. These images are explored in Images as History: King Andrew and the Downfall of Mother Bank (see pages 244–245).

Andrew Jackson, the Whigs,
 and the Bank War In the election of 1832, Jackson defeated Clay by 200,000 votes and by a roughly 4-to-1 margin in the Electoral College. Clay’s strategy of making the Bank the central issue in the campaign had backfired, and Jackson’s attack on it had increased his popularity. Still the Bank War helped Jackson’s opponents define their political identity and create a new political party, the Whigs. Having defeated its supporters, Jackson might have opted to let the Bank die a natural death by simply allowing its charter to expire. However, fearing that his enemies would try to revive the Bank during the next

 congressional session and vote it a new charter, he decided to withdraw all federal funds from the Bank, a move that would have made its revival financially impossible. Jackson ordered his secretary of the treasury to remove the government’s deposits, but even his own secretary thought such a move rash and damaging to the economy. The president had to fire two men before he could find one willing to become secretary of the treasury and follow his orders. Jackson justified this unusual step by noting that his reelection had given him a popular mandate to destroy the Bank. No previous president had ever cast his election in such terms. Even some congressional Democrats believed that Jackson had risked the economic well-being of the country to satisfy his personal vendetta against the Bank. Jackson’s enemies in Congress condemned his actions as additional proof that he was a tyrant who sought “a total change of the pure republican character of the Government and the concentration of all powers in the hands one man.” For the Whigs, Jackson was little better than George III, whom America’s own Whig Patriots had opposed more than 50 years before.

Economic Crisis and
 the Presidency of Martin Van Buren Jackson’s decision to remove funds from the Bank and deposit them in state banks damaged the economy. State banks were far less cautious than the Bank of the United States in loaning money, particularly for speculative land ventures. The resulting expansion of credit led to a speculative frenzy. By 1836, land sales mushroomed, increasing almost tenfold in five years to $25 million. To slow down the overheated economy, Jackson adopted a hard money policy, the Specie Circular, which required that land purchased from the government be paid for with specie—hard currency (before this policy individuals had purchased land with bank notes that were not guaranteed by gold or silver).

DEMOCRATS, WHIGS, AND THE SECOND PARTY SYSTEM

 Martin Van Buren had become the most influential figure in Jackson’s inner circle and was the Democrats’ candidate for president in 1836. In most respects Van Buren was nearly the opposite of Andrew Jackson. Political caricaturists made much of the physical and personality differences between the two. Jackson was tall, thin, impulsive, and headstrong, whereas Van Buren was short, stout, cautious, and compromising. The nicknames of the two underscored the differences. Jackson was the “Hero of New Orleans” or “Old Hickory,” whereas Van Buren was the “Little Magician” or the “Slippery Elm.” Van Buren won by a narrow margin in 1836, garnering 50.2 percent of the popular vote. He also inherited a weak economy. Within a year of taking office, he was forced to deal with the Panic of 1837, an economic crisis that plunged the nation into economic depression. Unemployment rose dramatically, as did the number of farm foreclosures and business failures. Wages dropped by as much as 50 percent, and a third of the workforce was out of work in hardhit areas, such as Philadelphia. The cartoon The Times

 illustrates the hardships associated with the Panic of 1837 and links them with Jackson’s economic policies (8.15). The images of idle workers staggering drunk, while a respectable-looking woman and child beg for coins, show the plight of the working class. Although Whigs blamed Jackson’s war against the Bank, the economic causes of the panic were largely foreign. In 1837, the Bank of England decided to raise its interest rates and restrict the flow of credit to British banks investing in America. This constriction of credit forced American banks to restrict their loans and call in many outstanding debts. Without access to additional credit, many businesses and farms defaulted on their loans. When these loans went bad, many banks, caught short, had to close. These bank failures led to a further constriction of credit, which then triggered another round of foreclosures and business failures. To make matters worse, the price of cotton on the world market plummeted in 1837, leaving many speculators without the funds to cover their loans and causing more bankruptcies. Critics of the president gave him a new nickname—“Martin Van Ruin.”

 Andrew Jackson’s war on the Second Bank of the United States provided political cartoonists with an excellent subject for satire. Jackson’s enemies seized on his veto of the bill renewing the Bank’s charter and his decision to withdraw federal funds from the Bank and deposit them in state banks

 who had trampled on the Constitution and recklessly distributed government funds to political cronies, the president’s opponents found a potent rhetorical theme that was easily translated into powerful visual images. The Whig view of Jackson is beautifully illustrated in “King Andrew the First.” In this cartoon, he not only sports a crown and scepter, two obvious symbols of monarchy, but is adorned in rich robes fit for a king. Jackson holds a copy of the Bank Veto in one hand and tramples on the Constitution.



 Jackson’s supporters also found fertile subject for visual treatment. In this cartoon, “the Downfall of Mother Bank,” Jackson and a popular cartoon character, Major Jack Downing (a forerunner of the character Uncle Sam) bring down the pillars of the Bank by announcing the withdrawal of Government Funds. The Bank’s President, rendered with a demonic head, flees the scene. Jackson’s enemies, the Whigs Henry Clay and Daniel Webster also rendered in an unflattering light.

 CHAPTER 8

DEMOCRATS AND WHIGS: DEMOCRACY AND AMERICAN CULTURE, 1820–1840

Playing the Democrats’ Game:
Whigs in the Election of 1840
 Largely because the Whigs split their vote among different regional candidates in 1836, they lost the election to Van Buren. However, the failure of the Whigs also reflected their problem communicating their message to the American people. Millard Fillmore, a young Whig from upstate New York (who would later become president), lamented the “heterogeneous mass” of the Whig Party, which included “old national republicans, and Jackson men in revolt, Masons and Anti-Masons, Abolitionists, and pro-Slavery men.” Fillmore hoped that his party could find some “crucible … to melt them down into one mass of pure Whigs of undoubted good metal.” In 1840, the Whigs did unite and learned how to frame their message to appeal to the American people. Drafting a popular military figure, William Henry Harrison, the Whigs reshaped their campaign using the tools and rhetoric that had made the Democrats so successful, especially their direct appeals to the people. In brief they learned to play the Democrats’ game. The Whigs also pioneered new techniques for mobilizing voters and made an unprecedented effort to involve women in their cause.

The Log Cabin Campaign
 Democrat Martin Van Buren’s supporters derided the Whig candidate in 1840, General William Henry Harrison, as “Old Granny” or “Old Tippecanoe.” The nicknames alluded to the general’s age— he was almost 70—and to his victory over Shawnee Indians at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. One Democratic editor in Baltimore suggested that given his advanced age it might be best to “give him a barrel of hard cider” and let him “sit out the remainder of his days in his log cabin.” The effort to ridicule Harrison backfired, however: The Whigs seized on the twin images of hard cider and log cabins as the symbols for their campaign. The new campaign message transformed Harrison’s public persona almost overnight: He was no longer the well-educated son of a wealthy Virginia planter (his real background), but was instead a simple farmer born into a log cabin who enjoyed a glass of hard (alcoholic) cider like all common folk. Eager to take advantage of the Democratic mistake, the Whigs plastered log cabins and barrels of hard cider onto an astonishing array of items: badges, banners, buttons, belt bucklers, hair brushes, pewter spoons, lithographed prints, quilts, and song sheets. The Whigs also used miniature wooden log cabins as floats, transforming what had been marches into festive parades.

 What political innovations helped the Whigs out-democrat the Democrats?

 Whig slogans became two of the most successful campaign slogans in U.S. history: “Tippecanoe and Tyler too” to support Harrison, and “Van, Van is a used up man” to taunt their opponent, Martin Van Buren. The Democratic Review, capturing the irony of the election of 1840, noted that “we have taught them how to conquer us.” Whigs not only adapted the Democrat’s campaign techniques for mobilizing the popular vote but also developed their own innovative campaign style. With parades and campaign music such as “General Harrison’s Log Cabin March & Quick Step,” one of several popular campaign songs, the Whigs orchestrated a brilliant campaign and trounced their opponents (8.16). One Democratic paper complained: “We could meet the Whigs on the field of argument and beat them.” But how were Democrats to respond when the Whigs “lay down the weapons of argument and attack us with musical notes”? While Whigs cast Harrison and his running mate John Tyler as men of the people, they made Van Buren out to be a dissipated aristocrat who gorged himself on expensive French cuisine and champagne while Americans suffered economic hardship. Although charges of sexual misconduct were not new in American politics—Jefferson had been tarnished by the Sally Hemings scandal

 (see Chapter 7)—the smears of the Jacksonian era sunk even lower. Eager to discredit him, the Whigs spread rumors that Van Buren was a sexual pervert who had instructed the groundskeeper at the White House to create a mound in the shape of a breast.

Gender and Social Class:
The Whig Appeal
 Another innovative aspect of the Whig’s electoral strategy was their mobilization of women. Although women could not vote, the Whigs hoped to get them to deliver their husbands’ votes. The Whig appeal to women relied on two elements: a defense of morality against corruption and an appeal to economic interest. Whig newspaper editor Horace Greeley’s description of the choice Americans faced in the 1840 election captures the appeal of the Whigs to many women. Greeley characterized the Whigs as supporters

 of the family and Christian morality and accused the Democrats of being atheists and sexual perverts: “Wherever you find a bitter, blasphemous Atheist and enemy of Marriage, Morality, and Social Order, there you may be certain of one vote for Van Buren.” Although such appeals to traditional family values and morality motivated some women to support the Whig cause, other women were inspired by economic arguments that Whigs directed at male voters.

 “The ladies they flock’d to their windows, In numbers, I say not a few, And held out their starspangled banners All to the honor of Tippecanoe. ” Harrison campaign lyric, 1840

 Why were women drawn to the Whig message?



 CHAPTER 8

DEMOCRATS AND WHIGS: DEMOCRACY AND AMERICAN CULTURE, 1820–1840

 Democratic policies had left the American economy in shambles, and Whig policies promised to bring back prosperity. Whigs sponsored all-female rallies in support of Harrison, including a meeting in Ohio in which Whig women raised cups of tea in toasts to “Old Tippecanoe.” Democrats complained about the Whigs “making politicians of their women,” which was “something new under the sun.” Whigs also attacked Democrats for fanning class resentments. Thus one Whig chided the Democrats for their “incessant and unrelenting assaults” that tore “asunder the good feelings which bind men to each other.” Rather than highlight the struggle between democracy and aristocracy, a favorite rhetorical theme of Democrats, Whigs stressed the essential harmony of all economic classes. An observer at a Whig rally proudly noted that “all classes” had rediscovered that “their interests were the same.” Calvin Colton, a leading Whig, evoked the notion that “This is a country of self-made men.” Whig policies would promote prosperity for all hard-working Americans. The election clearly energized the voters, who turned out in record numbers, nearly four-fifths of eligible voters casting a vote. Harrison defeated Van Buren by 150,000 votes and a 4-to-1 margin in the Electoral College. President Harrison’s inaugural speech was the longest in American history, 105 minutes long. His term in office, however, was the shortest. Within a month of becoming president, he contracted pneumonia and died. Vice President John Tyler then became the tenth President of the United States. Some dubbed him “His Accidency” because he inherited his position after Harrison’s death.

Democrats and Whigs:
Two Visions of Government
 and Society The Whigs and Democrats represented opposing political visions. The Whigs favored a strong central government, encouragement for industry, and defense of Indians’ rights; in the North and parts of the Midwest, they aligned themselves against slavery. Rejecting the views of old-style conservatives such as Chancellor James Kent, an heir to the Federalist vision of politics, the Whigs adopted the more popular style of politics pioneered by the anti-Masonic party, using it to reach out to voters. Whigs embraced Clay’s American System, arguing that would help all Americans so that the rich and poor would each see their fortunes rise. Whigs

 What were the most important differences between Whigs and Democrats on economic issues?

 emphasized the harmonious interaction of different elements of the economy and attacked Democrats for preaching an ideology that fostered class conflict. The Whig version of democracy was not egalitarian. It recognized the need for a talented and virtuous elite to guide the nation. The Whigs’ frank acceptance of inequality allowed them to find a place in their ranks for African Americans, Indians, women, and any other group who needed guidance or protection by an enlightened elite. Although slightly paternalistic in outlook, the Whigs believed they had a duty to protect these groups. Thus Whigs championed the rights of Indians against the efforts of Jackson and other Democrats to forcibly remove them from their lands. Although Southern Whigs supported slavery, Whigs outside the South often supported its abolition. Finally Whigs actively cultivated women’s involvement in their campaign efforts. The Whig Party drew from the Old National Republican Party of John Quincy Adams, adding to their ranks Democrats who opposed Jackson’s Bank War. Anti-Masons and the more commercial Southern planters were also drawn to the Whig message. Whiggery also had a significant ethnic and religious basis. Individuals of English origin were also more likely than others to be Whig in sympathy, and mainstream Protestant denominations such as the Congregationalists, Presbyterians, and Episcopalians were more likely to vote Whig. Democrats’ vision of white men’s democracy was more egalitarian than that of the Whigs, but it was also more exclusive. Although Democrats often couched their appeals in egalitarian terms, this rhetoric was not inclusive when it came to racial equality. Instead, Democrats reached out to workers, small farmers, and the planter class. Democrats attracted voters who were suspicious of the burgeoning market economy, including those who blamed banks, especially the Bank of the United States, for their economic problems. They asserted their support for the sanctity of private property and for the doctrine of states’ rights, meaning that they were the party best suited to protect the interests of Southern slaveholders. Obtaining more land for white farmers, including Southern planters, was the primary goal of Democrats. Promoting this old Jeffersonian ideal of an expanding nation of yeoman farmers meant having to sacrifice the rights of Indians. From Jeffersonianism, Jacksonian Democrats inherited a fear of centralized government and large concentrations of financial power. Thus Democrats opposed Clay’s American

8.17 Democrats and Whigs: Major Beliefs


 System and the Whig’s emphasis on a powerful federal government involved in economic development. Although not opposed to economic growth, Democrats believed that the individual states, not the federal government, ought to guide economic development. Rural farmers and urban workers flocked to the ranks of the Democrats. Religious affiliation also dictated Democratic affiliation. Democrats were more popular among the less affluent evangelical Protestant sects such as the Baptists and Methodists, who found Jackson’s egalitarian message appealing. Democrats also attracted free thinkers and Catholics who feared that the Whigs were trying to impose Protestant morality on them. For a summary of the ideas of the Democrats and Whigs, see the chart (8.17). Democrats hailed the majesty of the people and attacked aristocracy, particularly artificial privilege and monopolies. Whigs embraced a more measured view of democracy. They warned Americans of the threat posed by demagogues, tyrants who flattered the people but who willingly sacrificed the common good, the rule of law, and the rights of the individual as they pursed their own quest for power and glory. The expansion of democracy in America was accompanied by profound changes in the economy. The Whigs and the Democrats each grappled with these

 changes in different ways. Developments in technology, the growth of the factory system, and the burgeoning market would produce changes no less profound than the democratization of politics. Taken together these interrelated changes helped usher in an economic and cultural transformation historians describe as the “market revolution.” The Whigs would become the great champions of the market revolution, believing that government, including the national government, could help expand the market economy and promote American prosperity. Democrats accepted the necessity of the market, but were more wary of its changes, and were particularly concerned that government not manipulate the market economy to further the interests of a wealthy elite. They were especially suspicious of the national government, and believed that the states could better promote growth. Whigs and Democrats would also come to view the geographical expansion of the United States in radically different ways. For Democrats, more land meant the fulfillment of the old Jeffersonian dream of creating a nation of independent farmers. Whigs worried about the political side effects of expansion. They sought to improve America, not expand it. Economic development and reform, not geographical expansion, would become the key to the Whigs’ very different vision of the American future.

 “The aristocracy of our country … continually contrive to change their party name. It was first Tory, then Federalist, then no party … then National Republican, now Whig. … But by whatever name they reorganize themselves, the true democracy of the country, the producing classes, ought to be able to distinguish the enemy.” FREDERICK ROBINSON, Democrat, 1834

Workers, Farmers,
 and Slaves The Transformation of the American Economy, 1815–1848 The United States experienced extraordinary economic growth and change in the first half of the nineteenth century. But the economies of the Northern and Southern regions of the nation evolved along different paths. The North developed a free labor economy marked by industrialization, urbanization, and immigration. Economic growth was spurred by new technologies that made agriculture more productive and factories more efficient, as well as by improvements in transportation and communication that spurred consumer demand for the latest goods. By contrast, while the South experienced some industrialization and urban growth, most of its expansion and development focused on raising cash crops with slave labor. The huge profits generated by cotton cultivation prompted the expansion of plantations into the so-called Black Belt that stretched from Alabama west to east Texas. By mid-century Northerners and Southerners became increasingly self-conscious about the distinctiveness of the labor system in their own region and more critical of that employed in the other half of the nation. This image, The Tree of Liberty (1846), illustrates the radical differences between the vision of liberty defended by Northern proponents of free labor and that of Southern defenders of slavery. On the right side of the tree, a slaveholder reclining in a chair while fanned by a slave announces, “Surrounded by slaves & basking at ease by their labor we can have a clearer conception of the value of liberty.” On the other side of the tree, the artist has placed two industrious farmers conversing, and young mill women in front of their factory. A group of gentlemen chat, and one praises the North’s expanding population, composed of industrious immigrants from “almost every nation.” Although North and South had developed different labor systems, each was tied to the expanding market economy that Henry Clay praised in 1824. The expansion of the market economy transformed the countryside in both the North and South and fueled urban growth.

 “The greatest want of civilized society is a market for the sale and exchange of the surplus of the produce of the labor of its members . . . . If we cannot sell, we cannot buy.” HENRY CLAY, 1824





 CHAPTER 9

WORKERS, FARMERS, AND SLAVES: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, 1815–1848

The Market Revolution
 In 1800, most rural households produced only a small surplus that was traded locally, often through a system of barter that did not require cash transactions. Most manufactured goods were produced by artisans whose workshops were usually in their homes. During the nineteenth century, the American economy became more commercially oriented. Farmers began producing cash crops for sale in distant markets, and a wider range of consumer goods, many of them made in factories, became available. The market revolution, the term used by historians to describe this transformation, encompassed interrelated developments that revolutionized agriculture, industry, technology, transportation, and communications. This market revolution would radically change both North and South in the antebellum period. Improved technology such as iron plows and steam-powered cotton gins enabled farmers to produce more crops, while cheaper, more efficient forms of transportation including the railroad allowed them to deliver these goods to markets. New communication technology, notably the telegraph and steam-powered printing press, increased the speed and volume of news and information available to Americans.

Agricultural Changes
 and Consequences Before 1815 most farmers in the South and the North labored to achieve a “competence,” which meant enough food to feed their family and a small surplus to trade locally or barter for goods, such as tools, that could not be produced at home. But in the early nineteenth century, American farmers began raising crops for an expanding commercial market to earn profits and accumulate wealth. Periodicals geared to farmers promoted this new emphasis on commercial farming, touted the latest agricultural theories, and advertised the most up-to-date labor-saving devices. Publications such as The New England Farmer warned that “the cultivator who does not keep pace with his neighbors as regards agricultural improvements and information will soon find himself the poorer consequence of the prosperity that surrounds him.” In 1819 Jethro Wood introduced one of the earliest and most important of these “improvements”— an iron plow that could double a farmer’s efficiency. Within a decade John Deere had improved Wood’s design, creating a plow that seemed to move through soil so easily that it was dubbed the “singing plow.” In the wheat-growing Midwest, farmers adapted horse-driven machines to tasks such as threshing and raking. Crank-powered churns transformed arduous women’s tasks, such as making butter

 by hand. The cotton gin (see Chapter 7) transformed Southern agriculture. In 1839, the Farmer’s Almanac proclaimed that “scarcely a tool . . . has not been altered for the better in some way or other.” The new scientific methods of agriculture helped increase the productivity of the soil. The creation of a market economy encouraged farmers to concentrate on crops that they could sell for cash in the marketplace, a trend that caused changes in farming patterns that varied by region. The South concentrated on staples for export such as cotton, while farmers in the Midwest produced grain, particularly wheat. Eastern farmers shifted their efforts to livestock production, dairy goods, fruits, and vegetables. Market-oriented farming, with its emphasis on efficiency and profit, also transformed social values and communal patterns of life. The new, more commercial approach to farming challenged traditional ideas of neighborliness and community that had been central to rural life. Increasingly farmers began to see harvest parties, husking bees (communal celebrations in which corn was husked), dances, and other ritual communal occasions in which work and leisure were combined as inefficient and wasteful. The Farmer’s Almanac in 1833 advised that “if you love fun, frolic, and waste and slovenliness, more than economy and profit, then make a husking.” In this humorous image of a corn husking (9.1), a man finds a lucky ear of red corn that entitles him to a kiss, but his advance is met by a girl holding a corn

THE MARKET REVOLUTION

 “smut,” a weathered ear of corn that gave her the right to refuse her suitor. Upcountry Southern farmers continued to concentrate on producing food for personal consumption and devoted a relatively small percentage of their land to commercial crops. While other regions of the country sought to improve every parcel of land for commercial agriculture, parts of the South remained committed to practices that encouraged a more self-sufficient style of agriculture, geared to personal use. Unlike in the North, for example, where extensive land was enclosed behind fences, many Southern states enacted laws against fencing in lands not used for agricultural production, so that livestock could roam freely.

A
Nation on the Move: Roads, Canals, Steamboats,
 and Trains Central to the development of commercial, market-oriented farming were improvements in transportation. These changes allowed those previously unable to deliver farm products to the

 growing cities of the Northeast and Midwest to enter the market. For those already in the market, the costs of business were dramatically lowered. These changes also spread information, including almanacs, books describing the latest agricultural techniques, and advertisements for the latest goods. The first major development in transportation was the building of a network of roads and turnpikes that by the 1820s helped knit together the major urban areas along the eastern seaboard. New York state embarked on the most ambitious program of road building, adding 4,000 miles of improved road and turnpikes by 1820. The National Road, the first federally funded road in U.S. history, stretched from Cumberland, Maryland, to Wheeling in what is now West Virginia. By the 1830s, this road would take travelers as far west as Columbus, Ohio. Pennsylvania built the Lancaster turnpike, which eventually was extended to connect Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making transportation cheaper and more reliable. By the 1820s, 30,000 tons of freight moved by wagon across this route annually.

9.2 Trade and
Commerce Quilt
 In this quilt Hannah Stockton Stiles created images of maritime trade on Philadelphia’s thriving waterfront.

WORKERS, FARMERS, AND SLAVES: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, 1815–1848

 The new road network dramatically cut travel times: A coach journey from New York to Boston that had taken four days in 1800 took half that time in 1824. Even more dramatic was the invention of the steamboat. Navigable rivers such as the Mississippi, Ohio, Missouri, and Hudson had long served as vital arteries for moving agricultural products from the interior to market. This water highway system moved almost exclusively in one direction. Traveling upriver from New Orleans to Louisville in Kentucky, for example, was expensive and slow (as long as three to four months). As a result few manufactured goods reached the interior of the nation. The arrival of the steamboat would revolutionize upriver travel, reducing the same New Orleans to Louisville journey to just over a week by 1826. The steamboat proved an economic boon to river cities such as St. Louis, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Louisville. Hannah Stockton Stiles, the daughter of a prosperous merchant, stitched this elaborate needlework quilt, capturing the hustle and bustle of Philadelphia’s waterfront. Stiles included a steam boat, with smoke billowing from its smoke stack (9.2). Canals provided another means of moving goods more cheaply and faster than by road. Since

 What impact did the Erie Canal have on New York’s economy?

 the 1780s, private companies had built small canals, usually less than 20 miles long. In 1817, America had about 100 miles of canals, with no single canal longer than 30 miles. In that same year, however, New York’s Governor De Witt Clinton persuaded the legislature to fund a canal linking Buffalo on Lake Erie to Albany on the Hudson River. The Erie Canal, as it was called, was over 300 miles long and was an unprecedented undertaking, both in terms of engineering and state investment The New York legislature approved the huge sum of $7 million in bonds to fund the project, roughly a quarter of all the money spent by all the states on internal improvements in the 1820s. Although opponents mocked it as “Clinton’s ditch,” the Erie Canal was a stupendous success. Before the canal opened, wheat from western New York state took 20 days to reach Albany by wagon and cost almost $100 per ton to transport. After the canal was built, the same ton of wheat could be transported all the way to New York City in ten days at a cost of $5. Much as the steamboat fueled the growth of river towns, the Erie Canal fueled the development of new cities such as Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse. The canal’s success sparked “canal fever” across the country, and more than 3,300 miles of canals were completed by 1840 at a cost of about $125 million. In 1825, the same year that the Erie Canal was completed, the first commercial railway began operating in England. In 1830 the Baltimore and Ohio railroad successfully tested a steam-powered train. Americans soon developed their own railroads, and by 1840 railroad mileage surpassed canals. Railroads further increased the speed at which goods and people moved from one part of the country to another. By 1840, the trip between Boston and New York by rail took a mere half-day. Americans greeted with amazement each innovation of the transportation revolution, but the railroad evoked the most powerful responses. “What an object of wonder!” wrote one American in response to his first sight of a railroad in 1835. Charles Caldwell, the founder of the University of Louisville, praised the railroad as an agent of civilization that would help spread morality and education by linking people together more effectively. Not everyone shared this view of railroads. Critics of the railroad raised concerns about safety, noise, and some expressed fears about the destruction of the landscape.

NATURE, TECHNOLOGY, AND THE RAILROAD: GEORGE INNESS’S THE LACKAWANNA VALLEY
(1855) The president of the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad commissioned George Inness to paint the company’s new roundhouse, a facility to house and repair trains. But Inness soon found that his artistic vision conflicted with that of the railroad. For the railroad, artistic considerations were less important than advertising its achievements. The main disagreement between Inness and his patrons was over the representation of the roundhouse. The artist wished to render the facility accurately, which would have diminished its importance in the painting. Ultimately Inness agreed to make the roundhouse appear larger than it would have had he rendered the scene in actual perspective. He sacrificed artistic truth to the necessities of the marketplace. 
 Inness’s painting applies many of the conventions used to represent nature to a scene in which nature and technology coexist in a complex relationship. Thus he includes a reclining youth, a figure often used in landscape paintings. Here, the boy calmly gazes toward the oncoming train. Rather than disrupting the serenity of nature, the train appears to blend harmoniously into it. Although Inness portrays the railroad in a positive light, he also suggests the cost of technological progress: A field of tree stumps reminds viewers that economic development has taken a toll on the landscape. Which aspects of the painting present a positive view of progress? Which aspects suggest a negative view?

 The figure of the boy reclining in the field evokes serenity and harmony with nature.

 Although the distant roundhouse should have appeared much smaller, Inness increased its size to please his patrons.

 The prominence of so many tree stumps suggests that the artist was aware that technological progress came at a cost: the defilement of nature.

News 1800–1841
Improvements in
 communication technology and transportation dramatically reduced the time it took for news to travel from the coastal cities to the interior cities.

Spreading the News
 Improvements in roads, canals, and railroads facilitated the spread of communication. The near doubling of the number of post offices and miles of improved postal roads between 1810 and 1820 increased the number of letters delivered annually from not quite four million to nearly nine million. It had taken ten days for news to travel from Richmond, Virginia, to New York City in Jefferson’s day. By the 1810s, it only took five days. The advent of the railroad, as the figure (9.3) shows, accelerated this trend, dramatically cutting the time for news to travel. For example, in 1817, it took 19 days for news to travel from New York to Cincinnati; by 1841, it only took seven days. The telegraph, which used electricity to send coded messages over wires, revolutionized communication. In 1844, Samuel Morse, a painter turned inventor who had patented the device in 1837, transmitted a message taken from a Bible verse— “What hath God Wrought?”—along a telegraph line from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore. The message was in code—the Morse code—that he also developed. Observers predicted correctly that the

 nearly instantaneous communication of telegraphy would usher in a new age of communications. By the mid-1850s, companies such the Western Union Telegraph Company had offices across the nation, improving communication between cities as far apart as Boston and New Orleans. Improvements in print technology sharply reduced the cost of publishing, leading to an enormous increase in the number of newspapers, magazines, and books. In 1801, there were only 200 newspapers in America; by 1835, there were 1,200. The number of magazines also rose dramatically, giving Americans a far greater range of printed materials. While most eighteenth-century magazines and newspapers were directed at the general public, many of these new publications were aimed at specific audiences. The Farmer’s Almanac, for example, dispensed advice about agriculture, while magazines such as Godey’s Lady’s Book informed a large and growing group of middle-class women readers about the latest ideas in fashion, literature, and family matters. Also on the rise by the 1830s, American book publishing, with an output of at least 1,000 titles a year, nearly rivaled that of Britain. Between 1825 and 1840, the value of the American book business doubled to $5.5 million.

THE MARKET REVOLUTION

 Technological improvements in printing also made better and cheaper images possible. In 1834, Nathaniel Currier began producing colored lithographic images using a new process that was cheaper than traditional engraving techniques. Rather than aspire to provide high art, Currier set out to provide “cheap and popular pictures” of contemporary events, historical figures, and scenes of everyday life. Touted as “Printmakers to the People,” his firm, eventually renamed Currier and Ives, produced images costing as little as fifteen cents. These were sold on city street corners, and peddlers carried them to country stores across the nation. Currier and Ives prints often featured patriotic themes, displaying the nation’s wealth, ingenuity, and economic

 achievements. Technological progress was a favorite theme. Consumers could choose from an assortment of steamboats and trains. Although the firm often celebrated technological triumph they also exploited disaster. Currier’s first great success was this dramatic print of a fire aboard the steamboat Lexington published in 1840 (9.4). Beyond making it easier and faster to send messages and news, the communications revolution also contributed to economic expansion of the market revolution by fueling the desire for new consumer goods and fashions. Newspapers were filled with advertisements for the latest goods. Lavishly illustrated magazines inspired readers to buy the latest fashions.

 CHAPTER 9

WORKERS, FARMERS, AND SLAVES: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, 1815–1848

The Spread of Industrialization
 In the early nineteenth century, the United States began a transition from a predominantly agricultural economy to an industrial one. This process unfolded unevenly across different sectors of the American economy and followed different models depending on the industry and region. Driven by new manufacturing technology and techniques, industrialization led to a vast increase in the number of goods—everything from clothing and shoes to tools and toys—available to the American consumer. But for many workers, especially skilled artisans, the new industrial economy led to a devaluation of their skills and loss of social status. For less-skilled workers industrialization often meant exploitation, long hours, and low pay. For others, however, the new manufacturing economy opened up opportunities for advancement.

From Artisan to Worker
 The group of workers most dramatically affected by the onset of industrialization was artisans, or workers who used specialized skills to produce consumer goods, from shoes to bread to candles. In the colonial period skilled artisans worked in small shops attached to their homes, using hand tools to produce goods for local consumption. They also used an apprenticeship system, training boys in their skills (until about age 20) in exchange for their labor. The relationship between artisan and apprentice was close. Typically an apprentice lived in his master’s house, receiving food, clothing, and education. In the new factory system first pioneered by Samuel Slater in Rhode Island (see Chapter 7), the artisan system of small-scale production was replaced with a new set of roles: owners, managers, and wage workers. The owner provided the money for the enterprise, the manager supervised the workers, and the laborers did the actual work, which was usually less skilled than the traditional crafts practiced by skilled artisans. Some industries, such as textiles, shifted relatively rapidly to the use of power-driven machinery. Shoe production, by contrast, continued to employ many manual laborers into the 1860s. In both cases manufacturers undermined the old craft traditions of artisans by breaking down the productive process into simple steps that could be performed by workers with minimal training. Factory work forced laborers to give up many aspects of working-class culture. The work rhythm of artisans before the rise of the factory included periods of intense activity followed by slack periods

 How did the factory change work?

 in which artisans might socialize with one another, perhaps meeting in a tavern to drink and discuss politics. Under industrialization the clock ruled. Factory workers were required to follow a strict schedule and perform at a steady pace day in and day out. Beyond the rigid regulations of the workers’ day, the factory robbed them of the pride of craft associated with handmade goods. In contrast to artisan production, where a skilled craftsman might create one-of-a-kind pieces, factory goods were designed to be identical. In addition to creating a labor force of less skilled workers, the new system also led to a sharp separation between home and workplace. Before 1800, most artisans in New York had workshops attached to their homes, but by 1840, two-thirds of them lived in one place and worked in another. The factory system separated home and workplace. The apprenticeship system also suffered. By 1827, less than a quarter of apprentices lived with their employers. If the factory system diminished the control that working people had over their time and work, it increased the goods they could buy. Because factorymade goods cost less to produce, families of modest means could now afford items once available only to the wealthy. Ordinary Americans could now purchase furniture, clocks, dishes, silverware, and the latest fabrics.

Women and Work
 The factory system had a tremendous impact on the lifestyle and status of American women. While men’s work increasingly shifted to sites outside the home, women’s economic activity remained

THE SPREAD OF INDUSTRIALIZATION

 primarily within. Nevertheless, some women participated more directly in the new manufacturing economy through “outwork.” In this system skilled processes were broken down into simpler tasks that could be farmed out to women to perform in their homes. Manufacturers provided the materials to women with a specified completion date. They saved money because they did not have to provide a workshop or factory, and they paid women a fraction of the wages a skilled male artisan earned. In New England during the 1830s, 33,000 women took part in outwork production of palm leaf hats. They also produced paper boxes, hoopskirts, artificial flowers, and cloaks. In urban areas many women depended on the meager earnings of outwork for their survival. In rural areas, such as parts of New England, women might rely on outwork for supplemental income while continuing to do traditional agricultural work, such as producing milk, butter, and cheese. Rural New England women would eventually provide the labor force for one of the most ambitious industrial experiments of the day: the Lowell mills.

The Lowell Experiment
 In 1814, a group of Boston merchants decided to expand on Samuel Slater’s mill village model (see Chapter 7) and create a large planned industrial town. They built a textile factory in Waltham, Massachusetts, and developed the Waltham System, a mill town model that relied on centralized factories, each one of which united all the distinctive steps of cloth production under one roof. The system also came to depend on a large labor force housed in company-owned dormitories. In 1823, the same group of merchants, led by Francis Lowell, opened an even larger factory on a site in Massachusetts adjacent to the Merrimack River. The Lowell mill consolidated all aspects of cloth production. Cotton from the South arrived at the mills, where it was cleaned, carded, spun, and woven into a finished fabric. Within a decade the new mill town of Lowell boasted 22 mills, and grew to over 50 mills by 1850. Not surprisingly many competing mill towns cropped up all over New England and upstate New York. The mill owners recruited young, single women from rural New England to work at the factory towns. To accommodate this workforce and appease concerned parents, they built dormitories and libraries and provided boardinghouse matrons to supervise the morality of the workers. Each

 boardinghouse, with up to ten bedrooms per building, housed between 20 and 40 women. Two women sometimes had to share a single bed. The boardinghouses also contained a kitchen, a dining room, a parlor, and separate quarters for the housekeepers, who were generally older women. Compared to the remote New England villages from which most of the women came, Lowell offered many amenities. Lowell allowed women to earn significantly more money than did farm labor and domestic service, the two most common occupations for single women. The women operatives in the mills also made friends with their coworkers and enjoyed free time away from the factories to socialize and pursue cultural and educational opportunities not available in their small home towns. As Josephine L. Baker, a mill worker, noted, “there are lectures, evening schools, and libraries, to which all may have access.” The mill women even produced their own literary magazine, the Lowell Offering (9.5). The magazine, nominally independent of the mills, echoed this rosy portrait. Indeed, the cover of this 1845 issue shows a mill girl holding a book and adopting a contemplative pose. She stands in a lush natural setting of flowers, trees, and vines. In its early years the Lowell experiment was touted as an example of American ingenuity, a popular destination for European visitors eager to see the wonders of the new world. British novelist Charles Dickens visited and later wrote with wonder that the mill women were not degraded by factory life, but rather retained “the manners and deportment of young women.” Despite the upbeat image portrayed on the cover of the Lowell Offering, life in the mills was hard. The women worked 13-hour days, six days a week. Furthermore, the noise of the machines, the dust and lint generated by the manufacturing processes, and the long hours demanded by the mill owners often

 overwhelmed women accustomed to working out of their homes. As one young Vermont mill woman noted in a letter to her family, “It is very hard indeed and sometimes I think I shall not be able to endure it. I never worked so hard in my life.” For a decade the Lowell mill owners enjoyed high profits and peaceful labor relations. But increased competition with other textile producers led them in 1834 to announce a wage cut. Furious, the Lowell mill women went on strike, or “turned out.” Critics of the strike saw it as a radical assault on the rights of the mill owners’ economic freedom and a display of unseemly behavior for women. The mill women defended their actions as an assertion of their rights as American citizens and an example of the ideals of independence and liberty that had inspired the American Revolution (see Competing Visions: The Lowell Strike of 1834). The strike failed to block the wage cut, but it was a milestone in the history of both women’s rights and labor organization. In the 1840s, a new organization, the “Lowell Female Labor Reform Association,” would join a national struggle for a ten-hour working day for all workers.

Urban Industrialization

 How did urban industrialization differ from other models of industrialization such as the Waltham (Lowell) model?

 using everything from skilled handwork, similar to artisan production, to steam-powered machinery run by low-skilled factory operatives. The factories produced an enormous range of goods under this system, including chemicals, paints and varnishes, musical instruments, clothing and hats, tools, machines, furniture, and books. New York emerged as the nation’s leading fashion and clothing center during this period. Initially the city led in the production of cheap “Negro cottons,” coarse garments assembled for sale in the South to clothe its slaves. By the 1830s, elegant tailoring houses such as the venerable firm of Brooks Brothers were offering well-tailored clothes to the upper classes and the more prosperous members of the middle class, who sought to emulate them. The industrial economy that emerged in antebellum America created jobs and opportunity for many workers and a vast array of consumer products. But not everyone benefited equally. To protect themselves, skilled workers built a large labor movement; twenty labor newspapers emerged in this period to champion the workers’ cause. In 1835, 20,000 Philadelphia workers from a dozen trades walked off their jobs to protest working conditions and demand a ten-hour workday. The strike was the most successful labor action in the nation’s short history and made the ten-hour workday the new standard. By 1836, labor councils or federations, a precursor of modern labor unions, had been founded in 13 manufacturing centers across the nation, from Boston to Cincinnati. In the largest cities, such as New York and Philadelphia, more than 50 separate trades joined to form the general councils. The movement collapsed during a severe economic depression that began in 1837. Hard times produced high unemployment and intense competition, undermining labor’s ability to bargain for higher pay and better working conditions. Worker unrest stemmed in part from the awareness that a small group of Americans were benefiting more than others from the new economic order. The distribution of wealth became less equal. Although the wealth of the average citizen grew, the proportion of wealth concentrated in the hands of the nation’s wealthiest citizens also increased. One of the most revealing measures of changes in the standard of living of Americans is provided by statistics about the average height of men serving in the military (9.6). In the period between 1800 and 1860, the average height of Americans decreased by almost an inch. Given that the overall wealth of the nation increased during this period, this evidence suggests that not all Americans shared in this growing prosperity.

THE SPREAD OF INDUSTRIALIZATION



Competing Visions
THE LOWELL STRIKE OF 1834
In protesting a proposal to cut their wages, the Lowell mill women looked to the language of the American Revolution. They cast the mill owners as tyrants who sought to reduce the workers to economic slavery. For those sympathetic to the mill owners, the strikers were un-American, radical followers of the British feminist thinker Mary Wollstonecraft, the champion of women’s equality (see Chapters 5 and 6). Why did the protestors at Lowell seek to wrap their cause in the banner of the American Revolution and its ideals? The Lowell mill women cast themselves as the heirs to the Patriots who fought the American Revolution. Their appeal for public support focused on issues of rights and independence, themes that echoed the language of the American Revolution. UNION IS POWER Our present object is to have union and exertion, and we remain in possession of our unquestionable rights. We circulate this paper wishing to obtain the names of all who imbibe the spirit of our Patriotic Ancestors, who preferred privation [poverty] to bondage, and parted with all that renders life desirable—and even life itself—to procure independence for their children. The oppressing hand of avarice [greed] would enslave us, and to gain their object, they gravely tell us of the pressure of the time, this we are already sensible of, and deplore it. If any are in want of assistance, the Ladies will be compassionate and assist them; but we prefer to have the disposing of our charities in our own hands; and as we are free, we would remain in possession of what kind Providence has bestowed upon us; and remain daughters of freemen still. “Union Is Power,” petition of the striking Lowell women, 1834 
 In this contemporary report of the Lowell protest, a Boston newspaper highlighted the radical and unladylike behavior of the strikers. We learn that extraordinary excitement was occasioned at Lowell, last week, by an announcement that the wages paid in some of the departments would be reduced 15 percent on the 1st of March. The reduction principally affected the female operatives, and they held several meetings, or caucuses, at which a young woman presided, who took an active part in persuading her associates to give notice that they should quit the mills…. The number soon increased to nearly 800. A procession was formed, and they marched about the town, to the amusement of a mob of idlers and boys, and we are sorry to add, not altogether to the credit of Yankee girls…. We are told that one of the leaders mounted a stump and made a flaming Mary Wollstonecraft speech on the rights of women and the iniquities of the “monied aristocracy.” Salem Gazette, February 18, 1834

 CHAPTER 9

WORKERS, FARMERS, AND SLAVES: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, 1815–1848

The Changing Urban Landscape
 Industrialization accelerated the growth and changed the nature of American cities. While before 1820 less than ten percent of the nation’s population resided in cities (areas of more than 2,500 people), by 1860, that number had grown to 20 percent. Older cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Baltimore grew, and new cities in the West such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Chicago emerged. The population growth in these cities was fueled by migration from the American countryside and foreign immigration, especially from Ireland and Germany. Immigration fostered cultural diversity in cities, but it also led to tensions and violence along ethnic, racial, and religious lines. Hostility between Protestants and Catholics and between whites and blacks increased urban violence. Policing became a far more complex problem in these growing cities.

Old Ports and the New Cities
 of the Interior 9.7 Five Points This image reflects the elite’s view of the Five Points neighborhood. The artist has depicted a robbery in progress in the lower left.

 With nineteenth-century industrialization and population growth, major changes occurred in American cities. New kinds of neighborhoods developed that reflected the class and ethnicity of their inhabitants. Distinctive

 working-class neighborhoods, including the first urban slums, formed. This trend reflected the drop in the number of artisans who owned their homes and the rise of multiple-family dwellings, as well as the number of boardinghouses taking in lodgers. New York’s Five Points neighborhood illustrates the profound changes in the urban landscape caused by rapid economic development. To its working-class inhabitants, Five Points was a poor but thriving multiethnic and racially mixed community. To

THE CHANGING URBAN LANDSCAPE

 outsiders, however, its shabby housing and reputation for crime, especially prostitution, made it a symbol of urban decline. Thus while its inhabitants saw the neighborhood as a vibrant and diverse community, New York’s elite viewed it as a notorious slum to be avoided. This contemporary image (9.7) captures the multiracial character of the neighborhood, but it also reflects the fears of many New Yorkers that Five Points was crime-ridden and dangerous. Middle- and upper-class families eager to escape contact with working people, immigrants, and free blacks segregated themselves in new, more exclusive neighborhoods. New York’s Gramercy Park, for example, was created in 1831 as a private park surrounded by elegant houses. Ringed by a tall gated fence, the park was (and still is) accessible only to the adjacent homeowners who received special keys. This image of a similar exclusive enclave (9.8), St. Johns Park in New York, shows a park with a fence that segregates the rich residents from individuals such as the African Americans lampooned in this image for attempting to dress and act above their station in life. The African-American figures are caricatures whose physical features are exaggerated to conform to the racist stereotypes of the day. In 1800, even America’s largest urban centers were “walking cities.” A person could easily walk around all of New York, Philadelphia, or Boston in a few hours. By 1820, however, these cities had grown to contain more than half the urban population of the new nation, and by mid-century these once compact walking cities had become sprawling metropolises. Some of this growth came from annexation. Philadelphia in 1854 annexed several of its suburbs, increasing its size from two square miles to 129. Much of the growth was driven by advances in mass transportation that allowed city dwellers to live farther and farther away from where they worked, shopped, and went for entertainment. The first of these modes of transportation, which arrived in 1827, was the “omnibus,” an urban stagecoach that carried up to 12 passengers over fixed routes for a flat fee. Expensive, slow, and uncomfortable, it gave way by the 1850s to the horse car, a 20-passenger coach pulled on rails by horses. Faster, cheaper, and more comfortable than the omnibus, horse cars, or street-railway lines, spread to virtually every large city by 1860. Philadelphia alone boasted 155 miles of track. Steam-powered locomotives had also begun to carry commuters—or people who traveled over a significant distance from home to work—to and from outlying areas. Issues of sanitation and the problem of providing fresh drinking water for these expanding cities led cities such as New York and Philadelphia to undertake

 ambitious construction projects such as Philadelphia’s Fairmount Waterworks. By 1810, New York had surpassed Philadelphia to become the nation’s largest city. Central to this development was New York harbor, the largest on the East Coast and one ideally suited to become a major port. The Erie Canal ensured New York’s economic supremacy by connecting the city to the Midwest. It increased dramatically the flow of finished goods from Europe and the rest of the United States into the American heartland and the flow of foodstuffs produced by Midwestern farmers into domestic and foreign markets. Inland cities such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Chicago were among the fastest-growing urban areas in the nation. Situated on rivers or lakes and soon connected by railroads, inland cities became manufacturing centers and transportation hubs. Between 1800 and 1840, these new cities saw their populations quadruple. If any city in America fit the modern stereotype of a soot-covered industrial town, it was Pittsburgh. The French traveler Michel Chevalier remarked that “a dense black smoke which, bursting forth in volumes from the foundries, forges, glass-houses, and the chimneys of all the factories and houses, falls in flakes of soot upon the dwellings and persons of the inhabitants. It is, therefore, the dirtiest town in the United States.” Cincinnati, a small settlement on the Ohio River in 1800, became a major industrial center by 1840, producing a wide range of manufactured products, including furniture, tools, candles,

 paper, leather, and soap. The soap industry grew out of the city’s many pig-slaughtering houses (Cincinnati’s nickname was “Porkopolis”) that produced fat renderings that provided an essential ingredient for making soap. The firm of Procter & Gamble was founded in the city in 1837.

Immigrants and the City
 The sharp rise in urban populations in the nineteenth century stemmed from two sources: the migration of Americans from rural areas and immigration from Europe. The latter soared from 23,000 in 1830 to 428,000 in 1854. Immigrants left their homelands for the United States for many reasons, including poverty, poor harvests, warfare, and political and religious persecution. The most dramatic exodus in this period was triggered in 1845 when Ireland’s potato crop failed. The disaster killed more than one million people and spurred more than a million others, mostly poor peasants, to cross the Atlantic to America. Poor harvests and political turmoil boosted German immigration to the United States. Besides the Irish and Germans, the other large groups of immigrants came from other parts of Britain, notably Scotland and Wales, and from Scandinavia (9.9). The Irish and German immigrants changed America’s ethnic composition. For the first time many non-Protestants entered American society. Irish immigrants were almost entirely Catholic, whereas Germans included both Catholics and Protestants. Ethnic enclaves with names like Kleindeutchland (Little Germany) and Little Ireland, with their own churches, mutual aid societies, theaters, newspapers, restaurants, and social clubs, developed in many cities. Irish immigrants generally came from the poorest segments of society; they arrived with English 18%

 little money and few skills needed in an urban economy. They often ended up in slum neighborhoods like Five Points and came to dominate low-skilled jobs such as laborer and domestic servant. Nonetheless, many Irish immigrants entered the skilled trades and became successful entrepreneurs. German immigrants were more diverse. As with the Irish, many German immigrants were poor peasants forced off the land, but many others were skilled artisans. Liberal intellectuals also fled Germany after the political upheavals of 1848 that swept over much of continental Europe. Germans were more likely than the Irish to become farmers, shopkeepers, or skilled tradesmen. They also ventured further inland, settling places such as Cincinnati and St. Louis. More skilled on average than their Irish counterparts, Germans transformed a number of fields. Adolph Busch, a skilled brewmaster, brought German-style beer to America, and musical instrument makers helped launch such venerable firms as Steinway and Sons, piano makers.

Free Black Communities
 in the North Urban centers in the North and Midwest were home to some of the largest free African-American communities in the nation. Free blacks in enclaves such as Boston’s “New Guinea” or Cincinnati’s “Little Africa” were probably the most urbanized subgroup in America. Racial segregation was more pronounced in the urban North than in the cities of the South, where urban slaves were likely to live in their masters’ homes. Thus an African American in Boston was almost twice as likely to live in a segregated neighborhood as an African American in New Orleans. African-American communities developed thriving institutions, such as churches, schools, and self-help societies. Still, life for free African Americans was hindered by racial prejudice and discrimination. In the North and parts of the Midwest, exclusion from many of the skilled trades often forced African Americans into the most menial types of labor. This situation worsened in the 1840s and 1850s as immigrants, especially the Irish, took over occupations traditionally dominated by African Americans, such as barbers and cart men. In the cities of the North and West, hostility to African Americans competing for jobs with

 whites intensified. A drawing from the period (9.10) exploits white fears of African-American laborers. The racist message of the image is clear: Free blacks will steal the jobs of white workingmen. Through persistence, talent, and good fortune, some African Americans could still surmount the obstacles they faced in the labor market and achieve financial security or even prosper. Henry Boyd of Cincinnati is an example of one such life. Trained as a carpenter while still a slave, Boyd managed to obtain his freedom and began to ply his trade in Cincinnati. Although Boyd found some work, many employers refused to hire him. Yet in 1836, he accumulated enough money to establish his own furniture-making business, and by 1842, his downtown factory was using the latest steam-powered equipment to make furniture. By the 1850s, Boyd was employing a mixedrace workforce of some 50 people. Nine years later, however, fire destroyed Boyd’s factory. Without insurance he could not rebuild his factory, leaving him as he had begun—a struggling artisan.

Riot, Unrest, and Crime
 Urbanization in the first half of the nineteenth century was accompanied by a rise in crime and disorder. During the 1830s, there were 115 incidents of mob violence, a steep rise from previous decades. One newspaper reported that “a spirit of riot” had taken over the nation’s cities. Violence increased as growing cities became more divided racially, economically, and ethnically. Anti-Catholic sentiment spurred much of the intensified violence. In 1834, a mob attacked and burned a Catholic convent just outside Boston. Ten years later in Philadelphia, the “Bible riots”

 left 20 dead and two Catholic churches in ashes. Philadelphia’s growing Catholic community opposed the city’s policy of using the Protestant version of the Bible for instruction in public schools. After appeals from the city’s Catholic community were rejected, protestors took to the streets. Crowds of Catholics and Protestants attacked one another in the streets of the “City of Brotherly Love.” The city was plunged in to three days of rioting and mayhem. Racial animosity also inspired urban unrest. Cincinnati’s African-American community faced the ire of white mobs in 1829, 1836, and 1841. A three-day riot in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1831 destroyed most of the African-American part of the city. A riot in New York in 1834 destroyed an African-American church, school, and a dozen houses. Adding to the tensions and occasionally

 sparking violence were political battles between Democrats and Whigs, antagonisms between supporters and opponents of slavery, and conflicts over regulating or eliminating behaviors such as gambling and drinking. Contributing to the rise in urban violence was the steady increase in the number of single men living outside traditional family units, a trend that arose from industrialization and immigration. In the 1840s and 1850s, at least 30 percent of male urban dwellers lived outside family units, usually in boardinghouses. Free from the traditional guidance and restraint of adults and relatives, young men developed a masculine subculture in which alcohol and fighting played a central role. Many young women also streamed into the city looking to improve their economic conditions. The combination of an aggressive masculine sub-culture and a large pool of poor young women led to a significant rise in prostitution, a situation that alarmed many officials. The Reverend Lyman Beecher decried the fact that so many young people were “thrown out upon the open bosom of our city” where they were easily “corrupted by sensuality.” Beecher’s fears were well founded. At mid-century prostitution ranked as the second biggest industry in New York City! (See Envisioning Evidence, The Economics and Geography of Vice in Mid-Nineteenth-Century New York.) Theaters encouraged prostitutes to attend their performances to boost ticket sales, a practice so common that the cheap seats they occupied were dubbed the “guilty third tier.”

 The expanding news media found salacious tales about the city’s seamier side of life a great way to raise circulation. Tales of crime, including the sensational murder of the prostitute Helen Jewett in New York City in 1836, fueled the growth of the press. Rival newspapers competed to be the first to publish the latest revelation about the case, and the story dominated headlines for months. The crime even produced colorful images such as this showing the alleged murderer skulking away (9.11). Reflecting the low regard in which prostitutes were held, the lowly clerk accused of killing Jewett was acquitted despite considerable evidence suggesting his guilt. Most urban crime did not involve sensational tales of murder, but rather petty crimes against property or person. The informal policing mechanisms that cities had relied on in the eighteenth century, including the use of night watchmen and sheriffs who had to rely on community support to quell unrest, proved woefully inadequate to policing a major metropolitan area in the nineteenth century. In 1839, the mayor of New York pushed to create a professional police force, fearing that without strong intervention New York would attain “the character of a riotous city.” In 1845, New York created the first modern professional police force in America, modeled on London’s Metropolitan Police Force. New York employed 800 men organized in a military structure; they carried clubs (but not firearms) and were deployed to keep the peace and apprehend criminals.

THE ECONOMICS AND GEOGRAPHY OF VICE IN MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY NEW YORK
The influx of young men and young women into New York City in the early nineteenth century fueled both the supply of and the demand for prostitutes. Indeed, by mid-century, prostitution was the second largest industry in the city, exceeded only by tailoring. If one maps the geography of vice, a fascinating pattern emerges. The greatest concentration of brothels was clustered around New York’s Broadway theater district, the notorious Five Points neighborhood (one of the city’s poorest), and the docks. “The police do not meddle,” an observer of New York life wrote, “unless they [the prostitutes and brothels] are noisy, disturb the peace, or become a public nuisance.”

WORKERS, FARMERS, AND SLAVES: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, 1815–1848

Southern Society
 Even as Northern society changed dramatically between 1815 and 1860 due to immigration, urbanization, and industrialization, Southern society remained committed to slavery and a cash crop economy. The rise of cotton cultivation and the expansion of plantations into the band of fertile land from Georgia to Texas transformed slavery. Although most Southerners did not own slaves, slavery suffused Southern culture and society. A few planters dominated the political and economic life of the whole South. One leader reminded a Southern audience in 1850 that slavery was bound up with all of the South’s institutions and affected “the personal interests of every white man.”

 “I could easily prove that almost all the differences which may be noticed between the characters of the Americans in the Southern and in the Northern states have originated in slavery.”

The Planter Class
 Few planters lived in the grand luxury many people today associate with the world of nineteenth-century slavery. For example, at Nottoway, in Louisiana, John Hampden Randolph built a magnificent mansion that contained 64 rooms, 200 windows, and 165 doors. But the typical planter lived far more modestly in a simple two-story wood-framed house. His home, generally described as “the big house” because it was always the largest domestic dwelling on a plantation, was at the center of smaller outbuildings, including a kitchen, well, dairy, ice house, smokehouse, and laundry. More substantial plantations included many other types of buildings, such as barns, stables, sheds, and storehouses. Georgia rice planter Henry McAlpin’s Hermitage plantation (9.12) resembled a small town, with multiple residences, a hospital, and other buildings. Indeed, the slave quarters constituted an even smaller village within this self-contained community. Most

SOUTHERN SOCIETY

 plantations were far more modest. Most slave owners owned between one and nine slaves. Less than one percent owned 100 or more slaves. The typical slaveholder worked a small family farm of about 100 acres with fewer than ten slaves. Planters created something akin to Englishstyle landed aristocracy. Thomas Dabney, who had migrated to Mississippi from Virginia in 1835 to establish a large cotton plantation, aspired to this aristocratic lifestyle. He emulated the life of an English country gentleman, taking tea in the afternoon and treating his less affluent neighbors as social inferiors. While industrialization in the North created a sharp divide between work and home, physically separating the two realms, Southern plantations fused them together. A large body of advice literature geared toward plantation management that appeared in Southern magazines urged planters to act so that “the Negro should feel that his master is his lawgiver and judge; and yet his protector and friend.” An 1842 book reminded planters that because slaves were “placed under our control” masters had to care for and instruct them, so that they could “receive moral and religious uplift.” In theory masters sought to “govern absolutely.” “Plantation government,” a Georgia planter wrote, “should be eminently patriarchal.” The planter was not only “the head of the family” but also “should, in one sense, be the father of the whole concern, negroes and all.” Planters’ wives or widows or the eldest daughters in families without a matriarch often helped manage plantation life. The plantation mistress, as she was called, supervised slaves who might work in the kitchen, nursery, laundry, stable, or garden. Whereas husbands often relied on overseers to assist them and frequently left the plantation to attend to business or public affairs, the planter’s wife was often left to her own devices to run a home that was more like a small village. Southern men claimed that slavery had helped elevate the status of the white woman and liberated her from the drudgery of domestic life, making her “no longer the slave, but the equal and idol of man.” Hospitality was a central part of Southern plantation culture, and the plantation mistress played a key role in the rituals associated with it. Although lavish entertainment was one part of this reality, the evidence found in the surviving diaries and letters of many mistresses suggest that the typical plantation mistress was more apt to feel isolated than the center of a vivacious social life. Mary Kendall, for example, wrote in her diary about her loneliness: “for about three weeks I did not



 have the pleasure of seeing one white female face.” Kendall’s sense of isolation lent her description of plantation life a melancholy quality.

Yeomen and Tenant Farmers
 Most Southern whites were not planters but yeoman farmers, independent landowners who worked their own small farms. In 1860, more than three-quarters of Southerners owned no slaves. As a result yeomen farmers depended on neighborliness and communal cooperation to complete tasks such as planting, harvesting, or building. Lacking the urban centers and cheap transportation that allowed many small farmers in the North to enter fully into the market economy, many Southern yeomen did not produce large surpluses for market. Instead they devoted most of their resources to producing food for their own families and generally allocated only a small portion of their lands for cash crops that could be sold to purchase seeds, sugar, and the occasional manufactured good. Since they could not afford the cost of transporting their surpluses to market, yeoman farmers depended on planters to market their small surpluses. They also depended on planters for the use of the plantation mill to grind corn into meal. In much of the South where planters and yeomen resided side by side, a complex web of economic, political, and social ties bound these two classes together. But many yeomen in the upcountry regions of the South were fiercely independent and resented the more affluent planters who dominated their state’s militia, legislatures, and courts. Indeed, most Southern state legislators, judges, and militia officers were drawn from the planter class. But the yeomanry formed the core of the militia system that tried to catch runaway slaves and guard against slave insurrection. In this antislavery woodcut, the slave patrol is terrorizing a slave (9.13) traveling without the pass needed to leave the plantation. Passes were written by owners, and traveling slaves had to have them. Many Southerners owned no land and worked as tenant farmers. In parts of the South, estimates by historians vary, but between 30–50 percent of the white population fell into this category. Although some landless Southerners were young men waiting to inherit land from their fathers, many others rarely entered the ranks of the solid yeomanry. In parts of the Deep South with many African-American slaves, poor whites fraternized with slaves: smuggling liquor into the slave quarters, helping runaways, or forming sexual liaisons and permanent relationships with slaves. More often, however, a white supremacist ideology overcame class solidarity across racial lines.

Free Black Communities
 Although most African Americans in the South were enslaved, by 1860, six percent of black Southerners lived as free people of color. Most free blacks resided in the upper South, with large communities in border states such as Delaware and Maryland. A third of the free blacks resided in Southern cities; Baltimore, Richmond, New Orleans, Charleston, Memphis, Mobile, and Natchez had the biggest communities. The South’s Slave Codes were even more restrictive than the Black Codes enacted in the North (see Chapter 8). Free Southern blacks had to carry identification to prove that they were not slaves. They could not hold office and in some areas even testify in court against whites. Although life for free blacks in the South was difficult, the shortage of skilled artisans in many Southern cities enabled them to enter trades such

 as cabinet making. Southern cities were also less spatially segregated than Northern cities, and Southern African Americans played a prominent role as domestics and in some fields and trades such as tailoring and hair cutting. The free black community in New Orleans was one of the most affluent in the South. It published its own newspapers, and its elite members held lavish balls each year. Religious institutions were also important for the free African-American community. In addition to tending to the spiritual needs of their congregations, ministers were often community leaders. Southern black churches had much larger memberships than similar institutions in the North. Thus the largest African-American congregation in the North, New York’s Abyssinian Baptist Church, had a membership of 440 at mid-century, whereas the First African Church of Richmond, counted 3,160 members.

SOUTHERN SOCIETY

White Southern Culture
 Wealthy white Southerners in the antebellum years entertained on a lavish scale, hosting parties, balls, fox hunts, and horse races. Aristocratic affectations even led some to sponsor medieval tournaments that included jousting. Southerners took pride in their resorts along the Gulf Coast, gracious vacation spots characterized by a “quiet ease.” New Orleans gradually replaced New York as the horse racing capital of the nation. Blood sports such as cock fighting also remained popular, particularly among less affluent Southerners. Reputation and honor were central values in the male-oriented Southern culture. An “unsullied reputation,” one observer noted, was all that a man required to be “on a social level with his fellows.” A Scottish traveler remarked that Southern men “consider themselves men of honor” and “more frequently resent any indignity shown them even at the expense of their life, or that of those who venture to insult them.” When a social inferior insulted a gentleman, the appropriate response was to cane or horsewhip

 the offender. Dueling was reserved for settling matters of honor among gentlemen. In 1838, John Wilson, a former Governor of South Carolina, published The Code of Honor; or the Rules for the Government of Principals and Seconds in Duelling, which explained such things as the role of seconds and the choice of weapons. The centrality of honor to Southern culture was the chief reason dueling endured in this region long after it had been outlawed in the North. Many of the South’s leading politicians, including Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay, had fought duels during their careers. This contemporary drawing by a Northern opponent of slavery (9.14) portrays the South as a culture dominated by dueling, brawling, and mobbing. For some Northerners, especially those opposed to slavery, the dueling and other violence they associated with the South were a result of the brutality inherent in slavery. The connection between slavery and Southern violence figures prominently in the image, which shows a cruel master whipping a helpless slave child.

WORKERS, FARMERS, AND SLAVES: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, 1815–1848

Life and Labor Under Slavery
 Slavery was a complex institution that took many forms in the South. Some slaves lived on large plantations and worked in gangs under an overseer, whereas others toiled beside their master on small farms. Still others lived in cities where, if they possessed skills, they were often hired out. But the law treated all slaves as property, leaving them entirely at the mercy of their master who had the power to impose punishment and sell slaves away from their families. To protect themselves, slaves developed various traditions and strategies. Many turned to religion to provide spiritual comfort and cultural resources to resist the domination of their masters. Slaves also developed subtle forms of resistance such as feigned illness, work slow downs, and destruction of tools and other property. Occasionally slaves took more overt measures like running away, either to seek a temporary respite from the harsh labor regime or to escape North to freedom. The most radical and the rarest form of resistance was insurrection, rising up against the established authorities.

Varied Systems
 of Slave Labor Slave labor produced a variety of agricultural products—tobacco, hemp, sugar, and rice. But the leading product was cotton, an enterprise in which more than half of all slaves toiled. By 1840, cotton accounted for more than half the nation’s exports with most of it heading for European (especially British) textile mills. The remainder was sent north to mills in places like Lowell, Massachusetts. Yet even in those regions of the South in which cotton was not the primary crop, the cotton economy influenced economic life. Many farmers who did not produce cotton produced foodstuffs and supplies for consumption on cotton plantations. For instance, hemp was turned into rope to bind cotton bales for shipment. The antebellum South was divided economically into the lower South and the upper South. The warm climate of the lower South was ideal for cotton cultivation, as was the dark rich soil of the region stretching from Alabama to Texas known as the Black Belt. After 1820, cotton cultivation spread rapidly westward, propelled by two factors. First, the great wealth produced by cotton provided huge economic incentives for bringing new lands under cultivation. Second, because cotton exhausted soil of its nutrients, growers constantly sought new lands to bring under cultivation. To grow and harvest this cotton, planters relied on a labor force that was 90 percent enslaved.

Where was the Black Belt?


 The upper South included eight slave states, but it lacked the fertile land and long growing season necessary for cotton agriculture. As a result it embraced agricultural diversification, including grain and livestock. Of the agricultural staples produced in this region, corn, rye, and hemp were particularly important. With each passing decade, slavery became less and less viable in this region, and many masters sold their slaves to the lower South where demand for their labor was high. Although the Constitution had outlawed the international slave trade, a vibrant internal slave trade existed. Sales from the upper South to the lower South were central to this trade. Most slaves worked as field hands, toiling from sun up to sun down most of the year. On most large plantations slaves worked in the fields in gangs, which gave their masters more control over their labor. Men and women generally worked together, often supervised by a hired white overseer. Masters sometimes employed slaves to act as drivers, or supervisors, a role that required them to discipline other slaves or face punishment themselves. But a clever driver might find a way to protect other slaves from more severe punishment by an overseer. Larger plantations also employed many slave craftsmen as carpenters, blacksmiths, weavers, coopers (people who repaired wooden casks), and other occupations. Household slaves worked as cooks, coachmen, nannies, or maids. Planters used a system of rewards and punishments to enforce slave discipline. As rewards some

LIFE AND LABOR UNDER SLAVERY

 planters allowed slaves to maintain a small garden or even sell produce at market. Ultimately, however, labor discipline was enforced by violence. A popular management book that many planters consulted argued that “after reason and persuasion have been exhausted without producing the desired effect, punishment of some sort must be resorted to.” As an English observer noted, “Absence from work, or neglect of duty, was punished with stinted allowances, imprisonment, and flogging.” Northern abolitionist literature made the image of the whip one of their most prominent metaphors of life in the South as this broadside from an antislavery almanac reveals (9.15). Southern masters also controlled their slaves by threatening to sell them. Slaves in the upper South feared being sold “down river” to a cotton or sugar plantation because it meant separation from family and probably a harsher existence. Sales tore slave families apart. Sales may have dissolved as many as one-third of all slave marriages and separated almost half of the children living in the older parts of the South from a parent. The British artist Eyre Crowe painted a scene in a Richmond slave market, in which men, women, and children wait their turn on the auction block (9.16). Scenes such as this were common throughout Virginia and the Carolinas. In 1859, the Georgia

 planter Pierce Butler sold 450 slaves in a single auction lasting days. A reporter from the New York Tribune described the misery of the slaves whose “brothers and sisters” were to be “scattered through the cotton fields of Alabama.” The “expressions of heavy grief,” the reporter noted, reflected their horror at being “torn from their homes” and separated from their loved ones.

 CHAPTER 9

WORKERS, FARMERS, AND SLAVES: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, 1815–1848

 Although most of the South’s slaves toiled as agricultural laborers, many others worked in some type of industrial enterprise, primarily in the upper South. While the South lagged far behind the North in industrial development, it still exceeded all but the top five or six industrial nations in production of textiles and iron, flour and timber milling, sugar refining, and leather tanning. Most of these upper South industries relied on slave labor, and by 1850, at least five percent of the South’s slaves (between 150,000 and 200,000 persons) worked in industry. Employers owned 80 percent of the slaves who worked in industry with the rest hired out on yearly or short-term leases. Enslaved blacks and free whites sometimes worked side by side. Richmond’s Tredegar Iron Works employed such a mixed labor force until 1847, when a strike by whites prompted the owners to rely exclusively on enslaved black labor apart from a few white supervisors. Slaves also worked in nonagricultural enterprises in cities such as Richmond, Mobile, Charleston, and New Orleans. Slaves worked as domestics, artisans, carriage drivers, gardeners, couriers, and nurses. Southern cities also employed slaves for public works projects, including sanitation, road building, and bridge maintenance. Savannah and Charleston even used slaves as firefighters.

Life in the Slave Quarters
 Compared to Brazil, where living conditions for slaves were among the worst in the Americas, conditions for American slaves were less harsh. This contributed to a significant natural increase in the slave population in the United States; the population increased nearly fivefold between 1790 and 1850. Still American slave owners often treated their slaves brutally and provided inadequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical care. As a result infant mortality rates for slave children were twice those of white children. Life expectancy for whites in the South was between 40 and 43 years, which was lower than that in other parts of the country, but the average slave lived ten years less even than that. Fanny Kemble, the wife of planter Pierce Butler, described the slave quarters on her husband’s plantation in stark terms: “These cabins consist of one room, about twelve feet by thirteen. Two families (together numbering sometimes eight or ten) reside in one of these huts which are mere wooden frames.” Wealthier planters sometimes built sturdier framed houses with wooden floors or even brick houses for their slaves. The oppressive nature of slavery also shaped family life. Although Southern law did not recognize the legality of slave marriages, many slave men and

 women sought to form stable family relationships. Slaves developed their own marriage rituals to seal their unions. The most common was “jumping the broom,” which derived from traditional African marriage practices. Relatives or close friends of the bride and groom held opposite ends of a broom about a foot off the ground, and the couple would jump together over it as a symbol of their union. Planters encouraged slaves to marry because married slaves were less likely to run away. The offspring of slave marriages also provided planters with additional laborers. On larger plantations a slave family might reside together. On smaller plantations and farms, husbands and wives might reside on neighboring plantations. Such “abroad” marriages were common. Visiting a spouse under these circumstances required permission, and husbands might see their families only once a week. The slave family included extended kin, such as uncles, aunts, and, most important, grandparents, all of whom helped rear children.

Slave Religion and Music
 During the 1830s, Southern churches launched a major effort to convert slaves to Christianity. In proselytizing slaves white ministers stressed the conservative elements of Christian theology, often forbidding slaves from dancing during religious services and reminding them of the passages in the Bible that demanded slaves obey their masters. A popular Catechism for Colored Persons, for example, instructed slaves to “count their Masters ‘worthy of all honour,’ as those whom God has placed over them in the world.” But efforts to use religion to instill docility in slaves largely failed. Rather than accept their masters’ vision of Christianity, African Americans recast it to suit their own needs as slaves and articulate their hopes. The biblical story of the Exodus, which told of the flight of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, was particularly popular. “God was working for their deliverance,” a Georgia slave commented, and “would deliver them from bondage as sure as the children of Israel were delivered from Egyptian bondage.” African Americans created covert churches called “brush arbors” or “hush arbors” to practice their version of the faith. Slaves also borrowed elements from African religions, creating a distinctive African-American religious culture. White observers were perplexed by the “ring shout,” an ecstatic form of worship that mixed African religious practice with Christian beliefs, describing its chanting as “weird” or “droning” and its dance as “wild” and “barbaric.” Yet to the enslaved the ring

Hear the Audio File “Go Down Moses”


LIFE AND LABOR UNDER SLAVERY

 shout’s rhythmic circle dance involving joined hands, counterclockwise movement to a steady beat, hand clapping, and free-form upper-body movements became an important religious ritual. Funeral practices also reflected this fusion of African and Christian rituals. Slaves often scattered broken ceramics over a grave, a practice carried over from African burial practices. A Maryland observer of a funeral noted that the body was interred with a miniature canoe and paddle. The slaves explained that this would allow the spirit to cross the ocean and return to Africa. Because slaves toiled in the fields during the day, their funerals typically took place at night. Torchlight processions to gravesites, accompanied by drumming and other African-inflected music and chants, unsettled white observers. Still some whites, as this painting of a slave preacher leading a funeral service (9.17) shows, overcame their cultural bias and appreciated the beauty of slave burials. Barely discernible between the two trees in the bottom corner of the painting are the plantation master and mistress. They are a visual reminder that slaves were never completely free from the watchful eye of their masters. Spirituals, a distinctive musical art form created by slaves, drew heavily on biblical themes. The figure of Moses and the plight of the ancient Hebrews who were delivered from slavery were two common themes. Slave spirituals also featured images of crossing over the River Jordan to freedom in this life or redemption in the next. Music was also important in other aspects of slave culture. Slaves used song to preserve African traditions, help relieve the monotony of work, entertain, or even communicate cryptic messages to other slaves. When slaves “went around singing ‘Steal Away to Jesus,’” a former slave recalled, it not only affirmed the hope of redemption but often signaled others that there would “be a religious meeting that night.” Virtually every major form of modern popular music: jazz, gospel, blues, rock and roll, and hiphop derive in part from musical traditions rooted in the experience of American or New World slavery.

Resistance and Revolt
 Slaves developed a complex range of behaviors to resist the harsh discipline forced on them. Many used subtle tactics to thwart their owners because they minimized

 the chances for punishment. Slaves feigned illness, broke tools, and slowed their pace of work to fight back against their economic exploitation. Another means of resistance was flight. Typically runaways left only for short periods, seeking a respite from servitude, or to visit kin and spouses on neighboring plantations. Less frequently slaves sought to gain their freedom by fleeing to free territory in the North or in Canada. In the Deep South, some slaves fled to Indian Territory or to swamps to escape detection. In a few celebrated cases, slaves devised daring methods of escape. The most extreme form of resistance was insurrection. In 1831, Nat Turner led the largest slave uprising in American history. A lay preacher, Turner had a vision of a battle between “white spirits and blacks spirits” that would commence when the “sun was darkened.” He believed that the solar eclipse in 1831 was a divine sign that the time for insurrection was ripe. Nat Turner’s Rebellion lasted two days and attracted between 60 and 80 slaves before authorities subdued the rebels. Before the carnage ended 55 whites were killed and as many African Americans. This woodcut from a contemporary account of the rebellion written by a supporter of slavery depicts the rebels unsympathetically, about to attack defenseless women and children, and the efforts of whites to defend their loved ones as

Although laws varied from state to Spiritual, “Steal Away to Jesus” heroic (9.18). The bottom of the image shows the militia riding to rescue these helpless victims. Many Northerners, however, viewed Nat Turner as a righteous and heroic warrior against the evil of slavery. After the Rebellion, Southern states enacted more repressive laws to prevent another revolt. These laws prevented African Americans from preaching and limited the access of free blacks to firearms. States also strengthened their militias and made assaults by slaves against whites capital offenses. On the other hand, the Virginia legislature debated abolishing slavery before voting 73 to 58 against a proposal to end it.

 state, slave codes generally accorded slaves minimal rights. These laws curtailed the movements of slaves, forbidding them to travel without written permission from their masters. Laws also proscribed teaching slaves to read or write. Slaves had no right to testify in court, and planters served as both judge and jury on their plantations, meting out punishment. On rare occasions a slave did obtain a day in court, as when a South Carolina court ruled that a slave could not be tried for the same crime twice, an application of the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy that was a bedrock of American law. Despite such modest protections, however, slaves still enjoyed only the slimmest legal protection and remained at the mercy of their masters (see Choices and Consequences: Conscience or Duty? Justice Ruffin’s Quandary).

 “No one can read this decision, [State v. Mann] so fine and clear in expression, so dignified and solemn in its earnestness, and so dreadful in its results, without feeling at once deep respect for the man and horror for the system.” Abolitionist HARRIET BEECHER STOWE, The Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, (1853) Who was Nat Turner?

Choices and Consequences
CONSCIENCE OR DUTY? JUSTICE RUFFIN’S QUANDARY
In 1829, Chief Justice Thomas Ruffin of the North Carolina Supreme Court issued his opinion in State v. Mann, a case involving an assault on a slave named Lydia by John Mann. Lydia’s owner, Elizabeth Jones, instigated the case against Mann (slaves had no legal standing to bring charges) for wounding her slave. Mann had rented Lydia from Jones, and the law recognized that as a temporary owner, he did not have the same long term interests in protecting his property. Thus, although Mann was legally entitled to discipline Lydia, his power over her was more limited than that of her legal owner. When Mann tried to discipline Lydia, she ran off. Mann then shot and wounded her. Rather than try to recover monetary damages in a civil trial, an option precluded because Mann was too poor to pay damages, Lydia’s owner pursued criminal charges. A lower court convicted Mann of an assault and battery on Lydia, and Mann then appealed the case to the state Supreme Court. State v. Mann explored legal questions at the heart of slavery. In deciding how to handle the case, Justice Ruffin faced difficult choices. 
Choices




 Uphold Mann’s conviction and affirm that the doctrine that a temporary master’s power to discipline was limited



 Overrule the lower court and assert that Mann had the same legal authority as Lydia’s owner, including the right to punish disobedience, and affirm that a master’s power over slaves was unlimited



 Decide the case on the narrowest grounds possible. Affirm the lower court ruling and avoid sweeping statements about the nature of the master’s powers by focusing squarely on the facts: the excessive use of force by a disreputable person with a history of violence.

Decision
 Ruffin chose to overrule the lower court. Although tempted to sympathize with the plight of slaves and offer them legal protections, he argued that the law denied them such protections: “The power of the master must be absolute to render the submission of the slave perfect.” To bestow on slaves basic rights would undermine slavery itself.

Consequences


 Woodcut image of master shooting slave

 Within five years, in State v. Will, Ruffin’s fellow justices partially repudiated his decision. The case did not dispute Ruffin’s major premise that a slave must be totally submissive, but it rejected his claim that the only means to accomplish this goal was to give the master total power. The court accepted that the master’s power was limited and the use of excessive or lethal force to discipline a slave was not protected by the law of slavery.

Continuing Controversies
 What role did ideas of justice play in Justice Ruffin’s understanding of the rule of law? Most modern scholars agree that the decision in State v. Mann reflects the fundamental immorality of slavery. But the controversy over the decision focuses on a more basic question about law itself. Does law simply reflect the dominant power relations of society? Or, can the law embody ideals of justice or fairness that are not simply a mask to disguise the naked exercise of power? Ruffin’s decision reinforced the power of the planter class, and many view it as vindicating those who believe that the law is a tool that enables the powerful (the masters) to dominate the weak (the slaves). However, Ruffin’s anguish and the later ruling in State v. Will might be seen as proof that the rule of law does impose constraints on the powerful.

 Does the law of slavery support the claim that the law is a tool of the powerful or a constraint on them?

Revivalism, Reform,
 and Artistic Renaissance, 1820–1850 The expansion of democracy and the changes resulting from the market revolution left Americans concerned about their lives and the nation’s future. Rising inequality and a bitter debate over slavery intensified anxieties. In this popular lithograph, The Way of Good and Evil, the artist portrays the social ills facing America, including alcoholism, prostitution, and crime. A tavern, brothel, and prison represent the path of destruction. Different buildings—a school, home, and church—anchor the center. The path to salvation leads from these institutions through college and eventually up into heaven. In the artist’s view Americans faced a clear choice: salvation or eternal damnation. Americans sought solutions for the nation’s social problems and clamored for reforms. Many turned to mainstream religion for guidance or joined religious reform movements. Secular reformers targeted education and prisons or alcohol. Some religious movements viewed the market economy as the root of America’s problems and advocated the abandonment of private property. Secular utopian movements came to similar conclusions. Still other reformers adopted a radically different critique of market society. Champions of Transcendentalism, a literary and philosophical movement, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, urged Americans to reject the values of the marketplace and turn to nature or their individual consciences for inspiration. The expanding literary marketplace prompted many writers to explore contemporary ills, or use them as a backdrop for stories that probed issues as different as slavery and urbanization. The rise of a more aggressive abolitionist movement and the development of an equally fervid defense of slavery intensified the public debate over this issue. Abolitionism helped radicalize many women and gave them the opportunity to develop organizing skills. Inspired by a more radical theory of equality and equipped with their new skills, women’s rights advocates applied their critique of slavery to women’s status under American law. Reform efforts also affected architecture. Many reformers advocated transforming the American landscape itself, including the built environment, to promote social reform and spiritual renewal.

 “In the history of the world the doctrine of Reform had never such scope as at the present hour…. We are to revise the whole of our social structure, the state, the school, religion, marriage, trade, science, and explore their foundations in our own nature.” RALPH WALDO EMERSON, Man the Reformer (1841)

REVIVALISM, REFORM, AND ARTISTIC RENAISSANCE: 1820–1850

Revivalism and Reform


10.1 Religious
Camp Meeting
 A contemporary artist captured the intense emotional experience of a revival meeting.

 The Cane Ridge revival in Kentucky (1801) was the first stirring of the larger revival movement that constituted America’s Second Great Awakening. (For a discussion of the First Great Awakening, see Chapter 3.) In the next four decades, this emotional style of evangelical Protestantism attracted many Americans. For those swept up in the revival, the changes transforming American society were seen as a threat to the church and the family. However, the most farsighted proponents of revival, such as Charles Grandison Finney, realized that the power of the market revolution might be turned to good ends and used to promote religion and reform. By the 1830s, Americans began to believe that the economic, political, and social changes sweeping over their society were undermining individual morality, the ability of communities to prosper, and the integrity of the family. This belief drove the push for moral reform. In many cases religious impulse inspired reformers. Finney preached that “true saints love reform” and argued that humankind could create a perfect society here on earth if all Americans made “the reformation of the whole world” their priority. Not all reformers were religiously motivated, however. Some reform efforts promoted secular goals and drew on the Enlightenment’s ideals of reason, science, and faith in humankind’s ability to improve and reshape its surroundings (see Chapters 3 and 4). Secular reform movements led to improvements in schools, care for the mentally ill, and methods of reforming criminals. Whether religious or secular, reform efforts targeted individual behavior such as drunkenness and prostitution.

Revivalism and the
Market Revolution
 One way of promoting revivalism was the camp meeting, an outdoor religious revival that lasted for days. This painting of Religious Camp Meeting (10.1) by an English artist captures the emotional intensity of these events, during which grown men and women swooned and collapsed in response to the fiery preaching of ministers. The painting shows overwrought men and women, physically exhausted from the revival, splayed across the ground and on the benches in the foreground. One observer compared the audience’s response to the fiery sermons of the camp meeting with the “swelling” of an ocean wave, an awesome spectacle of “fainting, shouting, yelling, crying, sobbing and grieving.” The tents in the background of the painting give only a small sense of the scope of these events. Camp meetings could last for a week and attract 3,000 people and 100 preachers.

What was the Second Great Awakening?

REVIVALISM AND REFORM

 Revivalists faulted many mainstream ministers for their overly intellectualized preaching. Ministers also blamed America’s problems on the materialism associated with the market revolution. One minister feared that the same forces that were “increasing the business and moneyed interests in the Nation” would “by spreading vice and irreligion prove its ruin. Those very things which all regard as improvements will be our destruction.” For some, however, the new methods of communication and wealth generated by the market revolution were tools to press into the service of revivalism. No figure proved more adept at turning the tools of the market to religious purposes than Charles Grandison Finney, a lawyer turned preacher who became a leading spokesman for spreading the revivalist message of the Second Great Awakening to towns and cities. His influence was felt particularly strongly in those urban centers most closely associated with the market revolution. While walking to his law offices one day, Finney experienced a religious conversion. In a lawyerly manner he declared that from that day on he would be on a “retainer from the Lord Jesus Christ to plead his cause.” Drawing on his experience as a courtroom lawyer, he fashioned a forceful and direct style of preaching that cajoled, harangued, and pleaded with his audience to embrace salvation. Finney’s theology rejected many of the Calvinist assumptions of nonevangelical churches (see Chapter 3). Where Calvinists stressed predestination, the belief that God predetermined our individual destinies, including who will and will not be saved, Finney instead stressed free will, people’s ability to seek out salvation through their own efforts. The idea of perfectionism grew out of his emphasis on free



 will. By aiming for perfection, Finney preached, human beings could usher in the millennium. In contrast to the pessimistic message of Calvinism, which condemned most people to damnation, Finney emphasized sobriety and hard work along with his religious message. His sermons appealed to the expanding middle class and the wealthy. Finney found an especially eager audience in men and women in the cities and towns along the Erie Canal in upstate New York. A dramatic revival occurred in Rochester, New York, in 1830–1831. Finney adapted many of the new political techniques associated with Jacksonian democracy, designed to get voters involved in politics, to his revivals. Politicians, Finney noted, “get up meetings; circulate handbills and pamphlets; blaze away in the newspapers.” The goal of such actions was to stimulate “excitement and bring the people out.” Finney and other evangelicals took advantage of the opportunities provided by the market revolution, particularly the expansion of the publishing industry, to churn out tracts, Bibles, and evangelical periodicals. Organizations such as the American Bible Society and the American Tract Society led the way in marketing evangelical publications, making an effort to use high-quality wood-cut images in many of them to visually reinforce the text.

Temperance
 Rising levels of alcohol consumption spurred the growth of temperance, the reform movement that advocated abstinence from alcohol. By 1830, consumption of spirits reached an all-time high: almost seven gallons per person of pure alcohol a year (more than twice the amount that the average American drinks today). Alcohol had always been

 “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created temperate; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain natural and innocent desires; that among these are the appetite for cold water and the pursuit of happiness!” MANIFESTO OF THE WASHINGTON TOTAL ABSTINENCE SOCIETIES, 1841

 important in America. Every social class imbibed alcohol, and hardly a community function took place without alcohol consumption. Workers on the job often drank alcohol during their midmorning and mid-afternoon breaks. One commentator noted that “a house could not be raised, a field of wheat cut down, nor could there be a log rolling, a husking, a quilting, a wedding, or funeral without the aid of alcohol.” Although Western religions had always frowned on drunkenness, Christians had never deemed the consumption of alcohol a sin. The Great Awakening changed this as spokesmen for the revival fastened on intemperance as an issue. At first proponents of temperance merely sought to promote moderation, but by the mid-1820s, a more radical temperance movement sought complete abstinence from alcohol. The first national temperance organization was founded in 1826, and within three years there were 222 similar organizations. By the mid-1830s, temperance organizations had more than 1.5 million members, and more than two million Americans had taken the movement’s pledge of abstinence. Evangelical religious leaders took the lead

 What does this painting of a militia muster reveal about alcohol consumption in America?

 “I believe in the existence of a great, immortal, immutable principle of natural law … which proves the absolute right to an education of every human being that comes into the world.” HORACE MANN, 1846 in these organizations, delivering sermons with titles like: “The Nature, Occasions, Signs, Evils, and Remedy of Intemperance.” Reformers warned Americans that alcohol threatened their souls as well as their bodies. For Congregational minister Lyman Beecher, a prominent figure in the Second Great Awakening, temperance organizations were “a disciplined moral militia,” an ironic metaphor given that the real militia had become another illustration of the problem of intemperance. Although militia musters, the practice sessions of the militia, had always been festive occasions that included drinking, by the mid-nineteenth century, they had become drunken revels, as this depiction of a militia-day muster illustrates (10.2). The militiaman in the foreground is so

 inebriated he cannot stand, and the dancing African American suggests that the atmosphere is more carnival-like than military. Temperance advocates also campaigned for prohibition laws banning the sale of alcohol, and temperance attracted other reformers such as the young Whig politician Abraham Lincoln. The Whigs helped to secure laws to promote sobriety. Maine adopted the most wide-sweeping law in 1851, prohibiting alcohol. By 1855, 13 of the nation’s 31 states had passed similar laws. The temperance movement did not banish drinking from American life, but it dramatically reduced alcohol consumption.

Schools, Prisons,
 and Asylums Alcohol consumption was hardly the only concern of reformers. They also turned their attention to education, the criminal justice system, and the treatment of the mentally ill. They founded new institutions to deal with these social problems and campaigned to change the way Americans thought about these issues. Education was central to reform efforts. Lyman Beecher wrote that “we must educate, or we must perish by our own prosperity.” Unfettered growth and materialism, according to such leaders as Beecher, would otherwise subvert America’s moral foundations. The leading spokesman for educational reform in America was the Whig politician Horace Mann. As a member of the Massachusetts legislature, he worked tirelessly to create a state board of education that would establish a uniform curriculum for Massachusetts and improve teacher training. Mann became the first head of the new state board of education. Massachusetts also became the first state to pass a compulsory school attendance law. For reformers such as Mann, the Common School—universal public education—would cure society’s ills. As Mann wrote, “let the Common School be expanded to its capabilities … and nine tenths of the crimes in the penal code would become obsolete; the long catalogue of human ills would be abridged.” Although many types of reform were “curative or remedial,” schools, according to Mann, were “preventive.” He intended his reforms, like much mainstream educational reform of the day, to

Massachusetts Board of Education




 make good citizens and workers. This era saw the development of many features of modern schooling. The assignment of students to grades according to age and ability, the use of standardized procedures for promotion, and the notion of uniform textbooks for instruction all emerged out of the Massachusetts model that Mann helped pioneer. A new textbook, the popular McGuffey’s Reader, appeared in 1836. This text went through multiple editions for the remainder of the nineteenth century. The McGuffey readers carried a clear political message well suited to a society in which wealth was becoming less equally distributed. The readers instructed children not to envy their social betters, but rather to remind them that “it is God who makes some poor, and others rich.” A different vision of education shaped the agenda of the Working Men’s party, which saw education as an invaluable tool in the ongoing political struggle between the people and the aristocratic few. Although they shared Mann’s Whig goal of universal education, they intended education to liberate workers, not make them docile. Thus a Philadelphia Working Men’s party committee declared that “despotism” thrived when the “multitude” is consigned to ignorance, and education and knowledge reserved for the “the rich and the rulers.” Although educational reform attracted a wide range of supporters, including religious leaders, Whigs such as Mann, and the Working Men’s

 “We find in the United States two distinctly separate systems: the system of Auburn and that of Philadelphia. . . . The two systems opposed to each other on important points, have, however, a common basis, without which no penitentiary system is possible; this basis is the isolation of the prisoners.” GUSTAVE DE BEAUMONT and ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE (1833)

 How did Mann’s vision of educational reform differ from that of the Working Men’s Party?



 CHAPTER 10

REVIVALISM, REFORM, AND ARTISTIC RENAISSANCE: 1820–1850

 party, opposition to such reforms could be equally ardent. A variety of groups feared that government involvement in education would endanger individual freedom. Democrats in Massachusetts, for example, viewed Mann’s program as a “system of centralization” that would put “power in a few hands” and undermine the “spirit of our democratic institutions.” Farmers feared that a longer school year would rob them of a valuable source of labor, and that the increased taxes to fund the new school system would fall heavily on agricultural interests. Finally Catholics feared that the country’s Protestant majority had designed the new system to impose its values on nonProtestants. In response to the Common School movement, Catholics began creating their own parochial schools. Although Mann’s utopian vision of education as a cure for society’s ills was not realized, the Common School movement did achieve notable successes. By mid-century, over half of the white children in America between ages five and nineteen were enrolled in public schools, the highest percentage in the world. Higher education also expanded dramatically. In 1815 there were 33 colleges in America; by 1835 there were 68, and 113 by 1848. The Great Awakening inspired much of this growth. Almost half these new colleges were affiliated with denominations that took a prominent role in the Awakening: Presbyterians, Methodists, and Baptists. Among the colleges and universities founded in this period were Amherst

 “I proceed, gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of insane persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience... ” DOROTHEA DIX, 1843

 and Wesleyan in New England, Earlham in the Midwest, and Emory and Duke in the South. Although these schools excluded women, whose educational opportunities lagged behind those for men, some progress occurred in this area. In 1821, Emma Willard founded the Troy Female Seminary in Troy, New York, and in 1837, Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was established in Massachusetts. Oberlin College in Ohio admitted women from its inception in 1833. A hotbed of abolitionist sentiment, Oberlin admitted its first African-American students in 1835. The state universities that date from this period of educational reform include Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and Wisconsin, as do some of the nation’s leading Catholic institutions, including Fordham, Holy Cross, Notre Dame, Villanova, and Xavier in Cincinnati. The new religious emphasis on free will and commitment to moral reform also inspired new approaches to criminal justice. In place of punishment a new reform-based model of incarceration emerged: the “penitentiary,” where individuals were isolated from one another and given a chance to repent and reform. Earlier approaches to crime had cast behavior in terms of sinfulness and innate depravity and had meted out punishment accordingly. Two different models for implementing this penitential ideal emerged in prisons. The New York State system employed the first at Ossining, a prison in the Hudson River Valley. Prisoners sent “up the river” from New York City to “Sing Sing” were housed in individual cells at night but were organized in communal work details during the day. Inmates worked ten-hour days in stone quarries; eventually the prisoners manufactured goods, including barrels, boots and shoes, hats, brushes, and mattresses. Pennsylvania pioneered a different model, which it implemented in Eastern State Penitentiary. Eastern State employed solitary confinement, which isolated prisoners from all contact with other prisoners to force them to reflect on their criminality and seek repentance. The architecture of Eastern State reflected this new approach to penology. Architect John Haviland’s vision of the ideal prison combined fashionable Gothic architectural elements with

REVIVALISM AND REFORM

 an Enlightenment emphasis on geometrical forms ( 10.3). Thus although the outside of the prison looked like a medieval fortress, the inside consisted of a series of radiating spokes emanating from a central watch tower. A guard in the central tower could see the prisoners, who themselves were unable to see the guard. Haviland believed his plan would facilitate “watching, convenience, economy and ventilation.” This design, which its inventor, British philosopher Jeremy Bentham, dubbed a panopticon, applied the Enlightenment’s ideals of reason to prison reform. Prisoners were potentially under surveillance at all times and could never be sure if the eyes of the state were on them. The goal was to impose discipline and have prisoners internalize it as an ideal. This vision of penal reform fit with the Enlightenment’s ideals of reason and control.



 Life for the mentally ill had always been hard, and people with mental illness were often housed with criminals. In 1841, Dorothea Dix, a schoolteacher, volunteered to provide religious instruction for women in the Massachusetts House of Correction. Shocked by the treatment of the inmates, particularly the mentally ill, who were dressed in rags, confined to one room, and often beaten, Dix sought to change the way mental illness was treated. After visiting jails and poorhouses where the mentally ill were housed, she compiled a report to the Massachusetts legislature detailing the wretched conditions in places such as the House of Correction. Dix recommended that criminals be separated from the mentally ill and argued that the latter would benefit from more humane treatment. Other reformers followed her lead, and by 1860, 28 of 33 states had public asylums for the mentally ill.

 CHAPTER 10

REVIVALISM, REFORM, AND ARTISTIC RENAISSANCE: 1820–1850

Abolitionism and the
Proslavery Response
 The debate over slavery heated up as abolitionists demanded an immediate end to slavery. Like revivalists abolitionists also took advantage of the new tools provided by the market revolution to bombard Southerners with their message, particularly communications technologies such as improvements in printing. The more aggressive style of abolitionism produced a fierce reaction from Southerners, who became increasingly militant in their defense of slavery. Rather than concede that slavery was a necessary evil, as Jefferson and others of the Founding generation had, Southerners now touted slavery as a positive good that reformed and uplifted slaves. The real evils in American society, they argued, were abolitionism and the factory system. By mid-century, the slavery debate created huge divisions within American politics and society.

The Rise of Immediatism
 Much of the early opposition to slavery was led by the Quakers. The ideals of the American Revolution also contributed to the rise of abolitionist sentiment, which attracted leading politicians, including prominent Federalists, such as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. For these abolitionists slavery threatened the republican values of liberty and virtue. Racial equality or justice was not a major concern, the elimination of slavery was necessary to prevent Americans from becoming corrupted by the institution of slavery. James Madison, Henry Clay, and John Marshall championed a plan that included gradually liberating the slaves and returning them to Africa. The American Colonization Society, the organization

 “I shall strenuously contend for the immediate enfranchisement of our slave population…. I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation…. I will not equivocate—I will not excuse—I will not retreat a single inch— AND I WILL BE HEARD.” WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, The Liberator, 1831

 Why was David Walker’s Appeal so radical?

 devoted to implementing this idea, was founded in 1817. It helped to found the West African colony of Liberia and began transporting free blacks there from the United States. Yet by 1830, only 1,400 blacks had been sent to Liberia. Although gradualism and colonization had appealed to many white opponents of slavery, it never attracted much interest among African Americans, who supported a more immediate end to slavery and were committed to remaining in the United States. A convention of free blacks, speaking of the United States, proclaimed in 1831 that “this is our home, and this is our country.” In 1829 abolitionism entered a new era. David Walker, a free black who had grown up in North Carolina and moved to Boston, published an Appeal, which he addressed to the “Coloured Citizens of the World, but in Particular, and Very Expressly, to Those of the United States of America.” Walker rejected colonization and declared that “America is more our country than it is the whites—we have enriched it with our blood and tears.” He urged slaves to defend themselves, by force if necessary, against their masters. His call for slave insurrection led Southern states to enact or strengthen laws making it illegal to teach slaves to read. It also marked the end of support among many Southern intellectuals for colonization. Walker’s death in 1830 cut short his career as an abolitionist. Although Walker’s radical, insurrectionary appeal had little impact on mainstream abolitionists, his call for immediate abolition resonated with those most eager to abolish slavery. Since the Revolution mainstream abolitionist thought had adopted a gradualist approach, preferring to end

 slavery in a piecemeal fashion. Now, abolitionists rejected gradualism in favor of immediatism, an immediate end to slavery. The most forceful spokesman for immediatism was William Lloyd Garrison, who founded the newspaper The Liberator in 1831. In its first issue, Garrison announced that he had recanted the “popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition.” With other abolitionists, Garrison organized the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1832. A year later he joined 60 other delegates, including men, women, whites, and free blacks, to create the American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS). By 1840, more than 1,350 antislavery societies had sprung up in the North with combined memberships of 250,000. The success of British abolitionists, who in 1833 had persuaded Parliament to emancipate almost all slaves in the British Empire, inspired American abolitionists. In 1835, American abolitionists, taking advantage of the new opportunities provided by the market revolution to get their antislavery message across, began to inundate Southerners with antislavery literature. Abolitionists also worked diligently in the North to raise awareness of the evils of slavery. In addition to using traditional print forms such as newspapers and pamphlets, they developed almanacs, songbooks, children’s books, and jigsaw puzzles. This children’s puzzle (10.4) includes scenes typical of abolitionist literature, including images of slaves being whipped and brutalized. Adept at publicizing their cause, abolitionists seized opportunities provided by dramatic events, such as the escape of Henry “Box” Brown, who had mailed himself from Richmond, Virginia, to Philadelphia in a wooden box (10.5). The trip took 26 hours, and Brown arrived in his box in Philadelphia shaken but unscathed. Abolitionists distributed images of his escape, and he later toured the North with a panorama, “The Mirror of Slavery” Panoramas were large pictures mounted on rollers that, when unfurled slowly, gave the viewer the feeling that the picture was moving. Often a narrator accompanied a panorama on tour. Brown’s narration complemented the panorama’s depiction of the history of slavery in America. Another event that triggered public interest in slavery was the unveiling of American artist Hiram Powers’s sculpture, The Greek Slave. Powers’s popular work depicted a beautiful Greek woman enslaved by the Ottoman Turks, who were Muslims. The image of a Christian woman

How abolitionists accomplished this— and how Southerners recast its meaning to reflect their views—is the subject of Images as History: The Greek Slave. The antislavery movement attracted a strong following in New England and among transplanted New Englanders in the Midwest, particularly evangelicals. Quakers were active abolitionists, too. A few

Images as History
THE GREEK SLAVE
The Vermont artist Hiram Powers’s statue, The Greek Slave (1844), became one of the most popular sculptures in nineteenth-century America. Powers portrayed the slave stripped naked by her Turkish captors, chained, and placed on the auction block. Religious leaders and even reviewers had denounced earlier artists who, following European conventions, had portrayed women in the nude, but Powers avoided moral censure by explaining to his audience that by depicting the dignity of the slave in the face of such cruel treatment, he had clothed her in an invisible robe of virtue. How would viewers in different parts of the nation have responded to this work of art? How would abolitionists have interpreted its message? How would defenders of slavery? Cities across America and small towns in New England and Ohio exhibited The Greek Slave. The image here shows a crowded gallery of men, 
 women, and children viewing the work in New York. Besides prompting widespread commentary in the press, Powers’s work inspired poems. A poet in the Knickerbocker Magazine described The Greek Slave as “Naked yet clothed with chastity.” Public reaction to the sculpture became entwined in the larger debate over slavery. While Southerners praised the work, focusing on the theme of Christian virtue, Northerners compared the slave’s suffering to the plight of America’s slaves. One New York correspondent wondered how an audience might be driven to tears at the sight of an “insensate piece of marble” and “yet listens unmoved to the awful story of the American slave!” Apologists for slavery mocked such appeals. Noting that many abolitionists had waxed poetic about The Greek Slave, one writer wondered why “we have not heard” of a single effort to free her from her chains. Although a nude figure would have normally been shocking, The Greek Slave attracted huge crowds, including women and children. Exhibition guides reminded viewers that the slave was clothed in Christian virtue.

ABOLITIONISM AND THE PROSLAVERY RESPONSE

 prominent Southerners also joined the movement, including Angelina and Sarah Grimké, daughters of a wealthy South Carolina planter, whose conversion to Quakerism facilitated their involvement in abolitionism. The two women left the South to pursue the cause of abolitionism. The antislavery movement galvanized many women, who became the grassroots activists for abolitionism. By 1840, more than two-thirds of the signers of antislavery petitions submitted to Congress were women.

Anti-Abolitionism and
 the Abolitionist Response Proslavery rhetoric intensified as Northern opponents of slavery employed increasingly assertive tactics. Southerners held mass rallies to denounce Northern abolitionists. Garrison’s newspaper, The Liberator, was especially galling. Within a year of its first issue, the Georgia legislature proposed a $5,000 reward for anyone who would bring Garrison to Georgia for trial. Rewards were posted for bounty hunters to kidnap other prominent abolitionists and bring them to the South for trial. The wealthy New York abolitionist Arthur Tappan had a price of $50,000 on his head at one point. In July 1835, a steamship arrived in Charleston carrying thousands of antislavery tracts and newspapers addressed to Southerners. Angry residents grabbed the mailbags containing the Northern abolitionist literature; the next night 3,000 Charlestonians consigned the letters to a huge bonfire. This antislavery Northern political cartoon ridiculed Southerners’



 efforts to prevent the distribution of abolitionist materials (10.6). Southern hostility did not deter abolitionists. They began inundating Congress with petitions calling for an immediate end to slavery. Southerners reacted by passing the “gag rule,” a procedural motion that required that the House of Representatives automatically table antislavery petitions and not consider them. The gag rule passed with the support of Northern and Southern Democrats. The Senate was unable to pass its own gag rule, but it adopted a practice that produced virtually the same effect. Once the Senate had received slavery petitions, a proslavery senator would simply move to table them. Yet abolitionist petitions continued to pour into Congress, especially from women’s groups. In 1836–1837, an all-female petition from Massachusetts gathered 21,000 signatures, a record number. Southern efforts to stymie free speech and the right to petition Congress only underscored abolitionists’ belief that slavery was incompatible with liberty. To leading abolitionists interference with the U.S. mail and congressional refusal to deal with petitions made slavery a national, as opposed to a local, issue.

The Proslavery Argument
 Leading Southerners of the revolutionary era had attacked slavery even as they continued to profit from it. No member of the Founding generation was more conflicted over slavery than Thomas Jefferson, who told a friend in 1820 that “we have the wolf by the ears, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other.” Jefferson hoped that a new generation of statesmen would eliminate slavery. Such hopes diminished, however, as “Alabama fever” swept across the South, and cotton agriculture transformed the American economy. To complicate matters, Nat Turner’s insurrection (see Chapter 9) frightened Southerners, who became convinced that Northern abolitionists were stirring up slave insurrections.

 In 1832, Thomas R. Dew, a young professor at the College of William and Mary, published his Review of the Debate in the Virginia Legislature of 1831 and 1832. In the aftermath of Nat Turner’s Rebellion, the legislature had seriously debated ending slavery, but a narrow majority rejected the idea. Dew repudiated the ideas of Jefferson and others who, agonizing over slavery, considered it unjust and recommended its elimination. Dew defended the property rights of slaveholders and dismissed the impracticality of relocating emancipated slaves outside Virginia. He even claimed that slavery was a positive good, sanctioned by ancient philosophers such as Aristotle and justified by the Bible. In Southern colleges, proslavery spokesmen championed the religious, philosophical, and economic benefits of slavery, and in the South’s leading magazines they defended their new proslavery ideology. They even argued that slavery was good not only for masters but for slaves. Southern defenders of slavery cast themselves as benevolent patriarchs; slaves, they argued, were the lucky beneficiaries of this system. This selfserving vision of slavery is reflected in this lithograph appropriately entitled Slavery As It Exists In America (10.7). The two shocked Northerners depicted express their astonishment that slaves were so well treated and happy. The artist also singles out the evils of British factories for condemnation. Southerners often made similar points about Northern industry, which they argued treated its workers more brutally than Southern plantation owners treated slaves. One of the most influential apologists for Southern slavery was John C. Calhoun, an eminent South Carolina politician. He argued that the South’s “peculiar institution,” which was the term he coined for Southern slavery, was not “an evil,” a cause of shame, but rather “a good—a positive good,” to be championed.

THE CULT OF TRUE WOMANHOOD, REFORM, AND WOMEN’S RIGHTS



The Cult of True Womanhood,
 Reform, and Women’s Rights Women took a leading role in reform movements. The most active reformers were members of a growing middle class. Female reformers targeted activities that threatened the family and demeaned women’s family role. Prostitution was one prominent target of reformers, but hardly the only social problem that attracted notice from female reformers. They also attacked alcoholism, crime, illiteracy, and even slavery. The social changes brought about by the market revolution, including the rise of the factory system (see Chapter 9), contributed to new ideas about the family and gender roles. A new concept of domesticity and the related notion that men’s and women’s proper roles lay in separate spheres of activity became the cornerstone of a new middle-class ideal. Society defined the public world of work and politics as male, whereas the private world of home and family became women’s domain. Female reformers defended the new ideal and attacked the social evils that threatened it.

The New Domestic Ideal
 Horace Bushnell, an influential New England minister, captured the profound change that transformed American economic and social life when he remarked that the “transition from mother-anddaughter power, to water and steam power, is a great one” and had produced a “complete revolution in domestic life.” One consequence of the rise of industry was a growing separation between home and workplace. This change facilitated the rise of a new middleclass ideology that defined women’s role as a separate sphere of domesticity. A “cult of true womanhood” emerged in which female values were defined in opposition to the aggressive and competitive marketplace. Women were identified with piety, motherhood, and sexual passivity.

 Although this ideal was largely unattainable for rural farm women, urban working-class women, and free black women—all of whom had to work to maintain even minimal economic subsistence—this middle-class ideal suffused American culture. Magazines such as Godey’s Lady’s Book, the growing body of middle-class advice literature such as Catherine Beecher’s Treatise on Domestic Economy, and the ubiquitous prints produced by Currier and Ives all celebrated the new domestic ideal. Lilly Martin Spenser, the most renowned female artist of her day, made the new domestic ideal a central theme in her paintings. Rather than depict her subjects in the formal settings, garbed in rich velvet clothing and seated in poses borrowed from paintings of royalty and aristocracy, characteristic of the family portraits favored by earlier artists, Spencer often chose intimate scenes of domestic life as her settings. In Domestic Happiness she depicts a husband and wife standing before their two sleeping children. The mother’s hand gently touches her husband, symbolizing the new domestic ideal’s emphasis on emotional intimacy between husband and wife (10.8). She also appears to be gently

 restraining her husband from waking the children, a subtle reminder that in the domestic sphere, women, not men, were in charge.

Controlling Sexuality
 The new ideal of domesticity emphasized emotional control, including control of sexuality. In 1834, Lydia Finney, the wife of Charles Finney, established the New York Female Moral Reform Society to champion moral purity. By 1837, the Society had 15,000 members and branches across New England and New York State. It focused on the problem of urban prostitution. Estimates vary but in some urban areas such as New York City, prostitution was the second largest industry in the city, well ahead of publishing, brewing, and baking (see Envisioning Evidence: The Economics and Geography of Vice in MidNineteenth Century New York, Chapter 9). The members of the society even visited brothels to urge the “fallen women” to abandon their involvement in commercial sex. Sometimes reformers tried to shame the male clients of the prostitutes by publishing their names in the press. The society also lobbied to criminalize prostitution. Although they could be closed if they created a public nuisance, most brothels easily avoided legal entanglements and plied their trade without fear of prosecution. The reformer Sylvester Graham formulated a farreaching critique of sexuality. In his widely reprinted lectures on Chastity (1834), Graham advised his

 readers to avoid sexual overstimulation, recommending that they “Take more exercise in the open air, and use the cold bath under proper circumstances.” He also believed that diet contributed to overstimulation, producing a variety of physical and psychological ailments. His followers abandoned stimulants such as tea, coffee, and alcohol, replacing them with a bland diet built around whole-grain breads and crackers (the forerunner of Graham crackers). Followers of Graham could obtain information about bland diets from the Graham Journal of Health and Longevity, or they could attend Graham clubs at college or live in boarding houses committed to Graham’s rules. A follower of Graham’s who set off on a different path, Mary Gove became interested in women’s reproductive rights and health. She traveled across America lecturing to women about their bodies. Her Lectures to Ladies on Anatomy and Physiology (1842) included an image of a female skeleton, kneeling in prayer, on its frontispiece (10.9). Gove argued that the idea that women were passionless was a direct result of her “enslaved and unhealthy conditions.” She later married the health reformer Thomas Low Nichols, and the two promoted health reform and woman’s rights issues. Paulina Wright, another lecturer on women’s health, carried around an anatomically correct female mannequin to help demonstrate issues relevant to sexual and reproductive health. Her lectures sometimes proved shocking, causing some to faint or even “run from the room.” Interest in sexuality emerged out of a general concern to reform society and behavior. Woman’s involvement in antebellum reform led some to examine the values, institutions, and political forces that justified the oppression and exploitation of women.

 The Path toward Seneca Falls Women had already been active in political and moral reform movements, including opposition to President Jackson’s policy of Indian removal (see Chapter 8), temperance, and the crusade against prostitution. Participation in these movements had led women to organize themselves, speak out in public, and question the underlying political, legal, and social values that contributed to their oppression. Many women were drawn to the antislavery movement which further radicalized many female reformers. Of the almost 70,000 signatures on antislavery petitions submitted to Congress in 1837–1838, more than two-thirds were women’s. Organizations such as the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society (1833) provided women with unprecedented

THE CULT OF TRUE WOMANHOOD, REFORM, AND WOMEN’S RIGHTS

 opportunities to become actors in one of the most important political dramas of the day. Involvement in the antislavery cause could be a harrowing experience. The virulent hatred abolitionists faced, even in the North, did not make exemptions for gender. In 1838, the Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women refused to exclude black women from its meetings. An antiabolitionist crowd then stormed the building and torched it. Support for abolitionism also led many women to question their legal status as women. A turning point in the relationship between antislavery and women’s rights occurred in 1840 when American reformers Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott attended an international antislavery conference in London. The female delegates were not allowed to speak at the event and were forced to sit behind an opaque screen out of view of the other delegates. Incensed by their treatment in London, Stanton and Mott saw the oppression of women as an evil requiring the same attention as the oppression of slavery. Stanton was born into a prosperous family. Her father was a prominent lawyer who became a state Supreme Court judge. She spent hours reading law books in her father’s office. What most galled Stanton was the English common law doctrine of coverture, which treated a woman as legally dead once married. American law had inherited this concept, which meant that a husband would control any property a woman might have owned before her marriage and all of the wealth gained during their marriage. In 1837, Thomas Herttell introduced a bill into the New York legislature to give married women more control over their property. Eleven years later the legislature passed a landmark married women’s property act that allowed women to retain control of their inherited property. Stanton helped win approval for this law. The law did not give married women full control of any wealth or property they gathered during marriage, but it was an important step forward. The year 1848 was a momentous one in the history of women’s rights. In the same year that New York adopted the married women’s property act, supporters of women’s rights gathered in Seneca Falls, New York, not far from Rochester, for a historic meeting. The organizers of the convention were Stanton and Mott, two veterans of moral reform and abolitionism. About 300 men and women, including noted African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass, assembled in a church for the Seneca Falls Convention, during



 “The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman….” “Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions” of the Seneca Falls, New York, Women’s Rights Convention (1848)

 which a women’s rights manifesto modeled on the Declaration of Independence was drafted. The Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions declared that “all men and women are created equal.” It noted that women were denied economic opportunities, legal rights, and access to education. It also asserted that “it is the duty of women of this country to secure themselves their sacred right to the elective franchise.” Seneca Falls prompted more than two dozen other such meetings in the next 12 years. The ardent abolitionist newspaper founded by Frederick Douglass not only applauded the actions of the convention but also exhorted abolitionists to embrace women’s rights alongside their opposition to slavery. The mainstream press, however, was less sympathetic. One newspaper mistakenly concluded that the Declaration of Sentiments was a parody of the Declaration of Independence, not an attempt to appropriate its language for women. Forty percent of American newspapers printed negative accounts of Seneca Falls, but 29 percent were favorable. Although still opposed by most Americans, women’s rights had become a topic of national conversation for the first time. The Declaration of Sentiments would become a foundational text for all subsequent efforts to promote equal rights for American women. In Stanton’s view the women who gathered in upstate New York in a modest church had instigated “a rebellion such as the world had never seen before.” The women’s rights question caused a major schism in the abolitionist movement. In 1840, delegates to the American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS) debated whether women could hold office in the organization. William Lloyd Garrison, a supporter of women’s rights, outmaneuvered his opponents and emerged victorious on this question. However, abolitionists opposed to linking the cause with women’s rights responded by resigning from the AASS.

 CHAPTER 10

REVIVALISM, REFORM, AND ARTISTIC RENAISSANCE: 1820–1850

Religious and Secular Utopianism
 As many mainstream religious groups preached the necessity of reform and worked to change American society, certain sectarian groups sought a radical transformation of American society. In some cases these groups were attempting to create a heaven on earth, literally preparing the way for Christ’s return. The movement for reform also spawned a variety of different secular utopian movements. Both religious and secular groups engaged in bold forms of social experimentation. Many groups abolished private property and embraced some form of socialist or communist ideals, abandoning the idea of private property. 10.10 Millerite William Miller’s prediction that the millennium would arrive in March 1843 prompted this satirical image of one of his followers preparing for the apocalypse by stocking up on cheese and crackers.

Millennialism, Perfectionism,
 and Religious Utopianism Millennialism, the belief that the millennium was imminent and that Judgment Day would soon follow, attracted many followers in the mid-nineteenth century. Some believers even named the date of Christ’s return to establish

 the millennium. The followers of William Miller, called Millerites, predicted that Christ would return in March 1843. When that prediction failed to come true, Miller prophesied a new date, October 22, 1844. Again the millennium failed to materialize. The movement collapsed soon after the revised prediction also proved false. Indeed, the failure of the Millerites to predict the true date for the millennium inspired humor. This satirical picture of a Millerite depicts a man prepared to lock himself in a trunk together with crackers, cheese, and plenty to drink, emergency provisions which might come in handy in the chaos that would precede the apocalypse before Judgment Day. The sardonic image captures the popular reaction to Miller’s failed predictions (10.10). But aspects of Miller’s teachings survived and were later incorporated into the Seventh Day Adventists, another nineteenthcentury religious sect, one that celebrated Saturday, not Sunday, as their day of worship. The United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing, or Shakers, created a successful religious utopia, establishing settlements across the nation and attracting

RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR UTOPIANISM

 thousands of followers. The Shaker faith was shaped by the teachings of Mother Ann Lee, an eighteenthcentury religious figure who adapted Quaker teachings in light of her own experience and revelations. The wife of an abusive husband whose four children died during infancy, she experienced a revelation that sex itself was the root of human evil. Her followers became known as Shaking Quakers or Shakers because their religious worship involved an ecstatic form of dance that one contemporary described as including “extravagant postures” and “fantastic contortions.” The sect also adopted a strict rule of celibacy. Mother Ann’s vision of Christianity not only transformed ideas about sexuality but also radically recast gender roles. She preached that God was a combination of the masculine and feminine, a radical teaching given the strongly patriarchal character of most Protestant theology in the nineteenth century. Judged by the standards of the day, the Shakers came closer to the idea of equality of the sexes than almost any other group in America. Within the Shaker community, there were only brothers and sisters—neither husbands and wives nor mothers and fathers. Abandoning procreation, the Shakers grew only by taking in orphans and converting new members. The Shakers radically reconfigured the meaning of the family unit, rejecting the ideal of domesticity and marriage itself. (See Competing Visions: Reactions to Shaker Gender Roles.) Shakers not only rejected the values of domesticity and mainstream attitudes toward family life, but they also developed a complex relationship with the growing market economy around them. Thus while Shakers participated in the expanding market economy, they did not internalize its competitive values. Within the Shaker community, there was no private property. Shaker communities practiced a form of Christian communism. To support the community they sold a variety of goods to outsiders. Shaker craftsmen developed a reputation as skilled furniture makers, and Shakers sold agricultural products, including seeds to eager consumers. The Shakers were hardly the only radical religious experiment that rejected the values of the market-place and the traditional ideal of the family. One of the most radical utopian leaders was John Humphrey Noyes. A Yale-educated Congregationalist minister, Noyes took the idea of perfectionism, a doctrine that had evolved from Methodism, in a novel direction. Earlier perfectionists had argued that one could attain a perfect state of holiness.

Read the Document John Noyes on Free Love at Oneida




 That did not mean that a person was completely free from sin, but rather that one had attained the highest level of spiritual perfection consistent with human nature. In 1840, Noyes created the Putney Association, and by 1844, the small group was practicing a form of Christian communism in which, like the Shakers, all property was commonly owned. The association included 37 people who worshiped together in a small chapel, lived in three houses, farmed, and maintained a store. In 1846, Noyes took his theory of perfectionism in a new direction. If one attained a state of religious perfection and could not sin, then he argued one could be free of many laws enacted to deal with humans’ fallen, sinful state. Marriage and monogamy were two such ideals. Noyes’s restructuring of the family and new ideas about sexuality ran afoul of the dominant views of marriage; he was indicted for adultery in Vermont, but fled to upstate New York, to Oneida. There Noyes instituted the practice of “complex marriage,” in which any man or woman who had experienced saving grace was free to engage in sexual relations with any other person of the opposite sex. Given their commitment to free love, birth control became an important concern of the community. Noyes began to preach the necessity of something he called male continence, a primitive form of natural birth control that required that men engage in sex acts without consummating them. His views mirrored those of other nineteenth-century medical reformers such as Sylvester Graham, who believed that it was important for men to conserve their bodily fluids. Eventually the Oneida community embraced a form of eugenics, a theory that advocated using selective mating to produce superior children and thereby improve humanity. At Oneida only the most spiritually perfect were allowed to consummate their sexual unions and produce children. The interior of the Oneida mansion house was organized to facilitate the idea of complex marriage by weakening notions of privacy. The “tent room” on the third floor replaced private rooms with semiprivate enclosures blocked off by cotton cloth. The “tent room” increased the “sociality” of members and reduced the “cold isolation” of traditional apartments. Although the practice of complex marriage was radically different from the celibacy practiced by the Shakers, both groups sought to reconfigure the family, sexuality, and their relationship to the market economy. Although each group

Competing Visions
REACTIONS TO SHAKER GENDER ROLES
The unique religious practices of the Shakers drew many comments. For Americans, nothing was more remarkable than the Shakers’ reconfiguration of traditional gender roles and the family. Travelers, including the English novelist Charles Dickens, home-grown literary figures such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, and a variety of journalists toured Shaker communities and commented on the sect’s unique practices and habitations. In The Shaker Bridal, Nathaniel Hawthorne recounts the plight of two young lovers, Martha and Adam, who give up their chance for earthly love to join the Shakers. Rather than transcend earthly suffering and reach a higher spiritual level, however, her decision to forsake conventional marriage ultimately leaves her despondent and an object of pity. 
 The following account of a visit to New York Shakers in 1829 paints a different portrait of life and love among this utopian community. This visitor did not encounter a repressed and puritanical religion, but something close to a religious utopia. The brothers and sisters, in this view, had traded the suffering of the world for their own vision of heaven on earth:

 “I have bidden you to join your hands,” said he, “not in earthly affection, for ye have cast off its chains forever; but as brother and sister in spiritual love, and helpers of one another in your allotted task. Teach unto others the faith which ye have received”…. The aged Father sank back exhausted, and the surrounding elders deemed, with good reason, that the hour was come when the new heads of the village must enter on their patriarchal duties. In their attention to Father Ephraim, their eyes were turned from Martha Pierson, who grew paler and paler, unnoticed even by Adam Colburn.

 It is impossible to describe the air of tranquility and comfort that diffuses itself over a Shaker settlement. It is no matter what the enemies of such peaceful, unoffending communities may say about them. The acute observer of human manners will testify for them that they do not live after the manner of world…. with the Shakers; the two sexes together bear the burdens, if burden it may be, of celibacy; they enliven its dullness by the amenity of their intercourse with one another…. the union of these people, their uniform kindness to each other, and the singularly benevolent and tender expression of their countenances, speak spea sp eakk a stronger stro st rong nger er language lan langu guag age e than than their the theirir profession. p pro rofe fess ssio ion. n.

 approached the family and sex from different perspectives, both groups embraced communal ownership of property, and, although differing in means, they both also attempted to free women from traditional gender roles. See Choices and Consequences: Mary Cragin’s Experiment in Free Love at Oneida. Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints, or Mormonism, created another model of a religious utopia. Smith grew up in western New York, where the fires of the Great Awakening burned hot. In this evangelical milieu he had a revelation on which Mormonism was based. According to the Book of Mormon, in 1823, an angel steered him to a set of golden tablets written in an ancient language. With divine help Smith deciphered the tablets, which told of the travails of a lost tribe of Israelites who had settled in America and who Mormons believed were the ancestors of Native Americans. The Book of Mormon was published in Palmyra, New York, in 1830, and this town became the site of one of the earliest Mormon communities. The belief that the Indians were actually descendants of a lost tribe of Hebrews was not unique to the Mormons. The theory attracted attention from several prominent religious authors of the time. Smith’s treasure hunting was also not that unusual, spurred on by popular stories about buried treasures gathered by ancient Indian civilizations. Smith was influenced by the widespread belief that the millennium was at hand, bringing with it an end to debt and the return of Christ and a new era of peace, happiness, and prosperity. The revelations detailed by Smith struck a resonant chord with small farmers, tradesmen, and mechanics whose experience with the expanding market economy had been largely negative. Smith’s new revelation attracted thousands of followers. Mormons set up their own community in Kirtland, Ohio, and then a larger community at Nauvoo, Illinois. The Mormons did not go as far as the Shakers or Oneidians in embracing communism, but they had a strong communal economic ethic. Smith’s 1831 law of consecration urged Mormons to deed their land to the church, which would distribute it among the faithful and retain any surplus.

Secular Utopias
 Secular utopia also attracted individuals frustrated with American society. Hostility to the market revolution provided inspiration for a variety of



 socialist utopian communities. Robert Owen’s New Harmony in Indiana was one such ambitious experiment. A successful textile mill owner who began his career in Scotland, Owen was worried about the impact of industrialization on society and hoped to create an ideal community built on a socialist model. Despite early enthusiasm his community lasted only three years. The French theorist Charles Fourier provided a more popular socialist alternative, including a utopian theory of phalanxes, ideal communities organized around socialist ideals, that gained a considerable following in the 1840s. Indeed, between 1841 and 1846, 25 of these phalanxes popped up across New England, New York, and the Midwest. Rather than accept the values of the marketplace, Fourier championed the ideas of “association” and “cooperation.” Individual communities divided the profits produced by agricultural labor or goods manufactured at the phalanx among the members according to a formula that included the amount invested, a person’s skills, and the amount of his or her physical labor. Fourier’s socialist theories also questioned traditional gender roles. In his view social progress occurred in direct “proportion to the advance of women toward liberty.” Women in Fourierist communities enjoyed equal pay and equal opportunities with men and benefited from

 “Under our system of isolated and separate households, with separate interests and separate pursuits, instead of association and combination among families, there is the most deplorable waste, which is one of the primary sources of the general poverty that exists; and discord, antagonism, selfishness, and an anti-social spirit are engendered.” ALBERT BRISBANE (American Fourierist), Concise Exposition of the Doctrine of Association, 1843

 Why did Mormon values appeal to farmers and other small producers in the era of the market revolution?

Choices and Consequences
MARY CRAGIN’S EXPERIMENT IN FREE LOVE AT ONEIDA
Mary Cragin and her husband George were among the many Americans influenced by Charles Grandison Finney’s religious leadership in the Second Great Awakening. George worked for a reform paper in New York, the Advocate of Moral Reform, as an office manager and accountant. He showed his wife a copy of a letter written by John Humphrey Noyes, which introduced Mary to Noyes’s ideas of perfectionism. Mary and her husband were both taken with this doctrine and moved to Vermont. Noyes began his experiment in “communism in love” at Putney. As a member of his first perfectionist community at the Putney, Vermont community, Mary Cragin faced a choice: either leave the community or participate in its bold new experiment in free love. 
Choices




 Persuade her husband to leave the community with her.



 Leave regardless of her husband’s decision.



 Stay with her husband and participate in Noyes’s system of complex marriage.

Decision
 Mary chose option 3, to stay at Putney with her husband and participate in a complex marriage with Noyes and others.

Consequences
 Mary eagerly embraced Noyes’s theory and eventually traveled with her husband and others to Oneida, becoming founding members of that community. In the published comments in the “First Annual Report of Oneida Community Association” (1849), she declared that her life at Oneida brought her closer to God than anything else she had ever done. She died a year later when the boat she was traveling on capsized.

Continuing Controversies
 Why would a nineteenth-century woman be attracted to utopian movements that rejected mainstream views of the family and marriage? Modern scholars are divided over the impact of “Bible Communism” and “complex marriage” on women’s lives. Some argue that compared to the restrictive and oppressive environment most women faced in American society, Oneida provided women with more power, control over their sexual lives, and equality. Although not a feminist utopia, Oneida’s system of complex marriage was liberating in many ways for women. Others view Oneida as just another form of female oppression. The limited choices granted to women did not end male power and authority. At Oneida men continued to dominate women’s lives, controlling their sexual and reproductive choices.

 Why might a woman like Mary Cragin have been drawn to the Oneida Community?

 an egalitarian attitude toward sex that was unusual for its time. As the map (10.11) shows, utopian experiments, both secular and religious, were scattered across the United States. A host of other smaller utopian experiments were also attempted during this period. At Brook Farm, a community in Massachusetts near Boston, manual labor was supplemented by activities to encourage “intellectual improvement” and “social intercourse, calculated to refine and expand” the mind and soul. Nathaniel Hawthorne used his brief residence in the community as the basis for his novel The Blithedale Romance. Like Brook Farm, Bronson Alcott’s utopian community Fruitlands emphasized balancing manual and intellectual labor and communal ownership. But in contrast to Brook Farm,

 dietary restrictions were an important part of this utopia. Fruitland’s members were not only vegetarian but also ate only “aspiring” vegetables—those that grew upward (reaching up for the supreme truths). Potatoes, beets, and carrots, which grew downward, were forbidden. One utopian community tried to tackle the problem of race directly. Francis Wright, a Scottish abolitionist, founded Nashoba, an interracial cooperative near Memphis, Tennessee, to demonstrate the potential for blacks and whites to live together as equals. At Nashoba slaves were to be given a formal education and allowed to earn enough to purchase their freedom. However, Wright’s more radical ideas included the abolition of the nuclear family, religion, and private property. The community lasted only four years.

REVIVALISM, REFORM, AND ARTISTIC RENAISSANCE: 1820–1850

Literature and Popular Culture
 The danger posed by the “tyranny of the majority,” a subject explored in some detail by Alexis de Tocqueville in Democracy in America, attracted the attention of intellectuals and writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, a Harvard-trained minister, who rejected orthodox religion in favor of philosophical exploration. Emerson’s essays, beginning with his manifesto, “The American Scholar,” enjoined Americans to wake up, reject the latest fashions of the marketplace, and discover the deeper philosophical truths to be found in nature and selfreflection. Within two decades of Emerson’s address, Nathaniel Hawthorne published The Scarlet Letter (1850); Herman Melville, Moby-Dick (1851); Henry David Thoreau, Walden (1854); and Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass (1855). The vigorous intellectual and poetic activity of these writers and thinkers constituted a veritable American Renaissance. Some of the best-known works of these literary giants explored the problems of American society in a fictional setting. Although a few literary figures crafted rich and sophisticated works of fiction and poetry, many now forgotten writers marketed their books to the growing mass audience of readers. Many popular works depicted lurid tales of city life, including murder and prostitution. The marketplace also adapted to the intellectual ferment of the era by creating new institutions devoted to presenting to the people lectures by leading intellectuals, including Emerson. In addition to hearing literary figures such as Emerson, one might also learn about the latest intellectual fads, including phrenology, a pseudo-science that purported to enable practitioners to discern a person’s character and intellect from the shape of his or her head. Finally, architects explored a variety of different building styles hoping that improvements in the built environment would lead to moral and spiritual uplift. In some cases, architects turned to the lessons of the past, looking to the styles of antiquity: Greek Temples or Egyptian monuments for inspiration. Those seeking a more exalted and spiritual ideal turned to the medieval period for models. These ideas influenced everything from cemetery design to country farm houses.

Literature and
Social Criticism
 Emerson’s American Scholar address marked the beginning of one of the greatest periods of American literary achievement. Emerson became the leading exponent of the philosophy of Transcendentalism, a loose set of ideas that looked to nature for inspiration and insights. The other leading literary figure associated with this movement was Henry David Thoreau. In his masterpiece Walden, Thoreau decried the impact of the market on American society. Ostensibly a tale of his effort to get back to nature, Walden asserted that “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation…. The greater part of what my neighbors call good I believe in my soul to be bad.” Only by rejecting the numbing conformity of American society, the tyranny of the majority, and the worldly values of the

How did Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Melville
 respond to the market revolution?

 marketplace could Americans rekindle the divine spark in each person. Other American literary figures turned a critical eye to American history and society. Nathaniel Hawthorne parodied the excesses of utopian movements in The Blithedale Romance and explored the Shakers’ views of the family in the “Shaker Bridal” (see Competing Visions: Reactions to Shaker Gender Roles). In The Celestial Railroad, he took aim at the connections between revivalism and the market revolution. In this tale, an updating of the Christian story of the religious pilgrim’s search for salvation, Hawthorne provided his spiritual seeker with a comfortable seat on a railroad coach. Rather than patiently wait until arriving at the heavenly city, the train’s final stop, most of the travelers prefer to exit at “Vanity Fair,” a glittering city that was “an epitome of whatever is brilliant, gay, and

LITERATURE AND POPULAR CULTURE

 fascinating.” Although they failed to achieve salvation, the residents of Vanity Fair were well supplied with clergy, churches, and lecturers on the latest topics of discussion, and the stores sold the most fashionable goods. Herman Melville’s epic novel Moby-Dick told the story of Captain Ahab’s pursuit of a great white whale. A rich and complex novel, Ahab’s quest provided another metaphor for the search for meaning, spiritual fulfillment, and truth by those working within an economic system that increasingly treated people as commodities. As was true for Hawthorne, Melville’s writing grappled with the alienation of Americans resulting from the economic changes wrought by the market revolution. One group Melville discussed was the new expanding middle class of clerks for whom “Ocean reveries” provided an escape from their dreary lives. Melville wrote of these cogs in the great machine of industry, “tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks.” Melville’s own experiences at sea not only provided him with details for his tale of the “Great White Whale” but also allowed him to escape the fate of those clerks trapped at their desks that he chronicled in his writing. Indeed, one of Melville’s most famous literary creations was a lowly and alienated clerk “Bartleby the Scrivener,” a man drained of all creativity and energy who symbolized how commerce could turn individuals into utterly passive victims of larger social and economic forces. Bartleby responds to every request from his employer with the same bored refrain, “I would prefer not to.”

 Susana Warner’s The Wide, Wide World (1850) sold more than 40,000 copies in its first year and was reprinted 67 times. This tale of an orphaned but resourceful child who must find her way in the wider world recast the traditional tale of the Christian pilgrim on the road to salvation in terms of the ideals of middle-class domesticity. By discovering her inner strength, the heroine demonstrates her talents and virtues. After proving her determination and character, she finds a virtuous man whom she weds, thus fulfilling the ideal of domesticity. This general plotline carries through most of the era’s works of sentimental writing and domestic fiction. Domestic fiction mirrored the same cultural values that led to the creation of the first popular board game in American history, “The Mansion of Happiness.” Ann Abbott, the daughter of a Massachusetts minister, invented the game in 1843. Players traveled along a spiral board that led to the “mansion of happiness” at the center. If they landed on such desirable spaces as “temperance,” “piety,” and “chastity,” they could move forward. Landing on a space such as “idleness” sent the player backward. Rather than use dice, which were associated with the evil of gambling, players used a numbered top to determine how many spaces to move on a turn (10.12). The game



10.12 The Mansion of Happiness
 Modern style board games were invented during the period of the market revolution and moral reform to instill values into children. This popular board game embodied many of the ideals of domestic fiction and prints. The game sets players on a journey along a path toward piety in which they must avoid sin if they hope to finally arrive at the Mansion of Happiness.

Domestic Fiction,
Board Games, and
Crime Stories
 Many popular writers of Hawthorne and Melville’s day were women, which prompted Hawthorne to lash out angrily at the “damned mob of scribbling women” whose books often sold in the hundreds of thousands, many more copies than authors of serious fiction such as Hawthorne ever sold. Indeed, women had written the top-five bestsellers by mid-century. Women favored “sentimental writing” and “domestic fiction,” which were immensely popular.

 10.13 First edition of Douglass, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave (1845) The eloquence of Douglass led some to suggest that his account of his own escape from slavery could not have been written by an exslave. To underscore that the book was genuine, an image of Douglass and a copy of his signature are prominently displayed alongside the title page.

REVIVALISM, REFORM, AND ARTISTIC RENAISSANCE: 1820–1850

 shared the ideals of popular prints such as The Way of Good and Evil, which also imagined life as a journey along a path between piety and sin (see page 283). Although domestic fiction and games such as “The Mansion of Happiness” popularized the domestic values esteemed by reformers, there was also a market for stories about the very evils these works advised Americans to avoid lest they wind up in prison or the asylum. The new penny press included a host of papers such as the National Police Gazette and the New York Sun, whose pages were filled with tales of crime and moral depravity. Literature embraced the sordid as much as the spiritual, and crime fiction was especially popular. George Lippard’s The Quaker City, Or, The Monks of Monk Hall: A Romance of Philadelphia Life, Mystery and Crime (1845) spun a lurid tale that explored the evils of urban life. In contrast to Susana Warner, Lippard imbued his tale of seduction, murder, and intrigue with a subtle classconscious critique of the debauched elites who gathered in a dilapidated old mansion, Monk’s Hall, filled with secret passages and murder victims. The one writer who managed to transform such gothic tales of crime and horror into high art was Edgar Allan Poe. In stories such as “The Tell-Tale Heart” and the “Black Cat,” Poe explored the psychological dimensions of crime.

 Why did Douglass need to prove that he was the author of his autobiography?

 His taut, gripping stories were models of literary craftsmanship. Poe brought the techniques of high literature to bear on topics that were usually the province of popular writers.

Slaves Tell Their Story:
Slavery in American
Literature
 While the writers of the American Renaissance were formulating their critique of American society, other voices were also entering the expanding literary marketplace. Accounts published by runaway slaves described the brutality of slavery. The most famous and influential slave autobiography was Frederick Douglass’s Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave published in 1845. More than 30,000 copies sold within a decade of its publication. Douglass awakened Americans to the injustice of slavery by exposing “the cruelties of it as I had myself felt them.” The accuracy of his account was a key element of its appeal, but critics questioned his book’s authenticity. Douglass thus went to great lengths to prove that it was not an abolitionist hoax. Indeed, Douglass worried that his eloquence might itself be used as proof that a former slave could not have written the book. To establish his credibility, Douglass included a daguerreotype image of himself (a forerunner of modern photography), a copy of his signature (a sign of his literacy), and two testimonials swearing that the narrative was indeed authentic (10.13). Harriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl was published under the pen name Linda Brent. Jacobs had escaped to freedom in 1842, but it took almost another two decades for her to improve her writing to the point where she could publish an account of her ordeal under slavery. She described her purpose in writing in forceful terms: “I have not written my experiences in order to attract attention to myself, on the contrary,

LITERATURE AND POPULAR CULTURE

 it would have been more pleasant to me to have been silent about my own history.” Undaunted, she felt compelled to add my testimony to that of abler pens to convince the people of the free states what slavery really is. Jacobs’s account of her life, particularly the firsthand accounts of the sexual predations of white Southerners on black women, exposed the plight of female slaves.

Lyceums and Lectures
 Josiah Holbrook, a teacher and lecturer, began the Lyceum movement in 1826. Named after the place in ancient Athens where the philosopher Aristotle lectured to his pupils, the Lyceum movement provided a forum for public lectures and debates on intellectual issues. By 1834, more than 3,000 Lyceums appeared in towns and cities across America. As transportation improved with the rise of the railroad, the Lyceum movement created a national market for speakers on topics of general interest. An especially popular lecture topic was phrenology, a pseudoscience that focused on the relationship between the bumps and shape of the human head and character and personality. Americans could pay to have their heads analyzed by phrenologists at salons in major cities and towns. By the 1850s, the American Phrenological Journal had a circulation of more than 50,000. Phrenology became an American obsession in the mid-nineteenth century. Phrenological heads made of plaster or

 ceramic were commonplace decorations in many American homes, prompting the Boston Christian Examiner in 1834 to complain that “heads of chalk, inscribed with mystic numbers, disfigured every mantelpiece.” Few of these were as striking as this impressive folk sculpture of a young girl’s head with the different zones of the cranium colored according to phrenological theory (10.14). Phrenology also attracted the notice of many leading public figures such as Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, the moral reformer Horace Mann, and the artist Hiram Powers. Godey’s Lady’s Book even advised women to use hats and other head coverings to hide or accentuate their phrenological character. Phrenology appealed to Americans at a time when the nation was experiencing rapid change. In particular it spoke to the fears of urban Americans who increasingly lived and worked in a world filled with strangers. The new market economy opened up countless opportunities for swindlers and rogues, prompting a new term, “confidence man,” someone who exploited a stranger’s trust to fleece him of his property or money. Although one might dress like a member of the respectable middle class, appearances were often deceiving, and the rise of the “confidence man” was symbolic of the danger posed by the anonymous world of the market. Phrenology promised to allow one to see beyond appearances into a person’s true character and thus past the masks and disguises of “confidence men.”

 This colorful folk sculpture of a young girl’s head included hand-painted zones that phrenologists believed controlled human emotion and behavior.

 Nature’s Nation

 10.15 View from Mt. Holyoke This dramatic Cole landscape not only captures the wild power of nature, a common theme in Cole’s paintings, but it contrasts this untamed natural world with a more placid pastoral world represented by the rich agricultural lands of the Connecticut Valley.

 In honor of the opening of the Erie Canal, a young artist named Thomas Cole staged an exhibition of landscape paintings that became an immediate sensation. Organizers of the show declared that the artist’s work “had equaled those works which have been the boast of Europe.” Cole’s work would “adorn our houses with the American prospects and American skies.” While writers such as Emerson and Thoreau extolled nature in prose, painters such as Cole captured its majesty in color on canvas. The appreciation for nature influenced the design of urban parks and cemeteries. Reform also prompted Americans to embrace architectural styles that would help transform society. Cemetery designers and prison reformers turned to ancient Egypt for inspiration. Architectural reform even influenced phrenologists, who championed the octagon as the perfect housing form.

Landscape Painting
 The artist Thomas Cole became one of America’s most prominent painters. Cole’s landscapes became a symbol of America and its uniqueness. For those eager to defend American culture against its European critics, Cole’s cause became the cause of America.

 What does Cole’s painting reveal about American views of nature?

 An art critic noted that Cole’s work proved that American art need not embrace the artificial beauty depicted in so much European art: “Nature needs no fictitious charms, … the eye requires no borrowed assistance from the memory.” In 1835, in his “Essay on American Scenery,” Cole wrote that “the most distinctive, and perhaps most impressive, characteristic of American scenery is its wilderness.” Many of the themes that would become hallmarks of Cole’s work are evident in his dramatic painting, View from Mt. Holyoke (10.15) Cole contrasts a stormy natural landscape with the more placid panorama of the rich farm lands of the Connecticut River valley. Cole places himself in the midst of the wild mountain landscape nestled between two rock outcroppings to underscore his belief that nature is the true inspiration for artistic creativity.

NATURE’S NATION



 “In this age, when . . . what is sometimes called improvement in its march makes us fear that the bright and tender flowers of the imagination shall all be crushed beneath its iron tramp, it would be well to cultivate the oasis that yet remains to us, and thus preserve the germs of a future and purer system.” THOMAS COLE, Essay on American Scenary (1835–1836)

Parks and Cemeteries
 When Cole and other landscape painters were celebrating nature, America was undergoing one of its first great waves of urbanization. As agriculture became more efficient, Americans from the countryside streamed into the nation’s growing cities. While many urban homes boasted a Currier and Ives print of an idyllic rural setting, a more concrete effort was made to bring nature itself to the city. The creation of urban parks as retreats from the hustle and bustle of city life and a radically new approach to designing cemeteries were two highly visible results of the desire to preserve nature in the midst of rapid urbanization.

 New York’s Central Park (geographically at the center of Manhattan Island, but originally situated at the edge of the city) was the most ambitious and visible effort to bring the country to the city. Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in 1857 and officially opened two years later, Central Park sought to bring a varied country landscape, including meadows, rolling hills, lakes, and woodlands, to urban dwellers. To preserve the calming views, the designers sunk roadways beneath the line of sight of most strollers (10.16). For many upper- and middle-class Protestant reformers, Central Park was intended to help civilize the city’s workers and immigrants. These reformers believed that strolls through the different country

 settings would spiritually uplift those whose lives were degraded by industrial life and whose private lives were confined to the squalid conditions of areas such as Five Points. Championed by New York’s elite and designed with middle-class values in mind, the land for much of the park was acquired by displacing Irish immigrants and destroying one of the city’s most long-established African-American communities. Mount Auburn Cemetery, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just outside of Boston, reflected the new view of cemeteries. Its opening in 1831 attracted 2,000 people who were treated to orations by leading ministers and Supreme Court

 Justice Joseph Story. In contrast to earlier graveyards or burial grounds, designers made the new cemeteries associated with the rural cemetery movement, such as Mount Auburn, places of repose for both the living and the dead. As this painting (10.17) of a couple strolling through the landscaped terrain of Mount Auburn suggests, the “repose and sacred loveliness of natural beauty” made the cemetery a destination for nearby city dwellers who wished to experience the ennobling effects of nature. It soon became a major tourist attraction, with as many as 30,000 visitors per year traveling to Boston to see Mount Auburn. Its success led to the creation of other cemeteries designed to provide urban dwellers with places of reflection and repose. The “rural cemetery movement” inspired an important architectural change. Architects looking for inspiration to represent death found it in ancient Egypt’s pyramids, other monumental structures, and its funeral practices. The image of Mount Auburn shown here (10.17) features one of the most common architectural elements borrowed

Mount Auburn and other cemeteries also included EgyptianRevival entrances that borrowed architectural elements from ancient Egyptian temples, including the giant pylons that framed them. The Egyptian Revival also inspired architects working on other public buildings, mainly those with a grim purpose, including Philadelphia’s debtor’s prison and New Jersey’s state prison. New York City’s prison, officially named “The Halls of Justice,” was nicknamed “the Tombs” because of its forbidding Egyptian-Revival façade.

Revival and Reform in
American Architecture
 Egypt was not the only ancient culture that inspired American architects and designers in the 1830s. Andrew Jackson’s rise to power in 1828 had reflected and facilitated a broad democratization of society (see Chapter 8). The democratization of American life coincided with Greece’s war for independence from the Ottoman Empire that began in 1821. The Greek independence movement seemed analogous to America’s own struggle against Britain. Not surprisingly American culture developed a fascination with Greece, the birthplace of democracy. As a result Greek Revival was a popular style of architecture, interior design, and dress during the 1820s and 1830s. As a contemporary noted, “a perfect mania for the Grecian orders” pervaded American society and required that “every building from the shop of the tradesmen, to the church and the capitol, must be Grecian.” Simple farmhouses were adorned with classical columns and pediments, giving their doorways the appearance of mini-Greek temples. The rage for all things Greek also shaped the way Americans designed and decorated their homes.

 Furniture in this period was fashioned to resemble ancient Greek styles, often including decorative motifs drawn from Greece, such as urns and classical pillars. The obsession with ancient Greece literally transformed the map of the United States. Across America cities and towns sprung up with Greek names; western New York alone, along and near the Erie Canal, saw the appearance of cities named Troy, Ithaca, Utica, and Syracuse. Harriet Martineau, an English novelist who published accounts of her experiences in America, feared that America’s youth would grow up thinking that “Utica, Carthage, Athens, Palmyra, and Troy” were simply names of towns in western New York rather than the great cities of antiquity and the cradles of Western civilization. Ohio and Georgia each had its Athens. Although many Americans embraced Greek Revival, many utopian sects rejected mainstream architectural designs and the furnishings that accompanied them. No group was more self-conscious about the connection between architecture, furnishings, and reform than the Shakers. Shaker buildings were sparsely furnished, and Shaker furniture embodied their ideal of simplicity. The Millennial Law (1823) of the Shakers, a set of rules that governed Shaker communities, prescribed the styles of furniture, including permissible colors, and forbade designs that were “merely for fancy.” The Shakers’s rejection of the dominant styles of the day is evident if one contrasts the furnishing and design of a typical Shaker sitting room and a Greek Revival parlor in a prosperous home (10.18 and 10.19 on page 312). The plush cushioned furniture and intricately carved furniture of the Greek-Revival room contrast with the ascetic style of the Shaker room. Shaker furniture was devoid of ornamentation and highly functional, embodying the ideal of simplicity itself. The power of architecture to transform and uplift individuals inspired reformers to propose using architecture to mold American character and thereby

 reform American society. Two of the most influential architectural reformers were Andrew Jackson Downing and Alexander Jackson Davis, who in the 1840s and 1850s helped popularize the Gothic Revival, which looked to medieval Europe for inspiration. Downing authored two popular works on architecture in the early 1840s that went through 20 editions. Downing believed that a properly designed home should serve as a spiritual sanctuary from the commercial world of the market. His Gothic Revival homes, which incorporated medieval architectural elements, such as pointed arches, were meant to uplift those who dwelled in them and inspire those who saw them by literally guiding their gaze toward heaven. The Gothic Revival also drew on renewed interest in nature that had inspired painters such as Thomas Cole and the designers of Mount Auburn Cemetery. Rather than embrace the regularity and balance of Greek classicism, enthusiasts for Gothic Revival championed a more organic and variegated style that mimicked the irregularities of nature. At one level the Gothic Revival was part of the larger reaction against the excesses of Jacksonian democracy. Its leading champions, such as Downing and Davis, also rejected the democratic values of the Greek Revival, believing that architecture should underscore social position, not seek to erase it. Davis believed that housing ought to announce one’s

 status: villas for the upper classes, cottages for the middle class, and farmhouses for the working classes. He helped plan the nation’s first suburbs, including Llewellyn Park in Orange, New Jersey. Lyndhurst in Tarrytown, New York, was an opulent Gothic Revival villa. Compared to the symmetry of Greek Revival buildings, the irregular roofline and different shaped windows of Lyndhurst evoked the unpredictability of nature (10.20). The popular phrenologist Orson S. Fowler championed octagon-shaped houses as a cure for America’s social ills (10.21). Building on his phrenological theories, Fowler attacked box-like homes and argued that by more closely approximating a circle, the octagon encouraged harmony. Although most of these houses were built in the Northeast, octagon houses dotted the American landscape from Watertown, Wisconsin, to Natchez, Mississippi. Unlike reformers who feared progress and believed that the expansion of the market threatened American values, Fowler believed that the march of civilization was inevitable. Americans needed to accept acquisitiveness as crucial to the marketplace, while tempering it with insights gained from new areas of knowledge, such as phrenology. The octagon house, he believed, would serve both goals admirably well. The octagon fad dissipated when phrenology’s pseudoscientific doctrines were discredited.

Review Questions
 1. What values associated with the Second Great Awakening contributed to the success of the market revolution?

 4. What was phrenology? 5. How did architecture reflect the ideals of social reformers in the mid-nineteenth century?

 2. What was the cult of true womanhood? How did this ideal fit into the new notion of domesticity? 3. What role did the family play in the utopian worlds created by the Shakers, Oneidians, and Mormons? How were the reform efforts of these movements a response to social and economic conditions?

Key Terms
 Temperance A reform movement that developed in response to concern over the rising levels of alcohol consumption in America society. Penitentiary A new reform-based model of incarceration that isolated individuals from one another and gave them a chance to repent and reform. This method was a radical departure from earlier approaches to crime, which cast behavior in terms of sinfulness, innate depravity, and punishment. Immediatism Abolitionist doctrine that rejected gradualism and advocated an immediate end to slavery. Gag rule A procedural motion that required that the House of Representatives automatically table antislavery petitions and not consider them. “Peculiar institution” A term that John C. Calhoun coined to describe Southern slavery. In Calhoun’s view slavery was not “an evil” or a cause of shame but rather “a good—a positive good” to be championed.

 “Cult of true womanhood” A set of beliefs in which women’s values were defined in opposition to the aggressive and competitive values of the marketplace. Seneca Falls Convention A convention of women’s rights supporters, held in Seneca Falls, New York, whose resolves emphatically declared that “all men and women are created equal.” Complex marriage A system developed by John Humphrey Noyes’s followers at Oneida, where any man or women who had experienced saving grace was free to engage in sexual relations with any other person. Transcendentalism A loose set of philosophical and literary ideas focused on the spiritual power of the individual. Transcendentalists looked to nature for inspiration and philosophical insights.

“To Overspread
 the Continent” Westward Expansion and Political Conflict, 1840–1848 Richard Caton Woodville’s painting, War News from Mexico (1848), captures the excitement generated by the Mexican War, the first conflict in which news traveled almost instantaneously by telegraph from the frontlines back to Americans. Woodville’s painting shows a group of white men standing on the front porch of the “American Hotel,” a symbol of the American nation. The central figure reads the latest headlines from the war front. The expressions on the men’s faces range from astonishment to concern, suggesting the diversity of opinions about the war. A white woman looking out from a window is safely inside the “American Hotel,” part of the same nation as the white men but not an active participant in their political discussion on the porch. Woodville’s painting also shows those excluded from power: A black man sits on the lowest step, and an African-American girl stands outside the building. The war had profound consequences for the issue of slavery. By facilitating westward expansion and bringing new lands into American possession, the Mexican war complicated American politics by making slavery a central issue in national life. By 1840, all the land east of the Mississippi (except the territories of Florida and Wisconsin) had been organized into new states, but Americans remained hungry for land. Many had come to believe that America was destined to conquer and settle the entire North American continent, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. As a result tens of thousands of Americans migrated west in search of land and opportunity. Some went along the Overland Trail to the Pacific Northwest; others came with the large Mormon migration to the Great Salt Lake. The American defeat of Mexico dramatically increased the nation’s size. The United States incorporated a huge swath of new territory, from Texas to California. The war also exacerbated the divisions between Democrats and Whigs and intensified the conflict between abolitionists and proslavery forces.

Manifest Destiny and Changing
Visions of the West


11.1 The Trapper
 and His Family Artist Charles Deas offers a glimpse into the world of the trapper in this watercolor image. The canoe represents the multicultural world created by trappers in miniature.

 During the early nineteenth century, American fur traders had engaged in a lucrative trade with Western Indian tribes. The interactions between the traders and Indians created a “middle ground” (see Chapter 3), in which trade and cultural interaction prospered. By the early 1830s, however, this distinctive multiracial society was in decline. The fur trade declined as over-trapping decimated beaver populations and as changing tastes made consumers less eager to purchase furs. By the mid-1840s, the world of the fur trappers was gone. Americans began viewing the West as a region that had to be incorporated into an expanding democratic nation. Additional land would help preserve the ideal of a yeoman republic of honest and independent farmers that would now stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Americans embraced westward expansion as both their destiny and a practical necessity given the nation’s growing population. The rights of the indigenous Indian tribes of these regions mattered little to the champions of westward expansion. Even many sympathetic to Indian civilizations believed they were doomed to extinction. The conquest and settlement of the West became an important theme for artists who helped portray the West for those Americans who did not make the trek westward. Many artists memorialized an ideal version of western expansion, helping to forge important American myths about intrepid pioneers taming a frontier wilderness.

 The Trapper’s World During the colonial era French and British traders depended on Indians to trap or help them trap fur-bearing animals. American fur traders gradually gained control over this lucrative trade, and by the

 1820s, they were the dominant fur traders. The key figures in the trade, the trappers, or “mountain men,” played an indispensable role in the early exploration and settlement of the West. Between 1822 and 1840, at least 3,000 white trappers and traders entered this region. In this painting of a trapper and his family, Charles Deas captures the multicultural world inhabited by the trappers. In the canoe the trapper, his Indian wife, and his mixed-race children work together to navigate the river (11.1). The economic hub of the fur trade was the yearly rendezvous, a gathering held in the Rocky Mountains in which Indians and mountain men came to exchange pelts for goods offered by traders. With alcohol pouring freely, gambling aplenty, and a relaxed attitude toward sex among the participants, the rendezvous, which could attract as many as 1,000 participants, was a carnival-like, often riotous affair.

 “[is] to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.” Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri echoed O’Sullivan’s vision of America’s future, explicitly framing it in both racial and religious terms: “The White race alone received the divine command, to subdue and replenish the earth! Civilization or extinction has been the fate of all people who have found themselves in the track of the advancing Whites.” Manifest Destiny combined the language of Jacksonian democracy, stressing opportunity for all white Americans, with a Protestant millennial vision that defined the nation’s future in terms of the progress of “civilization” and the triumph of Christianity over “savagery.” Few believed there was room for Native Americans in this vision of geographical expansion and white man’s democracy. Even before O’Sullivan and Benton voiced the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, word of the lush agricultural lands of Oregon had reached east by the early 1840s. The economic dislocations caused by the Panic of 1837 (see Chapter 8) and the absence of cheap land suitable for agriculture in the East and Midwest also sparked interest in western migration. Propagandists embellished their accounts of the West’s riches to help attract potential migrants to the fertile lands of Oregon. Some rhapsodic descriptions of Oregon went beyond mere exaggeration, conjuring up an image of an almost magical place in which “the pigs … [were] already cooked, with knives and forks sticking in them so that you can cut off a slice whenever you are hungry!” Drawn by these promises many joined an 1843 expedition known as the Great Migration. This 2,000-mile trek along the Overland Trail (11.2) consisted of more than 100 wagons and helped pave the way

 What were the most important ideas associated with Manifest Destiny?

 for subsequent waves of migrants. This trail soon became the main route taken by American settlers traveling from the East and Midwest to Oregon, California, and Utah. By 1845, at least 5,000 settlers had made the arduous five- to six-month-long overland journey to Oregon territory. Migration westward placed an especially heavy burden on women, whose husbands seldom consulted with them before deciding to move. Estimates are that two-thirds of women opposed the idea of relocating to the West. Mary Richardson Walker, the wife of a Protestant missionary who headed to a settlement on the Walla Walla River in what is now Washington, vented her frustration in her diary: “I find it difficult to keep up a usual degree of cheerfulness, If I were to yield to inclination I should cry half my time.” Giving up friends and family and dealing not only with their normal responsibilities of cooking, cleaning, and childcare but also the added burdens of a long and perilous journey made the prospect of moving West terrifying. During the move many women were expected to take on traditional male jobs, such as repairing wagons or helping to construct bridges, while carrying on their traditional roles as mothers and wives. In effect the workload of most women doubled during the move westward. Few Americans, male or female, were aware of this grim reality. Indeed, their impressions of the West continued to be shaped by writers, speakers, and the many artists who traveled with the migrants and painted scenes that reflected the rosy vision of Manifest Destiny. This mythic image of the West influenced artists working almost a generation later and is beautifully captured by Albert Bierstadt in his 1859 painting, Emigrants Crossing the Plains (11.3).

MANIFEST DESTINY AND CHANGING VISIONS OF THE WEST

 Bierstadt depicts settlers pausing on their westward journey to allow their livestock to graze and drink. Above them rises a stunning Western landscape; in the foreground Bierstadt places the skeleton of a buffalo. These bones, like the Indian village barely visible in the distance, represent the West’s past, whereas the settlers symbolize its future. The sun’s location in the Western sky evokes God’s blessing and the optimistic vision of Manifest Destiny—a symbol of both the settler’s and the nation’s bright future.

The Native American
 Encounter with Manifest Destiny One danger associated with western migration that figured prominently in representations of the West, both in paintings and sensational newspaper accounts, was the threat of attack by hostile Indians. Even though such attacks were relatively rare, these representations of Indians dominated popular culture. Again, American artists helped spread a popular vision of the West. Charles Wimar’s 1856 painting, Attack on Emigrant Train (11.4), casts the Indians as bloodthirsty savages and accentuates the horror of the emigrants trying to fend off the attack. This painting became a model for later images of Indians and was even used a century later by Hollywood directors as a model for Western fight scenes between Indians and settlers. Americans had been prepared for such a view of Indians by a long tradition stretch-

 “The North Americans will spread out far beyond their present bounds. They will encroach again and again upon their neighbors. New territories will be planted, declare their independence, and be annexed.” DeBow’s Commercial Review, 1848 ing back to the earliest European representations of the New World (see Chapter 1)and rendered in paintings such as The Death of Jane McCrea (see Chapter 4) and in popular literature by Crockett’s Almanac (see Chapter 8). Wimar’s painting reflected one of two radically different visions of Native Americans that were deeply rooted in American culture. From the beginning of European contact with the Americas, Indians had been depicted as either bloodthirsty savages or noble savages (see Chapter 1). The image of the noble Indian chief had been propagated by artists, such as Benjamin West in The Death of General Wolfe (see Chapter 3). Artist George Catlin borrowed from this tradition when he set out to capture the culture of Western Indians. After traveling throughout the West and living among tribes in the 1830s, Catlin organized a popular traveling exhibit of his paintings and the Indian artifacts he had gathered. Acutely aware that American expansion would likely destroy many of the Native American

 societies of the West, Catlin believed that he had a responsibility to preserve a visual record of Indian culture. These themes are discussed in Images as History: George Catlin and Mah-to-toh-pa: Representing Indians for an American Audience. A few Americans rejected both the image of the Native American as a barbaric savage who ought to be exterminated and the noble savage tragically doomed to extinction. Whig and Protestant reformers expressed sympathy for Native Americans and opposed the relocation of Eastern tribes (see Chapter 8). They also opposed the racist and expansionist vision of Manifest Destiny articulated by O’Sullivan and Benton. William Ellery Channing, a Boston minister and reformer, attacked the arrogance and shortsightedness of Manifest Destiny: “We are destined (that is the word) to overspread North America; and, intoxicated with the idea, it matters little to us how we accomplish our fate.” For Channing and like-minded reformers, expansion was not an unqualified good to be obtained at any cost, but something that demanded that Americans act honestly and respectfully to Indians and do their utmost to protect them. Yet, despite the qualms of reformers American demand for Western land was insatiable. The pressure to make more Indian land available for settlement only grew as Americans streamed westward. Following the policy that had been adopted with Eastern tribes, such as the Cherokee (see Chapter 8), the federal government forced Midwestern tribes in Iowa, including the Sauk and Fox, to relocate to the Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska, after their defeat in the Black Hawk War of 1832. By the early 1840s, the massive relocation of American Indians was nearly complete. One of the few tribes to successfully resist removal, at least temporarily, was the Seminole in Florida. The American army fought a long and costly war to force the tribe to relocate. From 1835–1842, the Seminoles fought off American forces. In the end, the American government spent ten times the amount of money allocated for all of Indian removal to relocate the Seminole. While Americans in this era generated many descriptions of westward expansion, relatively little material exists written from the Indian perspective. One rare and outstanding exception is the memoir of Sarah Winnemucca, a Paiute Indian from Nevada who became a champion of the rights of indigenous peoples (see 15.16). Her memoir recounts the full range of experiences with whites, from interactions with “good white people” who traded fairly with

 her family and her people to traumatic encounters with hostile settlers. In one of the more harrowing episodes, she describes an occasion when a band of white men appeared while the village men were away hunting. Winnemucca’s mother and the other women feared that the whites intended to kidnap or sexually assault their children, so she and the other women hid them, burying them in mud and covering their faces with brush. Winnemucca described her anguish— “heart throbbing and not daring to breathe”—as she lay hidden “all day” till the hostile visitors left.

The Mormon Flight to Utah
 Most western migrants went in search of economic opportunities. The members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints were an exception to this rule. Joseph Smith founded this sect, whose members were popularly known as Mormons, in New York in the early 1830s (see Chapter 10). Smith and his followers had been the victims of violent persecution wherever they settled in the East and Midwest, so the West appealed to them as a potential refuge from such hostility. The Mormon trek westward was the largest organized migration in American history. Prior to their exodus the Mormons endured a long period of internal dissension and harassment by their non-Mormon neighbors. After leaving New York, Joseph Smith established Mormon communities in Ohio and Missouri. In Ohio the Mormons experimented with communal economic arrangements. The Mormon doctrine of “consecration and stewardship” required individuals to deed their property to the church, which then provided an allotment of land whose size was tied to the size of the family unit. Mormons also created cooperative agricultural enterprises, pooling their resources and labor. (For additional discussion of the communal dimensions of Mormonism, see Chapter 10.) Non-Mormons resented the economic advantages such cooperation brought to Mormon farmers and businesses. As tensions between Mormons and nonMormons rose, Smith moved most of his followers to Nauvoo, Illinois, on the Mississippi River. The fastestgrowing town in the Midwest in the 1840s, surpassing even Chicago, Nauvoo was a boomtown shaped by a distinctive religious vision. By the end of the 1840s, the Mormon population of this booming city had soared to over 10,000. The Mormon system of tithing (required donations to the church) enabled the church to buy land and build a monumental temple

GEORGE CATLIN AND MAH-TO-TOH-PA: REPRESENTING INDIANS FOR AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE
Through his paintings of Western Indians, George Catlin sought to preserve a visual record of their culture and accomplishments. He also felt obliged to portray these “doomed” peoples in a noble light. Capturing the nobility of Indians required representing them in a way that would evoke sympathy and respect from his American audience. One of the many Indians Catlin painted during his years in the West was the Mandan chief Mah-totoh-pa, also known as “Four Bears.” In his diary Catlin noted that the chief wanted to be painted in a manner that reflected the Mandan notions of beauty and masculinity. Both were closely tied to the ideal of the warrior. Accordingly Mah-to-toh-pa dressed for the painting in all the trappings of a warrior chief. Catlin noted in his journal, “His dress … was complete in all its parts, and consisted of a shirt or tunic, leggings, moccasins, head-dress, necklace, shield, bow and

 quiver, lance, tobacco-sack, and pipe; robe, belt, and knife; medicine-bag, tomahawk, and war-club.” Yet Catlin omitted most of these items, believing that they distracted from the chiefs “grace and simplicity.” The notions of beauty that shaped Catlin’s artistic decisions stretched back to antiquity and were different from those of the Mandan chief. In essence Catlin painted his subject as if he were a frontier Cincinnatus, an Indian George Washington (see Chapter Five). The resulting painting was an idealized version of how an Indian chief ought to appear to an American audience, not a representation of how a specific Indian chief wished the American people to see him. How did Catlin represent his Indian subject to his American audience? What does this tell us about American attitudes toward Indians in the early nineteenth century?

11.5 The Nauvoo

 The Mormon temple at Nauvoo stood on the highest point of land in the new town and towered over the surrounding landscape. Its architecture includes Greek Revival elements, Masonic symbolism, and ideas inspired by Mormon theology.

 in Nauvoo. As this contemporary image shows, the temple (11.5) dominated the landscape around it. As Smith and his followers faced increasing hostility from their non-Mormon neighbors, the church also encountered internal dissent. When dissident Mormons founded an anti-Smith paper in Nauvoo, Smith, who was also the mayor of Nauvoo, ordered the city marshal and Nauvoo militia to shut down the paper and destroy its printing press. The governor of Illinois then ordered the state militia to seize Smith and bring him to Carthage, Illinois, for trial. While awaiting trial, an angry crowd burst into Smith’s jail cell and shot him to death. Smith’s successor, Brigham Young, decided to move the entire Mormon community to the West, beyond the reach of the church’s critics. Some 16,000 Mormons eventually migrated to the Salt Lake Valley of what is now Utah. Young’s organizational skills and an almost military discipline among his people helped them negotiate the difficult journey. It also helped the Mormons survive and in their new environment. During the first years of settlement, when food rationing became necessary, Young confiscated

 food surpluses and distributed them to those in need. Mormon communalism again helped the community through a difficult time. Over time, the Mormons built an economic and religious community that combined communalism and private enterprise. Safely ensconced in the Great Salt Lake Basin, far beyond the control of the federal government, they also began openly to practice polygamy, the practice of men taking more than one wife. Brigham Young himself took over 20 wives. Polygamy shocked Americans, particularly in an era when the dominant culture venerated the conventional nuclear family and the cult of true womanhood (see Chapter 10). In remaking the conventional idea of the family, the Mormons resembled the Shakers and Oneida perfectionists, two other religious movement of the day that experimented with different models of the family and sexual practices (see Chapter 10). Mormon law required men to provide for their wives and children, which meant that most could not afford polygamy. Although the Mormon economic and religious elite practiced it, most Mormons were monogamous.

AMERICAN EXPANSIONISM INTO THE SOUTHWEST



 American Expansionism into the Southwest To stabilize and secure its territories that bordered the United States, Mexico adopted policies that transformed its northern provinces in the West and Texas. Changes were made in the way Indians were treated under the old colonial system in California and New Mexico, and Mexico opened Texas to American settlers in the 1820s. But the Americans in Texas became a source of discord for Mexico. Committed to slavery and reluctant to adopt Mexican ways, the Americans fomented an uprising of settlers that created the Republic of Texas. Despite opposition from abolitionists and some Whigs, the United States eventually annexed Texas. Rather than mark the end of expansionist sentiments, the annexation only whetted the appetite of proponents of expansionism. In 1846, the United States declared war on Mexico. The war proved unpopular with some Americans but nonetheless resulted in an American victory and seizure of northern Mexico, vastly increasing the size of the United States.

The Transformation
 of Northern Mexico Until 1800, Spain still controlled a huge swath of North America, a holding acquired in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries (see Chapter 1) and constituting all of present-day Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California and parts of Nevada, Colorado, and Utah. The Spanish had invested most of their resources in mineral-rich areas of Peru and Mexico and the sugar islands of the Caribbean (see Chapter 2), and had neglected this northern region of their colonial empire. But by the mid-eighteenth century, the Spanish had begun to organize California into four coastal presidios (forts) at San Diego, Santa Barbara, Monterey, and San Francisco. These administrative and military jurisdictions included 21 Catholic missions run by Franciscans and extending as far north as Sonoma, California. Under this mission system thousands of Native Americans were forced to convert to Catholicism and labor for the Spanish. Held in an oppressive condition little better than slavery, they herded livestock, tended crops, and worked as skilled and unskilled laborers. Indeed, the Russian artist and explorer Louis Choris painted this view (11.6) of the Presidio of San Francisco in 1816. This image, showing Indian laborers being herded at the point of a lance by a mounted Spaniard, illustrates Choris’s belief that the Spanish treated Indians like cattle.

 When Mexico declared its independence from Spain in 1821, the economy, politics, and social structure of this region began to change. Apart from achieving internal political stability, one of the new nation’s chief concerns was securing its northern border with the United States. Mexico’s northern borderlands were underpopulated and controlled by the Comanches and Apaches. The introduction of horses and guns to the region transformed the Comanche and Apache tribes: Both tribes proved extremely adept at the use of both guns and horses and as a result they gained almost complete control of the area between Mexico City and its northern provinces. America’s westward expansion also threatened Mexico’s control of its distant provinces. Mindful of these threats Mexican officials took steps to gain greater control of the region. To speed economic development in California, Mexico abolished the mission system and released Indians from their dependent status as bound laborers. To replace the mission system, they adopted the ranchero system in California and New Mexico. Huge tracts of former mission-owned land came into the possession of a relatively few families, and poorly paid Indians performed much of the labor. In Texas, to encourage population growth and economic development, the Mexican government in 1824 offered land grants to American settlers who agreed to become Catholics and learn Spanish. By 1830 there were, almost 7,000 American Texans to 4,000 Hispanic Texans, who were known as Tejanos. The

 American settlers were an economic boon to the region. Texans exported an estimated $500,000 worth of goods to New Orleans, mainly cotton and cattle. Additional trade networks developed elsewhere along the Mexican-American border. In California, New England merchants sought seal and sea otter pelts to sell in China. In 1821, American traders established a trade route from Missouri to Santa Fe. Far safer and less rugged than the nearly 1,700-mile journey to Mexico City, the Santa Fe Trail became a thriving trade route. American traders, whose profits on the sale of goods ranging from cloth to

 manufactured items such as umbrellas sometimes reached 40 percent, were often paid in hard currency. Indeed, trade with Santa Fe became so crucial that the Mexican silver peso became the unofficial unit of exchange for much of the western United States.

The Clash of
Interests in Texas
 Although Mexico benefited from the increased trade with the United States, the presence of so many American settlers in Texas worried Mexican officials. Three issues were particularly troubling. First, the Americans flouted the laws requiring they learn Spanish and convert to Catholicism. Second, they brought thousands of slaves into Texas at a time when Mexico was heading toward the abolition of slavery (a goal it achieved in 1829). Third, many American settlers did little to conceal their interest in joining the United States. A small uprising in 1826 of Americans hoping to secede was easily crushed by the Mexican army. The Mexican government reacted by banning further immigration from the United States. Still Americans came, and Mexico lifted the ban in 1833. Before long there were 30,000 Americans in Texas.

AMERICAN EXPANSIONISM INTO THE SOUTHWEST

 A well-organized effort to separate from Mexico occurred in 1834. This time Americans took advantage of the instability of Mexican politics. In 1834, Mexican General Antonio López de Santa Anna staged a coup and assumed dictatorial powers. When American settlers in Texas revolted, demanding a restoration of the constitution, Santa Anna decided to crush the rebellion. The ensuing war between Santa Anna’s forces and the American Texans was brutal. One of the bloodiest battles occurred in early 1836 near San Antonio at the Alamo, an old Spanish mission defended by a small force of Texans, including legendary frontiersman and politician Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie (for whom the Bowie Knife was named). Historians continue to argue over the exact death toll, but few dispute that the fighting was fierce and many died that day. Images such as this woodcut of Crockett’s death inspired Americans, whose battle cry for the rest of the war against Mexico became “Remember the Alamo” (11.7). Even as Santa Anna’s forces assaulted the Alamo, American Texans declared independence from Mexico (March 2, 1836) and drafted a new constitution.



 Meanwhile his victory at the Alamo convinced Santa Anna that the Texas forces were no match for his army. Overconfident he recklessly divided his troops, leading to his defeat and capture at the Battle of San Jacinto by the Texans under Sam Houston.

The Republic of Texas and
 the Politics of Annexation The citizens of the now independent Republic of Texas expected the United States to act quickly and annex Texas into the expanding American Republic. They would have to wait nearly a decade, however, as annexation proved to be a divisive issue in American politics. Opponents of slavery feared annexation would upset the delicate balance between free and slave states. Conversely Southerners and others who favored slavery supported Texas annexation. Heated debate in 1836 and 1837 died down as both the Democrats and Whigs sought to avoid the Texas issue. For the moment the economic problems associated with the Panic of 1837 (see Chapter 8) preoccupied Americans.

11.8 Texas Coming In
 In this political cartoon Polk welcomes Texas, while Whigs including Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, vainly try to hold back the Lone Star Republic from joining the Union. The Whigs are dragged into the “Salt River” a contemporary political term synonymous with a political dead end, oblivion, or an insurmountable obstacle.

 Texas annexation reemerged as a major political issue in 1844, reviving sectional tensions over slavery and western expansion. It started when President John Tyler, a proslavery Whig, began touting his support for annexation to gain the support of Southern Whigs and secure the party’s presidential nomination. His strategy backfired, however, when many Whigs opposed his plans for Texas annexation, viewing it as a thinly veiled effort to expand slavery into the West. Tyler’s proslavery stance cost him the nomination when the Whigs, seeking to avoid the controversy, chose Henry Clay, perhaps the best-known Whig politician in America, as their candidate. The Democrats were also shaken by the annexation and slavery issues. Although Martin Van Buren was the leading figure in the Democratic Party, Southerners opposed him because of his abolitionist leanings. After nine ballots the Democrats finally settled on a proslavery Southerner, James K. Polk, as their candidate. Polk favored annexation of Texas. In this political cartoon from the election of 1844 (11.8), the Whigs, led by Henry Clay, attempt to hold back Texas from entering the Union. James K.

 the Union. Texans Stephen Austin (left) and Sam Houston (right) each wave the Lone Star flag of the Texas Republic. Polk’s expansionist agenda appealed to Southerners and Northerners who hoped that westward expansion would mean more land for agriculture. Polk’s strong stance on annexation rattled the Whigs, including Clay, who feared the Democratic Party’s aggressive stance on Texas was popular enough to give it an electoral victory. Clay equivocated about opposing annexation, and his flip-flop alienated many antislavery Whigs in the North. A small third party, the newly formed Liberty Party, adopted a staunchly antislavery, anti-annexation stance and captured 62,000 votes, enough, some scholars argue, to rob Henry Clay of electoral victories in New York and Michigan, thereby handing Polk the presidency in 1844. Emboldened by Polk’s victory, Tyler, the sitting president, secured Texas annexation by a joint resolution of both Houses of Congress, which allowed him to bypass the constitutional requirement that treaties be approved by a twothirds majority in the Senate; Tyler could have never mustered enough votes to approve a treaty of annexation. This tactic bypassed the constitutional roadblock preventing the acquisition of Texas. Opponents of slavery viewed his actions as yet another example of the unscrupulous nature of proslavery forces. In 1845, Texas entered the Union as a slave state.

 Polk’s Expansionist Vision A Tennessee lawyer and a protégé of Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk earned the nickname “Young Hickory,” a reference to his mentor Andrew Jackson’s reputation as “Old Hickory” (see Chapter 8). Polk shared Jackson’s view of the importance of a strong executive and his belief in the necessity and inevitability of western expansion. He also shared Jackson’s racial views, which

 included support for American forces slavery and disregard Mexican forces for Native American American victory rights. Indeed, former Mexican victory President John Quincy Adams, who had become a prominent Whig congressman, denounced Polk as a “slave-holding exterminator of Indians.” Polk wasted little time in acting on his expansionist vision. Polk first moved to acquire Oregon, an area that the United States and Britain had been wrangling over for decades. Polk had campaigned on the slogan, “Fifty-four Forty or Fight,” a reference to the U.S. demand that the geographical boundary separating Oregon from British Canada be fixed at the latitude 54° 40ʹ. Ultimately Polk agreed to a border further south that extended across the 49th parallel. This shrewd compromise secured the most valuable agricultural lands sought by American settlers. The Oregon settlement in 1846 enabled Polk to focus his attention on Mexico. As the ardently pro-expansion Democratic paper The New York Herald noted, “We can now thrash Mexico into decency at our leisure.” The annexation of Texas in 1845 had left open the question of the exact boundary between the United States and Mexico. Polk sent John Slidell, a lawyer and Democratic politician, to Mexico to settle the boundary question and debts that Mexicans owed to Americans. Slidell was also instructed to

 inquire about buying California and New Mexico. This aggressive negotiating posture reflected Polk’s expansionist desires. He and his advisors feared that Mexico might pay off part of its debts by ceding California to Britain, America’s chief commercial rival. By being so belligerent, Polk ensured that the negotiations would fail. Still angry over the loss of Texas, Mexicans were not interested in losing any further land. The specific issue dividing the United States and Mexico was the exact boundary between Texas and Mexico. The Mexican government claimed the southern boundary of Texas was the Nueces River, not the Rio Grande as the United States maintained (11.9). The Rio Grande would give Texas more territory at the expense of Mexico. Polk dispatched American troops under General Zachary Taylor into the disputed zone between the two rivers. When a small group of Mexican forces attacked Taylor’s troops on April 25, 1846, Polk informed Congress that “Mexico has passed the boundary of the United States, and shed American blood on American soil.” Congress formally declared war on Mexico on May 13.

 CHAPTER 11

OVERSPREAD THE CONTINENT”: WESTWARD EXPANSION AND POLITICAL CONFLICT, 1840–1848

The Mexican War and
Its Consequences
 The Mexican-American War lasted only two years and ended in a resounding victory for the United States. America now controlled most of northern Mexico. Although supporters of Manifest Destiny had seen geographic expansion as a panacea for the nation’s economic and social problems, few could foresee how the defeat of Mexico and acquisition of new lands would usher in more intense political conflict. The debate over whether to allow slavery in the territories gained from Mexico would strain the two-party system, splitting Whigs and Democrats into Northern and Southern wings. A third party, the Free-Soil Party, emerged during this period committed to blocking the spread of slavery.

A
Controversial War  The Mexican War divided Americans along sectional lines and split both the Democratic and Whig parties. Southern Whigs supported Polk’s efforts. “Every battle fought in Mexico,” one South Carolina paper averred, “insures the acquisition of territory which must widen the field of Southern enterprise and power in the future.” Northern Whigs, in contrast, denounced the war as an unjust conflict manufactured by Polk to secure California and New Mexico. “This war is waged against an unoffending people, without just or adequate cause,” argued one outraged Whig, “for the purposes of conquest; with the design to extend slavery.” Northern abolitionists denounced “Mr. Polk’s War.” William Lloyd Garrison went so far as to welcome “the overwhelming defeat of the American troops, and the success of the injured Mexicans.” The most profound critique of the war came from the transcendentalist philosopher Henry David Thoreau (see Chapter 10), who defended the ideal of peaceful opposition by citizens to unjust government action. See Choices and Consequences: Henry David Thoreau and Civil Disobedience. The Mexican War was the first conflict America fought primarily on foreign soil. It was also the most logistically complex war in the nation’s brief history, involving multiple fronts, long supply lines, and the coordination of ground and amphibious assaults. The Mexican War also produced two of the greatest generals in American history, Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. Taylor was the common soldier’s general, a man without pretensions whose reputation for bravery earned him the nickname among

 his troops, “Old Rough and Ready.” Scott was in many respects the opposite of Taylor. A brilliant tactician and strategist, “Old Fuss and Feathers” was arrogant and fond of pomp and ceremony. The Mexican War also provided a proving ground for a host of military leaders who later became important generals of the Civil War era, including Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, George McClellan, George G. Meade, and P. G. T. Beauregard. The United States had clear military superiority over Mexico. American forces under Zachary Taylor scored an early victory in May 1846 at the battle of Palo Alto (11.9). General Stephen Kearny then opened a second front by marching from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to Santa Fe and then on to California, where he joined up with an army under Captain John C. Fremont. Fremont had already paved the way for the conquest of California by instigating a rebellion against Mexican authority there known as the “bear-flag revolt” for the grizzly bear emblem that decorated the rebel flag. Scott’s successful amphibious assault at the port of Vera Cruz led to an assault on Mexico City. After five more months of fierce fighting, Scott captured the Mexican capital on May 1, 1847. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the war (1848). It settled the border dispute between Texas and Mexico and ceded to the United States a vast swath of new territory in the Southwest—over 500,000 square miles—comprising present-day California, New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Texas, Utah, Colorado, and Nevada. The United States had seized 55 percent of Mexico’s territory.

THE MEXICAN WAR AND ITS CONSEQUENCES



Choices and Consequences
HENRY DAVID THOREAU AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
The author Henry David Thoreau was a committed abolitionist. Opposition to the war with Mexico among abolitionists was intense and reflected their view that the war was an effort to expand slavery. In the political cartoon, “Young Texas in Repose,” an unsavory Texan sits on a prostrate slave, whose head is rendered as a bale of cotton. Abolitionist protest against the war took a variety of forms, but none have had as profound impact on subsequent history as Thoreau’s refusal to pay his poll tax. His actions landed him in jail for a night. In Thoreau’s view jail was the only place for a just man in an unjust legal and political system. Thoreau explored the reasons for his act of defiance two years later. In a lyceum lecture called “The Rights and Duties of the Individual in Relation to Government,” he sketched this theory of civil disobedience. A year later a small literary journal published a revised version of this lecture, entitled “Resistance to Civil Government.” Thoreau’s essay framed in concise terms the options available to citizens facing government action they believed to be immoral: “Unjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress them at once?” Here are the options Thoreau envisioned: 
Choices




 Accept the government’s decision and not criticize it.



 Obey the law but work to change it.



 Protest the law by refusing to obey it, and suffer the legal consequences for challenging it.

Decision
 Thoreau chose the third option and spent a night in the Concord, Massachusetts, jail.

Consequences
 Thoreau’s actions had almost no impact at the time, and his essay attracted little attention. However, it became one of the most influential political essays ever written. His theory of civil disobedience influenced the twentieth-century Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi’s nonviolent protests against colonial British rule in India and the campaign of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. against racial discrimination. Protestors around the world continue to use Thoreau’s theory to advance human rights.

Continuing Controversies


Young Texas in Repose


 Is the notion of a legal right of civil disobedience a contradiction in terms? Philosophers continue to debate the morality of civil disobedience. If one condones civil disobedience, does it invariably lead to anarchy, that is, lawlessness and political disorder, or can one support the rule of law and still accept the moral legitimacy of civil disobedience? Another controversial issue that continues to divide supporters of resistance theory is the role of nonviolence. Must civil disobedience be nonviolent, or can one legitimately use violence to secure justice? Abolitionists debated this latter issue as they pondered what to do about the evil of slavery. The issue continues to divide supporters of the ideal of civil disobedience. Many affirm that the idea can only claim the moral high ground and be effective if it forswears violence.

 How significant was Thoreau’s essay when it was published?



 CHAPTER 11

OVERSPREAD THE CONTINENT”: WESTWARD EXPANSION AND POLITICAL CONFLICT, 1840–1848

 Divided at the outset of the war, Americans remained divided in its aftermath. The treaty arrived in Washington for ratification just as the city was celebrating the dedication of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument. One orator celebrated the victory over Mexico as the triumph of Manifest Destiny. Comparing American liberty to a “locomotive” that was speeding down the “track of human freedom,” he declared that “the whole civilized world resounds with American opinions and American principles.” Offsetting this ebullient optimism, however, was a sense of foreboding vividly expressed by Ralph Waldo Emerson: “Mexico will poison us.” The controversies created by the acquisition of so much land, particularly the nettlesome question of the future role of slavery in the territories, proved Emerson right.

Images of the Mexican War
 The Mexican War was the first conflict in American history that professional journalists covered and reported to the people directly almost daily. The telegraph made such instantaneous communication possible. Competing for readers, newspapers pioneered new techniques for gathering and reporting news, including sending “war correspondents” into battle. This practice freed newspapers from reliance on the military and government, allowing the press to be more independent. To be sure many papers continued to simply echo the official view of the war provided by the government. But many other editors voiced dissent. Abolitionists in particular used their antislavery newspapers to challenge the Polk administration and denounce the war. Indeed, one military officer’s complaint about the negative impact of a “thousand prying eyes and brazen tongues” was a direct result of “a free and uncontrolled press.”

 An equally significant innovation in war coverage involved the use of images by papers like The New York Herald to explain important events. The Mexican War was also the first military conflict in America to be captured on film. The daguerreotype, an early form of photography, produced images that are fuzzy by the standards of modern technology but that seemed miraculous in their day. Americans approached the new technology as if it were an actual facsimile of reality and not merely another artistic representation of it. Indeed, the Herald proclaimed that it intended its war coverage to be “daguerreotype reports,” a term meant to convey unbiased and accurate report of reality in nearly real time. Americans embraced the new pictorial art form enthusiastically. Before shipping off, a soldier might sit for a daguerreotype that he gave to family or loved ones. Soldiers might also carry daguerreotypes of loved ones into battle. Daguerreotypists even followed soldiers into Mexico, setting up temporary studios and recording battle scenes. At least one artist died recording America’s war effort. An especially haunting image produced during the war was a daguerreotype of the gravesite of Henry Clay Jr.,

THE MEXICAN WAR AND ITS CONSEQUENCES

 son of the noted Whig politician, killed at the Battle of Buena Vista (11.10). The scene is desolate: a cross, an open grave awaiting a coffin, and an adobe vault over Clay’s grave, a necessity that protected the burial site from being attacked by wolves or desecrated by grave robbers. Few people were likely to have seen such an image, but for those who did, its emotional impact would have been immense. This sober image contrasts with a heroic representation of Clay’s death in a popular print produced for a mass audience (11.11). Rather



 than capture the desolation of a grave in a distant wilderness, the lithograph shows a fallen leader urging his troops on to victory. The artist focuses on Clay’s final dramatic gesture with the pistol given to him by his father. “Take these pistols to my father,” he tells a comrade, “and tell him I have done all I can with them, and now return them to him.” Heroic images of this sort proved the most popular and influential representations of the war. Nathaniel Currier’s firm alone produced at least 85 different images of the war for an American audience eager to purchase them.

 11.10 and 11.11 Clay’s Grave and the Death of Colonel Clay These representations of the death of Henry Clay’s son capture radically different views of the war. The haunting daguerreotype (left) was a deeply personal artifact, whereas the more widely distributed lithograph was more inspirational than morbid.

 Why did the artist pose Henry Clay in the same posture as earlier artists had used for fallen leaders such as General Wolfe?



 CHAPTER 11

OVERSPREAD THE CONTINENT”: WESTWARD EXPANSION AND POLITICAL CONFLICT, 1840–1848

The Wilmot Proviso and the
Realignment of American Politics
 For a young, up-and-coming Whig from Illinois, the War with Mexico was a decisive moment. Abraham Lincoln opposed the war and viewed territorial expansion as a threat to America’s future. Whigs argued that economic development, not geographical expansion, was the key to America’s prosperity. In what would become a hallmark of his distinctive rhetoric, Lincoln translated this Whig ideal into a folksy idiom. “[Whigs] did not believe in enlarging our field,” Lincoln observed in 1848, “but in keeping our fences where they are and cultivating our present possessions, making it a garden, improving the morals and education of the people.” Supporters of slavery held a different vision: Acquiring a huge new swath of territory would be a boon for slavery. The problem of how to handle slavery in the territories gained from Mexico would strain America’s new two-party system, splitting Whigs and Democrats into Northern and Southern wings and eventually setting the stage for the emergence of a new political party, the Republicans.

The Wilmot Proviso
 In response to concerns that land seized from Mexico would lead to the spread of slavery, Congressmen David Wilmot, a Pennsylvania Democrat, introduced a measure, the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery from all territory acquired from Mexico. The bill created a firestorm. The controversy over the Wilmot Proviso heightened sectional tensions and conflict over the future of slavery. Southerners denounced it as a thinly veiled attack on slavery, whereas Northerners insisted that it left slavery untouched where it already existed. The Proviso passed in the House, where Northern representatives outnumbered Southerners, but it was defeated in the Senate, where the balance between slave and free states prevented either side from passing legislation objectionable to the other. The Wilmot Proviso shifted American political debate to the problem of slavery in the territories, splitting both parties into proslavery and free-soil factions. In response politicians tried to resolve the sectional argument over slavery. President Polk supported a proposal, modeled on the Missouri Compromise (see Chapter 7), to extend the 36° 30ʹ line across the Louisiana Purchase territories separating free states from slave states to the Pacific coast. Northerners opposed this idea because most of the land gained from Mexico lay below this line and seemed likely to enter the Union

 Why was the Wilmot Proviso so controversial?

 ultimately as slave states. Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan suggested another compromise, popular sovereignty, which would allow the people in each territory to decide for themselves whether to permit slavery. Hoping to garner both Northern and Southern supporters, he omitted a crucial detail: when this decision on slavery would be made. Most Northerners believed this decision would be made when a territorial legislature was established. Southerners, however, accepted John C. Calhoun’s interpretation that the decision over slavery would not be made until settlers wrote a state constitution, which opponents of slavery feared would allow slaveholders time to firmly establish slavery in a territory.

Sectionalism and the
Election of 1848
 The Wilmot Proviso and slavery defined the presidential election of 1848. Both the Democratic and Whig parties tried to downplay the question of slavery to attract voters in the North and South. Democrats nominated moderate Lewis Cass, champion of popular sovereignty. The Whigs had a more difficult time choosing a candidate. Henry Clay had been the clear frontrunner, but his adamant opposition to the seizure of lands from Mexico was a difficult political position to take. Clay had hoped to avoid having to take a stand on

 this issue, but the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo undercut him: After the treaty, Clay’s policy of non-expansion made no sense. Americans had to decide what to do about slavery in the lands won from Mexico. Casting Clay aside the Whigs eventually settled on General Zachary Taylor, a Mexican War hero who cast himself as a “no party man” and a unifier above partisanship. Even more useful to the party, because he was a career soldier, Taylor’s views on many political issues, including the Wilmot Proviso, were unknown. This humorous political cartoon from the election of 1848 shows a phrenologist (see Chapter 10) probing the general’s skull, supposedly to find clues to his political beliefs (11.12). The title, The Candidate of Many Parties, underscores Taylor’s attempt to be all things to all people. Indeed, the Whigs ran two different campaigns in the two regions of the country. To capture Southern voters, they stressed that Taylor owned slaves, asserting that no slaveholder would betray the interests of the South. To appeal to Northerners, the Whigs emphasized Taylor’s credentials as a Mexican War hero and his support for a cardinal Whig principle: opposition to a strong executive, including the presidential veto. By stressing his belief that the veto should

 be used only in exceptional cases, such as when a law was clearly unconstitutional, Taylor signaled to Northern Whigs that he would not veto a Wilmot Proviso-like law. Embracing this cherished Whig constitutional ideal not only allowed Taylor to underscore his Whig credentials to those who doubted them but also to side-step the slavery issue. Taylor’s election strategy enabled him to do the seemingly impossible: campaign as a proslavery candidate in the South and a pro-Wilmot Proviso candidate in the North. The 1848 election was further complicated by the emergence of a third party—the Free-Soil Party. This party brought together disaffected Democrats who supported the Wilmot Proviso and resented the growing influence of Southerners within their party. Led by former President Martin Van Buren, antislavery Democrats were known as “Barnburners,” a nickname that derived from an old Dutch tale about a farmer who burned down his barn to get the rats out. In 1848, the “rats” were proslavery Democrats. A political cartoon shows Van Buren setting fire to a barn. Lewis Cass, viewed as a pro-slavery Democrat by abolitionists, flees along with a bunch of rats (11.13). The Free-Soil Party also attracted “Conscience Whigs” who were unwilling to support a slaveholder

 as their party’s candidate. It also gathered abolitionist supporters of the Liberty Party (the antislavery party founded in 1840). Under the slogan “No more Slave States and no more Slave Territories,” the Free-Soil platform took the moderate position of opposing only the extension of slavery into the West. The Whig, Taylor, won the election handily, but his victory revealed the complexity the slavery issue posed for American politics. See Competing Visions, Slavery and the Election of 1848. He won eight of

 15 slave states, largely because he was a slave owner. The race was much closer in the North, but Taylor prevailed in the key states of Pennsylvania and New York. He owed his narrow margin of victory in the latter state to the Free-Soil Party, which drew votes away from the Democrats. The Free-Soil Party failed to win a single state, but it polled 300,000 votes (10 percent of the total) and elected two senators and nine representatives to Congress from states in the Northeast and Midwest.

 “Let the soil of our extensive domains be kept free for the hardy pioneers of our own land, and the oppressed and banished of other lands, seeking homes of comfort and fields of enterprise in the new world.”

Competing Visions
SLAVERY AND THE ELECTION OF 1848
What to do with the vast territory acquired from Mexico became a contentious issue in the election of 1848. The two-party system fractured, producing a new third party, the Free-Soil Party, which opposed the spread of slavery westward. The new party met in Buffalo, New York, as reflected in the cartoon showing Martin Van Buren, its candidate, riding a buffalo. The party platforms of the Democrats and Whig Party each adopted a different approach to slavery. The Democrat Party Platform reasserted its commitment to states’ rights and its corollary: Slavery was an issue that the Constitution had left for the individual states to decide. 
 The Whig Platform avoided mentioning slavery. Instead, it focused on the merits of the Whig candidate, Zachary Taylor who was presented as a war hero and a man who put the nation ahead of sectional interests.

 The Congress has no power under the Constitution to interfere with or control the domestic institutions of the several states, that such States are the sole and proper judges of everything appertaining to their own affairs, not prohibited by the Constitution; that all efforts of the Abolitionists or others made to induce Congress to interfere with questions of slavery … are calculated to lead to the most alarming and dangerous consequences.

 That we look on General Taylor’s administration of the Government as one conducive to Peace, Prosperity, and Union … we have a candidate whose very position as a Southwestern man, reared on the banks of the great stream whose tributaries, natural and artificial, embrace the whole Union, renders the protection of the interests of the whole country his first trust.

 The seizure of vast tracts of land from Mexico in 1848 ushered in a period of intense conflict between the North and the South over whether to permit slavery in the territories west of the Mississippi. At the root of these tensions were the starkly different paths of economic and social development being pursued in the two regions. The South prospered in the 1840s and 1850s by expanding its agrarian, slave labor economy; the North, by becoming more urban, industrial, commercial, and multicultural. In the process, the two regions developed divergent visions of the ideal society: The South celebrated the virtues of slavery, states’ rights, and white supremacy, while the North touted the benefits of free labor, upward mobility, and equal opportunity. One of the first and most bitter controversies of the period emerged with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, a law requiring Northerners to assist Southerners in the apprehension of escaped slaves. It produced almost immediately a series of sensational incidents, in which abolitionists tried, with some success, to thwart the law and spirit escaped slaves to freedom. Drawn by an abolitionist in the midst of this controversy, this image seeks to humanize the plight of escaped slaves while at the same time dramatizing the inhumanity of slave catchers and slaveholders. The quotations from the Bible (‘Thou shalt not deliver unto the master his servant which has escaped from his master unto thee …’) and the Declaration of Independence (‘We hold that all men are created equal …’) highlight the fundamental claim of abolitionists that slavery violated both Judeo-Christian morality and republican principles. Southern slaveholders, of course, rejected these claims and asserted their inalienable right to property in all things, including slaves. This controversy set the tone for a decade that was to be rocked by a series of political, legal, and economic disputes that ultimately led back to the slavery question. By the mid-1850s, each region increasingly came to see the other’s system as a threat. Northerners became convinced that Southerners wanted to spread slavery to the West and even to the North, while Southerners believed Northerners sought to destroy slavery and the Southern way of life. When Republican Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860, Southerners declared the Union dissolved, setting in motion events that led to a far more bloody conflict, the Civil War.

 “It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become either entirely a slaveholding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation.” WILLIAM SEWARD, 1858





 CHAPTER 12

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

The Slavery Question
 in the Territories The election of 1848 revealed an emerging sectional divide between the North and South over the issue of slavery. The dispute centered on whether slavery would be allowed in the new territories. Given the small population of white settlers in the West, many politicians hoped that any decision on creating territories and admitting new states would not arise for years. But the discovery of gold in California in 1848 brought tens of thousands of fortune seekers. By late 1849, they constituted a population sufficient to apply for statehood. After much acrimony Congress eventually passed the Compromise of 1850, a set of measures that quieted but did not resolve the fundamental disagreement over the future of slavery in America.

The Gold Rush
 Although both Whigs and Democrats in Congress sought to avoid the contentious issue of slavery and the territories, the discovery of gold in California soon forced them to confront it. In December 1848, following four months of rumors, more than 300 ounces of pure gold arrived in Washington, D.C., sent by the new territorial government of California. The news touched off the Gold Rush in 1849, a migration of thousands of gold seekers from farms and workshops in the East to northern California on news of the gold strike near San Francisco. California’s population exploded, rising from just 14,000 at the start of 1849 to more than 100,000 by year’s end. By 1852, it reached 220,000. Eighty percent of the new arrivals were American-born (including free African Americans), with the rest coming from Mexico, South America, Europe, and Asia. Most were single white men in their twenties and thirties. They came to California not to settle but to strike it rich and return home. This fortune-seeking spirit led to the creation of a rough and raucous society. Mining camps and boomtowns sprang up almost overnight only to be abandoned the moment the gold disappeared or word arrived of a fresh strike elsewhere. Most mining towns lacked any formal government, including sheriffs and judges, leading to high rates of crime and violence. By 1852, most of the gold that could be easily extracted was gone and with it individual earnings as high as $20 per day in 1849 (compared to less than $2 per day back East). With much gold remaining embedded in rock deep beneath the earth’s

 surface, mining shifted from independent miners to corporations possessing the capital to pay for the expensive technology required to extract the hardto-reach gold. Most of the men who remained in mining after 1852 did so as wage laborers. Among them were thousands of prospectors who had sold their farms and shops in the East in a fruitless quest for easy wealth. While many panned for gold, thousands of migrants worked in enterprises that supported the mining industry such as hotels, restaurants, banks, saloons, and laundries. They realized that the surest way to riches lay in selling supplies such as pickaxes, shovels, rope, tents, and clothing at outrageous prices to eager miners. Many women earned high wages working in cooking, cleaning, and health care jobs, but many were forced into prostitution to survive, a practice that flourished in the maledominated society of California. By one estimate, one out of every five women in California in 1850 worked as a prostitute. Another group that found its dreams of riches thwarted were the Chinese, 45,000 of whom

 arrived in California by 1854. White miners, motivated by racism and greed, used violence and intimidation to confine the Chinese to the least desirable mining areas. The drawing shown here (12.1) depicts the segregated world of these Chinese miners. No whites appear in the scene, which shows the Chinese engaged in several activities, primarily mining. In 1852, the state legislature imposed a heavy tax on Chinese miners, prompting many to turn from mining to farming, fishing, and operating restaurants and laundries. But increased immigration and job competition with whites in the coming decades would lead to escalating anti-Chinese sentiment and violence in California (see Chapter 16). Much worse was the fate of the California Indians. The diseases brought by migrants killed tens of thousands, while ruthless bands of miners killed thousands more or drove them off their lands. Of the 150,000 Native Americans who lived in California in 1848, on the eve of the Gold Rush, only 30,000 remained by 1870. Meanwhile, countless Californios—Mexicans living in California—lost title to their lands through legal obstacles that the new American government imposed. The Gold Rush sparked Western development and accelerated the creation of a coast-to-coast American nation. But the immediate consequence of the Gold Rush was not economic or social; it was political. The arrival of tens of thousands of people in 1849 suddenly made California



 eligible to organize a territorial government as a prelude to statehood. Looming over any discussion of California statehood, however, was the divisive issue of slavery.

Organizing California
 and New Mexico Even before the discovery of gold forced national leaders to consider California statehood, the question of the Western territories and the status of slavery there took center stage in Congress. Tempers flared in the House when Northern representatives unsuccessfully attempted to approve a motion upholding the Wilmot Proviso in the Western territories, draft a bill to organize California as a free territory, and pass a bill ending the slave trade in the District of Columbia. The tension eventually subsided as congressmen decided to wait for president-elect Zachary Taylor to take office and reveal his opinions on slavery and the Western territories. Within weeks of his inauguration in March 1849, Taylor made it clear that although he was a Southerner who did not oppose slavery, he would put national unity above regional loyalty. Instead of creating territorial governments for California and New Mexico that would leave authority over the slavery issue with Congress, he proposed that they be made states

 immediately and thus have the freedom to decide the slavery question according to popular will. This would remove the contentious issue from Congress where it sparked bitter debate and increasing sectionalism.

 “The people of the North need have no apprehension of the further extension of slavery.” President ZACHARY TAYLOR at Mercer, Pennsylvania, July 1849

12.2 The Great
Seal of California
 The inclusion of 31 stars indicated the hope that California would be admitted as the thirty-first state.

 Residents of New Mexico and California responded enthusiastically to Taylor’s invitation. By the fall of 1849, California had approved a state constitution prohibiting slavery and applied to Congress for admission as a free state. They also adopted a seal (12.2) to symbolize their vision of the state and its future. In the foreground sits Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, while behind her a miner prospects for gold. (The motto, Eureka, is Greek for “I have found it.”) Sheaves of wheat at her feet (symbols of agriculture) and ships (symbolic of commerce) sailing on the nearby waters indicate their

 expectations for robust economic growth. In 1850, New Mexico’s residents also applied for admission. Taylor’s actions touched off a firestorm of protest in the South. State legislatures forwarded petitions of protest to Washington, while mass meetings across the region denounced Taylor and his Northern supporters. Then in June 1850 hard-line defenders of slavery, often called “fire-eaters,” convened a Southern rights convention in Nashville, Tennessee, “to devise and adopt some mode of resistance to Northern aggression.” What angered Southerners most was the threat Taylor’s plan posed to the balance of power in Congress. Because of the North’s greater population, it sent more representatives to the House. But with slave and free states numbering 15 each, Southerners enjoyed equal representation in the Senate, allowing them to block legislation deemed threatening to slavery or Southern interests (the so-called Southern veto). Admitting California and New Mexico as free states would tip the balance in favor of the North. Under such conditions it would only be a matter of time, warned Southern defenders, before a Congress dominated by Northerners abolished slavery altogether. “For the first time,” warned Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, “we are about permanently to destroy the balance of power between the sections.”

The Compromise of 1850
 As he had done in the Missouri Compromise in 1820 and the Nullification Crisis of 1832–1833, Henry Clay of Kentucky proposed a compromise. His plan admitted California as a free state and organized New Mexico into two territories where the people would eventually vote to decide whether to permit slavery in a process known as popular sovereignty. It also settled the border dispute between New Mexico and Texas, arranged for the federal government to assume Texas’s debt, banned the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and established a stronger federal fugitive slave law. The speeches inspired by the debate over Clay’s bill, among the most famous in the history of Congress, revealed an intensifying clash of visions over the future of slavery in America. On March 4 a dying John C. Calhoun of South Carolina had a colleague read his speech expressing the views of proslavery Southern hardliners. He demanded that the Northerners end their attacks on slavery, uphold Southerner’s rights in the territories (especially the right to own slaves), and enforce the fugitive slave provisions in the Constitution.

 Why did Southerners react so negatively to President Taylor’s plan?

THE SLAVERY QUESTION IN THE TERRITORIES

 Three days later the renowned Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster delivered his famous “Seventh of March Address,” an impassioned plea for moderation and compromise, warning that both proslavery and antislavery extremism threatened to destroy the Union. William Seward of New York then voiced the views of staunch antislavery Northerners. Rejecting the Southern argument that the Constitution guaranteed the right to extend slavery into the territories, Seward invoked the authority of “a higher law than the Constitution,” the law of God under which all people deserved to live in freedom. Congress, he argued, should instead be debating how to eliminate slavery peacefully and gradually. Debate over Clay’s compromise raged for months. The hostility spawned by the differences of opinion over slavery and the Western territories is captured in this 1850 political cartoon, Scene in Uncle Sam’s Senate (12.3). The cartoon is satirical, but it depicts a real incident in which Mississippi Senator Henry S. Foote pulled a pistol on Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton (shown holding his coat open and daring his opponent to shoot). The Senate finally voted the compromise down in July. Then the unexpected occurred. President Taylor died of severe gastroenteritis on July 9, 1850, and



 “The South asks for justice, simple justice, and less she ought not to take. . . . Nothing else can, with any certainty, finally and for ever settle the question at issue, terminate agitation, and save the Union.” JOHN C. CALHOUN, March 4, 1850

 was succeeded by Vice President Millard Fillmore, a moderate Whig from New York. Compared to Taylor, Fillmore was more sympathetic to the South and eager to reach a compromise. With his support, a young and ambitious senator from Illinois, Stephen A. Douglas, revived the movement for compromise. He broke up Clay’s massive bill into separate pieces of legislation and then, without appeals to patriotism or sectionalism, he assembled enough votes to pass each individually. As the map illustrates (12.4), Douglas’s bill, or the Compromise of 1850, contained five components, some of which appealed to proslavery Southerners and others to antislavery

 of 1850 The Compromise attempted to quell the political storm that arose over the slavery question by making concessions to both sides.

 Northerners. First, California entered the Union as a free state. To offset this concession to the opponents of slavery, a second bill created the New Mexico and Utah territories and left the question of slavery to be decided by popular sovereignty when each territory applied for statehood. Left unexplained was the status of slavery in the years leading to statehood. Third, Texas was required to relinquish claims to disputed territory on its western border to New Mexico (pleasing opponents of slavery by reducing the slave state’s size) in exchange for the federal government assuming the $10 million debt Texas had incurred as an independent republic (pleasing Southerners who held most of the debt). A fourth provision granted abolitionists a partial victory by banning the slave trade—but not slavery—in Washington, D.C. Finally, a new Fugitive Slave Act greatly increased the federal government’s commitment to returning escaped slaves to their owners,

 something Southern fire-eaters had been demanding for years. When the bills were all signed by midSeptember, joyful crowds gathered in the nation’s capital to serenade Congress with song and cheers of “The Union is saved.” But a close examination of the votes on the compromise’s bills reveals a weakening of party loyalties and a growing tendency toward voting along sectional lines. Most Northern Whigs, for example, supported the admission of California as a free state and opposed the Fugitive Slave Act. Most Southern Whigs voted in the opposite manner. Only 20 percent of Congress—generally moderate Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs—voted for all five bills. As many antislavery Northerners and Southern hardliners correctly predicted, the question of slavery, whether in the territories or elsewhere, would surface again.

THE SLAVERY QUESTION IN THE TERRITORIES



Sectionalism on the Rise
 One element in the Compromise of 1850—the Fugitive Slave Act—sparked a national controversy that intensified the sectionalism, or hostility between North and South over slavery. The act created a force of federal commissioners who possessed broad powers to pursue and return suspected escaped slaves to their owners. It also permitted federal marshals to deputize private citizens to assist in capturing fugitive slaves. Those who refused to help were subject to fines and imprisonment. Once apprehended, an accused fugitive had no right to a jury trial. His or her fate was instead decided by a federal commissioner who stood to earn a fee of $10 if he returned the accused to slavery and only $5 if he released him or her. Fugitive slaves escaping to the North did not become a major political issue until the 1830s. In that decade the growing abolitionist movement began to encourage and facilitate slave escapes along what came to be known metaphorically as the Underground Railroad. It was a network of safe houses and other secret hiding places along a series of routes leading to the North and into Canada where British law prohibited slavery. The existence of such a network is revealed in this page from the 1844 diary of Daniel Osborn, a Quaker living in Alum Creek, Ohio (12.5). Between April and September of that year—warm months ideal for travel—Osborn assisted 47 escapees. His home was situated approximately halfway between the borders of northern Kentucky (where all but three of the fugitives came from) and Canada. Many of his Quaker neighbors also harbored fugitives. Angry slaveholders and eager abolitionists spread fantastic stories of thousands of slaves being spirited north annually, but the Underground Railroad probably brought no more than 5,000 slaves to freedom between 1830 and 1860. Its most famous “conductor” was Harriet Tubman, an escaped slave who made 19 trips to the South to lead scores of slaves, including many of her relatives, to freedom. Osborn’s diary occasionally revealed a similar pattern on a smaller scale. In one eight-day period in August 1844, he recorded that an African American man passed through Alum Creek on his way back to Kentucky where he gathered his wife, child, and sister-in-law and returned safely. He was followed by a woman who came from Canada to bring four of her children and one grandchild to freedom. Most

 fugitives escaped to the North through less formal arrangements and a combination of perseverance, ingenuity, and luck. Although the number of escaped slaves remained relatively small, averaging 1,000 per year out of a total slave population that approached four million by 1860, Southern slaveholders grew increasingly angry over the unwillingness of Northerners to assist in the return of their “property.” Especially galling were the “personal liberty laws” passed by nine Northern states between 1842 and 1850, which prohibited the use of state officials or facilities like courts and jails for the capture and return of escaped slaves. With these precedents in mind, Southerners made clear in the weeks following the Compromise of 1850 that they expected Northerners to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act. “It is the deliberate opinion

 Why did Southerners demand a Fugitive Slave Act?



 CHAPTER 12

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

 of this Convention,” resolved a gathering of Georgia fire-eaters, “that upon the faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Law … depends the preservation of our much beloved Union.” Southern insistence on a new fugitive slave law was full of contradiction. Even though Southern nationalists celebrated the sanctity of states’ rights, they condemned Northern states for enacting “personal liberty laws.” States’ rights doctrine also opposed any increase of federal power, especially when slavery was concerned, yet Southerners made an exception when it came to using federal authority to capture their escaped slaves. Abolitionists denounced the new fugitive slave law as “a hateful statute of kidnappers.” They formed vigilance committees throughout the North and vowed, in the words of one Illinois newspaper, “to trample the law in the dust.” Opportunities for resistance soon arose, for unlike the abstract questions raised by the Wilmot Proviso and popular sovereignty, the Fugitive Slave Act created a succession of concrete human dramas in dozens of Northern communities (see Choices and Consequences: Resisting the Fugitive Slave Act). Early and memorable incidents occurred in Boston, the unofficial headquarters of the abolitionist movement. In October 1850, just weeks after the law’s enactment, two slave catchers arrived there in pursuit of William and Ellen Craft, who had escaped from Georgia two years earlier. The city’s vigilance committee swung into action, hiding the Crafts and posting handbills throughout the city, denouncing the “kidnappers.” After five days of sustained harassment and physical threats, the slave catchers left the city. Taking no chances, the Crafts boarded a ship for England. The controversy over the Fugitive Slave Act played a significant role in popularizing and legitimizing antislavery

 sentiment—though not necessarily abolitionism— in the North. In the early 1850s, few Northerners were abolitionists. Indeed, many were deeply hostile to blacks and rejected racial equality. Other Northerners opposed slavery, but were not willing to jeopardize the national peace achieved by the Compromise of 1850 by supporting abolitionist vigilantism. Nonetheless, the controversies generated by the Fugitive Slave Act forced Northerners to confront the reality of an institution that had seemed distant and abstract. The vivid images of Southern agents seizing free people in a community of free citizens and returning them to a life of bondage shocked even the most conservative Northerners. As one conservative Whig wrote after seeing the fugitive Anthony Burns returned to slavery from Boston in 1854, “When it was all over, and I was alone in my office, I put my face in my hands and wept.” Although these and subsequent events in the 1850s did not convert masses of Northerners to abolitionism, they did move many to see slavery as an evil that at the least ought to be confined to its present boundaries to hasten its eventual demise. Many Northerners also gradually became more hostile to slavery as the result of reading antislavery literature. Although the growing number of firsthand accounts of slavery by escaped slaves proved popular, the most widely read and influential book was a work of fiction. First published in installments in an abolitionist newspaper, Uncle Tom’s Cabin appeared as a novel in 1852. Its author, Harriet Beecher Stowe, came from a prominent abolitionist family. Within a year her novel sold 300,000 copies, making it the best-selling book of the era. Soon thousands of theatrical versions of the story were being performed in cities across the North. Speeches, diaries, letters, and other evidence indicate that Stowe’s account of the brutality of slavery and the humanity of the enslaved moved millions of Northerners to become increasingly hostile to slavery, even if they did not believe in racial equality. By contrast, Southerners denounced Stowe as a “wretch in petticoats” and banned the book. They also published dozens of proslavery novels with similar titles. This image (12.6) from Aunt Phillis’s Cabin or Southern Life as It Is (1852), portrays slaves dancing, suggesting they enjoy free time and are happy. 12.6 Southerners Refute the Antislavery Claims of Uncle Tom’s Cabin This frontispiece from Aunt Phillis’s Cabin, or Southern Life as It Is (1852), presents slavery as a happy, carefree existence.

THE SLAVERY QUESTION IN THE TERRITORIES



Choices and Consequences
RESISTING THE FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT
In February 1851, Boston’s abolitionists faced a new challenge when federal authorities captured an escaped slave named Shadrach Minkins. As a federal judge ordered a hearing to determine Minkins’s status to be held three days later, 200 white and black abolitionists gathered outside the jail where he was held. Intimidating slave catchers and helping the Crafts avoid arrest had constituted resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act, but with Minkins in federal custody the question arose of whether abolitionists were willing to break the law to uphold their values. 
Choices




 Drawing on the civil disobedience tradition (see Chapter 11), declare the Fugitive Slave Act immoral and organize an extralegal effort to free Minkins.



 Respect the laws regarding fugitive slaves, but fight through the courts to prevent the extradition of Minkins and other alleged fugitive slaves.



 Respect the laws regarding fugitive slaves and accept the likely transportation of Minkins back to slavery, but organize a more effective effort to spirit fugitive slaves out of the country (like the Crafts).

Decision
 Convinced that the hearing would result in Minkins’s return to slavery, 20 African American men opted for Choice 1. They burst into the courtroom, overpowered the guards, and took Minkins to Montreal, Canada. The incident thrilled abolitionists, including Theodore Parker who wrote later,

 “I think it is the most noble deed done in Boston since the destruction of the tea in 1773.” Southerners and conservative Northerners like President Fillmore denounced the action as lawless.

Consequences
 When federal authorities apprehended another escaped slave, Thomas Sims, in Boston two months later, Fillmore sent 250 soldiers to guard the courthouse and escort the captive to a ship bound for Georgia. Nonetheless, similar extralegal incidents by abolitionists occurred elsewhere. In Christiana, Pennsylvania, in October 1851, for example, two dozen armed African American men killed a slaveholder from nearby Maryland who was pursuing two escaped

 slaves. These events outraged Southerners, especially pro-secessionist fire-eaters. South Carolina, Mississippi, and Georgia held conventions to denounce abolitionism and consider secession. The furor soon quieted down as the number of slave captures decreased sharply, largely because thousands of free blacks and escaped slaves fled to Canada (Ontario’s African American population doubled in the 1850s).

Continuing Controversies
 When are acts of civil disobedience and violence to further the cause of justice legitimate? In the 1850s, abolitionists deemed slavery such an outrageous violation of American freedom that acts of resistance—even violence—were justified. This question would generate heated debate in every subsequent era in American history, including movements for women’s suffrage in the 1910s and civil rights in the 1960s.

 What caused the furor over the Fugitive Slave Act to eventually subside?



 CHAPTER 12

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

Political Realignment
 Furor over the Fugitive Slave Act subsided after 1851, and American politics experienced a period of relative calm. Some felt a rising optimism over the prospect of territorial expansion into the Caribbean and Latin America. But unprecedented levels of immigration also spawned a powerful antiforeigner political movement that enjoyed widespread support until eclipsed by the reemergence of the slavery issue. Sectional animosity surged in 1854 as Congress debated whether to allow slavery in the Kansas and Nebraska territories. The resulting KansasNebraska Act prompted the collapse of the Whig Party and in 1856–1857, a violent and protracted conflict between pro- and antislavery forces, known as “Bleeding Kansas.”

Young America
 By late 1852, a prosperous economy and fear of disunion undermined the appeal of extremists in both North and South. Prosperity also helped calm the passions aroused by the Compromise of 1850 and the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. In the presidential election that year, both parties nominated moderate candidates (Democrat Franklin Pierce and Whig General Winfield Scott) and pledged to uphold the Compromise of 1850. Pierce won handily, but the most telling aspect of the election was the woeful performance of the Whig Party in the South (12.7) where Scott, allied with the antislavery wing of his party, won only Kentucky and Tennessee. The Whig Party was falling apart and soon would be gone. Pierce’s popularity stemmed from his reputation as a Northerner with Southern sympathies.

 the Democratic Party called Young America. Enthusiastic about the notion of Manifest Destiny (see Chapter 11), Young America promoted a nationalist vision of territorial expansion, increased international trade, and the spread of American ideals of democracy and free enterprise abroad. America, they argued, possessed the right, even the obligation, to continue its expansion, especially into Latin America and the Caribbean.

 children, Leutze indicates that generations of future Americans will benefit from the land’s bounty. A radiant sunset implies God’s blessing on the enterprise. As president, Pierce proved an ardent proponent of expansion, which he believed would strengthen the Democratic Party and unite the nation. Yet his efforts had nearly the opposite effect. When Pierce entertained proposals to annex Hawaii and purchase Alaska, Southerners in Congress stymied the plans because the treaties would have outlawed slavery. Conversely, Northern representatives denounced his attempt in 1854 to acquire Cuba—with its plantation economy and 300,000 slaves—from Spain. Northerners likewise took a dim view of the invasions of Latin American and Caribbean countries by small armies of expansion-minded adventurers known as “filibusters” (an English corruption of the Dutch word for pirate). These operations delighted Southern slave owners, however, who viewed these lands as ideal, in the words of Mississippi Senator Albert G. Brown, “for the planting and spreading of slavery.” Pierce’s support for proslavery expansionism alienated Northern supporters and threatened to upset the sectional peace achieved by the Compromise of 1850. But the controversy over proposed expansion would pale by comparison with that sparked in 1854 over a plan to organize the territories of Kansas and Nebraska.

 territories and eventually states in the land west of Iowa and Missouri (essentially the northern half of the Louisiana Purchase). He was not alone. Farmers were eager to settle in the region’s fertile Kansas and Platte River Valleys, and promoters of a transcontinental railroad hoped to run a northern route through it. Neither settlement nor railroad construction could occur, however, before the federal government negotiated land treaties with Indians and organized the area as a territory. Douglas faced strong opposition from Southern congressmen who feared the new territories would eventually become two free states. They also had their sights set on a southern route for the transcontinental railroad, from New Orleans through the New Mexico territory to San Francisco. They told Douglas they would support his plan only if it included a repeal of the ban on slavery north of 36° 30' that had been a part of the Missouri Compromise in 1820. Promises of popular sovereignty, they warned, would not be enough. Fully aware that it would “raise a hell of a storm,” but hopeful it would boost his presidential ambitions for 1856, Douglas introduced his Kansas-Nebraska Act as a solution to the issues arising over these Western territories. In addition to repealing the ban on slavery north of 36° 30', the act

 called for splitting the area into two separate territories, Kansas west of Missouri and Nebraska west of Iowa (12.9). He intended this last provision to placate both North and South by allowing the eventual establishment of Kansas as a slave state (since its soil and climate were similar to neighboring Missouri) and Nebraska as a free state. The Kansas-Nebraska Act touched off a national debate more intense than that of 1850. Most Northerners, both Whigs and Democrats, considered the 36° 30' line an untouchable agreement that had ensured national peace for more than 30 years. Although some moderates had been willing in 1850 to allow slavery (via popular sovereignty) into Western territory lying south of the line, they now balked at doing so in land north of it.

 Free-Soilers and abolitionists denounced the bill as conclusive evidence that the South, now increasingly referred to as the “Slave Power,” was bent on spreading the curse of slavery wherever possible. They organized hundreds of “anti-Nebraska” rallies across the North and forwarded petitions to Congress. “Despite corruption, bribery, and treachery,” asserted one typical resolution, “Nebraska, the heart of our continent, shall forever remain free.” Undeterred, Douglas prevailed, and his bill passed in May 1854. But it was a costly victory that seriously weakened his Democratic Party and hampered his presidential ambitions by associating him with controversy. The impact on the Whigs was even worse, shattering the party along sectional

 lines. Every Northern Whig in the House and Senate voted against the measure, whereas most Southern Whigs joined the Democrats in support. More seriously, the death of the Whig Party in the South indicated that the bitter fight over Nebraska had permanently ended the long-standing spirit of accommodation between the North and South. Many Northerners resolved to make no more concessions to the Slave Power, whereas a growing number of Southerners resolved to preserve their rights from attacks by abolitionists. This intensifying polarization between North and South is revealed in these two sculptures of “Freedom” by Thomas Crawford (12.10). Crawford was commissioned in 1854 to create a statue of a monumental figure representing liberty to top the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. One year later he submitted a proposed model for the sculpture to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, who was overseeing the renovation of the Capitol. Davis approved of the overall scheme—a large classically robed woman holding a sword and shield—but one detail infuriated the vociferous defender of slavery from Mississippi. Crawford had given “Freedom” a cap worn by freed slaves in ancient Rome. Sensing an abolitionist plot (Crawford was a friend of leading abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner), Davis threatened to cancel the commission. Crawford quickly replaced the cap with a helmet surrounded by stars and a bald eagle.



 with the addition of proslavery Whigs. From that point the party came under growing Southern, proslavery control. The nascent Republican Party was not the only movement seeking to succeed the defunct Whig Party. Although many Northerners harbored growing concern about the Slave Power, others perceived a greater threat to their way of life: mass immigration. The flow of immigrants into the United States, rising steadily since the 1820s, became a tidal wave in the mid-1840s. Industrialization, population growth, and crop failure in Europe led hundreds of thousands of Irish, German, and other Western Europeans to seek new lives in America, where industrial jobs and cheap land abounded. Between 1845 and 1855, three million immigrants arrived, with most settling in Northern cities.

Republicans and
Know-Nothings
 The political impact of the Kansas-Nebraska controversy became clear in the 1854 Congressional elections. Free-Soilers, ex-Whigs, and antislavery Democrats in the North formed dozens of local parties under names like the Anti-Nebraska or the People’s Party. The most popular name, and the one under which they would eventually unite, was Republican. Despite their varied names, the parties shared an overriding commitment to opposing further concessions to Southern slave interests. As this loose collection of antislavery groups coalesced into the Republican Party, the Democratic Party was transformed. In the midterm elections of 1854, Northern Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives and all but two free-state legislatures. Many of the defeated Democrats lost because they had voted for the Kansas-Nebraska Act. But in the South the Democratic Party grew stronger

 CHAPTER 12

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

 This surge in immigration caused antiimmigrant sentiment, or nativism—native-born Americans’ belief in their superiority to the foreign born—to rise sharply. As Images as History: The “Foreign Menace” shows, Americans were upset not merely by the number of immigrants arriving, but also by their perceived character. Although most immigrants in previous decades had been Protestants from Britain—many of them with money and skills—a large majority of immigrants in the 1840s and 1850s were poor unskilled Catholics from Germany and Ireland. Anti-Catholicism, with roots in American history going back to the nation’s earliest European founders, surged into near hysteria. Some of the best-selling books in the antebellum period charged that Catholicism, with its emphasis on clerical authority and loyalty to the Pope in Rome, was incompatible with democracy. Nativists—those born in the United States—also feared that immigrants took American jobs, drank too much alcohol, refused to assimilate, and increased poverty, disease, and crime.

 “The ill-clad and destitute Irishman is repulsive to our habits and our tastes.” The Christian Examiner (N.Y.), 1848 Anti-immigrant sentiment reached a fever pitch in 1854 with the emergence of the American Party. Its core constituents were members of secret antiimmigrant societies founded in cities in the late 1840s. Because secrecy required them to answer “I know nothing” when asked about their organization, they earned the name “Know-Nothings.” Their political platform condemned both political parties as hopelessly corrupt and called for legislation restricting office to native-born citizens, barring public funds for parochial schools, and raising the period of naturalization for citizenship from five to 21 years. With the Whig Party in decline and the Democrats closely associated with the immigrant vote, Know-Nothings achieved stunning success in 1854, winning control of the state governments in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. About 75 Know-Nothing congressmen were sent to Washington. Elections one year later in 1855 saw the party

 win Maryland and Kentucky, elect scores of nativists in New York and California, and post impressive tallies across the South. After the elections of 1854, the big question was which of these two new political forces—antislavery Republicans or anti-immigrant Know Nothings— would replace the defunct Whig Party. But the American Party disintegrated almost as quickly as it arose, splitting like the Whig Party along sectional lines over slavery. Most of its members eventually joined the Republican Party. Although many former members retained their dislike of foreigners, they perceived the growing aggression of the Slave Power as a greater threat to the nation’s well-being. This threat seemed most menacing in the newly created territory of Kansas.

Ballots and Blood
 Even as opponents denounced Douglas’s plan to allow popular sovereignty to decide the status of slavery in the territories, they devised a plan to ensure the results went their way. “We will engage in competition for the virgin soil of Kansas,” William Seward warned his Southern colleagues in Congress just before passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, “and God give victory to the side which is stronger in numbers as in right.” Wealthy New England abolitionists established the Emigrant Aid Company and financed the migration of more than 2,000 antislavery settlers to Kansas. Thousands more went on their own. Proslavery interests, however, proved equal to the task of opposing them. To offset the soaring numbers of Northern settlers in Kansas, they organized bands of proslavery “border ruffians” to cross into Kansas from Missouri. Although some came as settlers, most were illegal voters determined to see Kansas enter the Union as a slave state. In spring 1855 men from Missouri cast nearly 5,000 illegal votes helping elect a proslavery territorial government that gathered in the town of Lecompton and legalized slavery. Antislavery settlers rejected the legitimacy of this “bogus legislature.” In fall 1855, they drew up a freestate constitution, held elections that resulted in an antislavery legislature and governor located in the town of Lawrence, and asked Congress to admit the territory as a free state. Kansas now had two governments, bitterly opposed to each other. Kansas quickly became a divisive issue in Congress. Although the Senate (controlled by

From the colonial period up to the present, Americans have held conflicted visions about immigration.

 Democrats) voted to recognize the proslavery government of Lecompton, the House (controlled by Republicans) recognized the free-state government in Lawrence. On May 20, 1856, Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, a rising figure in the abolitionist movement, delivered a speech titled the “Crime Against Kansas,” a harsh denunciation of Southern efforts to force slavery into the territory. Days later, South Carolina Congressman Preston Brooks attacked Sumner with a cane in the Senate chamber for his affront to Southern honor. Sumner nearly died from his injuries and never fully recovered his health. As the image suggests (12.11), antislavery Northerners hailed Sumner as a near martyr. The artist’s emphasis on Brooks’s brutality and Sumner’s vulnerability (he is armed with only a pen) popularized the abolitionist vision of slavery as an inherently barbarous institution and its supporters, both in Congress and on the plains of Kansas, as violent criminals who did not respect democracy or free speech. In contrast Brooks became a hero in the South for defending Southern rights and dignity. Hundreds mailed him notes of congratulations, and a few even sent canes as a symbol of their support, inscribed with phrases like “Hit Him Again.” Only days after Sumner’s speech, heavily armed proslavery vigilantes attacked Lawrence, Kansas, home to the antislavery territorial government.

 The posse sacked the town, setting fire to the main hotel and destroying its two newspaper presses. Antislavery settlers arrived too late to prevent the devastation. Among them was John Brown, a zealous abolitionist who believed himself God’s chosen instrument for eradicating slavery. Three days later he led abolitionist avengers in a counterassault at Pottawatomie Creek, Kansas. Falling upon a settlement of proslavery families, the abolitionists pulled five men from their beds and murdered them with swords. The violence touched off a wave of vigilante reprisals and counter-reprisals by proslavery and antislavery forces. Newspapers began referring to “Bleeding Kansas” to describe the quasi-civil war taking place there. The antislavery press in the North, as exemplified by this political cartoon from 1856 (12.12), inflamed abolitionist passions. Note how the artist depicts key Democratic politicians as “border ruffians,” the pejorative name used by opponents of slavery to describe proslavery vigilantes. In the center kneels Liberty, begging for mercy (“O spare me gentlemen, spare me!”) while President Pierce (to her left) and Democratic Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan (right) stand on the American flag and taunt her.

 man to death. Images like this, along with editorials, sermons, and speeches, inspired Northerners to send money and guns to aid the Free-Soil cause, or to join Free-Soil settlers heading for Kansas to thwart proslavery efforts. By the time President Pierce sent a new governor and 1,300 troops to Kansas in 1856, 200 people lay dead, including one of John Brown’s sons. The decadeslong bitter debate over the status of slavery had erupted into armed conflict. The highly charged events of 1854–1856 benefited the young Republican Party. Thousands of Free-Soil, Whig, and Democratic voters joined its ranks, making it the largest party in the North. Yet it was also a purely sectional party with no support in the South. Democrats had the advantage of being the only true national party, with strength in both sections.

 For the presidential election of 1856, Republicans nominated the famed Western explorer John C. Frémont and waged a campaign likened to an evangelical crusade. Groups calling themselves “Wide Awakes” staged torchlight processions across the North, touting “Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Men, Frémont!” Democrats chose James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, who, like Winfield Scott and Lewis Cass, presidential candidates in elections before him, was a Northerner with pro-Southern credentials. The centerpiece of Buchanan’s campaign was to play on the racism of many Northern voters by branding his opponents “Black Republicans,” a racist pejorative that suggested that Republicans who opposed the extension of slavery into the Western territories were dangerous radicals who favored abolition and racial equality. The fast-fading American Party nominated ex-Whig and former president Millard Fillmore.

 1857 when proslavery Kansans (who controlled the territorial legislature) held a convention in Lecompton and drafted a proslavery state constitution as a preliminary step to applying to Congress for statehood. When these proslavery men put the Lecompton Constitution before the people of Kansas in a referendum, antislavery residents, deeming both the legislature and the convention illegitimate, boycotted it. As a result, the constitution won approval easily and was forwarded to Congress. To complicate matters, however, in the fall the antislavery party won control of the territorial legislature and immediately authorized a second referendum on the proslavery constitution. This time proslavery residents boycotted, and the constitution was rejected by more than twothirds of the voters, who were overwhelmingly antislavery. The scene then shifted to Washington. President Buchanan gave in under intense pressure from Southerners in his cabinet and in Congress, who threatened secession if the proslavery Lecompton Constitution was not accepted and Kansas admitted as a slave state. Douglas came out against Lecompton because it was unpopular in his home state of Illinois, and it mocked his vaunted principle of popular sovereignty (even as it exposed its weakness). Months of rancorous debate ensued. A brawl broke out in the House, and some members of Congress began to come to the chamber armed. The Senate approved the Lecompton Constitution, but the House narrowly rejected it. Kansas would remain a territory indefinitely.

 CHAPTER 12

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

Two Societies
 From an economic standpoint the 1850s brought stronger bonds of interdependence between North and South. Northern textile manufacturers depended on a steady supply of Southern cotton, whereas Southerners relied on Northern manufactured goods, credit, and shipping. Yet overshadowing the increased economic integration of North and South was their splitting into two distinct societies. Northeastern and Midwestern states industrialized at a stunning pace, symbolized by the spread in these regions of the railroad and factory. In much of the South, by contrast, economic growth arose from an ever-expanding system of staple crop production, notably cotton that depended on the labor of four million slaves. Along with these divergent economies, North and South developed distinct philosophies that defined their vision of the proper social order.

The Industrial North
12.15 The Crystal
Palace, 1853
Hundreds of
 thousands of visitors flocked to New York City in 1853 to view the “Exhibition of the Industry of the World” in the Crystal Palace. The main building itself, made of cast-iron and glass, was an expression of the latest industrial materials and design.

 The industrial revolution that began in places like Lowell, Massachusetts in the early 1800s, and then staggered after the Panic of 1837, reached new heights after the economic recovery in the early 1840s. Centered almost entirely in the North, this boom was triggered by three main developments. First, starting in the firearms industry and spreading into clocks, sewing machines, and farming equipment, Americans pioneered in the creation of machines made of interchangeable parts, thus facilitating the rapid manufacture of inexpensive goods. Second, manufacturers began to power their machines with steam, an energy source that was more powerful, reliable,

 and flexible than water power provided by rivers. Finally, manufacturers benefited from the huge pool of cheap labor provided by a steady influx of immigrants. Manufacturing output soared, and by 1860 the total value of all goods produced in the North reached $1.5 billion (compared to $483 million for the entire nation in 1840). The dynamic and innovative character of the Northern industrial economy was displayed for all the world to see in 1853 at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in New York City. Modeled on a similar exhibition in London in 1851, the “Exhibition of the Industry of the World,” as it was officially known, featured more than 4,000 exhibits, most of them American. Even the building itself (12.15), a monumental cast-iron

TWO SOCIETIES

 and glass structure, reflected the latest trends in architecture, design, and construction materials. More than one million people came to see the latest in modern technology, including Cyrus McCormick’s mechanical reaper, Richard M. Hoe’s rotary printing press, and Elisha Otis’s elevator. The only Southern exhibitions of new technology were improved versions of the cotton gin. The same spirit of enthusiasm and confidence that inspired the Crystal Palace Exhibition is also captured in this advertisement for the Colt Patent Fire Arms Manufactury in 1862 (12.16). Samuel Colt from Connecticut patented a design for a revolver in 1837 and then established an enormously successful firearms manufacturing business in Hartford. The image that dominates the advertisement conveys two main ideas. First, it shows a huge manufacturing establishment, the very size of which is intended to suggest strength and power. Second, the image shows the modern factory nestled neatly within a small New England town, suggesting that industry poses no threat to smalltown American values. Colt’s was one of many arms-manufacturing businesses that flourished in the 1840s and 1850s. Nearly all of them were located in the North, accounting for 90 percent of national output. Equally important to the emerging industrial economy was the building of a massive railroad network. Trackage soared from more than 9,000 miles in 1850 to over 30,000 in 1860. Because most of this track lay west of Pennsylvania, it bound the states of the Northeast more closely with those in the Midwest, such as Illinois. Trade increasingly moved east to west along railroads and canals rather than north to south along rivers as in earlier decades, accentuating the growing sectional divide. The growth of the railroads, along with two additional technological innovations—the reaper and the cast steel plow— revolutionized Northern and Western agriculture, which was still the foundation of the national economy. Cyrus McCormick’s

 mechanical reaper was a piece of equipment on small wheels pulled by a horse. As it passed through a field, sharp blades moved back and forth severing stalks of wheat. The harvested grain was then collected in a cradle. The reaper allowed for a much faster harvest—often crucial in times of bad weather—and eliminated the need to hire expensive farm labor. John Deere’s cast steel plow sliced smoothly through the toughest soil, making farming much easier and more efficient. Both inventions allowed farmers to expand the size of their farms, knowing they could handle the additional plowing and harvesting. The railroad also allowed farmers to sell their produce in markets hundreds of miles away and to turn from raising a mixture of animal, fruit, vegetable, and grain products to specializing in single crops such as wheat, corn, or oats. Rising prices and growing demand from abroad for American grain augmented this trend. Industrialization brought rising wages and opportunity to most Northerners, but also new levels of poverty—especially among unskilled and immigrant workers who formed a growing class of urban poor. Wages in many industrializing sectors, such as shoe making and textiles, were too low for one earner to support a family. To increase their family’s income, growing numbers of women and children worked in factories or performed “outwork” in their homes, often for 60 or 70 hours per week. Many workers became unemployed for

Envisioning Evidence
THE RISE OF KING COTTON
Many Americans associate cotton cultivation with slavery, but the relationship really only took form in the last half century of slavery’s existence in the United States (roughly between 1810 and 1860). The growth of textile manufacturing in Britain and the Northern United States in the early 1800s created a booming demand for cotton. At the same time, the expulsion of Native Americans from the fertile lands of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Florida, and North and South Carolina opened the way for cotton cultivation on a mass scale. Between 1815 and 1860 millions of white settlers moved into these lands. They brought with them millions of slaves who they put to work raising cotton. By 1830 cotton had become the South’s most profitable product and slavery the single most important source of capital investment. Cotton’s value only increased over the next three decades, leading many Southerners to conclude that if the rising controversy over slavery led to secession, the South was strong enough to flourish on its own. “Cotton was King,” went a popular slogan in the late 1850s.

 resolves and re-resolves in regard to his rights.” A vociferous advocate of Southern economic diversification, James D. B. DeBow, started a magazine with the motto “Commerce is King” and held commercial conventions throughout the South. By 1860, DeBow and other proponents of greater Southern economic independence could point to substantial progress. Southern railroad mileage had increased fourfold to 9,000 miles, and there were 18,000 factories, most in the upper South. But the economy of the North grew even faster. Even as the South increased its textile manufacture by 44 percent in the 1850s, its share of manufacturing nationwide declined by two percent. Indeed, in 1860, the city of Lowell, Massachusetts, operated more textile spindles than all the Southern states combined. The South remained an agricultural society. So long as staple crops brought high prices, only a handful of Southerners seemed willing to pursue industrialization.

 Industry also flourished in the upper South, especially in Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri. But it paled in comparison to industrialization in the North and constituted only a fraction of the overall Southern economy. Production of cash crops such as tobacco, sugar, and rice soared, as did prices. Nothing, however, outperformed the South’s main staple crop, cotton. Production jumped from 1.35 million bales in 1840 to 4.8 million bales by 1860. (Each bale weighed approximately 480 pounds.) Southern cotton by this time accounted for three-fifths of American exports and three-quarters of the world supply. As one Southern nationalist put it, “Cotton is King.” What made cotton king in this period was the labor of slaves—nearly four million by 1860.

 sign of wealth and status. Others embraced a longstanding Southern doctrine that white freedom depended on slavery. Because slaves performed hard, menial labor, slavery established a floor in the Southern economy, below which even the poorest whites could not descend. “Break down slavery,” argued one Virginian, “and you would with the same blow destroy the great Democratic principle of equality among men”—by which he meant, white men. Above all, poor Southerners supported slavery because they accepted the essential tenets of white supremacy, in particular the notion that blacks were inferior to whites and destined to live under their dominance. “Now suppose they was free,” said a white Alabama farmer about slaves to a Northerner touring the South in the 1850s, “they’d all think themselves just as good as we.… how would you like to hev a nigger feelin’ just as good as a white man?”

Divergent Visions
 Southern society not only preached the superiority of whites over blacks, but also the superiority of slave labor over Northern wage labor. The most prominent defender of slavery was George Fitzhugh. In books and pamphlets published in the 1850s, he argued that all great societies in history practiced slavery and that the Southern version was remarkably humane because masters felt obliged to feed, clothe, and shelter their slaves. “The negro slaves of the South,” he wrote, “are the happiest, and, in some sense, the freest people in the world.” Moreover, argued Fitzhugh and others, such as the artist who drew this image that idealized slavery (12.17), slavery rescued Africans from the so-called barbarism of Africa and exposed them to “civilization” and Christianity. Pointing to the North’s urban slums swelled with poor industrial workers, Fitzhugh ridiculed the Northern contention that wage labor was morally superior to slavery. Northern factory workers, he asserted, were little more than “wage slaves.” Their condition was worse than that of the black slave because factory owners owed them nothing but the lowest possible wage. “Capital exercises a more perfect compulsion over free laborers than human masters over slaves,” wrote Fitzhugh, “for free laborers must at all times work or starve, and slaves are supported whether they work or not.” Northern society with its “hireling labor,” claimed an official in Charleston, was characterized by “pauperism, rowdyism, mobism and anti-rentism.”

 Why did Southern whites who owned no slaves support slavery?

 Republicans had an answer for the likes of Fitzhugh: a free labor philosophy that celebrated the virtues of individualism, independence, entrepreneurship, and upward mobility. As Fitzhugh did for the slave South, they offered an idealized vision of the industrial North that conveniently ignored the hopeless plight of many poverty-stricken city dwellers. “In the constitution of human nature,” wrote New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley, “the desire of bettering one’s condition is the mainspring of effort.” In contrast to the South, which reserved hard labor for slaves, argued Greeley, in the North all work was noble and moral, no matter how menial. Better still, for the ambitious, wage labor need only be temporary. If a man labored hard, saved his money, avoided drink, and sought opportunity, went the free labor philosophy, he would soon possess his own farm or small business. Nothing—not lack of money, family ties, formal education, or American birth—stood in the way of success. A slave-based society, then, for these Republicans, was the antithesis of this dynamic society of democratic opportunity. “Enslave a man,” wrote Greeley, “and you destroy his ambition, his enterprise, his capacity.” To Northern abolitionists, slavery also stifled the capacity of most poor and middling whites, protecting the privileges of the aristocratic few and leaving the rest with little opportunity for success. Even worse, slavery led to a culture that celebrated laziness, luxury, and decadence as opposed to the capitalist virtues of hard work, thrift, and self-restraint. Northern writers like Frederick Law Olmsted, who traveled the South in the 1850s, frequently commented on the backwardness of Southern life, its lack of public education, railroads, factories, and substantial cities as well as a general tone of despair and fatalism among poor whites. This ideological war of words intensified when a financial panic on Wall Street sent the economy plunging into a deep recession in late 1857, bringing unemployment and hard times to the industrial Northeast and agrarian West. But because the Southern economy was so geared toward the export of cotton, it experienced little of the Panic of 1857. Southern nationalists pointed to this as evidence that “cotton is supreme” in comparison to Northern industry. Southerners also argued that it proved the South could prosper on its own should the Union ever dissolve. The development of these divergent philosophies in the 1850s played a major role in creating a climate of extreme mistrust between North and South. Given the moral and social dimension of

The successful efforts by

 Southerners in Congress to defeat proposals for higher tariffs to protect Northern industry, land grants to promote a transcontinental railroad, and a homestead act to give 160 acres of public land to Western settlers accentuated hard feelings in the North. In 1858, a leading ideologue of the Republican Party, William Seward, predicted “an irrepressible conflict” between the two societies.

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

A
House Divided  By the late 1850s, slavery dominated national politics. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the congressional elections of 1858, especially in Illinois where Senator Stephen A. Douglas engaged in a series of famous debates, mostly on the slavery issue, with a little-known Republican challenger named Abraham Lincoln. Increasingly, Southerners became convinced that Northerners wanted not simply to exclude slavery from the Western territories but to destroy it. John Brown’s abolitionist raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia in late 1859 only added to this perception. The subsequent election the following year of Abraham Lincoln, whose Republican Party Southern hardliners believed was committed to abolition, sparked a secession movement that soon brought the nation to the brink of civil war.

The Lincoln-Douglas Debates
 In 1858, national attention turned to Illinois, where Stephen A. Douglas, a leading Democrat and certain 1860 presidential candidate, was running for reelection to the Senate. Many Americans were eager to see which direction he would take on the slavery issue. Opposing him was Abraham Lincoln, a former Illinois state representative and congressman. No abolitionist, Lincoln nevertheless believed slavery was immoral and hoped to prevent its spread to the Western territories. “A house divided against itself cannot stand,” warned Lincoln in his speech accepting the Republican nomination to run for senator. “I believe this Government cannot endure permanently half-slave and half-free.” The overwhelming underdog in the contest, Lincoln boldly challenged Douglas to a series of seven debates across Illinois. The ensuing LincolnDouglas debates focused on the fate of slavery, the legal and social status of African Americans, and the viability of popular sovereignty in the wake of the Dred Scott decision. Douglas portrayed Lincoln as a radical abolitionist and “Black Republican” whose policies would destroy the Union, elevate blacks to social and legal equality with whites, and promote interracial marriage. Lincoln denied these charges but made clear that a black man was “entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” In this “he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.” Lincoln also castigated Douglas for his professed moral indifference toward slavery. “If slavery is not wrong,” Lincoln asserted, “nothing is wrong.” Douglas won reelection to the Senate, but Lincoln had forced him to make statements that appeared both indifferent to slavery and willing to let residents

 in the Western territories ban it, thereby antagonizing both Southern fire-eaters and Northern free soilers. His opponents would use these words against him in the presidential campaign in 1860. More important, the debates made Lincoln a national figure and a rising star within the Republican Party.

 John Brown’s Raid In 1857, just months after staging the Pottawatomie Creek massacre in Kansas, abolitionist John Brown began plotting an invasion of the South that he hoped would lead to a widespread slave revolt and the end of slavery. A deeply religious man raised from an early age to hate slavery, Brown believed God had called upon him to destroy slavery. His sense of mission is revealed in this 1847 daguerreotype (12.18). In it Brown reenacts a scene from a decade earlier when he stood up in a crowded church, raised his right hand, and pledged to commit his life to abolition. Brown’s passion for the cause inspired many supporters and by the summer of 1859, with secret assistance from a number of prominent abolitionists, he had gathered 17 whites (including three of his sons) and five blacks and moved to a farm in Maryland. John Brown’s raid began at eight o’clock on the evening of October 16. Leading his raiders across the Potomac River to Harpers Ferry, Virginia, Brown quickly took control of the town and seized its federal arsenal full of guns and ammunition. They planned to fan out across the South, arming slaves and touching off a wave of rebellion. But they were quickly cornered, and on October 18 U.S. Marines under Colonel Robert E. Lee stormed their stronghold. The soldiers killed ten of Brown’s men, including two of his sons, and took Brown and six others prisoner.

12.18 John Brown Vows to Destroy Slavery
 In 1847, John Brown stood for this daguerreotype taken by African-American photographer Augustus Washington, reenacting a pledge he made to destroy slavery ten years earlier at an abolitionist meeting.

 Six weeks later a Virginia jury found Brown and his men guilty of treason and sentenced them to hang. When given the opportunity to speak, Brown declared that he had acted in accordance with the Bible’s call to fight for justice, a cause for which he was prepared to die. On the day of his execution, Brown wrote one last note that proved eerily prophetic of the coming Civil War. “I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood.” If in life Brown had failed to overthrow slavery, in death he furthered the abolitionist cause by becoming an instant martyr to many in the North. On the day of his execution, bells tolled in hundreds of towns from Boston to Chicago. At rallies and church services, Brown was lionized as a righteous instrument of God. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote of Brown as a Christ-like figure who had made “the gallows as glorious as the cross.” Abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, a life-long pacifist, told an audience in Boston, “I am

 prepared to say ‘success to every slave insurrection at the South and in every slave country.’” Not all Northerners were so enthusiastic, however; opponents of slavery like Lincoln and Greeley criticized Brown’s use of violence. Still there was no denying, observed one Northerner, that the “death of no man in America has ever produced so profound a sensation.” Sensation also struck in the South, but it was one of fear and outrage. Brown’s audacious act rekindled among Southerners what Frederick Douglass called the ever-present “dread and terror” of slave insurrection. Brown’s glorification by Northern editorialists, politicians, and ministers convinced many Southerners that Northern abolitionists would continue to conspire to instigate future slave uprisings to destroy Southern society. “Mr. Seward and his followers,” charged a Mississippi legislator saying that the North’s leading abolitionists, “have declared war upon us.” Increasingly, Southerners talked of dissolving their union with the North to protect their property and way of life. Robert Toombs of Georgia voiced the most pressing concern of Southerners: “Never permit this Federal government to pass into the traitorous hands of the black Republican party.”

The Election of 1860
 Throughout the 1850s, the Democratic Party had managed to withstand the strains of sectional discord that demolished the Whigs and created a Republican Party with virtually no support in the South. But when the Democrats met in April 1860 in Charleston, South Carolina, to nominate a presidential candidate, disagreements between Northern and Southern delegates caused the convention to disband, unable to agree on a nominee. The sectional split became official when a Baltimore convention of mostly Northern Democrats nominated Stephen A. Douglas, a man Southerners had become convinced would not protect slavery. A week later a convention of Southern Democrats also met in Baltimore and nominated John C. Breckinridge, Buchanan’s vice president and a staunch proslavery man from Kentucky. To complicate matters, former Southern Whigs and Know-Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee, a pro-Union slaveholder of moderate views. The split among the Democrats and the emergence of the Constitutional Union Party enhanced Republican chances for victory. Deeming Seward too controversial on the slavery issue, Republicans

Bell of the Constitutional Union Party finished fourth taking three states of the upper South and 13 percent of the popular vote.

It was precisely the scenario Southern extremists had threatened would lead to dissolution of the Union.



 “That the South can afford to live under a Government, the majority of whose citizens … regard John Brown as a martyr and a Christian hero, rather than a murderer … is a preposterous idea.” Baltimore Sun, November 28, 1859

Secession
 Southern fire-eaters, having warned Southerners that the election of a “Black Republican” would lead to the end of slavery and the destruction of their society, wasted no time in calling for secession. Secessionist rallies broke out across the South. Nowhere was secession sentiment stronger than in the epicenter of Southern nationalism, South Carolina. Brushing aside the pleas of moderates to wait until the slave states could agree on a united course of action, South Carolina legislators called a convention to consider secession from the union. On December 20, 1860, this convention unanimously resolved that the “union now subsisting between South Carolina and the other States … is hereby dissolved.” In less than two months, six more states—Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas—also seceded (12.19). One by one their representatives in Washington delivered speeches, resigned, and headed home. Six of the seceded states sent delegates to Montgomery, Alabama, in early February where they organized a government similar to the one they had just left. The major exception, of course, was that its constitution declared slavery legal and protected everywhere in the new nation. They called their new nation the Confederate States of America and elected Jefferson Davis of Mississippi as its first president and Alexander Stephens of Georgia as vice president. They also created a Confederate Seal (12.20) that featured George Washington—not only the foremost Founding Father, but a Virginian and a slave owner—at the center and established his birthday, February 22, as the official birth of the Confederacy. These choices reflected the Confederates’ goal to legitimize secession by comparing it to the thirteen colonies breaking away from Britain during the American Revolution. Even as the new Confederate government took shape, President James Buchanan, a weak and timid leader with Southern sympathies, did little to avert the crisis, claiming that he lacked constitutional

 authority to do anything. Moderates mobilized to see if they could, as in previous sectional crises in 1820, 1833, 1850, and 1854, devise a compromise acceptable to both sections. Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky put forth the leading proposal. The Crittenden Compromise proposed constitutional amendments to protect slavery, including one extending the old Missouri Compromise line of 36° 30' to the Pacific, permitting slavery south of it, prohibiting it to the north. But while president-elect Lincoln expressed a willingness to compromise— including supporting a constitutional amendment protecting slavery where it existed in the South—he would not support the Crittenden Compromise. “On the territorial question,” he said in reference to the Republican opposition to extending slavery into the West, “I am inflexible.” With that the proposal died. Confederate President Jefferson Davis likewise professed an aversion to conflict, but rejected compromise. For the Confederate States of America, the decision to secede was permanent. The citizens of the Confederacy, he argued, asked simply to be left alone. The impasse left moderates in despair, but Lincoln placed his faith in pro-Union sentiment in the South. He believed that for all 12.20 The Confederate Seal: Linking Secession with the Spirit of 1776 By placing George Washington at the center of the Confederate Seal, Southerners sought to legitimize secession by comparing it to the decision of the thirteen colonies to break away from Britain in 1776.

SLAVERY AND SECTIONALISM: THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF 1848–1861

 “The tea has been thrown overboard; the revolution of 1860 has been initiated.” Charleston (S.C.) Mercury, reacting to Lincoln’s election their bluster, Southern fire-eaters would eventually pull back from the brink of disunion and civil war as they had so many times before. After all, eight slave states in the upper South still remained within the Union. His inaugural address (see Competing Visions: Secession or Union?) emphasized reconciliation while also declaring the Union indivisible and secession illegal. Lincoln also asserted his intent to “hold, occupy, and possess” all federal property in the seceded states. Although the seceding states had seized nearly all federal property within their borders, two harbor forts remained in federal control, Fort Pickens in Pensacola, Florida, and Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina.

 With food and other necessities running low at Fort Sumter, Lincoln informed the South Carolina government of his intention to send a ship with non-military supplies to resupply the garrison. For Confederate leaders the moment of truth had arrived. If they submitted to federal authority, secession would appear hollow. If they fired on the ship, they would be branded as the aggressors in the coming struggle. Confederate officials decided to force the issue before the ship arrived and ordered Major Robert Anderson, in command of the fort, to surrender. When Anderson refused, Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard began an artillery assault on the morning of April 12, and by afternoon the next day, the Union garrison surrendered. Southerners exulted in their quick victory, and immediately raised the Confederate flag over the ruins as a symbol of their triumph and sovereignty as an independent nation (12.21). On April 15, Lincoln declared the lower South to be in a state of “insurrection” and called for 75,000 men to enlist to put down the rebellion. The Civil War had begun.

SECESSION OR UNION?
Mississippi’s declaration of secession and Abraham Lincoln’s inaugural address from March 1861 present opposing views on secession. Note how both parties invoke the Constitution and other American traditions to justify their positions. How do the secessionists support their claim that the mere election of Lincoln justified secession? How does Lincoln reject the idea of secession and seek to place the responsibility for hostilities on the seceded states? Patterned on the Declaration of Independence, Mississippi’s declaration of secession sets forth a list of alleged attacks on slavery and states rights by the North. Our position is thoroughly identified with… slavery—the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes… the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth.… These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization.… The hostility to this institution commenced before the adoption of the Constitution…. It has grown until it denies the right of property in slaves, and refuses protection to that right on the high seas, in the Territories, and wherever the government of the United States had jurisdiction. It refuses the admission of new slave States into the Union, and seeks to extinguish it by confining it within its present limits, denying the power of expansion.… It has nullified the Fugitive Slave Law in almost every free State in the Union… It advocates negro equality, socially and politically, and promotes insurrection and incendiarism in our midst. It has enlisted its press, its pulpit and its schools against us, until the whole popular mind of the North is excited and inflamed with prejudice.… It has recently obtained control of the Government, by the prosecution of its… schemes, and destroyed the last expectation of living together in friendship.… Utter subjugation awaits us in the Union, if we should consent longer to remain in it. It is not a matter of choice, but of necessity. We must either submit to degradation, and to the loss of property worth four billions of money, or we must secede from the Union framed by our fathers, to secure this as well as every other species of property. For far less cause than this, our fathers separated from the Crown of England. Our decision is made. We follow their footsteps. We embrace the alternative of separation… The flag of Mississippi, adopted after the state’s secession in January 1861. 
 Lincoln used his inaugural address in March 1861 to respond directly to the assertions contained in the declarations of Mississippi and other seceded states. He attempted to reassure Southerners that his administration was not hostile to their interests, while rejecting their justification for secession. Fellow citizens of the United States: … I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination.… It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence, within any State or States, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances. I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.… In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. In YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail YOU. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. YOU have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to “preserve, protect, and defend it.” I am loathe to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.…

Key Terms
 Compromise of 1850 An attempt by Congress to resolve the slavery question by making concessions to both the North and South, including admission of California and a new Fugitive Slave Act. Fugitive Slave Act A component of the Compromise of 1850 that increased the federal government’s obligation to capture and return escaped slaves to their owners. Underground Railroad A network of safe houses and secret hiding places along routes leading to the North and into Canada (where slavery was prohibited) that helped several thousand slaves gain their freedom between 1830 and 1860. Young America The movement within the Democratic Party that embraced Manifest Destiny and promoted territorial expansion, increased international trade, and the spread of American ideals of democracy and free enterprise abroad. 350 Kansas-Nebraska Act An 1854 act designed to resolve the controversy over whether slavery would be permitted in the Western territories. It repealed the ban on slavery north of 36° 30' (the Missouri Compromise) and created two separate territories, Kansas west of Missouri and Nebraska west of Iowa.

A
Nation Torn Apart The Civil War, 1861–1865
 The Civil War began in 1861 as a conflict over whether Southern states possessed the right to secede from the Union. But when Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation took effect on January 1, 1863, it became a war against slavery. The soldiers depicted in this joyous scene were among the nearly 200,000 African American soldiers who contributed to the Union army’s successful campaign to defeat the Confederacy. In February 1865, a few weeks after the second anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, the popular magazine, Harper’s Weekly, published this drawing, “Entrance of the Fifty-Fifth Massachusetts (colored) Regiment into Charleston Feb 21, 1865.” The image reflected not merely a growing acceptance of slavery’s demise among Northerners, but also the celebration of emancipation as a noble cause, along with restoration of the Union, that helped the North justify the terrible human cost of the war. Emancipation was but one of the many extraordinary aspects of the Civil War that make it the most written-about event in American history. The war pitted American against American, in some cases brother against brother. Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, for example, saw two sons become generals, one Confederate and the other Union. Mary Todd Lincoln, the president’s wife, lost three brothers who fought for the Confederacy. The Civil War was also an unusually bloody war. The 618,000 Americans who died in the four years of conflict far outnumber the 117,000 lost in World War I and the 417,000 in World War II. The war also brought to the fore larger-than-life personalities such as Generals William Tecumseh Sherman, Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, and it produced moments of heroism that would become the stuff of legend. If these aspects of the war explain its popularity as a historical subject, they also indicate why the Civil War has generated such heated debate. For generations Americans have argued over the true cause of the war and why the North won (or as some like to put it, why the South lost). They have debated the significance and wisdom of crucial decisions such as Lee’s move to attack the North in 1863 or Union General George Meade’s failure to pursue the weakened Confederates after Gettysburg. Yet for all this debate, few commentators dispute this fact: The Civil War brought profound social, political, and economic change to the United States. Most also agree that although the war ended the contentious question of slavery, it immediately raised equally challenging questions about racial equality.

 “War for the destruction of liberty must be met by war for the destruction of slavery.” African American leader FREDERICK DOUGLASS





 CHAPTER 13

A NATION TORN APART: THE CIVIL WAR, 1861–1865

Mobilization, Strategy,
 and Diplomacy Neither the North nor South envisioned the character and course of the war that began with the South’s firing on Fort Sumter in April 1861. Both sides had to hastily mobilize, recruit, train, and outfit modern armies. The North possessed overwhelming advantages in population and industry, but the South enjoyed superior military leadership, a white population largely united against invading Union armies, and a hope that France or Britain would intervene in the conflict on their behalf.

Comparative Advantages
 and Disadvantages As North and South prepared for war, both sides believed they would win decisively. Journalist Horace Greeley spoke for many Northerners when he boasted of the president of the Confederate States of America and his administration that “Jeff Davis and Co. will be swinging from the battlements at Washington at least by the 4th of July.” On paper this confidence seemed justified. As the table (13.1) illustrates, the Northern states possessed more than twice the population of the Confederacy, giving the North an enormous advantage in soldiers, farmers, and industrial workers. The North also possessed a vast industrial system, nine times greater than that of the Confederacy. Producing 97 percent of the nation’s firearms, 94 percent of its cloth, and 90 percent of its shoes and boots, this system could

13.1 Union Advantages on the Eve of War, 1861
 The enormous disparities between North and South suggested to many a quick Union victory. But many factors beyond these statistics, notably superior Confederate military leadership, would make for a long and bloody war.

 What significant advantages did the North hold over the South on the eve of war?

 provide the Union armies with unlimited supplies. The North also had a modern railroad system twice the size of the Confederacy’s, and it was far more integrated. A final advantage was the firm belief among many Northern soldiers that they were fighting to uphold the Constitution, and the Union. This sentiment was stoked by a profusion of speeches, songs, and printed matter like the poster The Eagle’s Nest (13.2), extolling the Union cause. Demonizing secession as treason by invoking the famous 1830 declaration of President Andrew Jackson, a Southerner and slave owner, “The Union! It must and shall be preserved,” it also draws on familiar images of patriotism such as the bald eagle and the American flag. Many Northerners believed they were indebted to the Founding Fathers, whose sacrifices won American independence and established a republic where all possessed equal opportunity to succeed. Southerners likewise sought to boost their wartime morale. As the song sheet “Secession Quick Step” (13.3) shows, they often drew on the same patriotic images and themes as Northerners. This song and the accompanying image seek to connect the colonists’ break from Britain during the American Revolution with the South’s quest for Confederate independence. Note the reference to “Minute Men” the “Don’t Tread on Me” snake, a popular image of colonial resistance to British authority in the 1770s (see Chapter 4). Southerners also matched Northerners in their confidence about achieving a quick victory. “Just throw three or four shells among those blue-bellied Yankees,” boasted one North Carolinian, “and they’ll scatter like sheep.” Confederates were keenly aware that although they lacked population, industry, and infrastructure, they possessed certain advantages. To begin with, they

 were fighting a war for independence that carried with it a sense of destiny that would sustain them through the difficult times ahead—just as it had sustained, they reminded themselves, the overmatched colonists in their fight for independence from a superior Great Britain nearly a century earlier. The South also enjoyed an important geographic advantage: To deny Confederate independence, the North had to conquer the South, an area as large as Western Europe. Furthermore, this monumental invasion and occupation would likely unify the South, including poor whites who might otherwise view the conflict as a war to protect the interests of slaveholders. The South could thus fight a defensive war until the North grew tired of the conflict and withdrew, or until a European power, most likely Britain, which depended heavily on Southern cotton, intervened militarily and forced the North to let the states secede. Finally, whether they knew it or not, in April 1861 Southerners had the upper hand in military leadership. For the first half of the war, generals such as Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson would stymie much larger and better-equipped Northern armies led by inept generals.

Mobilization in the North


13.3 Connecting to the Colonial Cause
 As in the North, Southerners fostered unity, emphasizing the connection between the colonists’ revolt against British rule during the American Revolution and the Confederate bid for Southern independence.

 Mobilization of the Union Army began days after the firing at Fort Sumter with Lincoln’s call for 75,000 volunteers for 90 days’ service and the imposition of a naval blockade along the Southern coast. Eager volunteers jammed recruiting stations, convinced the Union would win quickly and with little loss of life. Among those who clamored to join the Army were thousands of free African Americans anxious to defeat the slaveholding South. Yet they were turned away because of an overabundance of white volunteers and Lincoln’s desire to sidestep issues of slavery and race to avoid provoking the slaveholding states that remained in the Union—Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri—from seceding.

 Why did Southerners seek to link secession to the American Revolution?



 CHAPTER 13

A NATION TORN APART: THE CIVIL WAR, 1861–1865

 Unfortunately for Lincoln, the Union Army’s enthusiasm was no substitute for experience. In 1861, there were only 16,000 professional soldiers in the Army, most of them stationed in the West. One-third of the Army’s officers joined the Confederacy. Of those officers who remained, few possessed any real combat experience. To make matters worse, because state officials named the officers to command the new regiments of volunteers, they invariably chose men whose chief qualifications were their political connections and fondness for parading. One regiment, the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry, was perhaps the most vivid example of this phenomenon. As this print (13.4) shows, these volunteers donned flashy uniforms patterned after the Zouaves, France’s famous regiments in Algeria, replete with red silk pantaloons and green jackets. The New York Zouaves enjoyed great celebrity at the war’s outset, and one of them, Colonel Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth (at right), became the Union’s first martyr when he was killed pulling down a Confederate flag in Virginia. Despite their stylishness, however, the 11th New York Zouaves performed disastrously at Bull 13.4 The Zouaves of the 11th New York Many regiments raised to fight for the Union and the Confederacy included inexperienced men whose romantic visions of warfare were expressed in their fanciful uniforms.

 How did the doctrine of states’ rights hinder the Southern war effort?

 Run. As the war progressed both armies replaced special regimental uniforms with Union blue and Confederate gray.

Mobilization in the South
 Unlike the North, the Confederacy needed to create an Army from scratch. Immediately after seceding, Southern states revived, reorganized, and expanded their militias, many of which were more like social clubs than military units. In March 1861, the Confederate Congress established an army of 100,000 volunteers for one-year terms of service, leading to the merging of most state militia companies into the Confederate Army. To thwart the Union’s intended blockade of the Southern coastline, the Confederacy commenced creating a navy and authorizing privateers to seize Union ships. Equipping their soldiers and sailors proved a far greater challenge. Lacking the industrial base of the North, the South built arms factories that eventually turned out some 350,000 rifles. They also imported 700,000 more. Nonetheless, throughout the war Confederate soldiers often needed to scavenge battlefields to find weapons and ammunition. The Confederate effort to thwart the Union blockade was similarly hampered by a lack of shipyards. The Davis administration also had to pay for the war. Possessing few banks and limited reserves of gold and silver, the government tried several schemes, including requiring individual states to pay for the war and imposing an income tax. When none of these policies worked, the Confederate government simply printed paper money. With more than $1 billion in circulation by 1864 (twice the amount issued in the North), the citizens of the Confederacy faced punishing inflation, which reached 9,000 percent by 1865 (as compared with 80 percent in the Union). Another obstacle to Confederate victory was the South’s popular doctrine of states’ rights. It envisioned the ideal national government as one that left most power and authority to the states. Even though the Confederacy ultimately managed to overcome states’ rights opposition and create a centralized national government and military, its efforts were hindered by vociferous critics. Governors Zebulon B. Vance of North Carolina and Joseph E. Brown of Georgia, for example, opposed the incorporation of their state militias into the Confederate Army. Later when the Confederacy enacted a military draft, they raised a loud protest and created hundreds of exemptions for friends and state officials.

 What made the Border States so economically and militarily valuable to the Confederacy?



 CHAPTER 13

A NATION TORN APART: THE CIVIL WAR, 1861–1865

Wartime Diplomacy
 Davis hoped to gain from Britain and France diplomatic recognition for the Confederacy and perhaps even military intervention. He knew the leaders and aristocracy of both countries sympathized with the Confederate cause and that their economies depended heavily on Southern cotton. Accordingly, Davis sent emissaries to Britain and France to lobby for recognition. To increase the chances of foreign intervention, the Confederacy in 1861 also established a cotton embargo, a ban on the export of cotton, the South’s most valuable commodity. Because

 the Confederacy wanted to avoid any appearance of blackmailing cotton-importing nations like Britain and France, the embargo was voluntary and unofficial. Although the embargo damaged the Southern economy, Confederates believed it a worthwhile risk if it caused enough economic pain in Britain and France to, in the words of one Charleston newspaper editor, bring about either “the bankruptcy of every cotton factory in Great Britain or France or the acknowledgement of our independence.” Keenly aware that foreign intervention would likely demolish his goal of restoring the Union, Lincoln dispatched his own emissaries to Britain and France. Shortly after Fort Sumter both nations, seeking to avoid war, declared their neutrality and agreed to honor the Union blockade. This was crucial to the North because had Britain or France insisted on their right as neutrals to trade with the South, Lincoln would have been forced either to stop their ships—a policy certain to draw them into the war—or allow them to pass and thereby provide the Confederacy with badly needed supplies. Despite diplomatic efforts, conflict with Britain soon erupted, threatening British neutrality. In November 1861, a U.S. warship stopped the British ship Trent and removed two Confederates heading for Europe to press for foreign recognition. As indicated in this cartoon (13.6) from the British magazine Punch, Britain reacted with outrage to the Trent Affair, putting its military forces on alert. “You do what is right,” Britannia warns a bellicose but smaller America, “or I’ll blow you out of the water.” Lincoln, determined to avoid war, released the two Confederates, claiming that the captain had acted without authority. The roles were reversed in 1863 when the British government, faced with a Union threat of war, prevented delivery to the Confederacy of two ironclad warships built in a British shipyard.

THE EARLY CAMPAIGNS, 1861–1863



The Early Campaigns, 1861–1863
 Beginning with Bull Run in July 1861, the Confederacy won repeated victories in Virginia, thwarting Union attempts to seize Richmond, the Confederate capital. The Union found success in the West and moved closer to securing control of the Mississippi River. By 1862, new technologies in communications, transportation, and armaments made warfare more complex, protracted, and deadly. The war also assumed a revolutionary character, as slaves flocked to invading Union armies, eventually convincing the Lincoln administration to embrace emancipation as a goal of the war.

No Short and Bloodless War
 In the weeks following Fort Sumter, pressure mounted in both the North and South for a decisive victory, despite the disorganized state of their armies. Although some argued that given the South’s limited resources, its best chance of victory lay with a defensive military posture, most Southerners wanted their army to take the offensive, believing that one or two early victories would bring foreign intervention or prompt Lincoln to abandon efforts to restore the Union by force. Northern leaders faced similar demands. General Winfield Scott had devised a grand strategy called the Anaconda Plan to slowly envelop and strangle the South, but popular sentiment demanded an immediate strike to crush the rebellion. The anticipated first clash, the first Battle of Bull Run, came in mid-July 1861. General Irwin McDowell led 30,000 Union soldiers of the Army of the Potomac south toward the town of Manassas, Virginia, site of an important railroad junction and a small Confederate force commanded by General P. G. T. Beauregard. Hundreds of curious and confident spectators from Washington, D.C., followed the army, many with picnic baskets in hand, hoping to witness some of the excitement. Beauregard positioned his army above Manassas on the south side of a small stream named Bull Run. On July 21 McDowell attacked and nearly drove the Confederates from the field. Beauregard, however, stabilized his troops, and with reinforcements staged a counterassault. Lines of exhausted and undisciplined Union soldiers soon disintegrated into a chaotic, humiliating retreat to Washington. Victory boosted Confederate spirits and confirmed their belief that one Southerner could whip ten Yankees. For the North the stunning humiliation demolished the notion of a short and bloodless war.

 Within a week of the debacle, Lincoln authorized the enlistment of one million volunteers for three-year terms of service. To rebuild the demoralized Army of the Potomac, Lincoln turned to General George B. McClellan. Dubbed the “Young Napoleon” by the press, McClellan was an impressive but arrogant man who treated Lincoln with barely disguised contempt. Lincoln tolerated this disrespect because McClellan inspired professionalism among his troops and by the spring of 1862, had transformed a mass of inexperienced volunteers into a well-trained army numbering some 150,000.

 “I seem to have become the power of the land. I almost think that were I to win some small success now I could become Dictator or anything else that might please me.” GEN. GEORGE B. McCLELLAN to his wife, 1861 As the Army of the Potomac regrouped, Union forces in the West gained two desperately needed victories. As indicated in the map (13.7 on page 382), in February 1862, Union forces led by a virtual unknown named Ulysses S. Grant seized Forts Henry and Donelson. The twin victories gave the Union control of vital communication and transportation routes on the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers and drove the Confederates out of Kentucky and most of Tennessee. They also created an early hero—Ulysses S. Grant—whose initials, the press suggested, stood for “Unconditional Surrender.” Grant continued south along the Tennessee River to seize more railroad lines as part of the

 Why did the Peninsular Campaign fail?

The Peninsular Campaign
 Lincoln welcomed the successes in the West, but recognized that defeat of the Confederacy required victory over its armies in Northern Virginia. Accordingly, he pressed McClellan to begin an offensive early in 1862. Despite his gallant martial image, however, McClellan seemed unwilling to fight, claiming his troops were not yet prepared. Only after weeks of goading did he agree to begin an offensive. The Peninsular Campaign, as his plan was known, reflected McClellan’s flamboyant style. Rather than a direct overland march on Richmond, he designed a complex plan whereby 400 ships deposited 120,000 soldiers on a long peninsula just east of Richmond at Fortress Monroe, between the James and York Rivers (13.8). To Lincoln’s frustration it took three weeks for the soldiers to get in place. Then McClellan continued to delay. The Confederates exploited McClellan’s delays by sending 17,000 men under General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson into the Shenandoah Valley. There between early May and June, he defeated larger Union forces, raising fears that he would capture Washington. Concerned for the capital’s security, Lincoln withheld a large force of 30,000 that was scheduled to join McClellan. When McClellan finally began to inch his army toward Richmond in late May, he confronted Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston in the Battle of Fair Oaks from May 31 to June 1, 1862. Although technically a Union victory since Johnston failed to dislodge McClellan’s army, the battle proved inconclusive. Yet it was a turning point in the war because Johnston, severely injured, was replaced by General Robert E. Lee. Lee proved a brilliant commander and strategist who made the most of the Confederacy’s limited resources to bedevil and defeat much larger Union forces. Often this meant taking the offensive as in the Seven Days Battle (June 25–July 1, 1862). Lee attacked with 85,000 troops against McClellan’s 110,000 and forced the Union commander to retreat to a secure location on the James River. The week-long clash produced staggering carnage, but McClellan lost proportionately fewer men than Lee, and his army lay just 25 miles from Richmond. He refused, however, to move on Lee’s

 killing a man from a distance of 400 to 500 yards (versus 100 yards for traditional muskets). The key technological breakthrough for the rifle was the minie ball, invented in France in the 1840s. As these photographs (13.9) show, the conical-shaped minie ball (left) replaced round musket balls (right) and were the forerunners of the bullet. The grooves inside the rifle barrel caused the minie ball, when fired, to spiral much like a football, increasing its accuracy. Other aspects of modern war included the emphasis on destroying the enemy’s army rather than merely seizing and holding territory and a willingness to inflict suffering on the civilian population. Military commanders on both sides, however, were slow to adjust to these changes. Schooled in traditional warfare at military academies such as West Point, most were reluctant to abandon the strategy of attacking entrenched enemy positions with massed infantry. When defenders of these positions turned their modern weaponry on charging soldiers, the results were horrific.

Toward Emancipation
 Along with modern technology, slavery also shaped the Civil War. At the outset of the conflict, moderates like Lincoln insisted the goal of the war was to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. They realized that while many Northerners opposed slavery, they also rejected the idea of racial equality. They also feared that talk of emancipation would cause the Border States to secede and alienate pro-Union residents of the South, who Lincoln hoped would overthrow Confederate rule and return their states to the Union. Abolitionists, however, argued that because the Southern states seceded to protect slavery, reunion could occur only after it was destroyed. But while white Northerners debated emancipation, enslaved African Americans in the South

 took matters into their own hands by fleeing to Union Army lines. Only weeks after the war began, in May 1861, an angry Virginia slaveholder demanded the Union Army observe the terms of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act and return his three escaped slaves. General Benjamin Butler refused, declaring fugitive slaves contraband of war, or seized property. The Lincoln administration endorsed the contraband policy as a shrewd war tactic likely to cause havoc in the South. Self-emancipating slaves continued to arrive at Union Army camps in ever-growing numbers, totaling close to one million by the war’s end (see Images as History: Who Freed the Slaves?). In response to these events, Congress slowly began the process of dismantling slavery. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act declared free any slaves used in the Confederate war effort. A Second Confiscation Act in July 1862 empowered the army to seize and render “forever free” the slaves of anyone aiding the Confederacy. That same month Congress authorized the president to let African Americans fight in the Union Army. These measures demonstrated a growing understanding among Northerners that winning the war required the abolition of slavery. The threat to slavery posed by these actions was not lost on Southerners, who feared not only the loss of their slaves but also a large-scale slave insurrection. Slave escapes, rumors of slave revolts, and the increased insubordination of many slaves led to rising anxiety among Southerners. They accordingly stepped up slave patrols and scrutinized slave behavior for any sign of ill intent. Lincoln gradually came to see emancipation not merely as inevitable but as essential for Union victory, since it would “strike at the heart of the rebellion” and prevent British intervention. On July 22, 1862, he informed the cabinet of his intent to issue a decree of emancipation. But to avoid the appearance of acting in desperation, Lincoln waited for a Union victory before issuing this decree. The Union victory came two months later in mid-September at the Battle of Antietam, in Maryland. Lee, choosing to wage a bold offensive, led his army north into Maryland. McClellan, even after acquiring a copy of the Confederate battle plan, reacted slowly, allowing Lee to consolidate his troops. Finally, on September 17, 1862, McClellan attacked Lee’s army. After squandering several chances to defeat Lee, McClellan’s forces were eventually stymied by the last-minute arrival of Confederate reinforcements. The next day,

WHO FREED THE SLAVES?
Why did Abraham Lincoln decide to issue the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, after stating many, many times that he had no intention of abolishing slavery? There were several reasons, not the least of which was that one year into the war the Confederacy seemed as strong as ever. Lincoln decided that attacking slavery would hasten the end of the war. But there is another, often overlooked reason for Lincoln to change and decide to embrace abolition: From the moment the war began, thousands of slaves began to flee to freedom, often to the camps of Union soldiers. This wave of selfemancipation, vividly captured in this 1867 painting by Theodor Kaufmann, “On to Liberty,” forced the Lincoln administration to formulate wartime policies regarding slavery, a process that ultimately led to emancipation. 
 But even as Kaufmann and others celebrated African Americans’ role in their own liberation, white Americans after the war began to present a different—and inaccurate—version of the story (see Chapter 14). Former slaves raised most of the money to pay for the Freedmen’s Memorial that was unveiled in 1876 in Washington, D.C. But they were excluded from the committee in charge of the monument’s design. As a result, the monument celebrated President Lincoln as the sole individual responsible for emancipation while depicting African Americans as passive figures who played no role at all in gaining their freedom.

 Kaufmann contrasts the darkness of slavery, which the escapees are fleeing, with the bright light of freedom they are moving toward.

 Unlike most images of African Americans in this period, Kaufmann portrays these women as dignified and courageous agents pursuing freedom for their families.

 This smoke is emanating from a battle between Union and Confederate armies. Long before the Emancipation Proclamation, slaves came to believe that the Union Army somehow represented their liberation. So they headed to Union lines, despite the danger. By presenting Lincoln as standing over the kneeling slave, the sculptor emphasizes his—and by extension all white people’s— superiority over African Americans. Note how there are no white people in Kaufmann’s scene of liberation.

13.10 Dead
 Soldiers along the Sunken Road, Antietam (1862) The Civil War was the first military conflict in American history captured by the relatively new medium of photography. Photographs such as this one taken by Alexander Gardner after the Battle of Antietam, brought home to millions of Americans the brutality of modern war. war.

A NATION TORN APART: THE CIVIL WAR, 1861–1865

 McClellan chose not to attack, despite superior numbers and the shattered condition of Lee’s army. The following day Lee led his army back into Virginia, handing McClellan a technical victory (a frustrated Lincoln, however, soon removed him from command). The battle, as indicated by the grim scene (13.10) of its aftermath captured by photographer Alexander Gardner, claimed 6,000 lives and left 17,000 wounded, making it the deadliest single day of the war. Shortly after Antietam in September 1862, Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. Unless the seceded states and parts thereof that were not under Union Army control returned to the Union by January 1, 1863, the decree warned, their slaves “shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.” Even though the decree left slavery intact in the Border States and areas held by the Union Army, Lincoln knew conservatives, Northern Democrats, and Border State Unionists would react negatively and that Republicans might suffer at the polls that November. Still, he reasoned, the benefits of emancipation far outweighed the risks as it would cause chaos by encouraging slaves to flee their masters and make it highly unlikely that Britain, where anti-slavery sentiment was strong, would intervene in the conflict.

 Why did photography have a more powerful impact on the public than artists’ depictions of battles?

 Though some radicals and abolitionists expressed dismay because the proclamation freed slaves only in the seceded states, they recognized that Lincoln’s simple, terse statement of military policy had transformed the meaning of the conflict. If Northerners by late 1862 realized the war was no mere “insurrection,” they also understood that its goal was something greater than simply a restored Union. It was now a war of subjugation. Reunion would occur only after the fabric of Southern society was destroyed.

Slaughter and Stalemate
 Restoring the Union and abolishing slavery, of course, depended entirely on victory in the field. But the Army of the Potomac, now commanded by General Ambrose E. Burnside, suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. Burnside tried one more offensive on January 22, 1863, a disastrous mid-winter effort that became mired in muddy, impassible roads. A despondent Lincoln replaced Burnside with General Joseph Hooker. Not all the news from the Union battlefields in late 1862 was negative. On December 31 Union troops under General William S. Rosecrans turned back an attempt by Confederate General Braxton Bragg to regain western Tennessee and Kentucky in the Battle of Murfreesboro. Bragg’s retreat left the West firmly in the hands of the Union Army for the rest of the war. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia, however, continued to thwart the Union effort to take Richmond. In the Battle of Chancellorsville, April 30– May 6, 1863, despite commanding a force half the size of Hooker’s, Lee scored a smashing victory. But it came at a price: Stonewall Jackson, the man Lee had come to count on most, was killed accidentally by his own men.

BEHIND THE LINES



Behind the Lines
 The war brought challenges and hardships to the Union and Confederate home fronts. Civilians faced shortages of goods, soaring inflation, and conscription. These conditions were more severe in the South where many civilians also came under Union military rule. These problems, coupled with mounting death tolls, led to sagging morale and rising criticism of political leaders in both regions. Occasionally discontent exploded into violent riots. The war placed an especially great demand on women, who assumed new occupational and civic roles.

Meeting the Demands
 of Modern War While war raged in the East and West, Republicans took advantage of their dominant position in Congress to enact legislation long opposed by Southerners. Most were policies to promote industrialization (a high tariff) and westward settlement (the Homestead and Pacific Railway Acts). Several laws, however, were part of an unprecedented effort to outfit and finance a modern army. The National Bank Acts of 1863 and 1864 established a national banking system whereby member banks could issue treasury notes, or “greenbacks,” as currency. The nation’s first income tax, the sale of $400 million in bonds to the public, and the borrowing of $2.6 billion from banks helped pay for the war. The cost of the war increased the federal budget twenty-fold during the war, from $63 million in 1861 to $1.3 billion in 1865. All told, the war effort greatly expanded the size and scope of the federal government. In contrast to the Union’s ability to sustain the war effort, Davis and other Confederate leaders soon discovered that there were limits to Southerners’ willingness to adapt to the demands of modern warfare. In response to the need for more soldiers and revenue, the Confederate Congress established a military draft and an income tax in April 1862. Officials across the Confederacy denounced the measures as gross violations of states’ rights. Among the loudest protestors was Alexander Stephens, Davis’s own vice president. Southerners evaded both the draft and income tax to such an extent that neither measure produced the needed men or money. Draft and tax evasion also occurred on a large scale in the North, to be sure, but greater supplies of men and money diminished their impact.

 These limits were compounded by President Davis. Despite his extensive political and military experience, he proved an ineffective leader for a time of crisis. Unlike Lincoln, he selected a weak cabinet to prevent challenges to his authority and bristled at the slightest disagreement. He also micromanaged the War Department, firing or driving to resignation five secretaries of war in four years. The Confederate Army’s success in the war’s first two years obscured Davis’s flaws, but as the Army’s fortunes declined after 1862, the president’s leadership style sparked rancor and disunity.

Hardships on the
Home Front
 While soldiers fought in the field, civilians in the North and South faced a number of hardships. In the North the arms, metalworking, boot making, and shipbuilding industries boomed, but the scarcity of cotton caused widespread layoffs and closures in the textile industry. Workers’ wages rose by 40 percent, but prices rose even faster as inflation averaged 15 percent annually. In response many workers formed and joined craft unions, but appeals to patriotism and the use of strikebreakers discouraged strikes. Southerners faced far worse economic problems. The Southern economy was hard-hit by the cessation of trade with the North and Europe due to the Union blockade. Southern industry and agriculture were hindered by chronic labor shortages due to military service and by the flight of slaves, and the destruction or seizure of farms and factories by Union armies. As a result, the production of goods and agricultural produce in the South decreased by 30 percent during the war. By contrast Northern output increased significantly. These conditions led to shortages of nearly everything in the South,

 including food, and the emergence of a thriving black market. The cartoon (13.11) from a Richmond newspaper captured the anger among Southerners directed at speculators and black marketers. A coldhearted speculator counts his profits as a hungry mother and child look through his window. “Anathema on him who screws and hoards / who robs the poor of wheat, potatoes, and bread,” read the first two lines of the accompanying poem.

New Roles for Women
 The war changed the lives of millions of women who remained behind the lines in both the North and South. With hundreds of thousands of men gone to war, women assumed new roles running farms and shops and working in factories and offices. Many did so out of a sense of duty to the war effort, whereas others worked to earn badly needed income, as military pay was low and inflation pushed up the cost of living.

13.11 Anger on
 the Home Front Runaway inflation and scarcity of necessities sparked angry accusations that speculators were hoarding supplies and selling them at extortionate prices. Here a speculator counts his profits while a starving mother and child look on.

 What new opportunities did the war open up for women?

 The war also enabled women to enter previously male-dominated professions such as teaching, civil service, and nursing. In nursing, the shortage of men and the recruitment efforts by women like Dorothea Dix, head of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, led to thousands of women volunteering to serve as nurses in field hospitals despite opposition from male doctors and others who disapproved of women working in such indelicate situations. Supporters argued that women brought to the profession nurturing and domestic skills. As Clara Barton, Civil War nurse and future founder of the American Red Cross, put it, at the end of the war, the American woman “was at least fifty years in advance of the normal position which continued peace would have assigned her.” Over the next 30 years women took over almost completely the profession of nursing. Many women also joined organizations that actively supported the Union cause, such as the Women’s Central Association of Relief, whose 7,000 chapters across the North raised money and sent supplies to the soldiers in the field. Southern women experienced similar changes during the war. They took on new responsibilities such as running farms and plantations, managing stores, working in government, and serving as nurses. Many worked in factories, including more than 500 employed by the Confederate Ordnance Department to fill cartridges, dangerous work that killed dozens in explosions. Their jobs grew more demanding as the war demolished the Southern economy and sent food prices soaring. The Union Army’s sweep across the South in late 1864 and early 1865 left many Southern women and their children destitute and hungry.

 Many Southern women also faced the challenge of maintaining the slave labor system, an increasingly difficult task as thousands of slaves fled to Union lines, leaving farms and plantations with inadequate labor. Many slaves who did not flee took advantage of a planter’s absence and challenged the authority of women unaccustomed to the role of master. As one exasperated wife wrote to her husband, “The Negroes are all expecting to be set free very soon and it causes them to be very troublesome.”

Copperheads
 One group that benefitted from the hard times in the North was the Democratic Party. Even though many Northerners associated it with secession and the Confederacy, it remained a viable political power in the North during the war. After all, it had received 44 percent of the popular vote there in 1860. Many Democrats supported the war against secession, but Copperheads (or “peace Democrats”) argued for a cease-fire, followed by a negotiated peace settlement even if it resulted in an independent Confederacy. A few Copperheads even expressed support for the Confederacy. Lincoln viewed the opposition of Copperheads to the Union war effort as seditious, if not treasonous, and took steps early to squelch it. After the pro-Confederate rioting in Baltimore in 1861, he suspended habeas corpus, citing the section of the Constitution providing “the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.” In so doing, Lincoln established a principle he followed for the rest of the war. To save the Union and the Constitution, he would not hesitate to suppress Constitutional guarantees of free speech and the right to a speedy trial. Over the next few years, thousands of Copperheads were jailed for lengthy periods without trial. Copperheads initially attracted few followers, but dissatisfaction with the

 war rose in the winter of 1862–1863 after repeated Union Army failures and the enactment of the controversial Emancipation Proclamation and military draft. Led by former Ohio Congressman Clement Vallandigham, Copperheads denounced Lincoln as a tyrant who abused his power and suppressed free speech by shutting down opposition newspapers and arresting people who voiced hostility toward the Union war effort or sympathy for the Confederacy. Copperheads gained support among farmers in the West by claiming the new Republican tariff hurt them economically and among urban workers and immigrants by stoking racial fears that emancipation would lead to social chaos and job competition. To counter rising Copperhead sentiment, pro-Union speakers, editors, and cartoonists vilified Copperheads as dangerous, disloyal men who threatened the Union. In February 1863, Harper’s Weekly printed the cartoon shown in Competing Visions: Civil Liberties in a Civil War (see page 390). The cartoonist shows the goddess Liberty, who is bearing a shield labeled “Constitution” and a drawn sword, being prevented from engaging in battle against the Confederacy by three peace Democrats depicted as copperhead snakes. To squelch Copperhead activism, the Lincoln administration stepped up arrests. On May 5, 1863, a Union Army commander in Ohio arrested Vallandigham after he delivered a speech denouncing the war and the draft.

Conscription and
Civil Unrest
 Despite the Lincoln administration’s crackdown on Copperhead dissent, opposition to the war among Northerners increased in 1863, especially among those expected to fight. The poor performance of the Union Army in the field, coupled with staggering numbers of killed and wounded, extinguished much of the early enthusiasm for war. Despite offers of cash bonuses and time off in exchange for reenlistment, Union soldiers were heading home as their enlistment terms expired, and recruitment offices now went begging for new recruits. To solve the manpower problem, in March 1863, Congress passed the Conscription Act, which declared all male citizens (and immigrants who had applied for citizenship) aged 20–45 eligible for draft into the army. Each state was assigned a quota of men. If drafted a man could avoid service. He could buy his way out by paying a “commutation fee” of

Competing Visions
CIVIL LIBERTIES IN A CIVIL WAR
The following opinions present opposing views on the constitutionality of Lincoln’s policy toward Copperheads. One is a series of resolutions adopted and sent to Lincoln by Democrats. The other is Lincoln’s formal response. Note what the parties define as the greatest threat to civil liberties and the Constitution. Were Lincoln’s actions justified? Are principles such as civil liberties subject to different treatment during a national crisis such as war? On May 19, 1863, a meeting of Democrats, including former Congressman Erastus Corning, in Albany, New York, passed and delivered to Lincoln a series of resolutions accusing the administration of having acted unconstitutionally in placing military authority over civil authority. … Resolved, … we denounce the recent assumption of a military commander to seize and try a citizen of Ohio, Clement L. Vallandigham, for no other reason than words addressed to a public meeting, in criticism of the course of the administration, and in condemnation of the military orders of that general. Resolved, That this assumption of power by a military tribunal, if successfully asserted, not only abrogates the right of the people to assemble and discuss the affairs of government, the liberty of speech and of the press, the right of trial by jury, the law of evidence, and the privilege of habeas corpus, but it strikes a fatal blow at the supremacy of law, and the authority of the State and federal constitutions. Resolved, … That, regarding the blow struck at a citizen of Ohio as aimed at the rights of every citizen of the north, we denounce it as against the spirit of our laws and Constitution, and most earnestly call upon the President of the United States to reverse the action of the military tribunal which has passed a “cruel and unusual punishment” upon the party arrested, prohibited in terms by the Constitution, and to restore him to the liberty of which he has been deprived. 
 On June 12, 1863, Lincoln defended his actions as both constitutional and necessary for the preservation of the Union. GENTLEMEN: …Ours is a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion; and the provision of the Constitution that “the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it,” is the provision which specially applies to our present case.… … Mr. Vallandigham avows his hostility to the war on the part of the Union; and his arrest was made because he was laboring, with some effect, to prevent the raising of troops; to encourage desertions from the army; and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it. He was not arrested because he was damaging the political prospects of the administration, or the personal interests of the commanding general, but because he was damaging the army, upon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends. He was warring upon the military, and this gave the military constitutional jurisdiction to lay hands upon him. Long experience has shown that armies cannot be maintained unless desertion shall be punished by the severe penalty of death.… Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts, while I must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert? … I think that in such a case, to silence the agitator and save the boy is not only constitutional, but withal a great mercy. I … [am un]able to appreciate the danger apprehended by the meeting [in Albany] that the American people will, by means of military arrests during the rebellion, lose the right of public discussion, the liberty of speech and the press, the law of evidence, trial by jury, and habeas corpus, throughout the indefinite peaceful future, … any more than I am able to believe that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during temporary illness as to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder of his healthful life.

 Northern Unionists depicted Copperheads as traitors who threatened the Republic. Here Liberty defends herself from the Copperheads with the shield of Union.

 How did Lincoln justify the suspension of habeas corpus?

BEHIND THE LINES

 $300 to the government or hire a substitute to serve in his place. Men lacking such substantial sums of money ($300 was equivalent to a year’s pay for a common laborer) could simply disappear—which more than 20 percent of draftees did. The draft began in early July and touched off widespread protest. Disturbances broke out in Boston; Troy, New York; Wooster, Ohio; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and other cities. Opposition to the draft was greatest in New York City, where on July 13, 1863, it erupted in unprecedented violence known as the Draft Riots. For four days mobs of mostly poor, immigrant, and working-class rioters attacked draft offices, Union Army recruiting stations, institutions associated with the Republican Party or abolition, and symbols of wealth and privilege, reflecting animosity toward the inequity that allowed the rich to pay a $300 fee to avoid the draft. Rioters also attacked African Americans. As the image (13.12) illustrates, they lynched at least eighteen. Rioters blamed blacks as the cause of the war and feared them as potential labor competition. The riots resulted in at least 119 deaths and $5 million in property damage. Officials eventually defused opposition to the draft by raising money to pay the $300 commutation fee or hire substitutes for draftees not willing to join the army and allowing

 easy exemptions for reasons of health or family considerations. Discontent and unrest also rocked the Confederate home front. In October 1862, the Confederate Congress passed what came to be known as the “Twenty Negro Law.” It exempted from the draft one white man per plantation that held 20 or more slaves. Supporters argued that the measure was vital to maintaining order and productivity on plantations, but to poor white Southerners it engendered levels of anger and protest similar to those evoked by the commutation provisions in the North. Many cited the law as the reason they deserted from the Confederate Army. Another source of discontent was the shortage of food brought about by drought, the blockade, and Union conquest of Southern territory. When shortages and high prices reached critical proportions in 1863, Southern women led food riots in several towns and cities, including most dramatically in Richmond. “Bread! Bread!” they cried, “Our children are starving while the rich roll in wealth!” The reference to the rich reflected the widespread belief that Confederate leaders and merchants were profiting from the war.

 CHAPTER 13

A NATION TORN APART: THE CIVIL WAR, 1861–1865

Toward Union Victory
 Despite many setbacks, by mid-1863, the North’s superior industrial strength, large population, and improved military leadership gave the Union the advantage. So, too, did the decision to allow African Americans to serve in the army, for they provided the Union with badly needed manpower when enlistments were declining. Victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg, and Atlanta boosted morale in the North and led to Lincoln’s reelection in 1864. Relentless military offensives by Grant in Virginia and William T. Sherman in Georgia led to the Confederate surrender in April 1865. The assassination of President Lincoln, however, dampened the North’s joy.

Turning Point: 1863
 Although the destruction and antiwar sentiment in New York City shocked Lincoln, events elsewhere in 1863 gave him hope. Back in May, Lee had convinced Davis to approve another invasion of the North. It was risky, but they believed it might force Lincoln to pull troops out of the western theater where Grant was threatening to seize the entire lower Mississippi. A victory on Northern soil would also demoralize the Lincoln administration and strengthen the Copperheads and Peace Democrats who were calling for a negotiated settlement. It might even convince France or Britain to intervene. In June, Lee headed north through Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley into Maryland and Pennsylvania. Although slow to react, the Army of the Potomac, now under General George G. Meade, eventually caught up with Lee in central Pennsylvania. On July 1, the two armies collided at Gettysburg, a small town at the junction of several major roads. Although outnumbered 90,000 to 75,000, the Confederates made significant advances that day. The following day the battle’s momentum swung back and forth before Union forces pushed the Confederates back to the previous day’s position. On the third and decisive day, Lee recklessly ordered an all-out assault on the fortified Union center. “Pickett’s Charge,” as it became known, proved gallant, but suicidal. Union forces devastated General George Pickett’s 12,000 men as they tried to cross a mile of open field and ascend Cemetery Ridge. “Picket’s division just seemed to melt away,” recalled one witness. “Nothing but stragglers came back.” With 23,000 Union and 28,000 Confederate soldiers killed and wounded, Gettysburg was by far the bloodiest battle of the war.

 Why did Lee decide to invade the North a second time?

 The next day, July 4, having lost one-third of his men, Lee retreated back toward Virginia. Although frustrated that Meade failed to pursue, Lincoln nonetheless recognized that the Union had won a major victory. Gettysburg marked the last time the Confederate Army invaded the North. That same day Lincoln received news of a vital victory in the West. In May Grant had begun a siege of Vicksburg, the Confederacy’s last stronghold on the Mississippi River. It fell on July 4, severing the Confederacy in two and giving the Union control over the entire Mississippi.

African Americans
 under Arms But the Union Army was still far from ultimate victory. One of the most formidable challenges it faced was finding new recruits. Declining enlistments of whites, and lobbying by black leaders and abolitionists eventually convinced Union officials to form African American regiments. Thousands of free African American men already toiled for the Union Army, moving supplies and building fortifications; now they would have the chance to fight to defeat the Confederacy and end slavery. One of the first and the most famous of all the African American regiments was the 54th Massachusetts, organized in 1863 by leading black abolitionists. “I urge you to fly to arms and smite with death the power that would bury the government and your liberty in the same hopeless grave,” read a recruitment pamphlet written by Frederick Douglass. Among the regiment’s members were two of Douglass’s sons, Lewis and Charles, and the grandson of Sojourner Truth, James Caldwell. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, son of a leading white Massachusetts abolitionist family, commanded the regiment.

TOWARD UNION VICTORY

 African American soldiers experienced many forms of racism within the Union Army. They served in strictly segregated units under white officers and, as this drawing (13.13) indicates, initially served mainly in noncombat duty as guards and laborers. Many also charged that they received substandard medical care compared to white soldiers. Most galling, as seen in Choices and Consequences: Equal Peril, Unequal Pay (page 394), was that African American soldiers received lower pay than white soldiers. African American soldiers also faced brutal treatment at the hands of Confederates when captured. The Davis administration announced that African American soldiers taken prisoner would be subject to execution as rebellious slaves. Lincoln’s threat of retaliation prevented the Confederacy from carrying out this policy on a wide scale, but African Americans were murdered, tortured, and mutilated. In the most egregious incident (13.14 on page 395), the Fort Pillow Massacre in Tennessee, Confederate troops murdered dozens of captured black soldiers

 in April 1864. This image, which ran in a popular Northern magazine, depicted Confederates as brutal and inhumane. Southern publications ran similar images that alleged Northern atrocities. The creation of all-black units in the Union Army raised another critical issue beyond the question of equality of pay or the assignment of white officers to lead them. Would these units be sent into actual combat? Racist notions led whites to question whether African Americans possessed the courage to fight. Others cautioned that if black

 by Racism Believing African Americans lacked the courage to fight under fire, Union commanders initially relegated them to noncombat roles. Eventually, however, blacks fought in 449 battles, including the Battle of Milliken’s Bend on June 7, 1863 (center).

Choices and Consequences
EQUAL PERIL, UNEQUAL PAY
At first, the War Department planned to pay African American soldiers the same $13 per month (plus $3.50 for clothes) as white soldiers. Indeed, as the recruitment poster below shows, many early black recruits received equal pay. But in June 1863, the Lincoln administration, fearing a backlash among white soldiers who did not see African Americans as their equals, adopted a two-tier wage scale that paid black soldiers just $7 per month (plus $3 for clothes). Outraged, African American officers and enlisted men of the 54th and 55th Massachusetts (Colored) Infantry pondered their options. 
Choices




 Quietly accept the lower wages as a regrettable but unavoidable trade-off that allowed them to enlist in the Union Army and fight to end slavery.



 Accept the unequal wages as better than nothing and necessary to maintain their families, while protesting the injustice and lobbying for equal pay.



 Reject the lower wages on principle, despite the financial hardship on their families, while fulfilling their duties as soldiers, protesting the injustice, and lobbying for equal pay.



 Lay down their arms and refuse to obey orders until they received equal pay.

Decision
 The men chose the third option, rejecting the lower wages on principle, despite the financial hardship on their families. They even rejected an offer by the governor of Massachusetts to pay the $6 per month difference out of the state treasury, citing the principle of equality that was at stake. Meanwhile they fulfilled their duties as soldiers, protested the injustice, and lobbied the Lincoln administration for equal pay.

Consequences
 The soldiers and their families hung on for more than a year until Congress in June 1864 authorized an equal pay scale for all soldiers regardless of race. By then, given the well-documented professionalism and courage exhibited by black soldiers on the battlefield, the distinction in pay had become an embarrassment to Lincoln’s administration. Not all black regiments, however, made the same decision as the Massachusetts 54th and 55th, and the consequences of their actions were starkly different. Sergeant William Walker of the 21st U.S. Colored Infantry had his men lay down their arms in protest over unequal pay. He was convicted of mutiny and executed.

Continuing Controversies
 How were African Americans in the military treated after the Civil War? The U.S. army eradicated the two-tier pay scale, but not racial segregation. African American leaders protested segregation, but for all subsequent wars through World War II, black soldiers and sailors served in segregated units under mostly white officers. President Harry Truman ordered the military desegregated in 1948.

 What role did African American soldiers play in the Union war effort?

TOWARD UNION VICTORY

 regiments were not used judiciously, critics would accuse the army of racism, asserting it carelessly sent them into harm’s way. The first well-publicized test of African American soldiers came on July 18, 1863, when the 54th Massachusetts led a nighttime assault on Fort Wagner, a key Confederate outpost that guarded Charleston harbor. The Confederates repulsed their attack. But the courage exhibited by the soldiers—the unit lost 100 dead and 146 were wounded—won them universal praise and undermined the racist belief that blacks would not fight. All told 198,000 blacks, including 144,000 former slaves, served in the Union Army and Navy. This number amounted to 10 percent of the total enlisted men even though African Americans comprised only 1 percent of the Northern population. African American soldiers participated in over 449 separate engagements against Confederate troops and 38,000 died during the war. Sixteen black soldiers and four black sailors received the Medal of Honor. “The colored soldiers in this four years’ struggle,” wrote one African American soldier, “have proven themselves in every respect to be men.” Their contribution to the Union war effort proved vital to winning the war.

 Most significant, African American service in the war empowered them to claim full citizenship after the war. “Once let the black man get upon his person the brass letters, U.S., let him get an eagle on his button and a musket on his shoulder and bullets in his pocket,” said Frederick Douglass, “there is no power on earth that can deny that he has earned the right to citizenship.”

The Confederacy Begins
 to Crumble News of the losses at Gettysburg and Vicksburg caused dismay across the South. Moreover, Davis and the Confederate leadership had other reasons to worry. The immediate problem was a lack of men. A draft instituted in April 1862 failed to attract enough recruits. Protests by poor whites forced the revision in 1863 of a provision in the draft law that exempted wealthy whites who held 20 or more slaves, but still new recruits fell short of the number needed. The continued loss of territory to the Union Army exacerbated this trend, as did a sharp rise in desertions, which topped 100,000 by late 1864.

Envisioning Evidence
HUMAN RESOURCES IN THE ARMIES OF THE CIVIL WAR
At the outset of the Civil War the Union possessed roughly two and a half times the population of the Confederacy (23 million vs. 9 million). This advantage translated into an immediate and lasting military advantage, as it allowed the Union to field a much larger army and navy throughout the course of the war. Indeed, as the data below shows, this manpower advantage increased over the course of the four-year conflict, in part because of the Lincoln administration’s decision to allow African Americans to serve in the military (and the Confederacy’s resistance to this idea until the last weeks of the war). The Union also enjoyed a much larger and steadily increasing population of immigrants from which to draw fresh recruits. Had the war lasted two or three years, these differences in manpower might not have had played such an important role in determining its outcome. But it lasted four years and it was in the last one that the manpower disparity became most pronounced and significant in determining the final outcome. Relative Military Strength, 1862–1865

 The surging number of Union troops in 1863 reflected the imposition of the draft and the decision to allow African Americans into the army.

 Desertions caused much of the decline in Confederate forces (as many as 100,000 deserted in 1864–1865). Confederate leaders in 1864 responded by expanding the age range of men eligible for the draft to 17 to 50 (from 18 to 35 in 1862).

 Both sides suffered huge numbers of casualties in the fierce fighting of 1864. But the Union was able to replace its fallen soldiers far more easily than the Confederacy.

TOWARD UNION VICTORY

 By mid-1863, the inherent weaknesses of the Confederate economy began to show. The Union blockade, which had stopped only one in eight Confederate ships in 1862, grew increasingly effective. By 1864, it stopped one out of every three Confederate blockade-runners and half of them by 1865. The impact on the import-dependent Southern economy was devastating. Civilians and soldiers alike suffered shortages of food, clothing, and equipment. The growing success of the Union blockade also exposed a critical miscalculation made by the Davis administration in 1861. The embargo on cotton exports failed because Britain possessed a surplus of cotton in 1861 and later found alternative sources in Egypt and India. Moreover, English workers, including an estimated half million who lost their jobs due to cotton shortages, expressed strong sympathy for the Union and thereby made British intervention on behalf of the Confederacy politically controversial. When the South finally lifted the embargo in 1862, the Union blockade was much stronger. The Confederacy’s economic dilemma posed a serious threat to its chances for success. It desperately needed hard currency to buy ships, weapons, ammunition, and other supplies for the war. But the main product it had to sell—cotton—was bottled up in Southern ports, unable to reach markets in Europe. This conundrum is captured in the image (13.15) that adorned “cotton bonds” authorized for sale by the Confederacy in Europe. A Southern version of “Columbia” holds the Confederate flag and leans on cotton bales while looking out to sea at a patrolling Union ship. In exchange for cash (usually 90 percent of face value), investors were promised payment in Southern cotton with interest. The plan brought in

 only $7 million to the Confederate treasury, far less than needed. The Emancipation Proclamation also shook Southern society, as Lincoln had hoped it would. Inspired by word that freedom was at hand, thousands of slaves left their places of bondage and headed for the Union Army or to the Northern states, exacerbating the Confederacy’s labor shortage and further weakening Southern agriculture. Despite these hardships, the Confederacy remained undefeated and the longer Confederates defended their independence, the greater their chances of success. For even as the Union won major victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, discontent and war weariness among Northerners grew. If Lincoln hoped to preserve the Union, he needed more military victories—and soon.

 in Ulysses S. Grant who at the end of 1863 delivered yet another badly needed victory for the Union at the Battle of Chattanooga. On November 23, Grant and the general he increasingly counted on, William T. Sherman, drove Braxton Bragg’s army from Tennessee into Georgia, putting most of eastern Tennessee and the vital Tennessee River under Union control. Already cut in two after the fall of Vicksburg, the Confederates now faced being sliced into thirds. Their main hope was that Northerner dissatisfaction with the war might lead to Lincoln’s defeat in the election of 1864, or at least force him to accept peace negotiations. In early 1864, Lincoln named Grant commander of all the Union armies. Many in the War Department objected, arguing that the rough-hewn soldier who had left the Army in disgrace in 1854 for heavy drinking was an alcoholic who could not be entrusted with a major assignment. But Lincoln had had enough of generals with impressive résumés and martial airs. He

 saw in Grant a commander who understood the key to victory in modern warfare—seek out and destroy the enemy’s army and sources of supplies. Pursuing this policy with single-minded determination, Grant in 1864 devised a two-pronged attack to finish off the Confederacy. As shown in the map (13.16), he sent the Army of the Potomac, now swollen to nearly 120,000, south to destroy Lee’s army of 66,000 and take Richmond. In the West Grant sent General William T. Sherman, a man who shared his understanding of modern warfare, and an army of 90,000 east from Tennessee to destroy General Joseph E. Johnston’s force of 60,000 and seize Atlanta (13.17). The first clash of this campaign, the Battle of the Wilderness, began with Lee attacking Grant on May 5. Over the next two days, aided by the rough, wooded terrain and sluggish Union leadership, the Confederates survived the clash despite Grant’s vastly superior numbers. The inconclusive battle

 left 18,000 federals and 10,000 Confederates killed, wounded, or missing. Normally after so great an engagement, Union commanders spent weeks, if not months, repairing their armies. But the next day Grant ordered his army to move against Lee. Possessing total confidence in his strategy, he also knew that, unlike Lee, he could replace his fallen soldiers. On May 8, the two armies clashed again, ten miles closer to Richmond in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, an epic struggle that left another 30,000 casualties between the two armies. Still Grant remained resolute, driving the Union Army southward, trying to draw Lee out for a final, decisive battle. Lee maneuvered his army between Grant and Richmond, playing for time and avoiding total defeat. On June 3 at Cold Harbor, Grant again ordered a massive assault against Lee’s smaller but heavily entrenched force. The result was the greatest loss of life since Fredericksburg. Many Northerners, appalled at the 55,000 Union casualties (to 30,000 Confederate) in a single month, questioned Grant’s competence; others simply called him a butcher. Peace Democrats renewed their calls for an end to the conflict. Altering his strategy, Grant marched his army south to seize the vital railroad junction at Petersburg and cut Richmond off from the rest of the Confederacy. But Lee managed to dig in around Petersburg just before Grant arrived. By now Grant recognized the futility of staging frontal assaults against entrenched troops and settled down for a siege. It was not the aggressive form of warfare he preferred, but the fall of Petersburg and Richmond seemed only a matter of time. Rising popular dissatisfaction with the seemingly endless bloodshed in summer 1864, however, imperiled Lincoln’s chances for reelection (Davis, was serving a six-year term). Democrats tried to capitalize on the dour mood by nominating former Union General George B. McClellan for president and calling for a cease-fire and peace conference. They also hoped McClellan’s outspoken criticism of emancipation would draw votes from racist Northerners. The Republican Party recognized its vulnerability (it had lost many seats in the 1862 congressional elections) and tried to broaden its appeal heading into the 1864 election. First, Republicans adopted the name Union

 Party to attract pro-war Democrats. Second, they replaced Lincoln’s vice president with Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, a pro-Union Democrat and the only Southern senator not to resign during the secession winter of 1861. Finally, as this campaign broadside (13.18) illustrates, Lincoln’s campaign argued that a vote for McClellan was a vote for slavery and military defeat. While Lincoln shakes hands with an artisan (representing the “free labor” North), McClellan shakes hands with Jefferson Davis who stands beneath the flag of an independent Confederate nation with a slave auction taking place in the background. Behind Lincoln white and black children enjoy the benefits of freedom and education. As late as August 1864, however, Lincoln and many of his supporters expected to lose. In September 1864, however, Lincoln received news that Sherman had captured Atlanta. This crushing blow all but doomed the Confederacy to collapse. It also boosted morale across the North and weakened the Democrats’ peace strategy. Two months later Lincoln soundly defeated McClellan, winning every state except for Kentucky, New Jersey, and Delaware to garner 55 percent of the popular vote. Still his margin of victory—just ten percent—demonstrated just how essential military success was to political victory.

 badly needed supplies and to demoralize the Southern people. Simultaneously, General George H. Thomas all but destroyed the Confederate army under General John B. Hood at the Battle of Nashville (December 15–16, 1864). One week later, Sherman’s army captured Savannah. Known as Sherman’s March to the Sea, the “scorched earth” campaign traversed 285 miles of Georgia. Sherman’s soldiers lived off the land, taking what agricultural produce and livestock they needed and destroying the rest. They also destroyed Southern infrastructure, tearing up railroad tracks, burning bridges, and pulling down telegraph wires to impair the Confederacy’s ability to move goods, soldiers, and information. Sherman’s army also enticed thousands of slaves to flock to its camps. By the time it reached the coast, Sherman’s campaign of destruction left the Confederate army bereft of a major source of supplies. More important, the campaign demonstrated the effectiveness of a tactic that would become central to modern warfare in the twentieth century: bringing the conflict to the civilian population to undermine its willingness to support the war. “We are not only fighting hostile armies,” Sherman told his men, “but a hostile people, and we must make old and young,

 rich and poor, feel the hand of war, as well as their organized armies.” Sherman compounded the horror felt by Georgians with his policy toward the state’s freed slaves. After meeting with Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and 20 African American ministers to discuss the fate of the freed slaves, Sherman issued Special Field Order No. 15. This directive set aside more than 400,000 acres of seized Confederate land for distribution to former slaves in 40-acre plots. Congress soon followed with the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery everywhere in the United States (it would be ratified 11 months later). With Georgia in ashes, the stage was set for the final phase of Grant’s plan—crushing Lee’s army between his and Sherman’s forces. On February 1, Sherman left Savannah and headed north into South Carolina. He faced almost no opposition, a sign Southern resistance was disintegrating. As this photograph (13.19) indicates, fire destroyed more than half of Columbia, the capital of South Carolina. Evacuating Confederates and liberated slaves set some of the fires, but some were also started by Union soldiers motivated by vengeance against the state that for decades leading up to the war represented Southern nationalism and ultimately,

 secession. Sherman’s men kept moving north into North Carolina where the meager opposition provided by General Joseph E. Johnston’s force slowed him only slightly. As the situation grew critical for the Confederacy, its leaders tried desperate measures. Among them were secret peace negotiations held in February 1865 at Hampton Roads, Virginia, which failed: Union representatives insisted on unconditional surrender (with the suggested possibility of compensated emancipation), while their Southern counterparts demanded recognition of Confederate independence. Confederate officials also began drafting soldiers as young as 17 and as old as 50. The depth of Confederate desperation was revealed in March 1865 when the Confederate Congress authorized a draft of up to 300,000 slaves to serve as soldiers (only two regiments were raised and neither saw combat).

 “If slaves make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong.” CONFEDERATE MAJOR GENERAL HOWELL COBB, Georgia By now Grant’s nearly nine-month-long siege of Lee’s army at Petersburg began to take its toll. Cut off from supplies, Lee’s men were starving. Thousands had deserted. On April 1 in the Battle of Five Forks, General Philip Sheridan’s cavalry and a large force of infantry cut the only remaining railroad line into Petersburg. When Grant attacked all along the Confederate line the next day, he forced Lee to retreat from both Richmond and Petersburg. Lee’s remaining hope was to slip his ragged army west and south to join forces with Johnston in North Carolina. To prevent this, Sheridan’s cavalry headed them off at a small town named Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia. On April 8, Lee made one last attempt to break out, but failed. “There is nothing left for me to do,” he sadly informed his officers, “and I would rather die a thousand deaths.” The next day, April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered. Lincoln had set a tone of reconciliation in his second inaugural address a month earlier, when he spoke “With malice toward none, with charity for all,” of the need “to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the

 battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.” Accordingly, Grant gave generous terms. The 30,000 men in Lee’s army were permitted to go home, providing they swore never again to take up arms against the federal government. Grant also ordered they be given three days’ rations of food and stopped his men from firing their weapons in victory celebration. Celebrations broke out across the North as people, weary of four years of war, reveled in both the victory and the peace. The exultation quickly changed to despair. On the night of April 14, just five days after Lee’s surrender, Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln at close range as he watched a play at Ford’s Theatre in Washington. Lincoln died early the following day. The tragedy elicited an outpouring of grief for the martyred president among Northerners and freed slaves in the South. After a somber funeral procession in Washington, a train carried Lincoln’s body back to Springfield, Illinois, past some seven million people who lined the tracks. Lincoln’s counterpart Jefferson Davis, who had fled hoping to establish a new Confederate government in Texas, was captured on May 10 and cast in prison. As this image (13.20) shows, the popular anger over the war and Lincoln’s assassination focused on Davis, with many Northerners demanding his execution for treason. Passions cooled, however, and Davis was released after two years without being tried. After Lee’s surrender, the war came to a rapid conclusion. On April 26, Sherman accepted Johnston’s surrender in North Carolina. Others followed suit, with the last Confederate units laying down their arms on June 23. With that, the bloodiest war in American history, one that cost 618,000 lives, was over.

Now That We
Are Free
Reconstruction and the New South,
1863–1890
 The Civil War ended in April 1865, concluding the bloodiest and most divisive conflict in American history. The period that followed came to be known as Reconstruction for several reasons. Most obviously, the name called to mind the need to rebuild the war-torn South. It also referred to the effort to reestablish the Union torn apart by secession. Finally, it indicated the need to remake Southern society in the wake of slavery’s destruction. The complexities and challenges of this last goal are evident in Winslow Homer’s 1876 painting, A Visit from the Old Mistress, which depicts ex-slaves being visited by their former owner. The elegant clothing worn by the “Old Mistress” suggests she has money, but clearly the relationship between the women has changed significantly in the wake of emancipation. To begin with, the mistress has come to visit the former slaves in their home, suggesting a diminishing of her status and power relative to them. The scene also lacks any sense of the affection that plantation owners always assured themselves existed between slaves and masters. Indeed, the three African American women eye the mistress warily. One of them even chooses to remain seated in what surely would have been considered a show of contempt. The old order was gone, but what would replace it remained unclear in the aftermath of the war. Americans entered the Reconstruction period facing the profound questions raised by war and emancipation. Could whites and former slaves live together in peace and mutual respect? What rights were the freedmen entitled to, and who would guarantee these rights? The different answers articulated by freedmen and white Southerners revealed sharply divergent visions of the future and led to a bitter struggle to define the meaning of freedom. “Verily,” observed ex-slave Frederick Douglass, “the work does not end with the abolition of slavery, but only begins.”

 “Never before had I a word of impudence from any of our black folk, but they are not ours any longer.” SUSAN BRADFORD, observing the defiant attitude among former slaves on her Florida plantation, 1865





 CHAPTER 14

NOW THAT WE ARE FREE: RECONSTRUCTION AND THE NEW SOUTH, 1863–1890

Preparing for Reconstruction
 Long before the Emancipation Proclamation took effect on January 1, 1863 countless thousands of enslaved Africans took advantage of the chaos produced by the war to liberate themselves. Their actions raised a host of questions about what rights the freedmen would be entitled to, including land ownership and voting. Lincoln and his advisers preferred to wait until the war was won before addressing these questions, but actions taken by the freedmen to assert their rights and secure their liberty forced the Lincoln administration to develop policies during the war that ultimately shaped postwar Reconstruction.

Emancipation Test Cases
 Even before the Emancipation Proclamation took effect, the federal government realized that it needed to enact policies regarding the growing numbers of freedmen in areas of the South occupied by the Union army. These policies varied by region and were shaped by local customs and the attitudes of freedmen and white officials. As such, they amounted to test cases for the coming debate over Reconstruction. Three of these test cases revealed both the promise and the conflict surrounding emancipation. The first test case began when federal forces seized the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina in November 1861. They found a vast system of cotton plantations, but no planters. The latter had fled, leaving behind 10,000 slaves, who moved quickly to establish new lives based on their understanding of freedom. While clearly posed, “Planting Sweet Potatoes” (14.1), shot by a New Hampshire photographer visiting a regiment from his state stationed on one of the islands, captured one fundamental way in which ex-slaves expressed their freedom. Rejecting cotton, a crop they associated with slavery, they planted crops of their own choosing, such as sweet potatoes and corn for local consumption. Freedom for the African Americans of the Sea Islands

 meant a future as independent farmers living free of white control. Many Northern whites who arrived after the military takeover, however, brought with them a different vision of the future for the Sea Islands. Convinced that Sea Island blacks should resume their labors on cotton plantations—not as slaves but as paid wage earners—federal officials chose not to grant land to the freedmen. This decision was driven in part by the sincere belief that subsistence farming on small tracts of land was backward, harmful to the long-term

 Most freedmen refused to grow cotton, considering it a symbol of slavery. They grew sweet potatoes and other crops, such as corn, primarily for their own consumption.

PREPARING FOR RECONSTRUCTION

 interests of the freedmen and also by the racist notion that African Americans could not handle freedom responsibly without the guidance of white employers. Consequently, they auctioned the land off to the highest bidder. Northern investors bought most of the land, hired freedmen as wage laborers, and resumed cotton cultivation. A second test case unfolded on Davis Bend, the Mississippi plantations owned by Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his brother Joseph. Before the Civil War, they had tried to make Davis Bend a model slave-labor community, where slaves received better food and were granted considerable autonomy. The Davis brothers hoped other planters would follow their example and thus refute the abolitionist argument that slavery was inhumane. Instead, Davis Bend became a model of a very different sort of ideal, one that vividly demonstrated what freedmen could achieve if granted land and autonomy. When General Ulysses S. Grant arrived and found the former slaves running the plantations, he ordered federal officials to lease land to the freedmen. Unlike the freedmen of the Sea Islands, the African American residents of Davis Bend did not have to contend with Northerners seeking to reassert



 white control over the land and impose a wage labor system. As a consequence, by 1865 Davis Bend residents had established their own local government and cleared a profit of $160,000 in cotton sales. A third and far larger test case for emancipation policy began in Louisiana and was eventually extended up the Mississippi Valley affecting some 700,000 former slaves. Soon after Union forces seized New Orleans in April 1862, army officers established a policy to guide the transition from slavery to emancipation. As in the Sea Islands, the policy reflected the racist belief among Northern whites that African Americans could not responsibly handle their freedom and therefore needed strict rules of conduct and work. Blacks were required to remain on their plantations, working as wage laborers bound by one-year contracts. Those wishing to travel, even for short distances, required a pass from the plantation owner. Runaways and resisters, as depicted in this 1864 drawing (14.2), would be forcibly returned to their plantations. Offsetting these harsh provisions was a ban on corporal punishment for plantation labor. Freedmen bitterly opposed the new system, arguing that it rendered them nearly

 powerless under the authority of their former masters. In New Orleans, home to the South’s largest free black population before the war, African Americans began to demand equal rights for all freedmen, including the right to vote and hold office. Although their efforts failed, they sparked a national debate over freedmen’s rights that would dominate Reconstruction. The experiences in the Sea Islands, Davis Bend, Louisiana, and elsewhere during the war created conflicting visions regarding the rights of freedmen, land redistribution, and the authority of exslave owners. Yet emancipation also revealed the optimism of the freedmen and their commitment to defend their newly won freedom and make the most of it.

 Lincoln’s Ten Percent Plan Even as the Civil War raged, President Lincoln had begun to formulate an official Reconstruction policy. In keeping with his moderate political views before the war, Lincoln proposed a moderate Reconstruction policy. As he suggested so eloquently in his second inaugural address, he intended to deal with the defeated South “with malice toward none” and “charity for all” to “achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves….” He believed that extending lenient terms to the South would convince Confederates to surrender sooner and speed the healing process necessary for the good of the Union. Vengeance, he held, would only delay Reconstruction. It might even inspire defeated Confederate soldiers to form renegade bands of insurgents to wage a war of terrorism for years to come.

 “A more studied outrage on the legislative authority of the people has never been perpetuated.” Wade-Davis Manifesto denouncing Lincoln’s veto of the Wade-Davis Bill In December 1863, Lincoln issued his Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction, also known as the Ten Percent Plan. Intended to establish Southern state governments, the plan pardoned all Southerners (except high-ranking military officers and Confederate officials) who

 What advantages did Lincoln see in a moderate Reconstruction policy?

 took an oath pledging loyalty to the Union and support for emancipation. As soon as 10 percent of a state’s voters took this oath, they could call a convention, establish a new state government, and apply for federal recognition.

Radical Republicans Offer
 a Different Vision Lincoln’s lenient plan enraged many Radical Republicans. In July 1864, Radical Republican leaders Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio and Congressman Henry W. Davis of Maryland cosponsored the Wade-Davis Bill, a Reconstruction program designed to punish Confederate leaders and destroy the South’s slave society. Southerners could reestablish new state governments only after a majority of a state’s voters signed an “ironclad” oath declaring they never aided the Confederate army or government. Southerners who served as high-ranking army officers or government officials would be stripped of their citizenship, including the right to vote and hold office. The former Confederate states would be readmitted only after a long period of punishment and a clear demonstration of their commitment to the Union, emancipation, and freedmen’s rights. Lincoln quietly pocket vetoed the bill. Furious, Radicals sought to replace him as the Republican Party presidential nominee in 1864. Although the effort failed, it exposed the deeply divided opinions regarding Reconstruction. Lincoln and his fellow Republicans did manage to find common ground on two issues. In late January 1865, at the urging of Lincoln’s administration, Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment, abolishing slavery. The measure ended any ambiguity over the Emancipation Proclamation, abolishing slavery everywhere in the United States and offering no compensation to former slaveholders. By year’s end 27 states, including eight former Confederate states, would ratify the amendment. In March 1865, Congress established the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands. Known simply as the Freedmen’s Bureau, it became an all-purpose relief agency in the war-ravaged South, distributing food, providing emergency services, building schools, and managing confiscated lands. It represented the first attempt by the federal government to provide social welfare services and quickly became the bedrock institution for implementing Reconstruction policy.

THE FRUITS OF FREEDOM



The Fruits of Freedom
 Many Southerners were stunned by the response of their slaves to freedom. Clinging to self-serving paternalistic notions of the plantation as one big family under the benign authority of the master and planter, they were taken aback when their slaves refused to obey their orders or exhibited anger or disrespect toward them. Susan Bradford, a young woman living on a Florida plantation, wrote in her diary that she was “hurt and dazed” when one of her former slaves refused to prepare a dinner for her mother. “Tell her if she want any dinner,” sneered the free woman, “she kin cook it herself.” “I believed that these people were content, happy, and attached to their masters,” wrote one South Carolina planter in 1865, unable to comprehend why slaves abandoned their masters “in [their] moment of need.” It would be the first of many such shocking experiences for whites, who never imagined that slavery might one day be abolished.

Freedom of Movement
 Even before the guns of the Civil War went silent, African Americans had begun to explore the meaning of their freedom and formulate their own vision of a reconstructed postwar South, both of which included unrestricted mobility. Under slavery, movement was sharply limited, and few slaves ventured far from their plantations. In the chaos of war, however, and later with official emancipation, African Americans hit the road. Many did so to escape the plantations that were home to their former masters and countless bitter memories. Others simply reveled in free and unfettered movement. They wandered for the pleasure of it with no particular destination in mind. As these advertisements (14.3) from the Colored Tennessean, Tennessee’s only African American–owned newspaper, indicate, many freedmen also journeyed in search of loved ones sold away years before. African American mobility led to a sharp rise in the black population of Southern cities. In contrast to rural life, black settlements in cities offered more varied job opportunities, albeit nearly always menial, difficult, and low paid. Urban life also provided freedmen access to strong black institutions such as churches, charities, and newspapers. Southern whites reacted to black mobility with both alarm and disdain. Just as former slaves equated freedom with mobility, their former masters saw in it a shocking reminder that the old order was gone. As a consequence, in one of the first expressions of resistance to black freedom, white Southerners passed vagrancy laws intended to restrict African American mobility.

 on Land Reform” (1865, 1866)

Forty Acres and
 a Mule Many freedmen also tried to become landowners. If travel was a symbolic expression of their new freedom, land was freedom in concrete form. Land, the freedmen believed, would give their freedom meaning by providing an independent living, free of planter control. The idea that freedmen would receive land in addition to their freedom originated during the war. As Southerners abandoned their plantations before the advancing Union army, ex-slaves often took control, partitioned land, and planted crops. Freedmen defended these extralegal actions as simple justice, citing the generations of unpaid labor that they and their ancestors had performed on farms and plantations. “The property which they [former slaveholders] hold,” asserted a group of freedmen, “was nearly all earned by the sweat of our brows.”

 1865 Special Field Order No. 15. It announced that 400,000 acres of abandoned land from northern Florida to the South Carolina Sea Islands would be distributed to freedman in 40-acre plots. Weeks later Congress established the Freedmen’s Bureau, authorizing it to rent to freedmen 40-acre plots of confiscated and abandoned land, along with a mule. By June some 40,000 freedmen lived on land distributed by Sherman, while thousands more rented plots under control of the Freedmen’s Bureau. Whether they owned land or worked as farm laborers for wages, African Americans used their freedom to change the way they worked. They often refused to work in gangs under overseers because it reminded them of slavery. Instead they preferred working independently, under the direction of elder family members. Many African American women left the field to work in their homes and care for children. African Americans and Radical Republicans wanted land redistribution programs, popularly known as “forty acres and a mule,” enacted across the South. Before long, however, their optimism would give way to bitter disappointment as nearly all the land was returned to its original white owners.

 Uplift through Education Along with land, freedmen sought education as an essential element of their freedom. Laws prohibiting the education of slaves had left most freedmen illiterate. But if they learned to read and write, they

 could conduct their own legal and business affairs, acquire better-paying jobs, read newspapers, and participate more fully in politics. General O. O. Howard, the first head of the Freedmen’s Bureau, also viewed education as an essential goal of Reconstruction. Working with charitable societies and African American leaders, the Freedmen’s Bureau helped build 3,000 schools across the South that by 1870 served 150,000 students of all ages. By 1875, literacy among freedmen jumped from 10 percent to 30 percent (and 52 percent by 1900). In the early years of Reconstruction, educated single white women from the North like the Cooke sisters (14.4) made up the majority of the teachers in these schools. Often sponsored by Northern charitable societies, they saw themselves as missionaries dedicated to the uplift of the freedmen. The journal that published this image in 1866, Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly, shared this vision. Note how the artist depicted the children in spotless attire with all of them focused on their studies. That the vision of these teachers and their sponsors went beyond merely teaching ex-slaves to read is shown in this image (14.5) of a brief biography of African American poet Phillis Wheatley. Published in 1866 by a Boston Christian organization, it demonstrates an effort to inspire ex-slaves’ quest for education and independence by instilling pride in African American achievement. Educating freedmen, however, proved no easy job. Southern whites often put up fierce resistance

14.5 Education and Inspiration

 Why did education become such a priority for African Americans?

 to African American education, especially in more remote areas. One report in 1865 described the hardships teachers faced: “Compelled to live on the coarsest diet … subjected to the jeers and hatred of her neighbors … swamped in mud—the school shed a drip, and her quarters little better; raided occasionally by rebels, her school broken up and herself insulted, banished, or run off.” The Freedmen’s Bureau and Northern aid societies also established more than a dozen black colleges, including Howard in Washington, D.C., and Hampton in Virginia. One of their most immediate goals was to train black teachers. By 1870, African American teachers outnumbered white teachers in freedmen’s schools. Many freedmen teachers became community leaders and ran for political office. At least 70 former teachers won seats in Southern state legislatures during Reconstruction.

The Black Church
 The vast network of black churches established during Reconstruction provided an even greater source of community leadership. Black churches had existed in the South before the Civil War, but most were part of larger white congregations and subject to strict white control. Southern whites usually insisted that white ministers lead black congregations to ensure that preaching never challenged slavery and white domination. When the war ended, countless African American congregations of Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, and other sects separated from white ones. They resented their inferior status in white-controlled churches and longed to practice a more emotional, expressive worship style disdained by whites. Most important, they wanted black clergymen who could address their spiritual and social needs. Often churches assumed a central place in the lives of freedmen. Religious services provided spiritual and psychological support for blacks’ daily struggles. Churches also ran schools and provided charitable services to the community. As this illustration (14.6) of a freedmen community at Trent River, North Carolina, demonstrates, African Americans built a church in the center that doubled as a schoolhouse and meeting place. Churches also offered African Americans a degree of self-government, electing members to serve as trustees and on committees overseeing parish life and budget management. African American women, in particular, filled numerous roles, planning



 events, raising money, and running programs such as temperance societies. Like their white counterparts, African American churches also sponsored countless initiatives, such as burial societies, fraternal organizations, and youth groups. With the church taking so prominent a place in African American life, black ministers, like black teachers, assumed major leadership roles. White hostility convinced most ministers to concentrate on building up their communities from within. Still, many ministers entered politics to advance the cause of black equality, including more than 100 elected to Southern state legislatures during Reconstruction. Reverend Richard H. Cain, for example, went to Charleston, South Carolina, in 1865, where he assisted at a black church. Two years later he served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention, followed by terms in the state senate and U.S. House of Representatives. African Americans’ response to emancipation showed that they understood freedom as more than simply an end to slavery. Freedom included the right to free movement and travel, to labor for themselves under conditions of their own choosing, on land granted to them by the government. It meant self-improvement through education and self-help organizations. It meant establishing their own institutions and building their own communities. It also meant full civil and social equality with whites, including the right to vote and hold office.

14.6 The Black Church Anchors Freedmen Communities
 African Americans organized thousands of churches across the South to address both their spiritual and social needs. In the freedmen settlement of Trent River, North Carolina, a simple structure served as a church, school, and meetinghouse (from Harper’s Weekly, June 9, 1866).

 How did the black church become such a vital institution in freedmen communities?



 CHAPTER 14

NOW THAT WE ARE FREE: RECONSTRUCTION AND THE NEW SOUTH, 1863–1890

The Struggle to Define
Reconstruction
 As freedmen in the South worked to define, protect, and extend their freedoms, political leaders in Washington, D.C., debated how to reconstruct the South. The debate revealed sharply divergent visions of the postwar South’s social, political, and economic order. Radical Republicans wanted to replace the old slavocracy with an interracial democracy protected by federal authority. Conservatives sought to limit Reconstruction to granting ex-slaves freedom and opposed proposals to distribute land and grant full equality to ex-slaves. Moderates held the balance of power in deciding most of these questions, but they lacked a clear vision of the postwar South and made their decisions in response to events as they unfolded. was a bitter racist who abhorred the notion of black equality.

 restored to them virtually all their lands, including the vast tracts of land that had been set aside in 40-acre plots for freedmen. In December, with all 11 former Confederate states having established new governments under his terms, Johnson announced the Union was restored, and Reconstruction was over. Johnson’s actions outraged Northern Republicans, including moderates. This political cartoon (14.7) shows Johnson accepting bags of cash from a former Confederate (depicted as the devil) in exchange for a pardon, while a “Pardoned Reconstruction Rebel” in the lower left kills “Union men and freedmen.” Three developments in the supposedly “reconstructed” South stoked Republican discontent. First, many of the state constitutional conventions had failed explicitly to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment; some even demanded financial compensation for the loss of their slaves. Second, and even more galling, in the state elections in November 1865, Southern voters elected dozens of ex-Confederate



 officials and army officers. Among them was Alexander Stephens, former vice president of the Confederacy, chosen to represent Georgia in the Senate. Third, new Southern state governments, beginning in late 1865 with Mississippi and South Carolina, passed laws known as Black Codes to limit the civil and economic rights of freedmen and create an exploitable workforce. Observing these developments less than a year after the end of the Civil War, many Northerners wondered if the great conflict had been fought in vain. Had hundreds of thousands died to defeat the Confederacy only to see its leaders quickly resume power? Had slavery been abolished only to be replaced with a similar system of unfree labor? One of the most common Black Codes (first established in Mississippi in 1865 and then replicated across the South) established the vague charge of “vagrancy”—having no regular home or employment—as a pretext for controlling freedmen. (See Competing Visions: Demanding Rights, Protecting Privilege.) Any freedman who

While newspaper editors, clergymen, and members of Congress debated the issue, white and black Southerners set out to answer the question themselves. As you read the following documents, one from a convention of freedmen and the other from the state legislature of Mississippi, consider the starkly contrasted visions for the future of Southern society. Why do the freedmen feel compelled to say they bear no ill will toward their “former oppressors?” Why do Mississippi legislators define vagrancy in such vague terms? “Address to the Loyal Citizens and Congress of the United States of America,” Proceedings of the Convention of the Colored People of Virginia, Held in the City of Alexandria, August 2, 3, 4, 5, 1865. We, the delegates of the colored people of the State of Virginia … solemnly declaring that we desire to live upon the most friendly and agreeable terms with all men; we feel no ill-will or prejudice toward our former oppressors; are willing and desire to forgive and forget the past, and so shape our future conduct as shall promote our happiness and the interest of the community in which we live … We must, on the other hand, be allowed to aver and assert that we believe that we have among the white people of this State many who are our most inveterate enemies; who hate us as a class, who feel no sympathy with or for us; who despise us simply because we are black, and more especially, because we have been made free by the power of the United States Government … We claim, then, as citizens of this State, the laws of the Commonwealth [of Virginia] shall give to all men equal protection; that each and every man may appeal to the law for his equal rights without regard to the color of his skin; and we believe this can only be done by extending the franchise, which we believe to be our inalienable right as freemen, and which the Declaration of Independence guarantees to all free citizens of this Government and which is the privilege of this nation. We claim the right of suffrage: 
 Mississippi legislators in December 1865 enacted the first “Black Codes” to limit the freedoms of African Americans. Defining vagrancy in such vague terms allowed white Southerners to arrest freedmen at will and to curtail their freedom of movement. These measures were quickly copied in the remaining ex-Confederate states. Section 1. All rogues and vagabonds, idle and dissipated persons, … persons who neglect their calling or employment, misspend what they earn, or do not provide for the support of themselves or their families, or dependents shall be deemed and considered vagrants, … and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not exceeding one hundred dollars, with all accruing costs, and be imprisoned … not exceeding ten days.… Section 5.… In case of any freedman, free negro or mulatto shall fail for five days after the imposition of any or forfeiture upon him or her for violation of any of the provisions of this act to pay the same, that it shall be, and is hereby, made the duty of the sheriff of the proper county to hire out said freedman, free negro or mulatto, to any person who will, for the shortest period of service, pay said fine and forfeiture and all costs … Colored Men’s Convention 1869.

 hit the road seeking new opportunities could be arrested as a vagrant and fined. If a freedman could not pay his fine, he could be hired out for a time to a local plantation owner willing to pay his fine. As this drawing (14.8) dramatically shows, in some cases the contracts for such labor were auctioned off to local planters. The artist intended to conjure in the minds of Northerners a grim scene reminiscent of a slave auction, suggesting that one of the war’s chief accomplishments, emancipation, was being undermined. Some Black Codes required that the children of “vagrant” freedmen be forced to accept apprenticeships that bound them to an employer until age 21. Others coerced blacks to sign long-term work contracts as proof of employment, a practice that left them at the mercy of employers who were not required to pay them for work performed if they quit before the contract expired. Other laws restricted freedmen to renting land only in rural areas (to keep them on plantations), prohibited ministers from preaching without a license,



 outlawed interracial marriages, and barred blacks from serving on juries.

Congressional Reconstruction
 and the Fourteenth Amendment Republicans in Congress vowed to block Johnson’s rapid and lenient Reconstruction program for both idealistic and practical reasons. Excepting emancipation, none of the Republicans’ goals for changing Southern society had been accomplished, and the former slavocracy appeared poised to resume power—a result certain to revive the Democratic Party. A slower process of Reconstruction would allow the Republican Party to take root in the South, especially if African Americans were granted the right to vote, as many Radicals like Congressman Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania demanded. The confrontation began in January 1866 when Congress reconvened. Republicans first refused

 to admit the senators and representatives from the former Confederate states Johnson had declared reconstructed. Next, they established the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, a body that gathered evidence and testimony from hundreds of witnesses detailing widespread lawlessness and violence against freedmen and their white allies in the South. To counteract Southern resistance and the oppression of freedmen, Congress passed two bills. The first expanded the powers of the Freedmen’s Bureau and authorized it to continue operations for two more years. The second, the Civil Rights Act, declared African Americans and all persons born in the United States (except Native Americans) citizens. It also defined the rights of all citizens regardless of race—for example, the right to sue and to make contracts. Taking direct aim at the Black Codes, the law prohibited state

 governments from depriving any citizen of these “fundamental rights.” Johnson, infuriated at Congress’s rejection of his Reconstruction program and determined to thwart efforts to establish racial equality, vetoed both bills. Congress overrode the vetoes and the bills became law, but by June 1866, Republicans decided bolder action was necessary. Johnson remained opposed to freedmen’s rights, and violence against blacks was on the rise in the South. The worst incident (14.9), was a race riot in Memphis, Tennessee, on May 1–2 that left 46 blacks, many of them Union army veterans, and two whites dead. This drawing from Harper’s Weekly, a widely read publication that favored freedmen’s rights, was intended to arouse anger in the North over Southern intransigence and support for congressional action. The Civil Rights Act was an unprecedented piece of legislation,

THE STRUGGLE TO DEFINE RECONSTRUCTION

 but its supporters knew that it could easily be overturned by a future Congress. An amendment, on the other hand, became a permanent part of the Constitution. On June 13, 1866, Republicans passed the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Its five main provisions radically redefined the role of the federal government as the guarantor of individual civil rights. First, it declared all persons born or naturalized in the United States as citizens, a definition that necessarily included all freedmen. Second, all citizens were entitled to “equal protection of the laws” of the states where they lived. Third, states that denied adult male citizens, including African Americans, the right to vote would have their representation in Congress reduced. Fourth, all highranking former Confederates were prohibited from holding public office, unless pardoned by act of Congress. Fifth, it repudiated the Confederate debt (thus punishing those who lent money to the Confederacy) and prohibited financial compensation for ex–slave owners. Johnson greeted the unprecedented amendment with an unprecedented response: He went on the campaign trail to urge its defeat. Hoping to make the midterm state and congressional elections in November 1866 a referendum on the amendment, Johnson and his allies played on white racism, conjuring up images of racial equality and racial intermarriage to alarm Northern whites. Republicans responded in kind, portraying Johnson and the Democrats as traitors who waged war on the Union. Republicans won a sweeping victory in November. Northern voters, although still leery of racial equality, rejected Johnson’s lenient form of Reconstruction because it required too little of Southerners and restored planter rule.

Republicans Take Control
 Emboldened by their legislative and electoral success, congressional Republicans moved to take complete control of Reconstruction policy. In March 1867, Congress passed the first of four Reconstruction Acts. They divided the South (except Tennessee) into five military districts, each governed by a military commander empowered to restore peace and protect individuals, especially freedmen. As soon as order was established, the ex-Confederate states could begin a new, stricter readmission process. The act called for elections to select delegates to state constitutional conventions— elections that permitted African American men to



 vote, but barred Southerners who had served in the Confederate government and army. The new state constitutions drawn up by these conventions had to allow universal male suffrage, regardless of race. As soon as a state’s voters approved the new constitution, the state could hold elections to fill government offices. Finally, if Congress approved the state’s constitution and the state legislature ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, the state would be readmitted to the Union. Two years after the end of the Civil War, the federal government had finally adopted a clear Reconstruction plan. The delay was understandable, given Lincoln’s assassination and the lack of precedent. Yet delay granted Southerners time to recover from the war and mount an effective resistance to federal intervention.

 “The President has no power to control or influence anybody and legislation will be carried on entirely regardless of his opinion or wishes.” Republican Senator JAMES W. GRIMES, Iowa, January 1867

 President Johnson promptly vetoed the Reconstruction Acts, but the Republican Congress passed them again over his veto. Some of the more radical Republicans grew so embittered by the president’s actions and words that they attempted to remove him from office. When Johnson dismissed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton in August 1867, Republicans charged him with violating the Tenure of Office Act, a constitutionally dubious measure they had passed in March. It required the president to seek congressional approval before removing a cabinet official. The House voted to impeach the president, charging him with 11 offenses. The trial began in March 1868 and after two months of heated debate and accusation, the Senate failed—by one vote—to convict Johnson and remove him from office. Johnson was saved by some moderate Republicans who feared setting a bad precedent if a politically motivated campaign succeeded in removing a president from office. Many moderate Republicans also considered Johnson’s likely replacement, Senator Benjamin Wade, far too radical. They also knew Johnson had less than a year left in office.

 CHAPTER 14

NOW THAT WE ARE FREE: RECONSTRUCTION AND THE NEW SOUTH, 1863–1890

Implementing Reconstruction
 As Congress engaged in its impeachment struggle with President Johnson in 1867–1868, the Reconstruction Acts took effect. A coalition of African Americans, poor up-country whites, and economically ambitious merchants (many originally from the North) and white planters formed the Republican Party in the South. They seized the opportunity presented by the congressional Reconstruction program and dominated the process of electing state governments and gaining readmission to the Union. The task would not be easy, especially as their different goals conflicted with each other and with those of most white Southerners, who would clearly oppose—politically, economically, and violently—any attempt to establish what they called “Negro rule.” 14.10 The Hated Scalawag Scalawags became despised figures in the popular Southern mind. Here a scalawag is depicted as an opportunist seeking political power by manipulating the black vote.

The Republican Party
 in the South The process of remaking state governments under the Reconstruction Acts fell to the Republican Party in the South, an organization comprising three distinct and in some cases antagonistic groups: Northerners who settled in the South, white Southerners,

 and former slaves. Northerners who moved south after the war were derided as carpetbaggers by white Southerners. The term suggested they were poor opportunists who carried to the South only a cheap suitcase, or carpetbag, which they intended to fill with plunder garnered from Southerners still reeling from the war. In reality most were middle class, often former Union soldiers or merchants, ministers, artisans, and professionals who viewed the South as a region of opportunity where they planned to settle permanently. Others came as idealistic relief workers, sent by Northern charitable and religious societies, intent upon aiding ex-slaves in their transition to freedom. The Republican Party in the South also contained many white Southerners. Most white Southerners referred to them derisively as scalawags and considered them traitors to their region and race, men eager to accrue riches and power by manipulating black voters (14.10). Most scalawags came from the less developed backcountry regions of the South, especially eastern Tennessee and Kentucky, northern Alabama and Georgia, and western North Carolina. Like carpetbaggers, they believed that the Republican Party offered them and their region the best chance for economic betterment. Most did not, however, embrace on the idea of racial equality. Former slaves made up the largest (about 80 percent), most significant segment of the South’s Republican Party. Empowered with the vote by the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and Reconstruction Act of 1867, African Americans turned out in huge numbers in late 1867 to vote in elections held to select delegates to state constitutional conventions. For supporters of black suffrage, this extraordinary moment—persons only recently considered property now exercising for the first time the right to vote—was captured in

 this Harper’s Weekly drawing (14.11). The dignified scene depicts three voters who symbolically represent a spectrum of blacks that includes common laborers, educated blacks who were free before the war, and Union army veterans. Most African American Republican leaders came from the second group. They tended to come from the North and possessed more wealth and education than the average freedman. The three factions of the Republican Party—carpetbaggers, scalawags, and freedmen—formed an uneasy alliance as they came together to reestablish Southern state governments. Nonetheless, their combined votes in the 1867 elections for delegates to state constitutional conventions led to a sweeping Republican victory. White Republicans, even though they comprised only 20 percent of party membership, won most of the seats. But freedmen won 265 seats overall and a majority of seats in South Carolina and Louisiana.

Creating Reconstruction
Governments in the South
 Republican delegates soon drafted new constitutions for former Confederate states according to the guidelines established by the Reconstruction Acts. In a few states, notably Virginia and Texas, conservatives delayed the process for more than a year. But by the end of 1868, seven Southern states had ratified new constitutions, created new governments, and been readmitted to the Union. These Republican governments achieved remarkable results. To begin with, they represented a revolutionary advance in the status of the freedmen. Held as slaves and denied citizenship only a few years before, African Americans now enjoyed

 the right to vote and hold office. Between 1869 and 1901, 22 African Americans would serve in Congress (20 representatives and 2 senators). More than 600 would win seats in state legislatures and to other state offices. While embittered white Southerners decried what they termed “Negro rule,” statistics show that white Republicans held a far greater share of offices than blacks. No African American was elected governor, and no state legislature ever had a black majority (the South Carolina lower house briefly had a black majority). What white Southerners really objected to was Republican rule

 and what it stood for: African American equality and empowerment. Republican-controlled Southern state governments also achieved several significant reforms. In contrast to the tightfisted governments of the antebellum era, they funded public works projects, built hospitals and orphanages, and founded public school systems. They also enacted more equitable tax codes and passed laws to help indebted farmers keep their land. Opponents of Republican rule denounced these initiatives (and the higher taxes needed to fund them) as wasteful and poorly managed. Fundamentally, they objected to their social and racial implications, since many of the projects were designed to aid the poor and freedmen. But the charges of corruption, mismanagement, and debt lodged by the opponents of Reconstruction governments were not entirely groundless. The rapid expansion of government services and expenditures caused many states to run up large deficits. It also created opportunities for graft and bribery which some Reconstruction legislators took advantage of. Democratic opponents railed against these abuses as alleged evidence that blacks were incapable of holding office and that their white allies were

 interested only in plunder. In reality the corruption in Southern state governments paled in comparison to that found in the North. New York’s Tammany Hall political machine, for example, under William “Boss” Tweed, stole more than $20 million from 1869 to 1871. Moreover, the spending by Southern state governments on social programs looked large only compared to the paltry expenditures on education, health care, and public works before the war. Nonetheless, charges of corruption and excessive spending, coupled with increased taxes, diminished support for the Southern Republican governments and created an unfavorable impression in the North.

The Election of 1868
 By summer 1868, there was little doubt whom the Republican Party would nominate for president. General Ulysses S. Grant enjoyed widespread popularity across the North and among Southern Republicans for defeating Robert E. Lee and ending the Civil War. Grant conveyed a tone of moderation in a time of partisan and sectional acrimony. “Let us have peace,” became his campaign slogan. Democrats, still weak in the aftermath of the war and the disenfranchisement of many exConfederates, faced an uphill battle against Grant. Note how this political cartoon (14.12) “‘Tis But A Change of Banners” from a pro-Republican journal sought to link the Democratic nominees for president Governor Horatio Seymour of New York and for vice president Francis Blair of Maryland with both secession and postwar racial violence. But as this racist Democratic campaign song makes clear (14.13), Seymour ran an aggressive campaign designed to arouse fears that the Republican Party and black suffrage threatened the rights of white Americans. Republicans, his campaign claimed, must be prevented from spreading the disastrous experiment in black political empowerment to the North. Running on a message of political moderation, fiscal responsibility, and an even-handed approach

 to Reconstruction, Grant won 214 electoral votes to Seymour’s 80. The popular vote, however, was much closer: 53 percent for Grant, 47 percent for Seymour (14.14). This outcome reflected three things. First, it indicated the wide appeal of Seymour’s blatantly racist message to conservative whites in both North and South. Second, it showed how vital the freedman vote was for the Republican Party. Grant received nearly 500,000 African American votes, but won by only 300,000 votes. Third, it revealed the effectiveness of violence as a weapon in electoral politics. A reign of terror unleashed by violent whites before the election, especially in Georgia and Louisiana, kept thousands of black voters away from the polls.

 on the rise, many Republicans argued that another amendment was necessary to guarantee unequivocally the right of African Americans to vote. Women’s rights activists agreed, but many also argued for universal suffrage—the vote for all adult citizens regardless of race or gender. Bitterly disappointed over the reference to only “male citizens” in the Fourteenth Amendment, feminists, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, demanded that any subsequent amendment include women. This demand was opposed by former abolitionists and Radical Republicans, including fellow feminists like Lucy Stone and Frances Harper, who argued that gaining the vote for African American men was a higher priority. Including women, they argued, would doom the amendment because the nation was not ready for such radical change. The cause of women’s suffrage could be taken up immediately after black suffrage was secured. Stanton and Anthony rejected this reasoning, leading to a twenty-year split in the women’s rights movement. Most Republicans in Congress, however, agreed with Frederick Douglass’s assertion that this was the “Negro’s Hour,” and they drafted the Fifteenth Amendment to read succinctly: “The right of citizens of the United States shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” Passed by Congress in late 1869 and ratified in 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment presented a striking contradiction. It established a revolutionary experiment in interracial democracy, something no other slave society, such as those in the Caribbean or 3,013,421

 Latin America, did so soon and so completely after emancipation. Yet its spare wording left wide open the possibility that states could devise clever ways to deny blacks the right to vote that did not directly invoke “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”

The Rise of White Resistance


14.15 Another
Victim of the Klan
 Terrorist violence by white vigilante groups soared in the early 1870s. In this scene from Moore County, North Carolina, a freedman pleads for his life, surrounded by Klansmen in full regalia.

 The secret white terrorist organizations that first arose in 1866 and that wrought havoc in parts of the South during the 1868 election grew bolder and more violent by 1870–1871, especially during election season. Known by various names, including the White Brotherhood, Knights of the White Camelia, and especially the Ku Klux Klan, they functioned in much the same manner. As illustrated in a popular Northern newspaper (14.15), Klansmen often operated at night, wearing hoods, robes, and other regalia to hide their identities and terrify their victims. Blacks (and occasionally carpetbaggers and scalawags) targeted for “punishment” were beaten and frequently killed. Some had their crops or homes burned or their mules killed. Klansmen also targeted symbols of black self-improvement and independence, such as black churches, businesses, and schools.

 Why did groups like the Klan indulge in anti-black violence?

 Klan terrorism served many purposes. For the poor whites who made up the bulk of Klansmen, the violent suppression of African Americans provided the psychological reassurance that they were not at the bottom of the social order. For white elites who approved of and often assisted the violence, it prevented a political alliance between poor whites and blacks. It also maintained a large, exploitable workforce for plantations and industry by keeping African Americans powerless and poor. Klan violence also discouraged African American voting and thus threatened the Republican Party in the South. In response to surging violence in the South, Republicans in Congress, with strong support from the Grant administration, passed several Enforcement Acts in 1870 and 1871, outlawing “armed combinations” that deprived anyone of their civil or political rights. The Justice Department vigorously enforced these laws across the South, arresting and prosecuting thousands and weakening significantly the Klan and similar organizations by 1872. Although the Enforcement Acts demonstrated that federal authority could effectively protect the rights of freedmen, they also revealed the vulnerability of freedmen should the federal commitment to Reconstruction ever wane.

RECONSTRUCTION ABANDONED



Reconstruction Abandoned
 By the end of Grant’s first term in office in 1873, supporters of Reconstruction and freedmen’s rights could look with satisfaction at the many extraordinary changes that had taken place in the South. Yet ominous signs suggested Reconstruction was in trouble. Despite the crackdown on the Klan, white Southerners increasingly demonstrated their commitment to seizing power and imposing a new form of servitude on African Americans. Northerners, by contrast, seemed less and less willing to support a vigorous Reconstruction policy. Slowly, from 1872 to 1877, the extraordinary experiment in interracial democracy and progressive government in the South was dismantled in favor of oligarchy and white supremacy.

Corruption and Scandal
 A major factor in the pullback from Reconstruction was a series of corruption scandals that plagued the Grant administration. Grant himself was honest, but also politically naive and given to a hands-off style of leadership that gave officials in his administration unusual independence. Many of them took advantage of Grant’s trust to enrich themselves through illegal schemes. For example, in the 1869 “Black Friday” scandal, Wall Street titans Jay Gould and Jim Fisk conspired with Grant’s brother-in-law to corner the gold market. The plan failed but not before hundreds of innocent investors were ruined. In the Credit Mobilier scandal, Grant’s vice president and several high-ranking members of Congress took bribes from the company involved in the completion of the government-subsidized Union Pacific Railroad. In the so-called “Whiskey Ring” scandal, Treasury Secretary Orville E. Babcock made a fortune by illegally allowing whiskey distillers to avoid paying excise taxes. In yet another scandal, Secretary of War William W. Belknap accepted bribes from companies engaged in corrupt activities on Indian reservations. With so much negative publicity stirred up by corruption scandals, Grant’s administration took steps to minimize political controversies. To secure his reelection and keep the Republican Party in power, Grant adopted a more conservative approach to Reconstruction, by now a frequent source of rancor in Washington. In summer 1872, for example, Grant lobbied Congress for and then signed into law the Amnesty Act, granting a general pardon to all but a few hundred former Confederate leaders. Now eligible to vote and

 hold office, these planters and ex-Confederate army officers and officials wasted little time in reasserting their authority.

Republican Disunity
 The retreat from Reconstruction in the 1870s was also hastened by growing dissention within the Republican Party. Many Republicans, including some former Radicals, began to question the wisdom of maintaining a strong federal role in the affairs of Southern states. Some argued the fundamental goals of Reconstruction—citizenship, civil rights, and suffrage for the freedmen—had been accomplished. There was, they believed, a constitutional and moral limit to what the federal government could do for the freedmen. Now was the time for freedmen to use their new rights to elevate themselves economically, socially, and politically. Other Republicans argued for an end to Reconstruction for less idealistic reasons. Even though some of them had been abolitionists before the war and advocates of freedmen’s rights in the first years that followed, they now considered Reconstruction a failure. These Liberal Republicans, as they came to be called, had grown tired of the political strife produced by debates over freedmen’s rights.

 They also worried about the growing power of the 2,834,761 federal government. 43.8% Liberal Republicans also expressed disgust over the corruption and mismanagement of Southern Reconstruction governments.

No one embod(Democrat, Liberal Republican) ied this dramatic change of heart more than Horace Greeley, the progressive editor of the New York Tribune. Once the outspoken champion of abolition and freedmen’s rights, by the early 1870s, he advocated returning the South to white rule. Blacks, he wrote in 1870, were a “worthless race,” who would rather accept charity than help themselves. Their Reconstruction governments were based on “ignorance and degradation.” A similar transformation from a progressive to a reactionary view of Reconstruction was revealed in the political cartoons of Thomas Nast (see Images as History: Political Cartoons Reflect the Shift in Public Opinion).

The Election of 1872
 The dissatisfaction of Liberal Republicans reached full bloom in summer 1872. Disturbed by the prospect of Grant being renominated for a second term, they broke with the Republican Party and held their own convention in Cincinnati where they nominated Greeley for president. A divided Democratic Party also endorsed Greeley. But the election of 1872 proved disastrous for Greeley and his backers. The public viewed Greeley as an eccentric who during his long career in public life had supported many fringe causes such as vegetarianism, spiritualism, and utopianism. Greeley’s call for an end to Reconstruction and reconciliation between North and South also repelled many Northern voters who still associated Southerners and the Democratic Party with secession and civil war. In Grant’s sweeping victory over Greeley (14.16), Republicans had good reason to cheer. The Democrats’ and Liberal Republicans’ call for

 ending Reconstruction and returning the South to white rule had been rejected. Moreover, the Grant administration’s crackdown on the Klan had allowed African Americans unprecedented freedom to vote. Still, Northerners and Republicans in Congress were not prepared to support federal intervention in the South indefinitely. As new pressing issues emerged after 1872, support for Reconstruction rapidly eroded.

Hard Times
 The American economy had boomed after the Civil War. Hundreds of thousands of new businesses were established. These included massive factories that employed hundreds, in some cases thousands, of workers. Aiding this economic growth was the dramatic expansion of the railroad and telegraph systems and increased availability of capital through banks and stock sales. The booming economy encouraged businesses to expand and investors to take bigger risks. When these trends reached a critical point in late1873, a panic on Wall Street ensued. Some of the nation’s most prominent financial houses and banks went bankrupt. As credit became scarce, businesses began to fail. Hundreds of thousands of workers lost their jobs. By early 1874, the nation’s economy had plunged into a deep depression that lasted until 1877. The Panic of 1873 directly affected Reconstruction. As hard times set in, the fate of the freedmen became less of a concern to Northerners. Economic issues like currency reform and the tariff took precedence over civil rights and white vigilante violence against freedmen. The public, declared one Republican, is tired of hearing about Southern violence against the freedmen: “Hard times and heavy taxes make them wish the ‘everlasting nigger’ were in hell or Africa.” The public expressed its discontent in the congressional elections of 1874 by voting in a Democratic majority in the House for the first time since the war.

The Return of Terrorism
 Reconstruction was also undone by a resumption of violence waged by white terrorist groups like the Klan. As the Grant administration bowed to political pressure to reduce federal intervention in Southern affairs, advocates of white supremacy seized the opportunity. In one notorious incident in 1873, a large band of heavily armed whites overran

POLITICAL CARTOONS REFLECT THE SHIFT IN PUBLIC OPINION
One of the nation’s most skilled and popular political cartoonists in the Reconstruction era was Thomas Nast. An immigrant from Germany, he landed a job in 1861 at Harper’s Weekly, the nation’s leading journal of politics and society. Nast’s artistic talent, combined with Harper’s vast circulation, soon turned him into one of the most influential illustrators of his day. As a staunch Republican and Unionist, his drawings during the Civil War were as intensely patriotic and proLincoln as they were anti-Confederate. After the war, Nast’s widely distributed cartoons continued to shape Northern opinion about Reconstruction and freedmen’s rights. Cartoons like And Not This Man? (August 5, 1865) proclaimed the dignity and humanity of the freedmen and their moral right to full citizenship and suffrage. In This is a White Man’s Government (September 5, 1868), he stressed the violent intent of white Southerners to reclaim power and the necessity of federal authority in carrying out the goals of Reconstruction. Nevertheless, Nast’s cartoons eventually reflected the growing disillusionment of Northern Republicans regarding Reconstruction. While he rejected the Liberal Republican call to end Reconstruction, Nast 
 nonetheless expressed the fear that African Americans were incapable of responsible government. Note the contrast between his earlier depictions of freedmen and that in Colored Rule in a Reconstructed (?) State (March 14, 1874). “Columbia,” an early symbol of America and democracy, advocates black suffrage. The globe is actually a nineteenthcentury ballot box.

 By showing African Americans in Union Army uniforms, Nast sought to remind Americans that blacks had earned the right to full citizenship through their service and sacrifice (note the missing leg) in the war.

 Colfax, Louisiana and slaughtered over 100 African Americans. Just as in the late 1860s, white vigilante violence had two goals: to strip away the freedmen’s hardwon rights and prevent them from voting and holding office. This effort peaked in Mississippi in 1875 when armed groups of whites closely allied with the Democratic Party waged a campaign of terror that came to be known as the Mississippi Plan. Through threats, beatings, and killings, they delivered an unambiguous message: blacks and their white allies who dared vote Republican risked their lives. But the Grant administration rejected Governor Adelbert Ames’s request to send troops to keep the peace and protect the polls. Not surprisingly, more than 60,000 Mississippi voters—nearly all black and Republican— stayed away from the polls on Election Day. Democrats swept to victory and took control of the state legislature for the first time since the Civil War. Immediately they threatened Governor Ames with impeachment and forced him to resign. The success of the Mississippi Plan in intimidating black voters and demolishing the Republican Party is indicated in this 1876 image, Of Course He Wants to Vote the Democratic Ticket (14.17). The artist shows the ruthless character of the white supremacy movement and the vulnerability of freedmen left without federal protection. Other Southern states soon employed their own version of the Mississippi Plan. One by one the remaining Reconstruction governments

 fell to a new class of political leaders known as Redeemers. As the name suggests, they cast themselves in almost biblical terms as saviors of Southern society. By 1876, only South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida remained under Republican control—largely because of the presence of federal troops. The removal of these troops in 1877 opened the way for the complete “redemption” of the former Confederacy and the restoration of white supremacy. Defenders of Reconstruction and the rights of freedmen in Congress were appalled at the rising tide of Redeemer oppression. In response they managed one final measure to bolster the rights of freedmen, the Civil Rights Act of 1875. It required that state governments provide equal access in public facilities such as schools and allow African Americans to serve on juries. The law was largely ignored, and in 1883 the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional.

The End of Reconstruction
 The final blow to Reconstruction occurred as the result of the presidential election of 1876. With the Democratic Party reinvigorated by gaining a majority in the House in 1874 and control of most Southern state governments by 1876, a close election was expected. The Democrats nominated Samuel J. Tilden, governor of New York and a well-known reformer. Republicans nominated Ohio governor and Civil War veteran Rutherford B. Hayes. The issues centered on political corruption, the failed economy, and of course, Reconstruction. On Election Day Tilden received 250,000 more popular votes than Hayes (14.18). But the electoral vote—which actually determines the victor—was unclear. Voting irregularities in South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida left both sides claiming victory—and the 19 electoral votes at stake in those states (one electoral vote was also in dispute in Oregon). Tilden needed to be declared the winner in only one of these four states to win a majority of electoral votes and thus the presidency. Hayes needed to win all three Southern states plus the Oregon vote to put him one electoral vote ahead of Tilden and into the White House. Both sides refused to budge, and a constitutional crisis loomed. Eventually they agreed

14.18 The Election of 1876
 In one of the most controversial presidential elections in U.S. history, Samuel B. Tilden won the popular vote (4,284,020 to 4,036,572), but lost the electoral vote to Rutherford B. Hayes, 185 to 184.

 March 2, 1877, the commission issued its decision, known as the Compromise of 1877. By a vote of eight to seven, the 15-member commission awarded all 20 disputed electoral votes to Hayes, giving him a 185 to 184 electoral vote victory over Tilden. Democrats denounced the “stolen election.” Yet the result proved beneficial to the party. Hayes’s presidency was weakened by the aura of illegitimacy (detractors referred to him as “his fraudulency”). More important, as part of a behindthe-scenes deal, he oversaw the final steps in the dismantling of Reconstruction. By the end of 1877, the last federal troops were removed from the South, and as the map (14.19) indicates, the last Reconstruction governments fell to Democratic Redeemers.

 CHAPTER 14

NOW THAT WE ARE FREE: RECONSTRUCTION AND THE NEW SOUTH, 1863–1890

The New South
 The optimism with which white Southerners greeted the end of Reconstruction gave rise to the term New South. It reflected the South’s development of a new system of race relations based on segregation and white supremacy. Even more so, the New South pointed to a profound economic transformation that swept across the region, bringing with it a boom in manufacturing, railroad construction, and urbanization.

Redeemer Rule


The Lost Cause


 The Redeemer governments that took control of Southern states by 1877 represented a new ruling oligarchy. Before the war a small and powerful class of planters dominated Southern politics. Now, in the aftermath of Reconstruction, a new elite took control. Although some were planters and former planters, most were men who drew their wealth and power from a new Southern economy based on industry, finance, commerce, and railroad construction. As men of business their politics reflected the dominant conservative economic theory of the era, which argued that the best form of government was small, frugal, and pro-business. Accordingly, Redeemer governments slashed taxes and spending on social programs and public education created during Reconstruction. Redeemer politics also championed a return to white supremacy. The return of one-party (Democratic) rule in most Southern states resulted in a steady decline in office holding by African Americans and Republicans. Intimidation and violence also led to a marked decrease in black voting across the South. Despite these setbacks, however, African Americans in many Southern states managed to vote and hold office in appreciable numbers into the 1880s and 1890s. Redeemer rule did not go unchallenged. In several states anger among poor farmers coalesced into full-fledged political challenges to oligarchic rule, inequitable taxation, and cuts to social programs. These insurgents denounced the new elite as “Bourbons” (the name of the former French royal family), a derogatory term that implied aristocratic ambitions. In Virginia, for example, a coalition of Republicans and disaffected Democrats called Readjusters turned out the Redeemer government in 1879. All of these challenges to Redeemer rule, however, ultimately failed.

 Southerners after 1877 embraced not only Redeemer rule, but also an image of the prewar South as an ideal society and the Confederate bid for independence a valiant Lost Cause. Southerners clung to this image because it provided them with a psychologically soothing explanation for why they lost the war. According to the Lost Cause idea, Confederate society was more virtuous than the North and its soldiers braver, but the South lost because the Yankees possessed overwhelming advantages in population, industry, arms, and ruthlessness. Defeat, while bitter and painful, was also a glorious martyrdom for a people and a way of life. Southerners expressed this interpretation of the war as a glorious, yet ill-fated campaign in poems, plays, songs, speeches, sermons, and books. One of the most popular Lost Cause poets was Rev. Abram Ryan, a Catholic priest from Norfolk, Virginia. Many of his poems, such as “The Conquered Banner,” became required recitations among white Southern schoolchildren for decades. These works by Ryan and others stressed courage, glory, duty, sacrifice, and the need for true Southerners to honor their Confederate heroes forever. As Ryan put it in one of his poems:

 What groups constituted the political leadership of the New South?

 But their memories e’er shall remain for us, And their names, bright names, without stain for us; The glory they won shall not wane for us, In legend and lay Our heroes in Gray Shall forever live over again for us. The Lost Cause carried with it an obligation to keep alive the memory of Confederate glory. Southerners built elegant battlefield cemeteries to inter the war dead and monuments to celebrate Confederate victories. White Southern women, many widowed by the war, played a major role in these efforts,

THE NEW SOUTH

 founding organizations such as the Ladies Memorial Association (1867) and the United Daughters of the Confederacy (1894). Southerners also erected thousands of statues honoring Confederate soldiers, including legends like Generals Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and Nathan Bedford Forrest. The photograph (14.20) demonstrates how enthusiasm for the Lost Cause only grew the further the Civil War receded into history. Lee had discouraged efforts to raise monuments to the Confederate cause, but soon after he died in 1870, they sprang up across the South, including this monumental rendering unveiled in Richmond in 1890. Thousands turned out for the dedication of the heroic statue by French sculptor Antonin Mercie and to hear Colonel Archer Anderson laud Lee for his “courage, will, energy …



 fortitude, hopefulness, joy in battle … [and] unconquerable soul.” Nothing that day, certainly not the speeches or Lee’s triumphant pose, recalled the fact that Lee had lost the war. But the Lost Cause legend served a second purpose beyond helping Southerners cope with their defeat in the war. It celebrated a nostalgic vision of the prewar South that supported their arguments for a resumption of white rule and African American subservience. Through literature, art, and music, Southerners (and some Northerners) fashioned romantic depictions of the “Old South” as a harmonious paradise where benevolent masters treated loyal, contented slaves with kindness, where chivalrous Southern gentlemen protected delicate, charming women, and where everyone revered tradition, family, and the Bible. Yet even as they glorified slavery, the proponents of the Lost Cause downplayed its importance as a cause of secession. The real issue, they insisted, was “states’ rights” and attempts by Northerners to run roughshod over them in the 1850s. The Lost Cause thus presented Southerners as victims of misguided and unjustified Yankee aggression who, in the wake of devastating war and humiliating Reconstruction, ought to be left alone to run their own affairs. The overt racism and self-serving depictions of slavery in Lost Cause rhetoric and imagery served to justify a resumption of white rule and the return of African Americans to the status of powerless, exploitable laborers.

The New South
Economy
 Even as Southerners revered the Lost Cause and Old South, their new leadership steered the region’s economy into an industrial future. In the 1870s and 1880s, they joined with Northern entrepreneurs who settled in the South during Reconstruction to develop a modern, market-oriented, and diversified economy. This effort entailed not simply the establishment of banks, textile mills, and railroads, but also the celebration and spreading of capitalist values, such as hard work, risk taking, thrift, and the profit motive.

 CHAPTER 14

NOW THAT WE ARE FREE: RECONSTRUCTION AND THE NEW SOUTH, 1863–1890

14.21 Celebrating the New South
 The Atlanta Exposition of 1895 offered a great opportunity for boosters of the New South to showcase the region’s newly diversified economy.

 The leading figure in this movement to establish a New South economy was Henry Grady, editor of the Atlanta Constitution. Beginning in the mid1870s, in editorials and speeches, he proclaimed industrialization as the solution to the South’s devastated postwar economy. His message inspired many Southerners, especially those who had never been part of the planter elite, to start businesses, invest, and support pro-business policies. Grady also convinced many Northerners, to invest in New South enterprises. The vast expansion of manufacturing represented the most stunning change in the New South. Drawn by low taxes, cheap labor, ample water power, proximity to cotton supplies, and the absence of unions, textile manufacturers moved their operations from New England to the South, What weaknesses limited the success of the New South economy?

 especially the Carolinas. By 1900, the South had become the nation’s leading producer of textiles. A similar transformation occurred in the tobacco industry, as the South went from merely producing raw tobacco to become the nation’s leading producer of finished tobacco products like cigarettes. Another significant aspect of the New South economy was the lumber and furniture industry. New South entrepreneurs took advantage of the region’s tremendous forest reserves and new technologies, such as rotary saws and dry kilns, and an expanded railroad system, and soon made the South the leading producer of lumber. In Mississippi alone the number of lumber mills jumped from 295 in 1880 to 608 in 1899. The furniture industry likewise boomed in the New South, especially in places like High Point, North Carolina, where a single factory opened in 1889, followed by 30 more over the next decade. Industry also flourished in the lower South. Birmingham, Alabama had only a few hundred residents when founded in 1871, but its position at the junction of two major railroads and nearby deposits of coal, iron, and limestone soon attracted iron and steel factories and the nickname, “Pittsburgh of the South.” By 1890, the South produced 20 percent of U.S. iron and steel. As this promotional poster (14.21) makes clear, the booming and increasingly diverse economy of the New South was the central theme of the 1895 Atlanta Exposition. Here “Liberty” carries in her left arm a cornucopia filled with symbols of traditional Southern products like cotton and sugar, but also steel and iron. Note the imagery at the bottom that suggests the Civil War–and all its destruction and lingering controversies—is long gone. As in the North the expansion of industry in the South relied on the existence of a large pool of cheap labor. But unlike the North, where millions of immigrants made up much of the workforce, the South relied on a rising population of poor white farming families pushed off the land by indebtedness, falling crop prices, and crop failure. In the rare

 instances where African Americans secured industrial employment, it was usually in the most menial, dangerous, and poorly paid jobs. Southern workers earned wages 50 percent lower than their Northern counterparts, revealing the limited success of the New South economy in overcoming the region’s poverty and social problems. Despite decades of impressive growth in industry, mining, and railroads, the South in 1900 lagged far behind the North in virtually every category of economic and social progress. Most Southern industry, for example, was small scale and focused on lowskilled labor, including growing numbers of child laborers. Per capita incomes in the South remained stagnant from 1880 to 1900. Other indications of backwardness and underdevelopment abounded. The infant mortality rate far exceeded the national average. And because Redeemer governments had slashed per pupil spending in public education to half the average in the North, the South led the nation in illiteracy; its high school graduation rate was one-third that in the Midwest.

The Rise of Sharecropping
 The limitations of the New South economy was most vividly revealed in the preponderance of Southerners engaged in agriculture. The region’s economy remained fundamentally tied to the production of cash crops, particularly tobacco, sugar, rice, and of course, cotton. Only 6 percent of the Southern workforce in 1900 was employed in manufacturing. The condition of Southern farmers, both white and black, deteriorated sharply between 1875 and 1900. While cotton production soared, the price plummeted, from 18 cents per pound in the early 1870s to 5 cents per pound in 1894. Shrinking profits forced many Southern farmers to forfeit title to their land and became tenant farmers. Some

 rented land for a set fee which left them free to grow whatever crops they desired. But most tenant farmers resorted to the sharecropping system, whereby they received the right to farm a plot of land in exchange for rent paid in the form of a share (generally one-third to one-half) of the harvest. By 1900, more than 70 percent of the South’s farmers (white and black) earned their living in this manner. Sharecropping granted African Americans a measure of independence. White landlords generally allowed their tenants to control their own time and to set their own work routines. The people in this photograph (14.22) are poor and live in a ramshackle house, but like most sharecroppers they work as families free of direct white supervision. Freedmen cherished this independence, given their experience in slavery of gang labor under the brutal control of overseers. And yet, as a closer look at this image shows, a well-dressed white man is in the background—probably the landlord who arranged for the photograph to be taken. Sharecroppers were not slaves, but as this photograph makes clear, they lived under the control of their white landlords.

THE NEW SOUTH

 These educated and relatively affluent African Americans provided leadership and direction for their communities, building social networks of churches, fraternal societies, and self-help organizations. The directors of the aforementioned North Carolina Mutual and Provident Insurance Company, for example, used their financial resources to support schools and establish a hospital, bank, and library to serve the black community of Durham. As Heroes of the Colored Race (14.24) suggests, middle-class blacks also cultivated pride in the accomplishments of African Americans after emancipation. This lithograph was published in 1881 for sale to African Americans. Note its emphasis on education and the role of African Americans in the Civil War and later as members of Congress. But in the late 1870s and early 1880s, Southern political leaders began to create a social and legal system of segregation and disenfranchisement that came to be called Jim Crow (named for a derogatory black character in a popular minstrel show). They understood that as long as some African Americans possessed civil, economic, and political rights, especially the right to vote, white supremacy was called into question. Redeemer politicians also recognized that stoking racial animosity protected their privileged status as a ruling elite by deflecting the frustration and anger of poor Southern whites away from them and onto African Americans. The Jim Crow system consisted of three main elements: segregation, disenfranchisement, and violence. The goal of segregation was to foment racial divisions by separating African Americans from as many aspects of everyday life as possible. Initial efforts focused on barring African Americans from hotels, restaurants, and railroad cars. Blacks denounced these violations of their constitutional rights-especially the Fourteenth Amendment-and challenged them in court. But a conservative Supreme Court sharply restricted the authority of the Fourteenth Amendment and its guarantee of equal protection. In Hall v. DeCuir (1878), for example, the Court

 pamphlet excerpt

 declared unconstitutional a Louisiana law prohibiting racial discrimination on steamboats because the vessel was engaged in interstate commerce (running routes between Louisiana and Mississippi), which only Congress could regulate. Five years later, in the Civil Rights Cases, the Court declared the 1875 Civil Rights Act unconstitutional, asserting that the Fourteenth Amendment did not empower Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals and organizations. The ruling cleared the way for private individuals such as hotel owners and institutions such as men’s clubs to bar African Americans, but left standing the right of Congress to prohibit discrimination by state government institutions. As explained in Choices and Consequences: Sanctioning Separation (page 434), this issue came before the Court in an 1896 case, Plessy v. Ferguson. Hand-in-hand with segregation came the effort to eradicate black political power by circumventing the Fifteenth Amendment. Violence and intimidation in the 1870s had reduced black voting and office holding significantly, but not completely. In Mississippi, for example, black voter turnout averaged 39 percent in the 1880s. But rising fears over the voting power of both blacks and disgruntled poor whites led Redeemer

Choices and Consequences
SANCTIONING SEPARATION
In 1890, Louisiana required separate cars for black and white passengers on all railroads in the state. To challenge the law, an African American carpenter named Homer A. Plessy bought a first-class ticket on the East Louisiana Railroad and sat in the whites-only first-class car. As expected he was arrested. Plessy argued before a local judge named John H. Ferguson that the law violated the Thirteenth Amendment’s prohibition of slavery and the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause. Ferguson ruled in favor of the railroad, stating that separation did not violate Plessy’s rights, a decision upheld by the state’s Supreme Court. When Plessy appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, the justices considered three major options: 
Choices




 Refuse to hear the case and thus not render a judgment on the constitutionality of segregation, letting stand the Louisiana State Supreme Court decision.



 Rule in favor of Plessy and declare Louisiana’s segregation law unconstitutional.

Continuing Controversies
 How should African Americans respond to the imposition of Jim Crow laws? Black leaders in the 1890s were divided over the best strategy to oppose segregation. Booker T. Washington, the nation’s most prominent African American leader, argued that efforts to overturn segregation were doomed to failure due to black Americans’ lack of political and economic power (see Chapter 18). Instead he recommended blacks focus their energy and resources on selfimprovement, especially in education, a strategy that would one day empower them to challenge segregation. Founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), W. E. B. Dubois, rejected this policy and insisted that African Americans keep up a sustained legal and political effort to end segregation. Ultimately it was Dubois’s vision and NAACP attorneys that ended legalized segregation. In Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka in 1954, the Supreme Court overturned Plessy and rejected the concept of “separate but equal.”



 Reject Plessy’s appeal and uphold Louisiana’s segregation law as constitutional.

Decision
 On May 18, 1896, the Supreme Court by a vote of 7 to 1 chose the third option and rejected Plessy’s claim that the law violated his constitutional rights. The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, argued the majority, were never intended to establish full social equality of the races. Furthermore, legal separation of the races, a doctrine subsequently known as “separate but equal,” was constitutional so long as states provided equal facilities. The lone dissenting justice, John Marshall Harlan, blasted the majority opinion, declaring the law a racist violation of the nation’s “color-blind” Constitution.

Consequences
 In sharply limiting the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection provisions, the court allowed state governments to establish separate schools, hospitals, parks, theaters, restaurants, and public transportation across the South. The decision also opened the way for segregation laws aimed at Mexicans in the Southwest and Asians in California. In practice “separate but equal” proved only half accurate as segregated facilities were indeed separate, but never equal in terms of funding, staffing, and supplies.

 politicians to commence a program of disenfranchisement. Given the sparse and direct language of the Fifteenth Amendment, the proponents of disenfranchisement needed to devise laws that deprived African Americans of the right to vote without making specific mention of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” In 1889, Tennessee became the first of many Southern states to enact a poll tax, an annual tax imposed on all adult citizens in the state. Those who failed to pay it could not vote. As the image (14.25) of a Florida poll tax receipt for 1900 shows, the tax of $1 was low enough so that most white voters like Henry R. Nicks could pay it, but high enough to disenfranchise thousands of impoverished African Americans. Most states also required that all unpaid poll taxes from previous years be paid off before a citizen could vote, meaning that a black man who had fallen behind in his taxes for five years would need to pay $5 before entering a polling place. In 1890, Mississippi enacted a poll tax and an additional measure to facilitate disenfranchisement: the literacy test. It allowed state and local officials to bar from voting anyone who failed a literacy test. It usually required a potential voter to read a complicated section of the state constitution and explain its meaning—a provision aimed at excluding African Americans given their low levels of education. Most Southern states soon adopted similar tests. In the mid-1890s, Southern states added a third disenfranchisement policy, the so-called grandfather clause. It guaranteed the vote to anyone, even if they could not pass a literacy test, if their grandfather had been eligible to vote before 1867. Since no African Americans could vote before 1867, they were the only ones subject to literacy tests.

 Adding to the effectiveness of the segregation and disenfranchisement movements was a stepped-up campaign of violence against African Americans. Vigilante groups across the South composed largely of poor whites, but often aided by local law officers and prominent citizens, launched an unprecedented wave of beatings, humiliations, and murders intended to intimidate blacks and “put them in their place.” Often an unsubstantiated accusation of rape or murder brought out a community’s lynch mob, but many killings were prompted by minor incidents of alleged disrespect such as arguing with a white man. Lynchings in the 1890s soared to an average of 187 per year, or roughly one killing every two days. By 1900, these disenfranchisement policies had reduced overall black voting in the South by 62 percent. In some states black voting was effectively eliminated. In Louisiana, for example, the number of black voters dropped from 130,334 in 1896 to 1,342 in 1904—a reduction of 99 percent. Thousands of poor whites were also disenfranchised, reducing the total white vote by 27 percent by 1900.White supremacy had triumphed.

Key Terms
 Ten Percent Plan Pardoned all Southerners (except highranking military officers and Confederate officials) who took an oath pledging loyalty to the Union and support for emancipation. As soon as 10 percent of a state’s voters took this oath, they could call a convention, establish a new state government, and apply for congressional recognition. Freedmen’s Bureau Relief agency for the war-ravaged South created by Congress in March 1865. It provided emergency services, built schools, and managed confiscated lands. Black Codes Laws designed by the ex-Confederate states to sharply limit the civil and economic rights of freedmen and create an exploitable workforce. Fourteenth Amendment Drafted by Congress in June 1866, it defined citizenship to include African Americans, guaranteed equal protection before the law, and established the federal government as the guarantor of individual civil rights. Carpetbagger White Southerners’ derogatory term for Northerners who came south after the war to settle, work, or aid the ex-slaves. It falsely suggested they were penniless adventurers who came south merely to get rich. Scalawag White Southerners’ derogatory term for fellow whites considered traitors to their region and race for joining the Republican Party and cooperating with Reconstruction policy.

 Fifteenth Amendment Constitutional amendment passed by Congress in 1869 providing an explicit constitutional guarantee for black suffrage. Mississippi Plan Campaign of violence and intimidation waged by armed groups of whites closely allied with the Democratic Party that drove Republicans from power in the Mississippi state elections of 1874. Copied by other Southern states. Redeemers Name for white Southern political leaders who successfully returned their states to white Democratic rule in the mid-1870s. The name was intended to depict these leaders as saviors of Southern society from rule by freedmen, scalawags, and carpetbaggers. Civil Rights Act of 1875 Passed by Congress in 1875, it required state governments to provide equal access in public facilities such as schools and to allow African Americans to serve on juries. In 1883 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. Compromise of 1877 Resolution of the disputed presidential election of 1876 that handed victory to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes over Democrat Samuel J. Tilden. Democrats agreed to the deal in exchange for patronage and the continued removal of federal troops from the South. New South Optimistic phrase white Southerners used to describe the post-Reconstruction South, reflecting the South’s development of a new system of race relations based on segregation and white supremacy and pointing to a profound economic transformation that swept across the region.

Conflict and
Conquest
The Transformation of the West,
1860–1900
 Most Americans envisioned the conquest and transformation of the West as a tale of triumph. In John Gast’s 1872 painting, American Progress, the goddess Liberty glides westward, stringing telegraph wire and holding a book, symbols, along with the distant railroad, of the civilization and new technology that would soon tame the wilderness. Beneath her, Gast depicts farmers and pioneers intent on taking advantage of the West’s bountiful resources. Turned into a lithograph, it was advertised as worthy of hanging in both “the miner’s humble cabin” and the “stately marble mansion of the capitalist.” Publishers put the image on the cover of a popular guide to the West, The New Overland Tourist and Pacific Coast Guide. Before 1840 most Americans viewed the lands west of the Mississippi as a great, untamed, and dangerous wilderness of rugged terrain, extreme temperatures, wild animals, and hostile Native Americans. But beginning in the 1840s, an ever-growing number of farmers, miners, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers moved west, aided after 1869 by the completion of the transcontinental railroad and soaring demand for Western products and resources. Gast’s celebratory scene reveals, doubtless unintentionally, the bitter conflict that accompanied the transformation of the West. On the painting’s left border, a cluster of Native Americans flee before the advancing whites. Above them a herd of buffalo likewise make their escape. Gast’s matter-of-fact portrayal of the seizure of Indian land and the near extinction of the buffalo reflected the nation’s enthusiasm for “progress” and the inability—or unwillingness—to confront the human and environmental costs associated with it. By 1900, the West had been radically transformed. Networks of railroads and telegraph lines crisscrossed the landscape, as did millions of miles of fencing that marked the boundaries of farms and ranches. Western cities like San Francisco and Denver rivaled their Eastern counterparts. Perhaps even more remarkable than the appearance of these new aspects of Western life was the disappearance of others. By 1900, the American government had confined hundreds of independent Native American tribes that had once lived in virtually every corner of the West to reservations. Gone, too, were the millions of buffalo from the plains and, in areas of intensive mining, large sections of once pristine mountain landscape were defaced. The conquest of the West between 1865 and 1900 included many stories of success, achievement, and undeniable progress, but it was far more complex, violent, and tragic than Gast’s dreamy vision suggests.

 “The destiny of the American people is to subdue the continent—to rush over this vast field to the Pacific Ocean . . . to change darkness into light and confirm the destiny of the human race . . . Divine task! Immortal mission!” WILLIAM GILPIN, The Central Gold Region, 1859





 CHAPTER 15

CONFLICT AND CONQUEST: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST, 1860–1900

Natives and Newcomers
 Inspired by visions of unlimited opportunity and measures of Congress like the Homestead Act, westward migration increased dramatically after the Civil War. Contrary to the popular notions of a vacant landscape, much of the West was home to hundreds of thousands of Native Americans. Their many languages, lifestyles, and religious practices made for a rich cultural landscape, but also conflict with the rising numbers of newcomers.

Congress Promotes
Westward Settlement
 In 1862, Congress passed three major bills to facilitate settlement of the trans-Mississippi West, the vast region of the United States west of the Mississippi River. The Morrill Land Grant College Act of 1862 created a system whereby funds raised by the sale of public land went toward establishing colleges specializing in agricultural, mechanical, and technological education. Far more significant, however, was the Homestead Act. It provided 160 acres of free land to any settler willing to live on it and improve it for five years. Farmers with more capital could buy the land for $1.25 per acre after living on it for only six months. Those who took advantage of the program included immigrants, landless farmers from the East, single women, and ex-slaves. By making available more than 600 million acres of public land to be settled and farmed, the Homestead Act touched off the largest migration of people ever within the United States. Advertisements and promotional literature produced by land companies and railroads convinced many people to head West to acquire homesteads. Like this image (15.1), which ap-

 peared in a Czech language magazine, these enticements promised rapid success. Note the year-by-year progression that begins with a barren farm and humble house. By the fourth year the landscape features not only a substantial house and flourishing farm, but also trees, a road, and more homes, suggesting that the loneliness of life on the plains will be short-lived. One year later a church steeple appears, further suggesting the development of a community and all the blessings of civilization. But the actual results of the Homestead Act varied widely by region. On the Great Plains and the lands farther west—regions with a harsh climate, poor soil, inconsistent supplies of water, and limited access to transportation—farmers who participated in the Homestead Act often went bankrupt. By contrast, the act worked well in the northern and central portions of the Midwest, where the soil and the climate were favorable to farming. Some people prospered from the Homestead Act in ways not intended by Congress. Many “homesteaders” were actually speculators who claimed their 160 acres with the intention of selling them for a quick profit in a few years. Larger enterprises like railroads and real estate companies accumulated vast land holdings by buying out farmers who failed or paying people to file homestead claims and then buying the land from them. The Homestead Act did indeed attract farmers to the West, but by 1900, only 52 percent of original homestead claimants had acquired legal title to the land. The third major piece of legislation passed by Congress in 1862 to promote Western development, the Pacific Railway Act, created two corporations to build the transcontinental railroad spanning the continent. The Union Pacific was to build west

 from Omaha, Nebraska, across the Plains and the Rockies to meet the Central Pacific, which was to build from California through the Sierra Nevada Mountains. To help the railroad corporations raise capital to pay for the road, Congress granted them ten square miles of land (in a checkerboard pattern with the federal government retaining ownership of the remaining sections) for every mile of track completed. The law also granted the railroads cheap loans and cash subsidies for each mile of track laid. It took six years of low-paid, hard, and dangerous work by huge gangs of workers, especially Irish and Chinese, to complete the project. Scores were killed. On May 10, 1869, a grand ceremony marking the union of the two lines took place at Promontory Point, Utah. At the appointed moment, Leland Stanford, president of the Central Pacific, drove a symbolic golden spike into place, joining two rails, one placed by a team of Chinese workers and another by an Irish crew. Telegraph wires attached to the sledge hammer and spike sent a signal across the nation, announcing the



 long-anticipated news: the continent had been spanned. Keenly aware of the historic nature of the event, railroad officials staged this iconic photograph (15.2) showing the workers and locomotives of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific. It soon appeared in numerous publications, often as a lithograph. Conspicuously absent from the photograph, however, are any of the thousands of Chinese workers who labored on the Central Pacific.

The Diversity of the Native
American West
 As this map of the trans-Mississippi West (15.3 on page 442) shows, white settlers heading west encountered Native Americans belonging to hundreds of different tribes that comprised some 360,000 persons. That number was significantly lower than it had been a century earlier, reflecting the impact of earlier European contact, starting with the Spanish, French, and Russians, that brought conflict and

 More than 360,000 Native Americans, constituting some 500 tribes, lived west of the Mississippi River.

 devastating disease. Most Indians had lived there as far back as anyone could remember, while some had come from the East only decades earlier during the many forced removals (see Chapter 8). Before the arrival of Europeans, dozens of Native American tribes in what is now California lived in villages as small bands of hunters and gatherers. These include the Hupa, Karok, Northern Paiute, Pomo, Wintun, and Yuki peoples. Their way of life was first disrupted in the late eighteenth century when the Spanish established a line of Christian missions on the Pacific coast running north from San Diego. While thousands of Indians lived beyond the reach of the missions, many were gradually transformed by the Spanish into an exploited class of laborers, converted to Christianity, and absorbed

 into Spanish colonial society. Even greater change followed the discovery of gold in northern California shortly after the U.S. government seized the territory in the Mexican War. Waves of white fortune seekers soon arrived and drove the Native Americans off their lands. This violence, along with the starvation and disease that followed, killed thousands of Indians (see Chapter 12). Present-day Arizona, New Mexico, and west Texas also fell under Spanish colonial rule in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. But because this region was dry and remote, it attracted few Europeans. Its native inhabitants, therefore, retained core elements of their culture despite Spanish rule and the presence of Catholic missionaries. Indeed, missionaries managed to gain converts only

NATIVES AND NEWCOMERS

 by blending Christianity with local customs and traditions. One major group, descended from the ancient Anasazi people, included the Hopi, Zuni, and Rio Grande Pueblo tribes. They lived in settled farming communities in western New Mexico and eastern Arizona, growing corn, beans, and cotton, and herding sheep. They also traded with neighboring Mexican ranchers, exchanging their decorative pottery and woven cloth for manufactured products such as hoes and tools. Eastern New Mexico and western Texas harbored more tribes, including the Jicarilla Apache and Navajo. Like the Pueblo, they lived in relative isolation from Spanish missions and thus retained much of their traditional religion, language, and culture. Before the sixteenth century they had lived much like the Pueblos, but their adoption of horses and, for the Navajo, sheep which had been brought to America by the Spanish, transformed them into more migratory peoples. The Navajo tended large flocks of sheep, following them on their seasonal migrations. Sheep provided food, but also wool, which Indian women wove into cloth. Navajo silversmiths also produced beautiful jewelry. The Pacific Northwest, comprising presentday Washington, Oregon, and northern California, was home to thriving native societies such as the Chinook, Salish, Yurok, and Shasta. Living in large villages, they divided their time between growing vegetables, hunting in the lush forests for bear, deer, and moose, and fishing along rivers and the ocean shore. Highly skilled in woodworking, the men produced excellent canoes for fishing and elaborate totem poles. Women wove intricate baskets that were both beautiful and practical. Many of these tribes enjoyed a rich material life that was offset by their custom of potlatch—a ceremony during which rich tribe members gave away many of their possessions as an act of competitive benevolence and a demonstration of superior status.

Native American Tribes
 of the Great Plains While Native American tribes could be found in virtually every corner of the West, the largest group—constituting nearly two-thirds of all Native Americans in the West—lived on the Great Plains. This vast open territory stretched



 from present-day Missouri to the Rocky Mountains and from North Dakota to Texas. In the northern half (the Dakotas, Idaho, Minnesota, and Montana) lived tribes such as the Flathead, Blackfeet, Crow, Arapaho, Northern Cheyenne, and Sioux. Tribes in the southern Great Plains (present-day Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico) included those relocated from the East during the so-called Trail of Tears ordeal (Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, and Seminole; see Chapter 8), as well as Pawnees, Comanches, Kiowas, Southern Arapahos, and Cheyenne. The Plains tribes varied culturally, but many shared a similar tribal structure. Most tribes consisted of bands of about 300–500 related men and women, each governed by a council that welcomed community involvement in decision making. The Comanches, for example, divided their population of 7,000 (ca. 1870) into 13 bands. Religious beliefs and practices varied among the Plains tribes, but most shared important fundamental elements, beginning with the worship of one primary god whom the Sioux called Wakan Tanka (the Great Spirit). Plains Indians also believed in spirits found in everything in creation, from the earth itself, to plants, animals, stars, the moon, and sun, and they considered certain places, such as burial grounds, sacred. A shaman deemed wakan, or blessed, led religious ceremonies, healed the sick, and even decided where to hunt. Many Plains tribes lived in settled villages near rivers where they tended fields of corn, beans, and squash; fished; and hunted game, including bear, deer, and buffalo. Trade with white settlers, explorers, and trappers since the eighteenth century had allowed them to procure guns, kettles, and tools. These sedentary tribes included the Wichitas of northern Texas and Oklahoma, Pawnees of western Kansas, the Dakota Sioux of Minnesota, the Mandans of North Dakota, the Omahas of Nebraska, the Osages of western Missouri and Arkansas, and the Arikawas of South Dakota. Although essential aspects of this Plains lifestyle had changed little over the centuries, some of the largest tribes took to using horses by the eighteenth century and adopted a migratory lifestyle. These included the Crow, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche, and Lakota Sioux. The horse allowed the Plains tribes to follow the seasonal migrations of the buffalo, whose

15.4 Plains
Indians Hunting

 population stood at 30 million in 1800. This scene, Buffalo Chase over Prairie Bluffs, (15.4), painted in 1844 by George Catlin, who traveled extensively among Indian tribes in the West from the 1830s to the 1850s, reveals both the drama of the buffalo hunt and the extraordinary horsemanship of Plains Indians. It also shows the centrality of the buffalo in Plains Indian culture, for the hunters’ clothing, jewelry, spear tips, and bridles are made from buffalo parts. Other uses for the buffalo included flesh for food; skin for teepees and blankets; horns and hooves for glue; bones and tendons for weapons; hair for rope; teeth for ornaments; and dried dung for fuel. The military advantages of the horse and the material wealth provided by the buffalo led these migratory tribes to become the dominant powers on the Plains, allowing them to exact tribute from weaker sedentary tribes. But reliance on the huge migratory beasts also meant that tribes, such as the Lakota Sioux in the north and Comanche in the central Plains, traversed enormous tracts of land during their annual migrations, a practice that increasingly brought them into conflict with whites eager to acquire land. It also increased conflict between rival tribes, such as the Lakota Sioux and Crow, as white settlement forced tribes into closer contact. While not all Native Americans were warlike, the culture of most Plains Indians glorified battle. Warriors aspired to earn reputations as brave hunters and fighters. Warfare between tribes to control land and access to game consisted of small skirmishes where the goal was not so much to kill their opponents as to steal their horses (a measure of a tribe’s

Individual warriors earned fame and respect by “counting coup,” or touching an enemy with one’s hand or weapon. Respect was also earned through acts of charity. Sitting Bull of the Lakota Sioux, for example, became chief of his tribe both because of his success as a warrior and his generosity.

The Great Westward
Migration
 In the late 1840s, after the Mexican War and the discovery of gold in California, a steady flow of settlers into the trans-Mississippi West commenced. By the mid-1850s, thousands annually traversed the 2,000-mile Oregon Trail that stretched from Missouri to Oregon. What attracted them was a torrent of pamphlets, books, articles, and photographs produced by publicists and boosters, many employed by railroads and land companies, celebrating the West as a region of wealth and opportunity. Several groups led this migration westward. One was the recently freed slaves who hoped to secure new lives as independent farmers, free of the poverty and violence in the South. One of these ex-slaves, Henry Adams, who became a land promoter after emancipation, helped more than 20,000 other black “Exodusters” move in the “Exodus of 1879” from the South to farms in Kansas. This image from Harper’s Weekly (15.5) captures the hope this movement inspired. Note the contrast the artist draws between the “old style” of African American migration (a desperate escaped slave hiding from a passing steamboat) and “the new” (well-dressed ex-slaves arriving at their destination by steamboat). The name Exodusters reflected the belief that, like the Israelites in the Bible’s Book of Exodus, they were heading

NATIVES AND NEWCOMERS

 for a “promised land.” The inclusion of a black veteran of the Union army symbolizes the fulfillment of the promise of emancipation won during the war. Unfortunately many Exodusters settled on poor land and lacked the capital to establish successful farms. As a result only about one-third stayed. The rest moved on or returned to the South. Native-born whites constituted a second, much larger segment of the westward migration. Many were Eastern and Midwestern farmers who sought larger plots of land, either through purchase or by the Homestead Act, and opportunities for upward mobility. Others came to work in railroad construction or mining. In addition, many westward migrants were white soldiers who had been stationed in the West and elected to stay and settle after their terms of service expired. One distinct subgroup of native-born whites migrants were the Mormons. Joseph Smith had founded this religious sect in upstate New York in 1830. But violent persecution—Smith was killed by a mob in Illinois in 1844—prompted the Mormons to head west in 1846 in search of an isolated homeland that could ensure their security and survival. They eventually chose a valley in Utah near the Great Salt Lake, territory then under Mexican rule. After the United States acquired the region following the Mexican-American War, Congress created the Utah territory in 1850 (see Chapter 12), and by 1865 some 20,000 Mormons lived in the region under a form of theocratic local rule where the church controlled most property, businesses, and

 public services. Gradually, as more non-Mormons moved to Utah and federal officials condemned the sect’s practice of polygamy (a practice the Mormons officially banned in 1896), the church took a less prominent role in public life. Joining Exodusters, Mormons, and nativeborn Americans in the great migration into the trans-Mississippi West were more than two million immigrants. They were drawn by the same desire for free, or at least inexpensive, farmland or to find work in mines, on railroads, or in the rapidly expanding economies of Western towns and cities. Over time large concentrations of particular ethnic groups emerged. For example, 30 percent of Minnesota’s population in 1880 was foreign-born, including more than 66,000 Germans, 62,000 Norwegians, and 39,000 Swedes. Drawn by jobs in the copper mines, thousands of Irish immigrants settled in Butte, Montana. By 1900, it was the most Irish city in America.



15.5 Seeking
 a Better Life in the West In response to poverty and mounting violence in the South, more than 20,000 African Americans known as “Exodusters” migrated to Kansas in 1879–1880 to acquire homesteads and start new lives as independent farmers.

 “[I]f you strike off into the broad, free West, and make yourself a farm from Uncle Sam’s generous domain, you will crowd nobody, starve nobody, and . . . neither you nor your children need evermore beg for Something to Do.” HORACE GREELEY, Editor, New York Tribune, 1867

 CHAPTER 15

CONFLICT AND CONQUEST: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST, 1860–1900

 As in the East, increased ethnic and racial diversity and economic competition in the West led to tension and conflict that occasionally exploded into raw violence. Frequently victims of the violence were Chinese immigrants. By 1880, California was home to 75,132 Chinese, while 30,000 more lived elsewhere in the West. But as this drawing (15.6) from Harper’s Weekly shows, anti-Chinese racism surged in the 1870s and 1880s as white laborers accused the Chinese of taking jobs and lowering wages. In this attack in 1885 at Rock Springs, Wyoming, whites killed 28 Chinese miners. Two years later white laborers massacred at least 34 Chinese miners in Hells Canyon, Oregon. Railroads and land companies played a key role in promoting immigration to the West, sending agents to Europe and advertising there to encourage migration, sometimes by entire villages, directly to the West. Railroads brought more than two million immigrants to the trans-Mississippi West between 1870 and 1900. “California, Cornucopia of the World” (1883) was one of countless posters that railroads placed in Eastern seaports to attract newly arrived immigrants (15.7). The competition among Western states for settlers is indicated in the phrase “without Cyclones or Blizzards,” a clear attempt to make California more appealing than the Plains states like Kansas. Also significant is the claim of “Room for Millions of Immigrants,” since only one year earlier Congress, with heavy lobbying from California, passed the Chinese Exclusion Act that barred Chinese immigration to the United States. 15.7 The Railroads Promote Westward Settlement Railroads placed promotional posters such as this one from 1883 in Eastern cities to entice settlers to head west to settle on land owned by the railroads, much of it acquired in land grants from the federal government.

 Why did railroads promote the migration of immigrants to the West?

15.6 Anti-Chinese Violence Surges in the West
 In the 1870s and 1880s, Chinese workers in the American West faced hostility and violence from whites. In this incident at Rock Springs, Wyoming in 1885, whites killed 28 Chinese miners.

THE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST



The Economic Transformation
 of the West While many Americans were inspired to migrate westward by notions of Manifest Destiny, the primary motivation was economic—a search for land and work. As a result, economic development was the chief driving force behind the profound transformations of the West after 1865. By 1900, four major industries—the railroad, farming, ranching, and mining—had fundamentally reshaped the region. These industries employed millions of workers and supplied some of the essential needs of consumers and industry in the East and internationally. Such progress, however, was accompanied by labor exploitation, environmental damage, and conflict with Indians.

Development


 (15.8) shows, the transcontinental railroad marked only the beginning of a vast transportation network of both major east-west railroad lines, such as the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad and the Northern Pacific Railroad, and countless smaller feeder railroads. This growing network opened up more and more western lands for farming, allowing farmers in once remote areas to sell their grain in the national market. The railroad also benefited many non-farmers, opening up Western lands for mining and ranching and providing employment for thousands who built the lines

 Between 1860 and 1900, the country’s agricultural output soared. The number of farms in the United States grew from two million to six million, with most of the growth taking place in the West. Agricultural output increased from $1.6 billion in 1860 to $4.3 billion in 1900. Several factors account for this agricultural boom. New technologies such as the steel plow and mechanical reaper dramatically increased the acreage a farmer Seattle could till.

 and later gained employment as firemen, engineers, switchmen, mechanics, dispatchers, and clerks. Railroads also transformed the West by promoting urban growth. Many Western cities like San Francisco, Portland, and Denver, were significant centers of trade before the arrival of the railroad. Once connected to the national rail network, however, they boomed into major metropolises. Their economies diversified as demand for construction, food, transportation, and retail opened up new opportunities for entrepreneurs. By 1890, the West was more urbanized than any region in the United States except the Northeast. Between 1860 and 1890, for example, Denver’s population rose from 2,600 to over 100,000, while Omaha, Nebraska’s soared from less than 2,000 to over 140,000. Like their Eastern counterparts, Western cities struggled with urban problems, including crime, disorder, corruption, poor public health, inadequate water, and ethnic tensions.

Hard Times for Farmers
 While the overall trend in this period was one of expansion and profit, the reality for many farmers was struggle, frustration, and failure. To begin with, farmers faced unpredictable weather patterns. Farmers on the Plains, for example, enjoyed unusually high levels of rainfall between 1878 and 1886, leading them to think this was the norm and encouraging still more farmers to acquire homesteads. But a return to dry conditions and occasional drought after 1886 caused widespread hardship and failure. Other threats came from swarms of insects such as grasshoppers that attacked crops. Farmers also struggled with wild fluctuations in prices for their crops from year to year. A plentiful harvest of wheat or corn often meant a glutted market and low prices. In the 1880s, wheat farmers on the Plains saw prices fall due to competition with less expensive wheat grown in Russia, South America, Canada, and Australia. Sudden drops in prices pushed many farmers into foreclosure because most carried high levels of debt

 to finance the purchase of land and equipment such as harvesters, plows, and windmills. These conditions favored larger farms, revealing a significant flaw in the original Homestead Act: in the more arid regions of the West the 160-acre allotment was too small for profitable farming. By the 1880s, so-called bonanza farms of 1,000 acres or more became increasingly common in the Dakotas and California. With more capital, these large enterprises could better afford the expensive equipment needed for plowing, sowing, and harvesting. On top of all these challenges were the loneliness and drudgery of life on the Plains. As this photograph (15.9) of the four Chrisman sisters standing by their sod house in Custer County, Nebraska, illustrates, life on a Western farm was often Spartan. Sod houses and dugouts cut into hills lacked even the most basic amenities like running water and glass windows. Apart from occasional trips to town, church, court sessions, and harvest fairs, opportunities for social interaction were rare since farmers usually situated their homesteads far apart. The Chrisman sisters developed a strategy that diminished their isolation and allowed them to fulfill the Homestead Act’s requirement that they live on their land to receive full title to it. Beginning with Lizzie’s homestead claim in 1887 and Lutie’s in 1888, the two younger sisters took turns living on the homesteads, keeping their sisters’ company, helping on the farm, and waiting until they were old enough to file their own claims. Hattie eventually did, but all the homestead plots were gone by the time Jennie Ruth came of age. To improve the lot of American farmers, a former clerk in the Department of Agriculture named Oliver

 Western farmers received 160 acres of free land through the Homestead Act, but success required years of hard work and sacrifices such as living in crude sod houses. This one, in Nebraska, was owned by one of the four Chrisman sisters shown here.

THE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST

H.
Kelley founded in 1867 the Patrons of Husbandry, or Grange. This social and educational society was dedicated to alleviating the problems faced by farmers by promoting fellowship, fraternity, and education. Grangers, as they were called, shared ideas about farming through a newsletter and attended lectures by traveling experts. Local chapters opened across the nation, and by the early 1870s, the organization had several hundred thousand loyal members. The Grange was transformed into a powerful political movement during the economic depression triggered by the Panic of 1873. Hundreds of thousands of farmers faced ruin as prices plummeted, while their creditors demanded payment for loans, and railroads charged high prices to transport their produce to market. In their desperation they created Granger Parties, which in 1874 won control of the legislatures of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota and gained significant influence in others. They enacted “Granger Laws,” some of the earliest regulations of banks and corporations, especially railroads. These measures set maximum rates for transporting or storing grain and banned abusive practices such as offering preferred customers special rates. Grangers tried, as this 1873 cartoon (15.10) indicates, to convince Americans not involved in farming to recognize the threat posed to them by uncontrolled railroad power. As a “Consolidation Train,” a name suggesting monopoly, pulls cars labeled “extortion,” “bribery,” “usurpation,” and “oppression,” a Granger warns unsuspecting citizens of their impending doom. Railroad magnates denounced these limitations on their power and profit as unconstitutional and sued. The Supreme Court, however, in two key cases in 1876 (Munn v. Illinois and Peik v. Chicago and Northwestern Railway) ruled that state legislatures had the legal authority under the Constitution to regulate commerce, including especially commerce between states. Despite this legal victory, the Granger movement faded when the depression lifted and farm product prices rose in the late-1870s. The Democratic and Republican parties also added pro-farmer planks to their platforms that made the Granger parties seem less necessary. 
The Cattle Kingdom
 Another key emerging sector of the Western economy was cattle ranching. When the United States annexed Texas in 1845, millions of longhorn cattle (introduced to Central America in the sixteenth century by the Spanish) roamed the range, raised mainly for their skins and tallow. But as Americans developed a taste

 for beef in the 1860s, ranchers envisioned the great profits to be made if they could get their cattle to Northern markets. A longhorn that cost $4 in Texas could be sold for $40 on the Northern market. Beginning in 1866 and lasting two decades, Texas ranchers began the first of the annual Long Drives of more than 1,000 miles to bring the cattle to market. Ranchers Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving drove thousands of cattle from Texas to Colorado, prompting many imitators. In 1867, another cattle entrepreneur, Joseph McCoy, established a stockyard, hotel, bank, and office in a small Kansas town along the Kansas-Pacific Railroad. Advertising heavily, he quickly turned Abilene, Kansas for a time into the premier cattle drive destination. By the late 1870s, more than 600,000 longhorns arrived per year to be sold and transported by rail to Chicago and other destinations for slaughter. Over time the need for the drives diminished as rail lines were extended from Kansas into Texas and entrepreneurs established large cattle ranches close to railroads in states such as Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado. The period of the great cattle drives lasted only 20 years, but it established the cowboy as an enduring icon of the Old West. Nineteenth-century dime novels, paintings, books, and plays (and in the twentieth century, films) depicted cowboys as paragons of manliness, independence, and courage who spent most of their days battling fierce Indians and driving cattle (see 15.21 on page 464) and nights in raucous saloons playing poker, brawling, and gun fighting. But the life of a cowboy was far more difficult and

 complicated. Cattle drives exposed them to harsh weather that included searing heat, flash floods, and deadly blizzards. Cowboys’ wages averaged only about $1 a day—or less if the price of beef fell—and they survived on a relentless diet of meat, beans, and coffee. They worked from dawn until dusk and then served a shift guarding the cattle at night against rustlers and Indians. Moreover, American cowboys were a far more diverse lot than the popular images depicting them as exclusively white men would indicate. Approximately one-third of cowboys in the American West were nonwhite, the largest group being Mexican vaqueros. Indeed, much of the equipment, clothing, techniques, and culture of the American cowboy derived from Mexican and Spanish traditions. This borrowing is evident in the many items associated with cowboys that bear names derived from Spanish. For example, the word cowboy itself is a direct translation of the Spanish term vaquero, while other terms such as lariat (la reata), chaps (chaparejos), and wrangler (catallerango) are anglicized versions of Spanish words. African Americans comprised the second-largest group of nonwhite cowboys. The eight black cowboys shown in this 1880s photograph (15.11) worked on the ranch of Thomas Jones (shown standing) in Texas. One of the most famous black cowboys was Bose Ikard. Born a slave in Mississippi in 1847, he was taken to Texas where he became a skilled cowboy. Freed by the Civil War, he played a key role in the first Long Drive led by Goodnight and Loving. Ranching held out the prospect of great profits, but ranchers faced big challenges. In the early 1870s,

 How did the reality of cowboy life differ from that presented in popular culture?

 the invention of barbed wire soon ended open-range ranching and the long drives, as farmers enclosed their land to protect crops from cattle hooves. Cattle ranchers also clashed with other livestock enterprises, such as sheep herders, over access to water and grazing lands. These conflicts frequently led to violence and even widespread hostilities known as “range wars.” Ranchers, like farmers, also were vulnerable to extremes of weather, losing cattle to scorching heat and drought and freezing cold and snow. They also suffered from rapid expansion of the ranching industry in the mid-1880s and consequent flooding of the cattle market that caused a collapse of beef prices, bankrupting many ranchers.

Fortunes Beneath the
Ground: The Mining Booms
 While many Western adventurers found fortune and failure in railroads, farms, and ranches, still others tried their luck underground in the many mining districts that emerged in the West. The second great Western mining boom, after California in 1849 (see Chapter 12), began in 1859 with the discovery of gold in Colorado and silver in Nevada. The Comstock Lode, as the Nevada site was called, yielded an astonishing $400 million in silver in the next 20 years. As with most mining booms, the initial wave of small-time prospectors garnered only modest profits. The real fortunes came in the succeeding years as heavily capitalized and incorporated enterprises established mining operations to extract the ore that lay deep underground. Among the titans who

THE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST

 accrued stupendous fortunes were four Irishmen— John Mackay, Jim Fair, James Flood, and William O’Brien—known collectively as the “Silver Kings.” They bought a controlling interest in a mine many declared “spent” and virtually worthless. Yet in 1873, their miners hit the greatest silver vein of them all, the Big Bonanza, that eventually yielded more than $100 million. Most fortune seekers, however, earned modest livings as wage earners working in the mines, while others flocked to the resulting boomtown, Virginia City, to work in construction, dry goods stores, and saloons. Thousands of women in Virginia City found work in hotels, laundries, and restaurants. Unfortunately, low wages and a lack of a family network to fall back upon forced many women to become prostitutes. Other discoveries of gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc, followed in Colorado, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. As in Nevada, the initial prospectors eventually gave way to larger, more sophisticated industrial operations that possessed the capital to invest in the technology needed to dig deep shafts, extract the ore from rocks, process it on site, and ship it by rail to market. Like Eastern industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, these corporations often integrated their resources with the means and methods of production to maximize profits (see Chapter 16). The industrial revolution was not merely an Eastern phenomenon.

The Environmental Legacy
 Economic development in the trans-Mississippi West led to countless success stories of enterprising and risk-taking individuals who established farms, ranches, mines, and small businesses, or who simply found lucrative employment in the region’s many urban centers. But such development often came at the expense of the natural environment. Mining, for example, came in many forms, but in nearly every case it left behind a badly scarred landscape. Open-pit mining of the Mahoning iron ore mine in Minnesota’s Mesabi Range eliminated vast tracts of forest and created massive gouges in the land (15.12). These changes shattered the local ecosystem and choked surrounding waterways with muddy runoff water. Hydraulic mining, or the use of high-pressure water streams to wash away soil and gravel, created similar problems.

 Ore processing often used toxic chemicals to separate ore from rock or other materials. Miners simply dumped them into rivers or open fields, where they eventually seeped into the water table and throughout the ecosystem. The arrival of ever-growing numbers of humans in the West altered the delicately balanced Western ecosystems. On the Great Plains, for example, hunting and other human activity led to the eradication or near eradication of elk, bear, wolf, and buffalo populations. Conversely, settlers introduced foreign animals and plants that, lacking natural predators, spread rapidly and disrupted the balance of the ecosystem. For example, cheatgrass, accidentally introduced to the West from Asia in the 1890s, quickly spread over millions of acres, wiping out or diminishing other flora and greatly increasing the incidence of wildfires. Farming in arid areas of the West, through the use of deep-cutting steel plows that loosened hard-packed dry soil, contributed to significant topsoil erosion. Vast herds of livestock had a similar effect as their grazing eliminated the grass whose roots held the soil in place. Likewise the practices of the timber industry led to deforestation, the loss of habitat for many animal and plant species, and without trees to shield the soil from heavy rainfall, erosion. Some Americans decried this environmental damage, but most viewed the West through the lens of Manifest Destiny, seeing it as a place of limitless resources provided by God for the enjoyment and enrichment of human beings.

 Native Americans under Siege Westward expansion benefited many Americans, but it devastated Native Americans. They faced a relentless tide of white settlers who possessed both superior weaponry and a belief that they had a higher claim to Western land. White settlers also enjoyed the support of the federal government and army. The result for Native Americans in the last third of the nineteenth century was broken treaties, devastating wars, relocation to reservations, and forced assimilation. 15.13 Promoting an Image of Indian Savagery This 1853 sculpture by Horatio Greenough promoted the idea among white Americans that Native Americans were violent savages.

15.14 Seeing

 Greenough’s image became so widely known that a dime novel artist easily adapted it to a Daniel Boone story.

Mounting Problems
 for Native Americans In 1851, as it became clear that the traditional government policy of simply forcing tribes into the West was no longer viable because of increased white migration into the region, Congress passed the Indian Appropriations Act. It set aside vast tracts of the Oklahoma Territory as reservations for dozens of Native American tribes. That same year the U.S. government, the Sioux, and other Plains tribes signed the first Treaty of Fort Laramie. In exchange for declaring nearly all of the central and northern Great Plains off limits to white settlement, the tribes agreed to allow whites to pass unmolested along the Oregon Trail as they moved westward. But the lasting peace that government officials and tribal leaders hoped the treaty would secure did not materialize. Tension and violence between white settlers and Native American tribes only increased in the coming years. One of the most serious problems Native Americans faced in resisting Euro-American incursion onto their lands was the racism of white Americans that characterized Indians as backward, pagan, violent savages who lacked a rightful claim to

 the lands they occupied. As Competing Visions: Inevitable Progress or Unjust Invasion? makes clear, many Americans believed their own culture was vastly superior and viewed Native Americans as obstacles to national progress that must be removed. These notions originated in the colonial period, but greater contact and conflict between whites and Indians after 1850 led to a proliferation of largely negative depictions of Native Americans in newspapers, magazines, songs, plays, and works of art like The Rescue, by sculptor Horatio Greenough (15.13). Commissioned by the federal government and placed at the entrance to the U.S. Capitol in 1853, the scene drew on the many sensationalized stories and paintings of white settlers, especially women, being kidnapped, raped, and murdered by Native Americans. But Greenough departed from the traditional depictions and introduced a towering, dominant white settler. Note the contrasts in the men’s size, demeanor, and clothing. “I have endeavoured,” Greenough explained, “to convey the idea of the triumph of the whites over the savage tribes.” By 1874, the scene had merged with the life of the famous pioneer and icon of frontier masculinity, Daniel Boone (15.14). Both images proclaim Indian savagery and justify white domination, a message that eventually resulted in the sculpture’s removal from public view in 1958.

How does Blackmore make the extinction of Native Americans seem natural and inevitable? What message does this notion convey to white Americans?

 All authorities who have investigated the subject are unanimous in predicting that the Red Men are a doomed race. The … Indians will as surely disappear before the progress of the more energetic and aggressive Anglo Saxon, as sure as the snows of winter melt away before the summer sun. But sad as the fate of the Red Man is, yet, even as philanthropists, we must not forget that, under what appear to be one of immutable laws of progress, the savage is giving place to a higher and more civilized race. Three hundred thousand Red Men at the present time require the occupation of an entire continent as large as Europe, in order that they may obtain an uncertain and scanty subsistence by the chase. Ought we, then, to regret if in the course of a few generations their wigwams, tepees, and mud lodges, rarely numbering more than one hundred in a village, are replaced by new cities of the West, each equaling, perhaps, in magnificence, in stately structures, and population (exceeding that of all the Indians), either in St. Louis or Chicago?

Sitting Bull, Speech at the Powder River Council, 1877
 Behold, my friends, the spring is come; the earth has gladly received the embraces of the sun, and we shall soon see the results of their love! Every seed is awakened, and all animal life. It is through this mysterious power that we too have our being, and we therefore yield to our neighbors, even to our animal neighbors, the same right as ourselves to inhabit this vast land. Yet hear me, friends! we have now to deal with another people, small and feeble when our forefathers first met with them, but now great and overbearing. Strangely enough, they have a mind to till the soil, and the love of possessions is a disease in them. These people have made many rules that the rich may break, but the poor may not! … They claim this mother of ours, the Earth, for their own use, and fence their neighbors away from her, and deface her with their buildings and their refuse. They compel her to produce out of season, and when sterile she is made to take medicine in order to produce again. All this is sacrilege. This nation [of whites] is like a spring freshet; it overruns its banks and destroys all who are in its path. We cannot dwell side by side. Only seven years ago we made a treaty by which we were assured that the buffalo country should be left to us forever. Now they threaten to take that from us also. My brothers, shall we submit? or shall we say to them: ‘First kill me, before you can take possession of my fatherland!’

 Why did many white Americans believe they had a right to take lands inhabited by Native Americans?

CONFLICT AND CONQUEST: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST, 1860–1900

 “Women and children were killed and scalped, children shot at their mothers’ breasts, and all the bodies mutilated in the most horrible manner. . . . Colonel J. M. Chivington all the time inciting his troops to their diabolical outrages.” MAJOR EDWARD WYNKOOP, testimony before congressional committee investigating the Sand Creek Massacre White hostility to Native Americans shaped government policy, especially when it came to signing and honoring treaties. Invariably, it seemed, federal officials negotiated treaties with tribes that promised to permanently fix the boundaries of their hunting grounds and places of habitation, only to find soon thereafter that whites, hungry for land, had begun settling there. Rather than enforce the terms of the treaty and force the removal of white settlers, the government inevitably revised the treaty to further shrink designated Native American lands. This combination of white settlers’ desire for land and disregard for Native Americans’ rights, and the efforts of Native Americans to resist

 white encroachment, led to repeated outbreaks of violence. One of the worst incidents was the Sand Creek Massacre. On November 29, 1864, angered by sporadic attacks on settlers by Native American tribes in Colorado, a military outfit under Colonel John M Chivington raided a peaceful encampment of 800 Cheyenne at Sand Creek. With most of the Cheyenne men off hunting, Chivington’s force slaughtered more than 200 Indians, mostly defenseless women and children, mutilated their bodies, and returned to Denver with their scalps. Native Americans also confronted epidemics of diseases such as smallpox and measles—diseases that they possessed little or no resistance to. While the worst devastation had taken place in previous centuries during initial European contact (see Chapter 1), epidemics continued to kill thousands. For example, a smallpox outbreak in the Pacific Northwest in 1862 killed some 12,000 Indians. The widespread abuse of alcohol, a commodity obtained

 through trade with whites, further compromised Native American health. Additionally, long-standing animosities among tribes prevented Native Americans from developing a united front against the U.S. Army. White officials took advantage of these divisions to obtain help from one tribe, in the form of guides and even soldiers, against another. Disunity within tribes also contributed to this problem, as individual bands guarded their autonomy and resisted the idea of centralized tribal authority. For example, in 1863 leaders of the Nez Perce tribe split over whether to sign a treaty that would confine them to a reservation. The Plains tribes’ dependence on the buffalo left them particularly vulnerable in the 1870s. Railroad companies, disdainful of the large herds that occasionally disrupted the passage of trains, hired gunmen to kill buffalo. Entrepreneurs made buffalo robes fashionable in the East, thereby encouraging hunters to kill still more buffalo. The army soon recognized the strategic value of wiping out the great herds to undermine the independence of the Plains tribes and force them to stay on reservation lands. The scale of extermination was staggering. In this photograph (15.15), workers at the Michigan Carbon Works prepare thousands of buffalo skulls for processing into fertilizer, glue, and other products. The buffalo population, estimated at 30 million in 1800, plunged to only a few thousand by the early 1880s creating a crisis for the Plains Indians who depended on them. The technological disparity between Indians and white settlers left the latter at a great disadvantage. Euro-American settlers and soldiers alike were heavily armed with modern rifles. The army also had early machine guns (called Gatling guns) and heavy artillery. While many Native American tribes had long ago acquired firearms, they never produced guns and ammunition and remained dependent on whites for them. The telegraph also allowed the army to communicate over great distances about troop movements and Native American military activity, and request supplies and reinforcements.

Wars on the Plains
 Despite its lack of commitment to honoring them, the federal government nonetheless signed many treaties in the late 1860s hoping to bring peace to the West and allow continued settlement by whites. Treaties were drawn up and signed with the Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho in

 Read the Document Chief Red Cloud’s Speech



1865, the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache in 1867
 (the Medicine Lodge Treaty), and the Sioux (the second Fort Laramie Treaty) in 1868. The latter treaty ended Red Cloud’s War (1866–1868), a conflict that erupted when the army announced plans to build forts along the Bozeman Trail in the Wyoming and Montana territories to protect white migrants drawn by the discovery of gold in Montana. It guaranteed to the Sioux ownership of the Black Hills and land and hunting rights in South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. It also explicitly barred white people from these lands. “From this day forward all war between the parties to this agreement shall forever cease,” declared the treaty in words that would soon prove false. “The government of the United States desires peace, and its honor is hereby pledged to keep it.” Despite these measures, continued violation of treaties by white settlers who ventured onto Indian lands and bands of Indians who refused to accept confinement on reservation lands led to increased bloodshed. The Red River War broke out in 1874 on the southern plains in present-day Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas when bands of Kiowa, Comanche, southern Cheyenne, and southern Arapaho, angered over the federal government’s failure to uphold its obligation to provide adequate supplies and keep whites off the reservation land (the army actually organized buffalo hunting parties that devastated local herds), left the reservation and raided white settlements. Led by General Philip Sheridan, the army crushed the rebellion by the spring of 1875, thereby ending Native American resistance on the southern plains. By then the primary conflict had shifted to the northern plains. The discovery of gold in the Black Hills of South Dakota in 1874 touched off a flood of white fortune seekers into the region that was indisputably (as stipulated in the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty) territory granted exclusively to Native American tribes. Rather than keep white trespassers out, however, the federal government demanded the Sioux vacate their Red River hunting grounds and return to their reservations. When the tribes refused to comply, the army launched an offensive. In the late spring 1876, the Seventh Cavalry, led by a young and vainglorious lieutenant colonel named George Armstrong Custer, closed in on a large band of Cheyenne, Sioux, and Arapaho warriors, including the well-known Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, near the Little Bighorn River in

 Montana. Eager to earn fame and believing there were only a few hundred Indian warriors when in fact the number was closer to 2,000, Custer attacked before the rest of the army (and other officers who might overshadow him) arrived. The Battle of Little Bighorn quickly disintegrated into

 one of the most devastating defeats ever suffered by the U.S. military as Custer and more than 250 of his men were killed. Although the battle was an overwhelming triumph for the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho, it quickly proved a hollow victory. As this cartoon ( 15.16) published in the New York Graphic a few weeks after the battle demonstrates, the Eastern media ignored Custer’s blundering and instead depicted him and his men as valiant victims and demanded vengeance. Note the artist’s blunt depiction of Indians as savage, semi-animal beings in stark contrast to the two white soldiers, one a heroic victim and the other a coolheaded executioner. The caption, “The Right Way to Dispose of Sitting Bull and His Braves—What the Country Expects of General Sheridan,” was a not-so-subtle assertion of the popular belief that the government was showing too much leniency toward Native Americans who resisted white expansion. Responding to this pressure, the government expanded military action in the Black Hills and forced the Sioux and other defiant tribes onto reservations.

 15.16 The Negative Fallout from Little Bighorn After the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho Indians defeated Custer and the Seventh Cavalry in the Battle of Little Bighorn, negative press coverage hardened white attitudes toward Native Americans. This image appeared in the New York Graphic (August 15, 1876) with the caption, “The Right Way to Dispose of Sitting Bull and His Braves—What the Country Expects of General Sheridan.”

 How did the victory over Custer and his men ultimately prove costly to the Plains Indians?

 Farther west, native tribes encountered similar problems. During the last third of the nineteenth century, the states and territories west of the Rockies also were growing. The mining and railroad industries, the economic centerpieces of that

 region, required a great deal of land—land long occupied by Native Americans. Just as on the Great Plains, the tribes on the West Coast and in the intermountain West faced an encroaching white population that considered the land theirs for the taking. In 1876, following the massacre of Custer and the Seventh Cavalry, army and government officials increased pressure on tribes to move to reservations. One such group targeted was a portion of the Nez Perce tribe that lived on the northwestern plateau of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. In 1863, most of the Nez Perce had agreed to move onto a reservation, but about a quarter had refused. Led by Chief Joseph, about 750 Nez Perce (500 of them women, children, and elderly non-combatants) fled the region to escape the army. Over the ensuing four months, they engaged in an epic flight of 1,400 miles, hoping to cross into Canada. Despite their small numbers and dwindling supplies, they defeated the army in several battles and came within 40 miles of the Canadian border before they were forced to surrender to the army and to life on a reservation. Similar scenes of final military resistance played out in the Southwest. An Apache warrior named Geronimo had emerged in the 1860s and 1870s as a fearless opponent to encroaching Euro-American and Mexican settlers. Captured in 1874, Geronimo and some 4,000 Apaches were sent to a reservation at San Carlos, Arizona. The grim life on the reservation led him to escape and resume his campaign of resistance. He surrendered in 1884, but in 1885 and again in 1886, Geronimo escaped with a few warriors and their families and eluded capture for months. These escapades added to his already legendary status, but he eventually surrendered for good in 1886, ending the last significant Native American resistance. In the 1880s and 1890s resistance to exploitation and abuse also erupted in the Southwest among Hispanos (descendants of Spanish colonists) and Mexicans. Euro-American settlers who arrived in New Mexico in the mid-nineteenth century eventually gave rise to a powerful ruling class of politicians, landowners, and ranchers. Many allied themselves with powerful gangs that provided protection and intimidated (and sometimes killed) their rivals. Poor Hispano and Mexican farmers often bore the brunt of these ruling Euro-Americans’ ruthless tactics and hunger for

 land. When officials began to sell off to speculators and ranchers what had long been used as common grazing lands, the poor farmers resisted. The most famous of these resistors were Las Gorras Blancas, or The White Caps, a secret militant vigilante group of Mexican men who in the late 1880s and early 1890s wore white masks and cut fences on lands taken over by speculators. They also destroyed railroad bridges, buildings, and crops.

In Pursuit of a Solution
 While most Americans expressed little concern over the fate of Native Americans in the West, a few did protest. One of the first was Helen Hunt Jackson. Inspired by an 1879 lecture by Susette La Flesche and her uncle, Chief Standing Bear, relating the plight of the Ponca tribe to an audience in Connecticut, she began speaking and lobbying on behalf of Native Americans. In 1881, she published A Century of Dishonor, a book that chronicled in searing detail the misguided and murderous treatment of Native Americans by the U.S. government. The book prompted Congress to appoint a commission to study Indian affairs and seek a new and more humane policy.

 “Hear me, my chiefs! I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.” CHIEF JOSEPH, shortly after his surrender in 1877

 Another influential reformer garnered a wide audience as an authentic spokesperson for the Native Americans. Sarah Winnemucca, the granddaughter of a Northern Paiute chief, had received some education from white families in Nevada and California and worked as a translator for the army. In the late 1870s, her lectures in the East demanding more humane treatment of the Paiutes and other tribes brought her to the attention of reformers. Winnemucca tried to gain credibility among whites by presenting herself as an “Indian Princess,” an image firmly established in American popular

 Why did Native Americans resist the government’s demand that they settle on reservations?

15.17 Speaking
 Out for NativeAmerican Rights Sarah Winnemucca, a member of the Paiute tribe in California, drew attention to the injustices being suffered by Native Americans through a speaking tour of the Eastern United States and the publication of a book.

 culture by the mid-nineteenth century, notably in the story of Pocahontas (see Chapter 2). In her posed portrait (15.17), hardly anything in her costume, especially the crown and bag embroidered with a cupid and bow and arrow, resembles traditional Paiute clothing and jewelry. Nonetheless, in an era when the political and social opinions of women, especially Native American women, were largely ignored, Winnemucca’s strategy brought extensive and respectful press coverage of her speeches and eventually her book, Life Among the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims (1883). “In the history of the Indians,” wrote one reporter in 1885, “she and Pocahontas will be the principal female characters.” Both Jackson and Winnemucca promoted education for Native Americans, but with different goals in mind. Jackson represented the reformers who believed it the duty of the government to elevate Native Americans from “savagery” by educating and assimilating them into white Euro-American society. In particular they advocated the establishment of boarding schools for Indian children and the eventual dissolution of reservations (see Choices and Consequences: Forced Assimilation Versus Cultural Preservation). In contrast, Winnemucca believed in formal education, but not at the expense of eliminating Native American culture. She believed that Indian children could become educated and productive Americans, while retaining the core of their culture and traditions. Jackson’s ideas prevailed among reformminded legislators in Congress concerned about the plight of Native Americans, especially Senator Henry L. Dawes. In 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Severalty Act to break up the reservations

 Why did reformers like Dawes believe the break up of reservations would benefit Native Americans?

 “For shame! For shame! You dare to cry out Liberty, when you hold us in places against our will, driving us from place to place as if we were beasts.” SARAH WINNEMUCCA, Life Among the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims (1883)

 and assimilate Native Americans into the dominant white Christian American culture. The plan offered Native American heads of household allotments of 160 acres of reservation land (with smaller amounts going to those unmarried or under age 18) to encourage them to become independent family farmers. Remaining reservation lands would be sold off and the profits set aside for tools and education. Native Americans who accepted these terms could apply for U.S. citizenship. To prevent speculators from defrauding Indians, land allotments would be held in trust for 25 years before full ownership was conferred. The Dawes Severalty Act (and subsequent related laws) was born of high ideals and good intentions, but it proved devastating to the Native Americans it was intended to help. The program was rife with flaws, beginning with the allotment of land that was often of poor quality, making successful farming difficult if not impossible. It also included restrictions on

Choices and Consequences
FORCED ASSIMILATION VERSUS CULTURAL PRESERVATION
The Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 stipulated that revenue generated from the sale of reservation lands be applied to the education of Native American children. As with the land allotment plan, the principal motivation of people like Dawes and reformer Helen Hunt Jackson was to assimilate Indians into American society, which they believed would be facilitated by providing vocational training to enhance their job prospects. But the act did not specify what kind of education ought to be provided, and so Congress and the Bureau of Indian Affairs faced a choice. 
Choices




 Establish reservation-based schools offering a traditional public school curriculum, while allowing Native Americans to maintain their culture and language.



 Establish reservation-based schools offering a traditional public school curriculum, while requiring a higher degree of assimilation (especially learning English).



 Establish off-reservation boarding schools committed to eliminating all vestiges of Native American culture.

Decision
 The government chose to establish off-reservation boarding schools. The model was the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Established in 1879, it operated on the simple, but brutal principle of “kill the Indian, save the man.” As the “before and after” photographs indicate, Native American children sent to boarding schools were required to cut their hair, wear American clothing, take an American name, and speak only English. Some schools made conversion to Christianity a top priority.

Consequences
 Removal from families and fellow Native Americans on their reservations caused many children to suffer psychological trauma. Many also suffered from physical abuse, malnutrition, and poor health care. About one in seven ran away, and many committed suicide. Still, by 1902, 25 federally funded boarding schools, and many more private ones, operated in 15 states with 6,000 students.

Continuing Controversies
 What was the long-term impact of the boarding schools? Along with the trauma inflicted on generations of children, it hastened the demise of Native American culture, including the disappearance or near disappearance of many languages. Native American groups have filed lawsuits against the government and the churches that ran the schools and demanded formal apologies.

 hunting, further limiting options for participants. Despite safeguards, white speculators and scammers found ways to con Native Americans out of their allotted land long before the 25-year term. The act also allowed, as indicated by the poster (15.18), the government to sell land deemed “surplus” to white settlers. This poster touts the high quality of the estimated 350,000 acres being offered for sale in 1910. As the map (15.19) shows, by the time the Dawes Act was replaced in 1934, two-thirds of Native American reservation land had been lost.

15.19 The Loss of Native-American Lands
 Native-American land possessions shrank steadily in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries through treaties, sales, and forced expulsion by white settlers and soldiers. In 1887, the Dawes Severalty Act accelerated this trend by encouraging the breakup of reservations.

 How did the Dawes Act play a key role in the loss of Native American land?

RESISTANCE AND ROMANTICISM



Resistance and Romanticism
 The surrender of Geronimo in 1886 symbolized the end of significant armed resistance by Native Americans to the Euro-American settlement of the trans-Mississippi West. Nonetheless, a revival movement called the Ghost Dance, offered one final chance to reverse the fortunes of Native Americans. When that effort was brutally crushed by the army at a place called Wounded Knee, Native Americans turned to more subtle and enduring efforts to preserve their tribes, families, and culture. At the same time, white Americans continued to fashion a pleasing image of the West as a place of adventure, heroism, individualism, and opportunity. This image found its way into art, literature, music, and popular culture in the twentieth century. Yet historians and activists have offered a corrective to this romantic image that takes into account the experiences of Native Americans, Mexicans, and women, and the impact on the environment.

Persecution and Persistence
 The last major form of resistance to the EuroAmerican conquest of the West emerged in the late 1880s. The Ghost Dance movement originated in the 1870s, but did not become widely popular until a Northern Paiute shaman named Wovoka began preaching a message of Native American revival based on a vision he had experienced during a total eclipse of the sun in 1889. In this vision, which he related to his followers, a great flood scoured the land clean of all white settlers, leaving behind Indians who had remained true to traditional teachings and a renewed herd of buffalo. Wovoka told his followers to perform the Ghost Dance, a ritual ceremony where participants donned special shirts and danced in a circle until brought to an ecstatic state that they believed drew to them the spirits of ancestors who would protect them from the white man’s bullets. The hopeful message of the Ghost Dance spread rapidly among Native Americans from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, alarming federal officials who feared it contained the seeds of rebellion. The director of the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota ordered Sitting Bull arrested. When he resisted, the police shot him dead. Two weeks later, on December 29, 1890 the army confronted about 300 Sioux Ghost Dancers at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota. When one of the Indians accidentally fired his gun, the soldiers attacked and

 massacred more than 200. This photograph (15.20), “The Medicine Man Taken at Wounded Knee, S.D.,” conveyed the brutality of the event. The date of January 1, 1891, on the photograph indicates that bodies were left unattended for days before being interred in a mass grave. Note the rifle placed on the body by a soldier, so that the photographer could present an image of a hostile Indian. It was not the bloodiest clash between Native Americans and the U.S. Army, but the Wounded Knee Massacre symbolized the brutality associated with the conquest of the West. The end of armed conflict did not mean an end to resistance for Native Americans. In the coming

 decades, as they struggled with the loss of tribal lands, the cultural erosion caused by the boarding schools, and high levels of poverty and alcoholism, Native Americans found ways to preserve their culture, including languages, artistic forms, and religious beliefs. They did so by maintaining traditions within families and establishing informal methods of passing on traditions from one generation to the next. As a result, when a Native American rights movement emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, it included a commitment to reaffirming and strengthening traditional Native American cultures.

Creating Mythical Heroes
 and Images The story of the American West has long been the object of romanticism and myth. The image of the West as a place of high adventure, heroism, rugged individualism, and endless opportunity developed with the first enthusiastic reports of Western explorers such as Lewis and Clarke (see Chapter 7). But this image really flourished after 1850 as more migrants and journalists headed west and sent back to the East countless letters and dispatches describing the West’s wide-open lands, roaring rivers, and majestic mountains, as well as the heroic struggles of pioneers against weather and hostile Indians. Eventually writers turned to fiction, especially a new genre known as the “dime novel.” The first Western dime novels appeared in the 1860s and their subjects—characters like cowboy Deadwood Dick and his rough and ready girlfriend Calamity Jane—soon became pop heroes. So too did Buffalo Bill. Stories based on the legendary exploits of a real Western scout, buffalo hunter, and Pony Express rider named William “Buffalo Bill” Cody first appeared in a newspaper and then in dime novel form as Buffalo Bill, King of the Border Men. When it sold well, its author (and many imitators) wrote hundreds more Buffalo Bill stories. Cody grew famous but he earned no royalties from the novels. To capitalize on his fame, he created in 1883 “Buffalo Bill’s Wild West,” a circus-like production that purported to show audiences the thrilling and harrowing life on the frontier, replete with huge reenactments of cattle drives and clashes between Indians and cowboys, and exhibitions of marksmanship,

 Why did the West become such a popular topic in entertainment and literature?

 cattle roping, and riding. Immensely popular, it grew more elaborate every year, eventually topping out at 400 horses and 650 cowboys, Indians, musicians, and support staff. Over time Cody added big-name stars like the famous sharpshooter Annie Oakley and even the Sioux chief Sitting Bull. Most Americans, indeed, much of the Western world, viewed the West, through Buffalo Bill’s performances, as a place of heroism, optimism, gallantry, and success (see Images as History: Annie Oakley).

The West in Art
 and Literature Western imagery and ideas also shaped American art and literature. Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens, emerged in the late nineteenth century as one of the first American novelists generally unaffected by European mores. Twain headed west in the early 1860s seeking adventure and wealth in Nevada’s Comstock Lode mines. The result was his classic book Roughing It (1872). Based on his experiences of the wild life in Virginia City, Nevada, the book fit in with the evolving Western tradition of the yarn or tall tale. Twain’s major works, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), were set along the earlier frontier of the Mississippi River and both contained Western themes of adventure, individualism, and a desire to escape the constraints of modern society for a purer, more authentic world. When Huck Finn sets out at the end of the book to start life anew, he heads for the West. Many subsequent writers like Owen Wister and Zane Grey popularized this vision of the West, especially the figure of the cowboy as the embodiment of American manliness, decency, courage, and common sense. In addition to writers, artists popularized a heroic image of the West. One of the most famous was Frederic Remington. Raised in the east, Remington eventually made his way West where he worked a variety of jobs before becoming a newspaper artist covering battles between the army and Native Americans. Drawing upon earlier Western artists like George Catlin (see 15.4), he painted, drew, and sculpted vivid scenes of Western life. Most were vignettes of the lives of unknown cowboys, Native Americans, and soldiers.

RESISTANCE AND ROMANTICISM



Images as History
ANNIE OAKLEY
Two years after William Cody launched his Wild West show, he hired a woman who became one of his most celebrated performers. Born and raised not in the West, but in Ohio, Annie Oakley was a gifted sharpshooter. She had been taught to shoot at a young age and killed game to earn money for her struggling family. At age 16 she beat a professional in a sharpshooting match. She soon married the man and joined him on stage. In 1885, they joined Buffalo Bill’s Wild West. For 16 seasons Oakley thrilled audiences with her marksmanship. She shot cigarettes from her husband’s mouth and coins from his fingers. She blasted an endless succession of glass balls thrown in the air. 
 She hit a target behind her by holding a mirror in one hand and shooting over her shoulder with the other. No one could match the “peerless lady wing shot.” But as this photograph and virtually every one she posed for show, an essential part of Oakley’s appeal lay in her image as an ideal frontier woman who combined Victorian femininity and rugged, almost masculine, strength. Oakley’s adoring public was not put off by her entry into the traditionally male world of guns and horses because she presented a pleasing and reassuring feminine persona. In so doing Annie Oakley, the woman from Ohio, played a key role in shaping the evolving mythical image Americans held of the Old West.

 Oakley’s dual image as both feminine and tough is captured in her facial expression. In all of her studio portraits, she presents herself as beautiful and composed, but unsmiling, to emphasize her grit and fearlessness.

 While Oakley radiated a beguiling feminine charm (she entered the show ring skipping and blowing kisses to the audience), this hand-on-hip pose was masculine and expressive of the manly self-assuredness that audiences associated with cowboys.

 Oakley’s outfit was modeled on the cowboy’s, but with exceptions to emphasize her femininity. Unlike the oblong cowboy hat, hers had a broad round brim. She set it on the back of her head to reveal her face and ladylike curls.

 Conforming to Victorian mores about proper behavior for women, Oakley always wore a dress and rode side saddle.

 She always appeared with a gun, a central icon of how Americans in the late nineteenth century understood the West. It was a symbol they associated almost entirely with men.

 Her many medals were intended to lend her authenticity, as if to say that although she was a performer, her skills as a shooter were real.

 One exception was Lt. Col. George A. Custer, whom Remington helped make into a hero after the Battle of Little Bighorn. Charles Russell, a cowboy-turned-artist, also emerged as a leader of Western art, producing works that often depicted more sensational and imaginative scenes than Remington’s. Both men played a central role in creating the iconic image of the American cowboy. Russell’s 1897 painting (15.21) is typical of most depictions, showing skilled and fearless cowboys roping a bull.

15.21 The Making
 of an American Icon Artists such as Charles Russell, who painted this scene, The Herd Quitters, in 1897, played a central role in promoting the cowboy as a symbol of the West and the West as a place of heroism, daring, and manly individualism.

 Another key influence on the way Americans came to develop a particular image of the West was the work of historian Frederick Jackson Turner. In 1893, he published an essay, “The Significance of the Frontier in American History,” that focused on a recent announcement by the Census Bureau (based on data compiled from the 1890 census) that the American frontier was “closed,” that is, the United States was essentially “settled” from coast to coast. He argued in what historians came to call the Frontier Thesis that the frontier had played a vital role in shaping the American character and American institutions. The frontier’s importance began with the first settlers along the Eastern seaboard during the colonial period and continued in every succeeding generation as it pushed farther and farther west. This seemingly endless supply of land created

 How have new Western historians changed the way many Americans understand the history of the West?

 widespread opportunity for upward mobility. The demands of the frontier, Turner argued, forced Americans to develop a spirit of rugged individualism and innovation. Frontier life also fostered values such as equality and democracy because success was determined not by one’s background but rather by one’s ability to work hard, sacrifice, and command the respect of others. Turner’s thesis proved enormously influential. Generations of Western historians based their writing and research on his ideas about the frontier. His influence also spread well beyond Western history— indeed, well beyond the study of history itself. Some American politicians and policy makers reacted to the apparent closing of the frontier in the 1890s by embracing imperialism to acquire new lands and markets that might make up for the absence of new places to conquer within the United States (see Chapter 19). During the second half of the twentieth century, a new generation of historians challenged Turner’s thesis. One of the leading figures in this “new Western history” movement is Patricia Nelson Limerick who in 1987 published The Legacy of Conquest: The Unbroken Past of the American West. Just as Turner’s article was a product of the optimism and anxiety of late-nineteenth-century American society, Limerick’s book offered an interpretation that reflected the fact that she was a woman raised in the 1960s, a time of social ferment, when historians began to focus more on racial, ethnic, and gender issues. Consequently she brought a far more critical eye to her study of the West than Turner. While Turner had depicted white EuroAmerican settlers as triumphing over such “obstacles” as a stubborn landscape and “a fierce race of savages;” historians like Limerick present a far more complicated story. They emphasize, for example, that Native Americans had inhabited the West for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans and thus had a legitimate claim to the land. Viewed from this perspective, the story of westward migration was one of violence, exploitation, and conquest. New Western historians also stress the diversity of the West, seeing it as a meeting place of Native Americans, Euro-Americans, immigrants from Europe and Asia, African Americans, Mexicans, and Hispanos who contributed to and shaped a Western

 culture that was not simply “white.” Finally, these historians study the environmental impact of westward economic development. This new way of seeing the history of the West in recent years has had an impact beyond the history books. Hollywood films on Western themes also began to change. In the classic Western epics of the 1940s and 1950s, cowboys were heroes, fighting Indians who terrorized innocent white settlers. Beginning in the 1990s, filmmakers began to present a more complicated view of westward settlement, lawlessness, and white-Indian conflict. Dances with Wolves (1990), for example, presented Native Americans in sympathetic terms. Unforgiven (1992) presented the West as a place of violence, lawlessness, failure, desperation, and corruption, where the line between good and evil is not at all clear. Many more such films followed. This reassessment of the West’s history has also changed the way museums and public memorials present key chapters in American history. Nowhere is this more apparent than at the site of

 the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn. For more than a century following the battle, the site memorialized Custer and his men as heroic martyrs who died in the cause of Western settlement. Named the Custer Battlefield National Cemetery it featured a memorial to the Seventh Cavalry and some Indian scouts on Last Stand Hill. Native Americans, who, of course, won the battle, were ignored. But the influence of new Western history and Native American activism led to the renaming in 1991 of the site as the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument and in 2003 the unveiling of the Native American memorial shown here (15.22). Only 100 yards from the Seventh Cavalry monument, it features three bronze outline sculptures representing Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors who participated in the battle. Its official theme is “Peace through Unity,” but it also represents a growing awareness that for far too long Americans relied on an incomplete and overly simplistic understanding of the history of the American West.

 Why are Native Americans so committed to reshaping the interpretation of historic sites like Little Bighorn?

Wonder and Woe
The Rise of Industrial America,
1865–1900
 This scene of industrial discontent, The Strike (1886) by artist Robert Koehler, was inspired by the great railroad strike of 1877. Set in an unidentified industrial town, it captures a moment of confrontation as workers pour out of a factory to gather outside the office of their employer. Unlike most scenes of labor unrest painted or drawn in the late nineteenth century, Koehler presented these workers as sympathetic characters, painting each as an individual rather than as nondescript members of a mob. Many wear square hats popular among various skilled trades, suggesting that these are more established workers. They appear as hardworking and hard-pressed men voicing their anger to the employer, perhaps over a wage cut or layoffs, through the spokesman at the bottom of the stairs. Yet the painting is fraught with tension and an atmosphere of impending violence. Note, for example, the worker in the foreground stooping to pick up a rock. Maybe he is doing this merely as a dramatic show of anger, but perhaps he fully intends to throw it. Note also the scene to his left where a woman tries to calm down another angry worker. Again, it is not clear that she will succeed. And what about the employer? He appears to be listening patiently to the workers’ representative, but whether he will accede to their demands is unclear (his stiff, emotionless bearing suggests he will not). The uncertainty in the painting over both what is about to happen and which side—workers or employer—is in the right illuminates a central theme in American society as it experienced rapid industrialization in the late nineteenth century. By 1900, the Industrial Revolution had transformed the United States from a predominantly agricultural nation that ranked well behind Britain, Germany, and France to the world’s most formidable industrial power. While many Americans celebrated the Industrial Revolution for the unprecedented material wealth and progress it brought, others grew disturbed by some of the grim consequences of industrialization, especially the immense power accrued by big businesses and capitalists and the growing number of workers living in squalid slums. The result of these conflicting visions was an intense debate—much of it vividly captured in Koehler’s painting—over the proper role of government in regulating the economy, the rights of workers to form unions and strike for better wages and working conditions, and the impact of growing disparities of wealth on America’s republican traditions.

 “This association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times…. It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts to our civilization, and which not to answer is to be destroyed.” HENRY GEORGE, Progress and Poverty, 1879

Revolution by
 the Numbers During the second half of the nineteenth century, every area of the economy produced enormous increases in output and value. Huge population increases helped to drive industrial and farm output.

 America’s huge supplies of key raw materials, its rapidly growing urban workforce, and its tradition of imposing few restraints on business enabled industrialization to boom after the Civil War. The railroads quickly emerged as the first big business, followed by steel and petroleum. All three industries pioneered in establishing modern business practices, but they also drew increasing criticism as Americans worried about their extraordinary power.

 to industrial supremacy by 1900 even more astonishing. Every statistical comparison between 1860 and 1900, from factory production to railroad mileage, told the same story of phenomenal growth that saw the Gross National Product rise 171 percent (16.1). Several factors combined to allow the United States to surpass all other industrialized countries by % Increase 1900. First, the nation possessed enormous quantities of 142.3 two essential ingredients for rapid industrialization: raw materials and cheap labor. 180.7 Vast deposits of coal in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and 150.0 Kentucky, for example, provided a seemingly inexhaust263.0 ible supply of inexpensive fuel to fire steam locomo584.0 tives and factory machinery. Other plentiful resources 292.3 included iron, lead, copper, silver, gold, wood, cotton, and oil. Cheap labor came from 1982.7 two sources. Record levels of immigration (see Chapter 17) in the late nineteenth century pushed the number of foreign-born to one in five American workers (two in 165.8 five in manufacturing and mining) by 1910. Millions of 9064.8 American-born workers also moved from rural settings to manufacturing centers in 543.3 search of new opportunities. Many women and children, 79,761.5 both immigrant and nativeborn, also entered the paid 171.4 workforce.

THE EMERGENCE OF BIG BUSINESS

 The relentless development and adoption of new technology also furthered industrialization in the United States. Inventors flooded the U.S. Patent Office with applications, raising the number from an average of 1,000 per year in the 1850s to 20,000 per year in the 1890s. Some notable inventors, such as George Eastman (Kodak camera), William S. Burroughs (adding machine), Isaac Singer (sewing machine), Alexander Graham Bell (telephone), and Thomas Edison (incandescent light bulb, phonograph, motion picture camera, mimeograph machine, and more) became business giants. Less well known were the many women, immigrant, and African American inventors who filed thousands of patents in this period. For example, Jan Matzeliger, an immigrant of African and Dutch heritage from South America, invented a machine that simplified the most difficult and time-consuming step in making shoes ( 16.2). Although much of shoemaking had become mechanized by the 1880s, the difficult “lasting” process—attaching the upper portion of a shoe to the sole—could be done only by hand. Matzeliger’s lasting machine (patented in 1883) was a complex device, yet was easy for unskilled workers to operate, allowing manufacturers to boost production while slashing costs. Government policy also boosted American industrialization. The federal government and the states extended substantial support to railroad projects that totaled almost 180 million acres in land grants and $500 million in loans and tax breaks (see Chapters 13 and 15). Public officials, in an argument later used to justify government support for the interstate highway system and the Internet, defended this largess by arguing that railroads generated economic growth that benefited everyone from travelers to farmers to manufacturers. High federal tariffs that raised the price of imported goods, thereby helping domestic manufacturers, also promoted industrialization. Yet the government also facilitated industrialization by inaction. Public officials, business leaders, and conservatives subscribed to the philosophy of laissez-faire (French for “let do,” or “leave alone”), which argued that the government should impose no restraints on business, including workers’ demands for laws to regulate the hours of work, safety conditions, and wages. Government officials also ignored reformers’ demands for an income tax and laws curbing cutthroat business

 practices. As Thomas Nast’s political cartoon vividly shows (16.3), business and government leaders argued that government interference harmed the American economy, depicted here as a woman weighed down by government-imposed burdens such as income taxes, laws (regulations), and “ideal” money (money not backed by gold). The closed shop and idle ship in the background and the vultures circling overhead all suggested these policies would kill the economy. Widespread support for laissez-faire among lawmakers left capitalists to operate in a market free of the restraints of government regulation.

 CHAPTER 16

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

The Railroads
 The most dramatic change in the late nineteenthcentury industrial economy was the emergence of large corporations, business organizations established by a group of individuals and owned by people who buy shares of stock in the company. Before the Civil War, most American manufacturers were small-scale operations with fewer than 25 employees. They were usually privately owned and sold their products within a few hundred miles of where they were made. All this changed after 1865, as entrepreneurs, seeking bigger markets and greater profits that they could now reach thanks to the railroad and telegraph, began to form massive corporations that boasted thousands of employees in a single factory complex, operations in several states, and millions of dollars of investment capital raised from the sales of stock. The original big businesses were railroads, and they played a key role in transforming the United States into an industrial power. In 1865, scores of small railroad companies operated throughout the Northeast and Midwest and, to a lesser extent, the South. Comprising 35,000 miles of track, they serviced small areas and established their own standards for things such as track gauge (the distance between the rails). Nearly all suffered from financial instability and poor management. But by 1900, this haphazard system had developed into a massive, consolidated, and integrated national railroad network of 193,000 miles dominated by just seven large corporations. Railroads grew at such a ferocious pace because they could be built almost anywhere, creating a transportation network no longer confined to meandering rivers and expensive, slow-to-construct canals that often froze in winter. The railroad also offered another great advantage: speed. People, mail, and goods traveling by stagecoach might, on a good day, cover 50 miles. A steam locomotive pulling many times more people, mail, and goods could cover the

 same distance in less than two hours. And after the completion of the first trans-continental line in 1869 (see map 15.8), the railroad offered service from coast to coast. The quicker and cheaper transportation offered by the railroad benefited the national economy. Railroads opened new areas of settlement, enticing farmers to settle on nearby land (often sold to them by the railroad), confident that they could get their produce to market. Shopkeepers, artisans, laborers, and railroad employees (one million by 1900) settled in towns that sprang up along the tracks. In turn they became consumers of finished goods brought by the railroad from Eastern manufacturers. The railroad industry also contributed to the national economy by consuming large quantities of iron, steel, coal, and wood. Fierce competition among railroads initially led to the rapid expansion of lines. By the 1870s, many railroads tried to diminish competition by buying out rivals, leading to the creation of giant corporations such as the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad. Both owned thousands of miles of track in many states, employed tens of thousands of workers, and handled millions of dollars in investment capital and revenue.

Modern Business Practices
 The success of the large railroad corporations led to the modernization of business practices in two important ways. First, railroad corporations showed other types of businesses the advantages of incorporating and issuing stock. Stock sales allowed corporations to raise capital to expand the business (for example, to buy new and more efficient equipment, or a rival company). If the company earned a profit, stockholders benefited from an increase in the value of the stock (which they could sell for a profit) and sometimes by earning dividends. Stockholders played no direct role in running a company; a professional management team performed that

 “Railroad time, it appears, is to be the time of the future. And so, people will now have to marry and die by railroad time. Ministers will preach by railroad time, and banks will be required to open and close by the same time. The sun is no longer the boss of the job.” Indianapolis Sentinel, 1883

 function. But stockholders also enjoyed “limited liability”: If the company failed they were not liable for any of its debts or obligations; they stood to lose only their shares. By the 1870s, many companies involved in manufacturing, mining, communications, and finance had incorporated. Second, the sudden emergence of huge railroad corporations encouraged the development of modern, sophisticated management practices. Chief among these practices was standardization. For example, in 1883, the nation’s major railroads established the four time zones that are still in use today. This decision helped to combat the problem of irregular “local time” (for example, when local time in New York City was 12:00 p.m., it might be 11:55 a.m. in Philadelphia and 11:47 in Washington, D.C.) that often led to costly accidents between trains sharing a single track or crossing at a junction. Similarly, the development of standardized equipment like couplers, signals, and brakes allowed for easier operation and maintenance of a railroad’s growing fleet of rolling stock. In 1886, the railroads also established a standard gauge for track of 4 feet 8.5 inches, thereby eliminating costly delays caused by the need to transfer cargo from one train to another wherever tracks of two different gauges met. As this drawing (16.4) indicates, many Americans viewed standard gauge as bringing both economic and political benefits to the nation, since it promised to create both a more efficient railroad system and greater unity between the less developed South (see Chapter 14) with the rapidly industrializing North. The banner “The Last Spike of Our Commercial Union” likens the event to the 1869 completion of the transcontinental railroad. To oversee these vast commercial operations— the largest in the world—executives of the major railroads, such as Jay Gould, Tom Scott, and Collis B. Huntington, developed complex hierarchies of superintendents, managers, and clerks and new systems of accounting, advertising, information management, and pricing. Other big businesses, such as steel, oil, manufacturing, and retailing, soon copied these organizational practices, making them the norm in most large corporations.



 as “the modern emblem of motion and power— the pulse of the continent.” They delighted in the benefits of inexpensive and speedy travel and increased access to finished goods in new mail order catalogs. Yet many Americans worried about the larger implications of the railroad. This cartoon depicting

 tions further tarnished the railroads’ image and fueled concerted efforts to curb their power. Although few critics raised the issue at the time, later generations decried the railroad for its role in hastening the defeat of the Plains Indians and the near extermination of buffalo, on which they depended (see Chapter 15). Growing anxiety and anger over the abusive practices of many large railroads eventually compelled reformers to seek tighter regulation of the industry. Given the immense power and wealth of the railroad and politicians’ reluctance to regulate business, reform faced many setbacks. Farmers, bitterly opposing the high rates charged by railroads to transport and store agricultural commodities, led the first significant effort to curb laissez-faire business practices. Known as the Grange (see Chapter 15), it led a successful political movement in the 1870s to pass numerous laws regulating prices and outlawing unfair business practices.

 Why did many Americans come to see railroads as potential threats to democracy?

 Of all the new things produced by the explosion of industrial output after 1865, none was more important than steel. Much stronger than iron, steel became the essential ingredient in the transformation of America into an industrial society, allowing for the construction of the railroad and telegraph networks and tall buildings called “skyscrapers.” Steel also enabled the construction of huge factories, filled with powerful machinery— made from steel, of course. Sharp, durable, and deep-cutting steel plows and mechanical reapers accelerated the commercialization of American agriculture. More accurate and powerful, and thus more deadly, weapons made of steel also altered modern warfare. Steel, in short, was as influential and revolutionary a substance in the late nineteenth century as silicon (used to make computer chips) was to become in the late twentieth. Steel was important in still another way, for it brought to prominence the single most influential big businessman of the era, Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie’s success was all the more remarkable because of his humble origins. Born in Scotland in 1836, he immigrated to America with his family at age 12. Settling in Pittsburgh they struggled to earn a living. Young Carnegie dropped out of school and worked

 CHAPTER 16

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

 The result of Carnegie’s business policies was astonishing, bringing annual profits to $40 million by 1900. By then Carnegie Steel was the largest corporation in the world, with more than 20,000 employees and operations in many countries. Carnegie’s success was part of the larger story of the “age of steel.” By 1900, the U.S. steel industry employed 272,000 workers who produced 10.4 million tons of steel—an output more than twice that of its nearest rivals, Germany and Great Britain.

Rockefeller and the
Rise of the Trust
 Carnegie was the most famous industrialist in the late nineteenth century, but countless others developed key parts of the American economy. They included entrepreneurs like Philip Armour and Gustavus Swift (meat-packing), James B. Duke (tobacco products), George Eastman (Kodak camera), and Cyrus McCormick (farm equipment). Like Carnegie these industry leaders and thousands more succeeded by combining vision and ruthlessness, leading the public to both laud them as “captains of industry” who offered an ever-growing number of new products and services and denounce them as “robber barons,” greedy capitalists who grew rich by devious business practices, exploitation of workers, and political manipulation. One industrialist frequently denounced as a robber baron was John D. Rockefeller. His rise to dominance in the oil industry resembled that of Andrew Carnegie. Through relentless cost-cutting, acquisition of new technology, hiring top-notch managers and scientists, and making secret deals with railroads to undermine his competition, Rockefeller’s Standard Oil company controlled 90 percent of the nation’s oil-refining capacity by 1879. Unlike Carnegie, Rockefeller initially expanded his interests via horizontal integration (16.6), focusing almost exclusively on buying or building oil refineries. Later he followed Carnegie’s vertical integration model, purchasing oil fields, railroad cars and warehouses, pipelines, and barrel factories. Rockefeller’s chief contribution to the rise of big business was the invention of two new forms of corporate management: the trust and the holding company. Like many industrial magnates, Rockefeller

 paid lip service to the ideal of competition, but privately he believed competition between rival companies was wasteful and led to market instability. Because so-called pools—secret deals between ostensibly rival companies to set production limits to keep prices high and award each participant a certain share of the market—inevitably failed, Rockefeller devised the trust. Unlike pools, which lacked any legal basis and thus carried no penalty for cheating, trusts were legally binding arrangements that brought many companies in the same industry under the direction of a single board of “trustees.” To join a trust, a company turned over to a board a majority of its stock in exchange for trust certificates, which guaranteed it a share of the profits. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust, for example, consisted of 40 companies under the direction of a nine-member board of trustees selected by Rockefeller himself. As profits soared, dozens of trusts in other industries, such as sugar, lead, cotton, and oil, were formed, although not all successfully.

 “Honest labor never rusts: up with labor down with trusts.” Banner in 1889 Boston Labor Day Parade The rapid emergence of giant trusts, as with the rise of large railroads, alarmed many Americans. Fueling this concern was the unwillingness of Congress and the Supreme Court to curb the power of big business. In 1886, the conservative Supreme Court declared that state railroad commissions did not have the authority to regulate railroads because only Congress had the right to regulate interstate commerce (Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Co. v. Illinois, 1886). In a separate case (Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, 1886), the Court also declared that corporations were “de facto persons” and thus subject to all the protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. No state or local government, therefore, could impose limits on corporations “without due process of law”—in other words, approval by conservative federal courts. The next year in 1887, Congress attempted to curb the power of the railroads by establishing the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and making pools and rebates (special discounts by railroads

THE EMERGENCE OF BIG BUSINESS

 to favored customers) illegal. But the ICC proved weak and ineffective, especially in the face of a conservative Supreme Court. Of the 16 cases that resulted when railroads challenged a ruling by the ICC between 1887 and 1905, the Court sided with the railroads 15 times. Big business also benefited from enormous political influence in Congress. In this damning 1889 cartoon from the popular magazine Puck, The Bosses of the Senate (16.7), the bloated trusts, are clearly in charge. Congress was all too willing to do the bidding of corporate interests. Note that the doorway marked “People’s Entrance” is boarded shut while a much larger “Entrance for Monopolists” is wide open. Note too the bitter conclusion that big business has subverted American democracy: “This is a Senate of the monopolists, by the monopolists, and for the monopolists.” The fate of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890 seemed to verify this conclusion. It was originally proposed to empower the Justice Department to prosecute any illegal contract, combination, or conspiracy among corporations that was designed to eliminate

 competition or restrain free trade. In other words the act made trusts illegal. But months of lobbying by corporate interests influenced Congress to word the final version of the act so vaguely that it was essentially unenforceable. As a result, the Justice Department prosecuted only 18 antitrust cases between 1890 and 1904. Rockefeller’s other major corporate management innovation—the holding company—replaced the trust in the 1890s as the preferred big business model. The holding company was a huge corporation that bought and ran other corporations by purchasing their stock. Rockefeller’s idea caught on immediately because it offered protection from the Sherman Act and allowed for the creation of enormous corporations, many of which exercised near monopoly control of the market. Corporate mergers occurred at an astonishing pace. By 1900, one percent of corporations controlled 33 percent of the nation’s manufacturing output, a figure that rose to 44 percent by 1910. The same was true of the railroads. In 1900, seven colossal railroads controlled twothirds of the nation’s track mileage. Big business, despite the best effort of reformers, was here to stay.

 Why did efforts to curb the power of trusts fail?



 CHAPTER 16

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

Creating a Mass Market
 Railroads, oil refineries, textile factories, and steel mills were the most vivid symbols of the industrial era, but production was only one part of the story. Equally important was consumption—getting the public to purchase the growing array of the national economy’s new products. Advertising would play a crucial role in creating a consumer culture, as would the department store and mail order catalogs.

The Art of Selling
 To promote consumption, businesses developed sophisticated advertising techniques and marketing strategies. Many hired psychologists and other experts to develop advertising campaigns that appealed to both consumers’ fears and their desires. Ads for toothpaste and deodorant, for example, stoked the public’s fears about bad breath and body odor, while those for pianos and fine clothing played to desires to appear sophisticated and wealthy. Advertisers also cultivated brand loyalty through catchy slogans and impressive claims. The makers of Ivory Soap, for example, touted their product’s healthful qualities with the impressive, but ridiculously exaggerated, claim that it was “99 44⁄100 % Pure.” Recognizing the value of celebrity, some manufacturers hired famous entertainers and athletes to endorse their products and allow the use of their pictures in ads. The underlying idea of advertising—spending a portion of a business’s profits to generate more profit—soon became a standard business principle. Spending on advertising jumped accordingly, from $50 million in 1867 to more than $500 million by 1900. As advertising caught on among manufacturers and retailers, competition led to increasingly complex and sophisticated advertisements. Gone were the days from before the Civil War when advertisers relied exclusively on a few bold headlines in a newspaper or magazine and some accompanying text touting a product’s quality and price. With so many advertisements jamming the pages of these media, and adorning roadside signs, sides of buildings, and grocery store windows, a product’s advertisement had to be eye-catching, convincing, and memorable. Advertisers experimented with new styles and sizes of type, developed catchy slogans, and enlisted celebrities and “experts” like doctors to vouch for their product. Once developments in

 print technology made it possible and affordable, they focused increasingly on images to sell their products.

Shopping as an Experience:
The Department Store
 With the emergence of advertising came the department store. Irish immigrant Alexander Turney Stewart established the first department store in New York City in 1846. Stewart and the entrepreneurs who copied his idea built giant stores that offered a huge selection of goods for sale usually organized into different “departments.” Customers also found a small army of clerks ready to assist them and fixed prices that eliminated uncomfortable negotiations. Retailers also offered attractive policies such as the money back guarantee and free delivery. By the 1870s, customers, increasingly called “shoppers,” flocked to department stores not only for the selection, price, and convenience but also for the experience. Retailers had discovered that it was not enough to offer the finest products at good prices. Shopping had to be a pleasurable experience, so merchants built palatial, richly decorated “emporiums,” an impressive Latin term meaning a store

 “You can now buy your pins, your outing shirts, your wines, your prayer books, your Indian clubs, your pianolas, your false teeth, your automobiles, … [and] your spectacles … in the same place.” The Wall Street Journal, 1903

 that displayed a large variety of merchandise. One of the first merchants to do so was John Wanamaker, who transformed a Philadelphia railroad depot in 1876 into a massive and opulently decorated store called the Grand Depot. Rival stores soon sought to outdo each other in size and splendor, and customers came to look forward to store openings. On September 12, 1896, for example, 150,000 New Yorkers paraded through the new Siegel Cooper store on opening day. This new “shopping resort,” as the New York Times called it, employed 8,000 clerks and cashiers and 1,000 drivers and packers. It offered not only a huge selection of merchandise but also conveniences such as telegraph and long-distance telephone services, foreign currency exchange and stock trading, and a dentist office. As this photograph (16.8) of the central lobby shows, the store also wowed shoppers with its lavish interior. Note the marble columns, high, decorative ceilings, and the statue in the center of “The Republic,” a copy of the one carved by the renowned American sculptor Daniel Chester French for the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago. The success of the department store led some retail entrepreneurs to expand their operations to large regions or even the whole country. The most noted



 figure in this field was Frank W. Woolworth, whose “five and dime” stores specialized in low prices rather than opulence. He opened his first store in Utica, New York, in 1879. By 1911, he owned more than 600. Like their big business counterparts in manufacturing, Woolworth and other national retailers found that with size came advantages. Because he bought huge quantities of goods, Woolworth received big discounts from wholesalers and manufacturers that allowed him to sell his merchandise at low prices.

Bringing the Market
 to the Frontier Some entrepreneurs realized that despite advertising and the growth of department stores, a massive retail market remained untapped: rural America. Living on farms or in small towns far from cities, these potential customers had money and desire to spend but lacked access to consumer goods. In 1872, Montgomery Ward set out to change that. If rural America could not get to a department store, he would bring it to them—in the form of a single broadsheet offering two dozen items for sale by “mail order.”

 CHAPTER 16

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

 Ward steadily expanded his list of offerings. By 1884, his broadsheet was now a catalog featuring some 10,000 items. By this time a rival mail order company run by Richard W. Sears and Alvah C. Roebuck had begun operation. Eager to reach this new market, established department stores like Macy’s in New York, Jordan Marsh in Boston, and Marshall Field’s in Chicago brought out their own mail order catalogs. The reach of corporate retailing beyond urban centers and into rural America (where most Americans lived until 1920) marked the emergence of a mass market. Whereas Americans had long shared a common language and republican political culture, they now developed a shared consumer culture. Exposed to the same advertising images and appeals, millions of Americans in different parts of the country began to adopt the same fashions, develop the same habits (cigarette smoking, for example), and purchase the same newfangled contraptions, including more than one million bicycles a year in the 1890s.

Selling to the World
 As the nation’s industrial production soared to unprecedented heights, manufacturers searched for new markets for their goods. The United States had long been an exporter of agricultural products like cotton and wheat, but the leading trend after the

 Civil War was the export of manufactured goods. The total value of exports rose between 1870 and 1900 from $450 million to $1.5 billion, with the percentage of manufactured goods rising from 15 to 32 percent. In addition to selling produce and goods overseas, American business interests also began to invest heavily in business ventures in foreign countries. By 1897, Americans had invested $635 million in overseas mines, plantations, oil wells, and increasingly, manufacturing plants ($94 million). By the 1890s, the Singer Sewing Machine Co. was an international corporation ( 16.9). With factories in Scotland and the United States, Singer sold its machines throughout the world. Note how the advertisement’s text, “The Singer Seam unites Two Continents,” and angelic female figures suggest that the company is pursuing humanitarian as well as capitalist goals. Farm equipment giant, International Harvester, likewise opened factories in Canada and Sweden. The globalization of the American economy brought many benefits to workers, consumers, and investors. But it also contributed to the growing sentiment in the 1890s that the United States needed to become an imperial power to protect overseas investments and ensure that markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America remained open (see Chapter 19).

THE WORLD OF WORK TRANSFORMED



The World of Work Transformed
 The huge industrial enterprises built by Carnegie, Rockefeller, and others ultimately depended not on their individual genius but on the collective labors of American workers. As the number and size of factories grew in the late nineteenth century, so did the industrial workforce expanding from 1.3 million workers in 1860 to 5.1 million in 1900. Many of them faced hardships: long hours, low pay, dangerous conditions, and frequent downturns in the economy. Workers responded by forming unions, staging strikes, and protesting the surging power of business as a threat to democracy.

The Impact of
New Technology


Hard Times for
Industrial Workers


 New industrial technology greatly increased manufacturing output, but it also changed the status of industrial workers. New machines produced more goods in less time and required mostly low-skilled labor to operate. Machinery transformed shoemaking, for example, from a skilled trade in the 1820s to a low-skill factory occupation by the 1860s. The same was true in the garment and textile industries. Because they could easily replace low-skilled labor, employers could pay low wages and demand long hours. They could also simply fire or replace workers who complained or failed to keep up the pace with other unskilled workers. This trend occurred unevenly across industrial America. For example, in building trades like carpentry and bricklaying, new technology did little to undermine the position of skilled craftsmen. In other settings new technology created new opportunities for some workers. Some found well-paid skilled work as mechanics, while others became foremen and floor managers who oversaw the work of unskilled operatives. These more fortunate workers often enjoyed far higher wages, shorter hours, and better treatment than the unskilled. Nonetheless for many workers new industrial technology eliminated their skilled jobs in favor of unskilled ones. Just as shoemaking changed from a skilled trade in the 1820s to a low-skill factory occupation by the 1860s, so did the garment and textile industries. In these settings, employers enjoyed increasing power over their employees for the simple reason that unskilled workers were easily replaced.

 New technology was but one of many difficulties confronting industrial workers in the age of industrialization. Most workers complained about long hours and low wages. Although averages for both varied by industry and region, workers often toiled 12 hours a day, six days a week, for wages that barely covered basic living expenses. By some estimates wage earners in the late nineteenth century made $400–500 per year, when living decently required a minimum of $600–800. Working-class families made up the difference by sending their children to work, taking in boarders, and bringing in “home finishing” work, performed by women and children, such as sewing buttons on new shirts. Compounding the precarious economic position of wage earners was the instability of the industrial economy. Severe depressions (1873–1877 and 1893–1897) and recessions interrupted periods of prosperity and economic growth and brought widespread business failure and high unemployment lasting years. The severe depression of the 1870s, for example, resulted in the loss of more than a million jobs and nearly 50,000 businesses. Those who did keep their jobs often found their wages slashed and hours increased by employers desperate to remain solvent or ruthless enough to take advantage of rising job competition between the employed and the unemployed. The monotony of industrial work also added to the difficulties wage earners faced. Many jobs required a laborer to perform the same task repeatedly, such as pulling a lever on a metal stamping machine. Workers felt, in the words of one machinist in 1883, that they were becoming “part of

16.10 The Price
 of Child Labor Because they could pay children less than one-half the wages of an adult, employers hired more children in the late nineteenth century, depriving them of education and often exposing them to industrial hazards.

 the machinery,” a state of affairs they found “very demoralizing.” The industrial workplace was also extremely dangerous. Every year between 1880 and 1900, 35,000 workers (on average) were killed on the job and another 500,000 injured. This carnage resulted in part from the monotony of factory work, which led mind-numbed workers to make mistakes or fall asleep. But most injuries stemmed from the factory owners’ negligence. With no laws compelling them to make their workplaces less lethal, few industrialists were willing to pay for safety devices or procedures. Not until the early twentieth century did most states begin enacting laws requiring compensation be paid to injured workers or the families of killed workers (see Chapter 18). Another disturbing trend was the sharp rise in child labor. Before the Industrial Revolution children of farmers and artisans performed all sorts of work that contributed to the family economy—but always under the supervision of a parent or relative. Children working in industry, however, left their homes to work in factories and mines under the supervision of a manager rather than a parent. Between 1870 and 1900, the number of children younger than 16 working for wages—usually a fraction of those paid adults—skyrocketed from 700,000 to 1.7 million. Children as young as seven toiled long hours in dangerous conditions in mines and factories, at jobs that exposed them to dangerous and unhealthful conditions. The boy in this photograph (16.10) lost his arm while operating a power saw in a box factory. Many states passed laws prohibiting child labor, but they rarely enforced them.

 Central to the transformation in the lives workers ushered in by industrialization was the increasing power exercised by employers in the workplace. Since profit was their paramount goal, employers imposed strict discipline on their workers. clock dominated the workplace, as employers demanded workers begin and their day (with a few short scheduled breaks) at precise times. Workers who

 arrived late or took unauthorized breaks were fined or fired. Some factories forbade workers to talk to one another—or even to whistle.

 “I make about three dollars a week, and my sister—she is only six years old—she does not make as much, sometimes a dollar a week, sometimes more.” An eight-year-old child laborer, New York, 1871 Enforcing these new rules was an increasingly important figure in the industrial workplace: the manager or foreman. In sharp contrast to the early nineteenth-century preindustrial economy, few workers now ever saw, let alone spoke to, their employer. Instead, they dealt with managers or foremen hired to run a factory as efficiently and profitably as possible. This meant pushing workers to meet production goals and firing those who could not keep up or caused trouble. Many foremen came from working-class backgrounds and treated workers fairly, but others could be abusive, especially to workers of a different ethnic background. Female workers were particularly vulnerable to abuse. In this drawing from 1888, the foreman in a garment factory shakes his fist at a weary woman, urging her to work faster (16.11). In the larger inset, the overworked woman sprawls on a bed in a dingy tenement. That this image ran under the sensational title The Female Slaves of New York in a popular newspaper that often expressed hostility toward workers indicates the notoriety the foreman had achieved in the garment industry by the late nineteenth century. Workers also found it difficult to organize labor unions. The first major effort to build a national labor movement after the Civil War began in 1866 when William Sylvis, a charismatic iron molder, founded the National Labor Union (NLU). A federation of independent craft unions, the NLU sought to unite skilled workers nationwide to secure demands such as a federal law establishing the eight-hour day and a federal department of labor. Its membership topped 300,000 (nearly all native-born white men in skilled trades)

16.11 Exploiting Female Workers
 Shop floor foremen and managers became increasingly important as workplaces grew bigger. As demands for productivity grew, female workers were especially vulnerable to abusive foremen. The threat of overwork to the health of women is emphasized in the two insets. One depicts workers carrying heavy bundles of work home while another shows an exhausted laborer collapsed on her bed.

 by 1869. But Sylvis’s sudden death that year weakened the NLU, and the depression of the 1870s wiped it out. Most employers saw unions as threats to their profits and freedom to run their businesses as they wanted. Many hired spies to expose labor organizers so they could fire them and put them on blacklists, lists of workers that employers in a town or industry refused to hire because they were considered trouble-makers. During strikes, employers routinely hired replacement workers, and enjoyed the support of local officials who ordered policemen to drive away or arrest pickets gathered outside a workplace. If a labor dispute went to court, an employer could normally count on a favorable ruling by a judge or jury. On top of all this, workers faced one over-riding problem—few unions had the resources to support striking workers for more

 than a few weeks. Strikers, one worker attested, “have had nothing to combat capital with except their empty stomachs, while the capitalists have had unlimited financial resources and have been able to starve the workingmen into submission.” Rising worker frustration and anger led to more strikes and violence. Between 1881 and 1905, six million American workers participated in nearly 37,000 strikes. One particularly bitter incident took place in Pennsylvania. In response to the abusive policies of coal mine bosses in the 1860s, miners had formed a union called the Workingmen’s Benevolent Association (WBA). Many of its members were Irish immigrants, some of whom, drawing on the tradition of secret societies that resisted oppressive landlords in Ireland, formed a clandestine labor organization known as the Molly Maguires that carried out acts of intimidation, vandalism, violence, and murder against foremen and managers. In 1874, mine owners set out to destroy the WBA by convincing the public that it was one and the same as the Molly Maguires. Within a year this campaign resulted in more than 50 arrests and numerous convictions—many on questionable testimony and with little or no evidence. Twenty alleged Molly Maguires were hanged for murder, including ten on a single day, June 21, 1877. Note how in this drawing (16.12) public officials created a powerful public spectacle to emphasize the men’s guilt and, aware that

 most of the region’s miners were Catholic, their sinfulness. Three weeks later, on July 14, 1877, the largest nineteenth century strike in the world erupted. The “Great Uprising” of railroad workers began in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and quickly spread to Baltimore, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Chicago, and other cities. The strike involved thousands of workers, and violence emanated from both sides. In Pittsburgh, for example, soldiers opened fire on striking workers and their families, killing 25 and wounding 29. Enraged strikers and their supporters attacked the troops and destroyed all of the Pennsylvania Railroad terminal’s buildings and other property. The mainstream press criticized the railroads for slashing workers’ wages, but most dismissed labor activism as illegal, ill-informed, and un-American. (See Competing Visions: The Legitimacy of Unions.) While workers faced hostility from employers, politicians, and journalists, they also had to contend with animosity within the ranks of labor that often hindered their ability to organize. Deep hostility often existed between skilled and unskilled workers, who frequently saw little in common with each other. Workers were also riven by disputes arising from different ideologies, including varieties of socialism, a theory that rejected capitalism and advocated common ownership of private property and greater social and economic equality. They also argued the persistent question of whether workers’ interests were best

 served by pressuring the major political parties or by forming an independent labor party. Perhaps the most significant divisions among workers centered on race and ethnicity. A rising tide of immigration in the late nineteenth century increased the ethnic, racial, and religious diversity of an already diverse workforce, making it more difficult to unite them in common cause. For example, when hard times hit during the depression of the 1870s, anti-Chinese sentiment among American workers soared, leading to the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 barring Chinese immigration to the United States. As the cartoon (16.13) from The Wasp demonstrates, Chinese workers were blamed for taking jobs from Americans. The artist depicts a 12-armed Chinese worker, drawn in racist caricature, laboring maniacally at a dozen tasks while young American-born workers stand idly near a factory. One of the workers is being hauled away by a policeman, implying that unemployment has led him to a life of crime. African American workers also faced racist hostility from white workers, especially when they began moving to Northern cities in the 1890s. Much of this hostility stemmed from the widely held racist beliefs of the day including the concept that all whites were superior to blacks. But it also emanated from the fear that African Americans would take jobs from white workers—a fear exacerbated when employers occasionally used black workers as strikebreakers.

Competing Visions
THE LEGITIMACY OF UNIONS
Although conflict between workers and their employers often centered on wages and hours, it also occurred over the legitimacy of labor unions. Many Americans denounced unions as illegal, foolish, and un-American. The editor of Scribner’s Monthly, writing after the 1877 Great Uprising of railroad workers, reflects this view as does the image from Puck. Workers and their advocates like John Swinton, editor of a pro-labor newspaper in New York, offered a different vision of labor unions as vital organizations that protected workers from the exploitation. Why did employers find unions so objectionable, even dangerous? What benefits did workers see in unions? 
 Scribner’s Monthly (October 1877)

 John Swinton’s Paper (January 27, 1884)

 And now that it is over, it is a good time to ask once more what good has come from this strike, and what good has come of any strike. The laws of nature which, after all, govern the laws of trade … can never be overcome or circumvented by a strike. Labor will always command its value—no more, no less.… Strikes are always mistakes; they are often crimes. The day of the inauguration of trades unions and labor organizations in this country was a day the blackest and fullest of menace to the popular prosperity and peace that ever dawned upon the nation. They have been an unmitigated curse to employers and employed alike. The nature and purpose of these organizations are simply outrageous. They have been despotic toward their own members, oppressive toward the class in whose interest they pretend to have been established, impertinent and intermeddling. They have assumed the right to control property and business in which they had no more right than if they lived in the moon. There should be in the good sense of the great mass of laborers a reaction against this wretched crime, and this stupendous foolishness.

 There are many who cannot understand why Trades Unions exist here. They have heard them described as alien to the American craftsman, causing strikes, and raising ill-feeling generally between … employer and employe[e]. In the present state of industry, Trade Unions are a necessity, recognized as such by the great majority of intelligent workmen, … and securing for their members a partial degree of protection without which they would sink into depths as yet unfathomed. There is a hue and cry against the Unions as agencies that provoke strikes. In nine cases out of ten, strikes are made necessary by circumstances over which the Unions have no control whatever; sometimes they are a protest against unendurable reductions in wages … sometimes by unjust conduct on the part of bosses or corporations. No Union to-day orders a strike that can be avoided by reasonable means; no Union orders a strike without full consideration of the subject and after a fair vote.… But we are told that no strike ever brings any advantage to the strikers … This is a mistake that cannot be made by any one who has observed the results of strikes either in the United States or in any other country.… But strikes often fail,—yes, it is true. Capital often triumphs in the conflict with labor,—true again. Yet capital would be even harsher and more exacting than it is, if it were not for the protest of the strike, and the warning that it gives. The wages which, in many industries, are but little above the living point, would be put down and kept down to the starvation point, if the men accepted with submissive spirit every reduction of wages, and all the severe terms that capital tries to enforce.

 This Puck magazine cartoon from the mid-1880s portrayed labor union officials as tyrants who hurt the interests of workers.

 Why did labor activists argue that unions were defensive in nature?

New Roles and Opportunities
 for Women Economic necessity brought millions of women into the paid workforce. Whereas just 13 percent of women worked outside the home in 1870, 20 percent did so by 1900. Nearly all these women were single and younger than 25. Domestic service (cooking, cleaning, and childcare in the homes of middleand upper-class families) remained the leading occupation for wage-earning women in this period, but many also took on factory work, especially in the garment and textile industries. Like their male counterparts, women factory workers labored at repetitive tasks for long hours in unsafe conditions—but for only half (or less) the wages of men. Employers justified this disparity by claiming women worked merely for extra money, whereas men worked to support whole families and therefore deserved higher pay. In fact, many working-class families depended for their survival on the earnings of wives and daughters. Factory owners simply paid them less because women were powerless to prevent it. The emergence of modern corporations requiring armies of secretaries, clerks, and stenographers, combined with the invention of the telephone,

 adding machine, and typewriter, created new opportunities for educated, native-born, white women (16.14). Teaching, social work, and, as indicated in the graduation photograph of the Philadelphia School for Nurses (16.15), nursing emerged in the late nineteenth century as almost exclusively female professions. Although these fields represented new opportunities for women, they were deemed appropriate because they drew on what was widely believed to be women’s “natural” role as nurturers. The pageantry evident in this photograph, especially the bright white and highly professional looking uniforms, the elegant setting of the Philadelphia Academy of Music, and the presence of Red Cross founder Clara Barton (seated at center), indicates the high reputation the profession had achieved by 1900. Regardless of the level of work, social custom dictated that women leave the paid workforce soon after they married (only five percent of married women worked outside the home in 1900). Of necessity, working-class women continued to earn money to support their families. Only now they did so from within the home by taking in boarders, laundry, and “piece work,” which paid by the piece rather than by the hour. Many more African American women, more out of economic necessity than custom, remained in the paid workforce even after marriage. In urban areas in both the North and South, many worked as domestic servants in white homes, cooking, cleaning, doing the laundry, and caring for children. These jobs required long hours and paid low wages, but racist hiring policies in industry and other sectors of the economy left African American women with few options.

CONFLICTING VISIONS OF INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISM



Conflicting Visions of
Industrial Capitalism
 As the Industrial Revolution unfolded in the late nineteenth century, Americans of all classes, occupations, and regions felt its impact. For many it was an age of wonder, marked by a succession of new inventions, ideas, and possibilities. Yet one did not have to look far for signs of anxiety, fear, and discontent. Numerous critics offered a different vision of society, emphasizing the growing poverty, gaps between rich and poor, and inequality.

Capitalism Championed
 Many Americans in the late nineteenth century celebrated industrial capitalism. Proponents noted that every year American industry produced more consumer goods, from inexpensive clothing in a dizzying array of colors and styles to exciting new products like phonographs and bicycles. It also generated new forms of transportation that allowed people, including the poor, to travel to new and different places. In farming industrial technology led to stupendous annual harvests, falling food prices, and a more varied diet for the average American, whose life expectancy rose from a mere 38.3 years for white men in 1850 to 50 years by 1910. The telegraph, telephone, and steampowered printing press allowed for the unprecedented spread of information and literacy (aided by an expanded public school system). And despite unrest, depressions, and strikes, real wages for the average worker rose 50 percent between 1860 and 1900 (74 percent for skilled workers and 31 percent for unskilled). To these optimists industrial capitalism meant progress. Of the enthusiastic champions of the new industrial order, none was more fervent and influential than Andrew Carnegie. He offset his harddriving corporate style with a carefully constructed public image designed to set him apart from many of his fellow industrialists who angered the public with arrogant pronouncements. The shipping and railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, for example, once brushed aside the suggestion that his business practices violated the law by saying, “Law! What do I care about the law? Ain’t I got the power?”

Read the Document Andrew Carnegie, “Wealth”


 In countless speeches and articles in prominent magazines, Carnegie defended the status quo and emphasized its virtues. Rejecting the claims of critics that industrialists like him were greedy, abusive monopolists, he insisted they were visionaries who built key industries that brought immeasurable benefits to Americans, including jobs for workers and products that improved the quality of life. Granted, Carnegie explained in what he came to call the “Gospel of Wealth,” he and other entrepreneurs had grown fabulously rich, but this was a necessary and beneficial result of a free economy. Without the hope of future riches, business leaders would not have the incentive to seek new opportunities, take risks, and develop new products.

 “I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half.” Financier and railroad magnate JAY GOULD Carnegie and other champions of big business also emphasized that industrial fortunes could be— and increasingly were—used to fund philanthropic projects such as schools and libraries. In the 1880s and 1890s he emerged as the nation’s most ostentatious philanthropist. In 1901 he sold his steel empire to financier J. P. Morgan for $400 million and then donated most of it to various causes, including thousands of public libraries. For a man who was both conservative and optimistic, libraries appeared the perfect form of charity because they

 How did business leaders like Carnegie defend industrial capitalism?



 CHAPTER 16

16.16 The
Carnegie Library
 and Floor Plan in Lincoln, Nebraska As a symbol of the virtue of industrial capitalism and the spirit of individual uplift, steel magnate Andrew Carnegie funded nearly 1,700 public libraries in America. The exterior designs reflected the popularity of classical styles circa 1900. The interiors emphasized the industrial values of order and efficiency.

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

 provided ambitious, hard-working, and intelligent people opportunities to better themselves, instead of handouts. This Carnegie library (16.16), built in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1901, typified the more than 2,500 (1,689 in the United States) libraries funded by Carnegie between 1886 and 1929. Communities awarded a library were allowed to pick their own architectural style. Most, like Lincoln, opted for some variation on the popular neoclassical style. But Carnegie and the staff that oversaw the program insisted that library interiors stress efficiency and order—the values reflected in the design of his steel factories. Note how the floor plan allowed for a single centrally located librarian (seated at the curved desk in the center) to monitor all the neatly organized spaces devoted to reading, children, reference, and stacks. When Carnegie and other defenders of industrial capitalism were asked about the growing problem of poverty amid such progress, they pointed to what they claimed was the greatest virtue of a capitalist economy: the self-made man. As Carnegie’s own life story seemed to attest, anyone, regardless of birthplace, family, education, or poverty, could climb the ladder of success. Success was not guaranteed, noted Carnegie. But for those who possessed self-discipline, intelligence, frugality, and diligence and who avoided liquor and debt, the future was bright. Aiding Andrew Carnegie and other optimists in spreading this ideal of the self-made man was Horatio Alger. A former minister, Alger wrote more than 100 young adult books, beginning with Ragged Dick in 1868. All featured similar plots that told the story of a young boy, often a bootblack or a delivery boy, who lived a life of poverty and irresponsibility on the mean streets of a big city. Through the intervention

 Why was the self-made man idea so popular in the age of industry?

 of a “respectable” man, the boy discovers that he need only end his prodigal ways and pursue education and opportunity to enjoy the good life. Alger sold millions of books, and imitators churned out similar publications, including the popular Fame and Fortune magazine (16.17). As this cover shows, each issue offered dramatic “stories of boys who make money” by exhibiting honesty, diligence, and courage. Not all conservative defenders of industrial capitalism shared Alger’s rosy vision of a society where anyone willing to work hard, save money, and avoid liquor could find success. They subscribed to a theory known as social Darwinism, a corruption of Charles Darwin’s biological theory of natural selection (later termed “evolution”). British philosopher and sociologist Herbert Spencer took Darwin’s central idea that in evolution, plants and animals that are able to adapt to changing conditions survive, while those that cannot become extinct, and tailored it to fit his idea of modern industrial society as “survival of

16.17 The Promise of Success
 Taking their cue from the success of Horatio Alger’s success in writing scores of young adult novels, many imitators published similar books and magazines preaching that reward and respectability could be won if only one worked hard, told the truth, and helped the less fortunate.

And the poor? They were the “unfit,” men and women consigned by nature to failure, misery, and early death.

They also attacked any initiatives public or private to alleviate the plight of the poor because they would promote the survival and growth of the unfit population with devastating consequences for society.



 parents fail to notice the shivering children as they pass. Many commentators in this period focused on the profound extremes of wealth and poverty found in two New York City neighborhoods: Fifth Avenue and Five Points. In the former neighborhood were the homes of the Stewarts, Vanderbilts, Astors, Morgans, and Carnegies. They patronized the opulent Metropolitan Opera House, entertained each other at lavish balls and dinners, and summered in their 50-room “cottages” in coastal retreats like Newport, Rhode Island. Just a few miles downtown was a notorious district called the Five Points. In this neighborhood and the surrounding Lower East Side district, nearly one million people lived in tiny, airless tenement apartments with no running water or toilets. Their neighborhoods had no parks, and the streets were filled with filth due to irregular street cleaning. Reformers, ministers, and social critics began to question whether American democracy, with its ideals of equal rights and individual freedom, could endure under such inequality and enslaving poverty. For example, a self-taught political economist named Henry George wrote Progress and

Capitalism Criticized
 Despite these confident assertions on the morality and virtue of laissez-faire industrial capitalism, critics decried the widening chasm between rich and poor. While some 4,000 Americans had become “millionaires” by the early 1890s, millions of others lived in poverty, or perilously close to it. A tour of any city provided ample evidence of what some called the “haves and the have nots,” a concern vividly captured in this 1876 image (16.18) from a popular magazine. Its caption, “The Hearth-Stone of the Poor,” and accompanying article pointed out that many of the poor, unlike the wealthy family on the left, had no warm fireplace around which to gather on cold nights. Instead, like these children, they gathered around outdoor steam vents to keep warm. Note how the wealthy

 16.18 The Growing Gap between the Haves and Have-Nots This image, The Hearth-Stone of the Poor from the popular magazine Harper’s Weekly (February 12, 1876) captured the growing concern among Americans over the growth of poverty amid rising levels of wealth.

 Why was the theory of social Darwinism so attractive to the wealthy and successful?

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

 Poverty, an influential book that addressed one of the central questions of the age: Must industrial and technological progress be accompanied by increased poverty? If so, he warned, American democracy was doomed. George claimed that the monopolization of resources, especially of land, by powerful elites was to blame for the era’s growing social inequality and class conflict. Few people understood or supported George’s unorthodox solution (a “single tax” on land values), but his vivid diagnosis of the rising clash between labor and capital and his vision of a more equitable social order gained him an enormous following in the 1880s and turned Progress and Poverty into a bestseller. Edward Bellamy achieved similar fame as a critic of laissez-faire capitalism with his novel Looking Backward, 2000–1887. Published in 1887, it told the story of Julian West who, like Rip Van Winkle in another era, falls asleep in 1887 and awakens in 2000. To his astonishment he finds American society transformed into a socialist utopia. The class conflict, poverty, and economic inequality of the late nineteenth century are gone. The government controlled the economy, eliminating destructive competition and providing a comfortable living for all citizens. Bellamy’s book became a bestseller, and his largely middle-class followers established nearly 500 clubs to spread its message.

Power in Numbers:
Organized Labor
 Less famous, but more influential than critics like George and Bellamy, were the protests of those most buffeted by the Industrial Revolution: workers. Through the pages of labor newspapers and in speeches at worker rallies—and in actions such as strikes—American workers articulated a sharp critique of the new industrial order. A few were socialists, but most supported the broad ideals of a free market economy. Their protest stemmed from the growing conviction that greedy monopolists, in league with unscrupulous politicians, had seized control of the economy and bent it toward their own advantage. As a result, argued workers, they received a shrinking portion of the wealth they created, while working longer hours in increasingly inhumane conditions. Try as they might, these workers claimed, the upward mobility celebrated by

 What conditions led to rapid membership growth in the Knights of Labor?

 Andrew Carnegie and Horatio Alger was less and less attainable. Unsettled and angered by their declining power in the face of big business, American workers renewed their efforts to organize labor unions. In 1869, Philadelphia garment cutters formed The Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor (KOL), an organization that called for many of the same reforms as the NLU, but added a long list of radical, even utopian, goals. For example, it advocated replacing the existing competitive industrial system with an economy based on cooperation. In addition, unlike the NLU’s emphasis on craft workers, the KOL was an industrial union open to all workers, including unskilled wage earners, immigrants, and eventually women and African Americans. Its leaders believed that fundamental social change was impossible unless this broad spectrum of workers joined forces. To overcome employer hostility, the organization adopted a policy of strict secrecy that necessitated holding meetings in clandestine locations. This requirement, however, combined with the depression of 1873–1877, hindered its growth. By 1879, it counted just 10,000 members, most in Pennsylvania. But two key developments that year propelled the KOL to become the world’s largest industrial union. First, the national economy recovered, providing wage earners with a measure of economic security that allowed them to form and join local unions in huge numbers. Second, a young machinist named Terence Powderly became the KOL’s leader, or Grandmaster Workman. Powderly was a superb organizer and gifted orator who in 1882 abolished the KOL’s secrecy rule, a decision that made it possible to recruit thousands of new members and fend off accusations from employers, politicians, and religious leaders that the KOL was a sinister and conspiratorial organization. Membership soared to 42,000 in 1882 (on its way to an eventual peak of more than 700,000 in late 1886). What drew many workers to the organization was the KOL’s sharp critique of laissez-faire capitalism and emphasis on economic justice and democracy. Its constitution decried, “the recent alarming development and aggression of aggregated wealth” by industrialists, bankers, and stock speculators, warning that it would soon lead “to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses.” (See Images as History: Why Fear Big Business?”)

WHY FEAR BIG BUSINESS?
people—retain its legitimacy when big business exercised so much power and answered to no public officials and no voters? Other Americans focused on the plight of the worker under such a system. How could workers resist the power of large employers to slash wages, increase hours, and ignore safety issues? Could the United States endure as a republic if these citizens were reduced to desperate poverty while a few wealthy families reveled in luxury? These concerns are on full display in this vivid political cartoon from Puck Magazine. 
 As large corporations emerged in the Gilded Age (the late nineteenth century period of rapid economic growth), many Americans grew concerned about their power and influence. Some focused on the fact that large corporations and the immensely powerful men that ran them, people like John D. Rockefeller and William H. Vanderbilt, operated beyond the control of laws and democratic institutions. Did this not mean, they asked, that the republic was in danger? How could a democracy—a society governed by the will of the

 The artist represents the horse of “monopoly” as a huge golden locomotive. Railroads were the original big businesses and the largest corporations. They were also at the center of the era’s biggest corruption scandals and strikes. In contrast, the shoeless American worker sits on a scrawny horse labeled “poverty.”

 Big business and monopoly are depicted as a knight, a symbol of European aristocracy and the antithesis of republicanism. His plume carries the word, “arrogance.” Note how this figure stands in sharp contrast with the much smaller, humble worker.

 In a section labeled “Reserved for Capitalists,” sits a collection of the nation’s most powerful businessmen, including Cyrus Field, William H. Vanderbilt, and Jay Gould. Note the joy they seem to take in seeing the American worker destroyed.

 This huge, seemingly endless, crowd symbolizes the American people, who clearly outnumber the handful of capitalists on the left. Observe how small the people are compared to the industrialists. Note too how most of the crowd looks anxious or angry at what is happening (some shake their fists) and how some of the children appear malnourished.

 One of the most significant aspects of this image is its source. Subscribers to Puck were overwhelmingly middle- and upper-class. This shows that the rising fear of big business in the Gilded Age was not confined to low-wage factory workers. It was shared by a large cross-section of the American people.

 The vast disparity in power is captured in the weapons brought to the fight. The knight holds a shield labeled “corruption of the legislature,” suggesting corporate titans’ ability to bribe state and federal elected officials to ensure laws favorable to business. In his other hand he holds a lance labeled “subsidized press,” indicating the power of big business to buy favorable coverage in the newspapers. The lowly worker, in contrast, holds only one weapon: the strike.

 Why did so many Americans come to fear big business in the Gilded Age?



 CHAPTER 16

16.19 Establishing
Labor Day
 In 1882, workers in New York City held the first local Labor Day celebration. It soon became a national holiday.

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

 These sentiments and spirit of protest inspired workers in New York City, many of them KOL members, to establish the Labor Day holiday in September 1882. The organizers took care to present workers as orderly and dignified, marching in almost military fashion (16.19). Yet they also held aloft signs voicing their grievances (“Abolish Contract Labor” and “8 Hours to Constitute A Day’s Work”) and announcing their intent to reclaim their influence in the political system (“Vote for the Labor Ticket”). Others proclaimed the importance of workers (“Labor Creates All Wealth” and “Labor Pays All Taxes”), and in an age of growing economic inequality, reminded the spectators of key American principles (“All Men Are Created Equal”). The annual Labor Day holiday quickly gained popularity. By 1886, it was a national event, and in 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed a law establishing Labor Day as a holiday for all federal workers. Another significant aspect of the KOL’s vision, albeit one that was not embraced in every part of the country, especially the South, was its inclusion of African American workers as members. Many in the KOL’s leadership argued that the union

 Why did so many workers find the Knights of Labor appealing?

 must include all workers, including blacks, because employers would inevitably use them against organized labor to break strikes and lower wages. This same argument for inclusion led the KOL to allow women members. As a result, in an era when labor unions were almost exclusively the domain of white men, in 1886, ten percent of the KOL’s membership was women and another ten percent was African American. Many workers also joined the KOL because it emphasized practical goals. Its constitution called for the eight-hour workday, equal pay for men and women, the establishment of state bureaus of labor, and the prohibition of child and convict labor. The KOL also gained enormous support among workers because it led successful strikes. But the decision to strike was difficult and risky. (See Choices and Consequences: To Strike or Not to Strike?) Most strikes in this period were small and local, but on several occasions the KOL enjoyed success on a grand scale. In 1885, KOL-affiliated railroad workers won a strike against the Wabash Railroad, owned by financier Jay Gould, a man widely despised and

Choices and Consequences
TO STRIKE OR NOT TO STRIKE?
Most strikes in the late nineteenth century failed, but the surge in labor activism and the emergence of the Knights of Labor in the 1880s boosted confidence among workers that strikes could succeed. In the summer of 1881, the hundreds of male shoemakers in the Knights Local Assembly 64 successfully opposed a wage reduction by the Mundell Company in Philadelphia. Management then imposed a rate cut on its female shoemakers. One of the workers, Mary Stirling, urged the workers, men and women, to strike until the company rescinded the wage cut. The workers at the Mundell Company considered essentially three major options: 
Choices




 Fearing for their jobs male and female workers refuse to strike.



 Seeking to protect their recent victory, the men remain on the job while the women walk out.



 Recognizing their mutual interests in opposing wage cuts for all workers, the male and female workers agree to strike together.

Decision
 Inspired by the KOL motto, “an injury to one is the concern of all,” the 700 men and women of the Mundell factory decided on option 3, walking out at Mary Stirling’s urging. The strike lasted weeks, during which time the female workers formed their own KOL local assembly—even though the union did not yet enroll female members. Strikers organized pickets, rallies, and fundraisers to help pay for food and rent.

Consequences
 The Mundell Company, facing lost profits and pressure to settle from other factory owners who feared worker unrest, rescinded the wage cut. The victory boosted the confidence of the workers and the reputation of the KOL locally. Within three years the shoe industry alone had 11 local assemblies that managed to win many struggles with employers over wages, firings, and work rules. Even more important, later in 1881, Mary Stirling attended the national convention of the KOL and convinced the organization to admit women. By 1887, ten percent of the KOL’s 700,000 members were women.

The Mundell Shoe
Company was one of the
 nation’s leading footwear manufacturers in the late nineteenth century

Continuing Controversies
 How should organized labor deal with the rising number of women in the workforce? The admission of women into the KOL did not end the opposition of many American workers to the rights of women to work and join unions. They continued to argue that keeping women out of the workforce

 would open up jobs for men and raise overall wages. When the KOL fell apart in the 1890s, the status of women in the labor movement fell with it. The American Federation of Labor, the organization that succeeded the KOL, admitted few female members until well into the twentieth century.

 What made strikes so risky for workers?



 CHAPTER 16

WONDER AND WOE: THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL AMERICA, 1865–1900

 feared by workers. Elsewhere the KOL popularized the boycott, the organized effort to discourage customers from patronizing a business engaged in antilabor activity, as an effective labor tactic less costly and risky than a strike. As the KOL’s membership and influence grew in the mid-1880s, it alarmed employers, politicians, and conservatives, who feared its radical rhetoric of class conflict and demands for economic reform. They denounced Powderly and other KOL leaders as radical socialists bent on promoting violence and class warfare. Although both accusations were false, they made many Americans, including many wage earners, leery of the KOL and of organized labor.

The Great Upheaval of 1886
 Fear of the KOL in particular and the labor movement in general peaked in 1886. On May 1, 340,000 workers across the country staged a one-day work stoppage to bring attention to their demand for the eight-hour day. Three days later a far more serious

 incident occurred that would hurt the labor movement for decades. Outraged by the killing of striking workers outside the McCormick Reaper Works in Chicago, the city’s radical labor leaders called a mass meeting in Haymarket Square on May 4. When 300 policemen moved in to disperse the crowd, a bomb exploded amid their ranks. The enraged police attacked the crowd with guns and batons. In less than 20 minutes, seven policemen lay dead (most, an investigation would show, from shots fired by fellow officers) along with four workers. The press quickly dubbed the incident the Haymarket Riot, and especially when accompanied by images such as this one (16.20), the incident stoked vehement opposition to organized labor. Note the placement of the dead policemen in a sort of martyrs’ pantheon above a riot scene depicting “murderous rioters” being gunned down. The next day, as hysterical headlines across the nation proclaimed that revolution was at hand, Chicago police arrested eight men, all selfproclaimed anarchists, and charged them with

 murder. After a hasty trial in which even the prosecution conceded that no one had seen the men throw a bomb, all were convicted. Seven were sentenced to death and one to life imprisonment. Four were hanged; one committed suicide in his cell. In 1893, Illinois elected a pro-labor governor who pardoned the remaining three, declaring they had not received a fair trial. Haymarket created a climate of fear and provided justification for officials across the nation to crack down on the labor movement. Throughout the spring and summer of 1886, hundreds of labor activists were arrested—100 in New York City alone. In response workers across the nation formed labor parties and ran candidates for offices from city councilor to governor. Most candidates lacked the money or experience to win, but there were notable surprises. For example, Chicago’s United Labor Party polled 25,000 votes (of 92,000 cast) and elected a state senator and seven state assemblymen. In Milwaukee, the People’s Party elected a mayor, a state senator, six state assemblymen, and a congressman. In one of the most widely watched contests, Henry George, the reformer and author of Progress and Poverty, finished a close second in the mayor’s race in New York City—out polling Republican Theodore Roosevelt, who finished a distant third. However, the unity and hope expressed by workers at the polls in November 1886 were soon undermined. First, the tumult of 1886 brought to the fore the dissatisfaction of many skilled workers within the KOL. Deeming the organization too strike prone and too influenced by socialists and radicals (who after Haymarket brought organized labor unwanted criticism), 25 unions of skilled workers convened in Columbus, Ohio, in December 1886 and founded the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The more radical activists within the



 KOL also grew dissatisfied with Powderly’s leadership, decrying his growing opposition to strikes and political action. Anti-labor hysteria in the press and legal repression following Haymarket further weakened the labor movement. Membership in the KOL dwindled rapidly, from 700,000 in 1886 to only 100,000 by 1890. National leadership of the labor movement after 1886 fell to the new AFL. Comprised exclusively of unions of skilled workers and led by cigar-maker Samuel Gompers, the AFL shunned the KOL’s idealistic goal of industrial cooperation. Instead, it accepted capitalism and the wage system and focused on what it termed “pure and simple” goals: higher wages, shorter hours, and job security. The AFL also refused to organize unskilled workers, arguing that they were too weak and unreliable. They similarly excluded (with a few exceptions) women, African Americans, and recent immigrants. The AFL grew to 1.6 million members by 1904. However, its narrowed vision and conservative approach to the labor question would leave the growing numbers of less-skilled industrial workers without a national voice until the 1930s. These divisions within the labor movement reflected the dramatic and often controversial changes industrialization brought to the United States after 1865. Many Americans prospered in this period, but others found themselves working in dangerous factories for long hours and meager wages. As a result, this period was marked by vigorous debates about economic justice, social equality, and the proper role of government in regulating the economy and protecting the rights and well-being of its most vulnerable citizens. These debates that would continue into the next century.

Becoming a
Modern Society
America in the Gilded Age,
1877–1900
 Hundreds of thousands of people, including President Chester A. Arthur and countless dignitaries, participated in the joyful ceremonies marking the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge on May 23, 1883. As this painting of the event demonstrates, Americans in the late nineteenth century celebrated the onset of the urban age. An astonishing sight and the very embodiment of the modern age, it was the world’s largest suspension bridge, a style made possible by the one product that in many ways defined the industrial revolution—steel. The bridge’s designer, German immigrant John Roebling, emphasized this transition to the modern age by using a stark contrast: he constructed the bridge’s twin towers out of the ancient building material (stone) and formed them into gothic archways, a style reminiscent of the great medieval cathedrals of Europe. The Brooklyn Bridge embodied the new urban and industrial era beyond its cutting-edge technology and symbolic design. Workers who were either immigrants or the children of immigrants constructed the bridge. By connecting the nation’s largest city (New York) and third largest city (Brooklyn), a prelude to their consolidation into one city in 1898, the new bridge also symbolized rapid urban growth. Finally the bridge hinted at the emergence of a new, more independent American woman. When Washington Roebling (who had succeeded his father as chief engineer) fell gravely ill in 1872, his wife, Emily Warren Roebling, spent the next 11 years as the project’s onsite manager. The enthusiasm that marked the bridge’s opening masked the grave problems that rampant urban growth entailed. Indeed, the era’s name, the Gilded Age, reflected this notion that the amazing achievements of the period were like a thin gold layer that covered many unresolved social problems. The sections of New York and Brooklyn connected by the bridge, for example, were vast working-class immigrant districts beset by high rates of poverty, crime, and disease. Equally unseen in the glow of the fireworks was the rising discontent among American workers over exploitation by employers and alienation from an unresponsive political system. Indeed, dozens of men had died during the bridge’s construction, and more than once the workers went on strike. These sentiments and those of hard-pressed American farmers in the heartland would explode in the 1890s, leading to the emergence of the People’s Party. The party eventually faded away, but not before establishing a reform agenda that would shape the Progressive Era (1900–1920).

 “The day seems brought distinctly nearer when the nation, equipped with the latest implements furnished by science, shall master and use as never before its rich domain.” REV. RICHARD STORRS, speech at the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge





 CHAPTER 17

BECOMING A MODERN SOCIETY: AMERICA IN THE GILDED AGE, 1877–1900

The Rise of the City
 The United States experienced explosive urban growth in the second half of the nineteenth century. Industrialization and mass immigration transformed older cities, such as New York and Philadelphia, and newer ones, such as Denver and Chicago, into major metropolises. Their growth was often chaotic and attended by significant increases in crime, poverty, and epidemics. City political machines grew powerful, providing relief to the vulnerable and promoting urban growth, but earning a reputation for corruption.

To the Cities
 The urban population of the United States grew at an astonishing rate between 1860 and 1900. In 1860, one in five Americans lived in urban areas—by 1900, two in five. In that same period the number of cities with populations greater than 100,000 soared from 9 to 38. Among these were New York (3.4 million), Chicago (2.7 million), and Philadelphia (1.3 million). Seventy-eight other cities had 50,000 or more inhabitants by 1900. Much of this new urban population came from rural areas within the United States. As agriculture became more mechanized (see Chapter 15), thereby lowering demand for farm labor, men migrated to urban areas. Similarly, the rise of American manufacturing eliminated the need for rural women to make clothes and other household goods, leading many to seek economic opportunity in cities. These men and women found an array of job opportunities in the city, from low-paid work as factory operatives, laborers, and servants to more desirable positions as skilled artisans and clerks. They also were faced with the challenge of adjusting to an utterly new lifestyle.

 Another rural-to-urban internal migration involved African Americans seeking to escape the poverty, racism, and violence of the Jim Crow South (see Chapter 14). Drawn by word of better jobs and greater freedoms, some 300,000 migrated to northern cities between 1890 and 1910. Chicago’s African American population jumped from 15,000 in 1890 to 110,000 in 1920. This marked the beginning of what became known as the Great Migration, the relocation of some 7 million African Americans from the South to the North between 1890 and 1970. However, the greatest source of urban population growth was mass immigration from Europe, with significant numbers also from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia. Before 1880, most immigrants to the United States came from Britain, Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia. Thereafter, the sources of immigration shifted to nations in Southern and Eastern Europe such as Russia, Italy, Greece, and AustriaHungary (17.1). All told, the United States accepted 28 million newcomers between 1860 and 1920. As with all immigrants before and since, some of these newcomers chose immigration to escape poverty, warfare, political and religious

 persecution, and natural disasters. But most were drawn by the promise of economic opportunity and upward mobility in America. Some migrated to rural areas and became farmers, but most headed for America’s cities with their ever-expanding number of jobs in industry, construction, service, and entrepreneurship. Cities already characterized by ethnic, racial, and religious diversity brought by earlier immigrants and African Americans saw their diversity reach unprecedented levels. By 1910, immigrants and their American-born children comprised an astonishing 78.6 percent of New York’s 4.8 million residents. Chicago (77.5 percent), Milwaukee (78.6 percent), San Francisco (68.3 percent), and most medium-tolarge cities boasted similarly astoundingly numbers. Overall, the foreign-born comprised 14.8 percent of the national population in 1910.

Emergence of
Ethnic Enclaves
 These new immigrants, like the Irish and Germans before them, soon formed concentrated ethnic enclaves. Often they moved into neighborhoods previously dominated by immigrants who had arrived before the Civil War. As a result in New York, for example, the Lower East Side enclaves of Little Ireland, Little Germany, and Little Africa became by the 1890s Little Italy, Chinatown, and the Jewish East Side. This process of ethnic succession is captured in a World War I memorial plaque affixed to the façade of the Church of the Transfiguration on New York’s Lower East Side (17.2). A community of native-born Americans built the church in 1801 as the English Lutheran First Church of Zion, but they sold it in the 1840s to Irish Catholics who renamed it Church of the Transfiguration. In the 1890s, a massive influx of Italians and outflow of Irish to other parts of the city turned the neighborhood into Little Italy and Transfiguration into a mostly Italian Catholic church. (Mother Elizabeth Cabrini, later canonized a saint, worked in the church caring for Italian immigrants.) The plaque provides a snapshot of the transformation from Little Ireland to Little Italy. Of the twenty names of parishioners who died in World War I,



 seventeen are Italian and only three—Donahue, Durkin, and Kane—are Irish. Today the neighborhood is part of Chinatown and most of the parishioners are Chinese. Immigrant groups formed ethnic enclaves in part because they faced hostility and discrimination from Americans and other immigrant groups. But the primary cause was their recognition that grouping together enhanced their chances of success in America. Italian immigrants in Chicago’s Little Italy, for example, enjoyed the comfort and practical benefits of residing among people who spoke their language. There they could find help getting a job from an immigrant aid association, fellowship in an Italian fraternal society, or solace in an Italian Catholic church. They also found things that reminded them of home: Italian food, books, newspapers, churches, theaters, and opera houses. A closer look at these enclaves revealed that they usually comprised smaller units composed of people from a particular region or village of their home country. New York’s Jewish East Side, for example, included large concentrations of Jews from Hungary, Romania, Galicia, Russia, and the eastern Mediterranean. Italians in Boston’s North End clustered on certain streets depending on whether they came from Sicily, Campania, the

 Abruzzi, or Liguria. Yet as this 1895 map (17.3) of the neighborhood surrounding Chicago’s famous Hull House, which provided that city’s immigrants with social and educational services, demonstrates, even immigrants in ethnic enclaves shared their neighborhoods with people of diverse origins. This twelve-block section of the city included immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Italy, Russia, Poland, Switzerland, France, Canada, Bohemia, Scandinavia, China, and the Netherlands, not to mention African Americans.

The Troubled City
 Many Americans in the late nineteenth century saw cities as exciting places filled with opportunity, cultural diversity, entertainment, and new technology such as electric lighting and skyscrapers. Yet many more viewed cities as places of crowding,

 turmoil, filth, and despair. Both images were accurate, but the latter generated the most commentary and concern. One of the most striking features of modern urban life was the emergence of densely packed “slums.” In one ward on New York’s Lower East Side in 1890, population density reached 334,000 people per square mile, numbers never seen before in history. Most people living in these densely packed districts were immigrants who worked for low wages as day laborers and factory operatives. Few men earned enough money to support their families. So they relied on their wives and children to produce additional income (see Chapter 16). Squalid housing exacerbated the poverty of urban workers. Tenements, or multiple family dwellings of four to six stories housing dozens of families, became the most common form of housing for poor city dwellers by the 1860s. Most tenement

THE RISE OF THE CITY

 apartments consisted of just two or three dimly lit and poorly ventilated rooms. Tenement districts in every city suffered from high rates of disease and death, much of it caused when drinking water became contaminated by bacteria due to primitive sewage systems. Another source of disease was horses. In 1900, New York’s 120,000 horses dropped six million pounds of manure on the streets every day. In most cities, as shown in this photograph (17.4), street cleaning was inadequate in working-class neighborhoods. Note that in this filthy working-class street in New York, vendors sell all manner of goods on the sidewalks, including food. These conditions contributed to frequent epidemics. In Chicago in 1891, for example, 2,000 people died from typhoid fever and 4,300 from bronchitis and pneumonia. Every year in Chicago in the early 1890s, 10,000 to 12,000 children under the age of five died. Despite the dreadful condition of many tenements, the surging population of American cities kept the demand for housing high, causing rents to rise continually. In New York an 1883 survey of bricklayers, among the city’s best-paid workers, determined that they paid 28 percent of their annual income to their landlords. Another survey a few years later revealed that cloak makers, another skilled group, devoted 38 percent of their income to



 rent. As a result evictions for falling behind in rent were common. New York averaged more than 16,000 evictions per year in the early 1880s and more than 23,000 by 1892.

 “Thousands of small houses and cottages arranged for one family are now packed with a family in each room.” Chicago Board of Health report Late-nineteenth-century cities also suffered from high rates of crime, especially in the tenement districts. Some crime was driven by poverty or despair. Women, for example, usually turned to prostitution as a last resort to survive. Immigration also increased crime, because it resulted in a disproportionately high population of young single men (typically an age cohort with higher than average crime rates). The overall growth, diversity, and mobility of urban populations also contributed to increased crime because these populations fostered anonymity and undermined the ability of communities to prevent potential criminal activity.

The Political Machine—
“Boss Rule”
 Another unsettling feature of urban life, in addition to poverty, crime, and disorder, was the emergence of political machines. Most often associated with the Democratic Party, these organizations became powerful in nearly every large American city by mobilizing large blocs of working-class and immigrant voters while developing favorable relationships with real estate and business interests. Some machines controlled small sections of big cities. Martin Lomasney, for example, was the “boss” of Boston’s Eighth Ward. Others, such as New York’s Tammany Hall, ruled the entire metropolis by the 1860s. By the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, several machines extended their power to the state level.

17.5 Winning By
Any Means
 Political machines often resorted to voter intimidation and election fraud. As the motto “In Counting There Is Strength” suggests, vote counts were manipulated to ensure victory.

 Several trends coincided to account for the rise of political machines in American cities. The spread of universal white male suffrage in the 1820s (see Chapter 8) meant that political success depended less on a candidate’s family name or wealth than on his ability to whip up enthusiasm and get out the vote on Election Day. Rapid urban growth also produced unprecedented opportunities for politicians and their machines to reward supporters with construction contracts and jobs such as police officers and building inspectors. Machines also garnered support from immigrants by denouncing nativism and stymieing anti-immigrant legislation such as proposals to deny public jobs to the foreign born. Finally, the growing numbers of the poor provided a needy constituency, for which the machines supplied not only jobs but also a range of services and favors, including cash handouts, payments for funerals, legal assistance, and seasonal giveaways of turkeys at Thanksgiving and bags of coal in winter. Recipients of machine

 largesse and charity were expected to vote for its candidates. The emergence of political machines horrified many wealthy and native-born Americans. They found rule by the foreign-born threatening and the rough and corrupt style of bosses offensive. One aspect of machine politics, however, aroused especially bitter criticism: the policy of no-questions-asked charity. Political machines acquired and retained power not only by providing services to their constituents but also, as suggested by this political cartoon of boss William Tweed, the notoriously corrupt head of Tammany Hall, by intimidating voters and engaging in election fraud (17.5). This image shows that the ballot “box” in many cities was actually a transparent glass ball that allowed the political machines’ “shoulder hitters” to intimidate voters by letting them know they were watching to see how they voted. The motto “In Counting There Is Strength” refers to the machines’ tactic of using the police and boards of elections to manipulate the vote count to ensure victory for their party. Equally important was the money machines garnered by selling patronage jobs, demanding kickbacks from city contractors, and collecting protection fees from a vast economy of vice the machine-controlled police allowed to flourish. Reformers railed against the machine, but consistently failed to defeat it.

A SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS



A
Search for Solutions  The dark side of urbanization in the late nineteenth century prompted a wide range of competing views and responses. Some Americans concluded that the real problem of urban poverty and the troubling crime, disease, disorder, and corruption that accompanied it was the urban poor, in particular, the foreign-born. Their solution was heightened nativism and a demand to restrict immigration. Other Americans, however, worked to develop government agencies to address the emerging challenges of urban life. Still others established private institutions like settlement houses that reflected a new attitude toward the immigrant poor.

The Nativist Impulse
 The rise of the modern American city was accompanied by a revival of nativism, or antiimmigrant views and sentiments. Suspicion of and hatred for the foreign-born had flared up during the Know-Nothing movement (see Chapter 12) in the 1850s, which targeted Irish and German immigrants, especially those who were Catholics. In the Gilded Age nativism targeted the so-called new immigrants, or those coming from Southern and Eastern Europe. As this 1899 image (17.6) illustrates, nativists decried newcomers as bearers of a wide range of unwanted habits and ideas. The immigrant, shown here in a racist caricature of Eastern Europeans, carries according to his labels poverty, anarchy, superstition, intemperance, and Sabbath desecration (working or recreating on a Sunday). Note Uncle Sam’s disdainful reaction and the sarcastic inscriptions on the gateway— “admittance free,” “walk in!” and “welcome”—meant to convey nativists’ anger over what they considered lax immigration laws. As slums grew larger and strikes (often involving many foreign-born workers) became more violent, nativists called all the more loudly for the sharp restriction of immigration. One of the most prominent was Josiah Strong, a Midwestern minister whose 1885 book, Our Country:

 Exclusion Act (see Chapter 16), which barred Chinese immigration to the United States. In 1887, nativists who were especially fixated on the dangers posed by Catholic immigration formed the American Protective Association (APA) to lobby for immigration restriction. The organization grew to 500,000 members by the end of 1893. Its main base of strength was middle-class Protestants in the Midwest, but chapters also sprang up in most cities in the East.

 The city has become a serious menace to our civilization…. It has a peculiar attraction for the immigrant….Here is heaped the social dynamite; here roughs, gamblers, thieves, robbers, lawless and desperate men of all sorts, congregate; men who are ready on any pretext to raise riots for the purpose of destruction and plunder. JOSIAH STRONG, Our Country: Its Possible Future and Its Present Crisis (1885) In 1890, Congress made oversight of immigration a federal responsibility and established immigration depots in most major ports to weed out and reject immigrants with incurable diseases, radical beliefs, criminal backgrounds, or so little money and skills they seemed likely to swell the ranks of the urban poor. The largest and most famous of these facilities, Ellis Island in New York harbor, opened in 1892. Many nativists considered this new system too lenient and called for additional restrictions on immigration. In 1894, several Harvard graduates founded the Immigration Restriction League to lobby for a literacy test for all would-be immigrants (requiring they demonstrate the ability to read and write in any language). Presidents Cleveland, Taft, and Wilson vetoed immigrant literacy test bills, but Congress overrode Wilson’s veto, and it became law in 1917. How did urban reformers try to improve the safety and livability of cities?

A
Different View: Urban Reforms
 While some Americans believed urban poverty, crime, disease, and overcrowding could be eliminated simply by restricting immigration, others developed a range of innovative policies and institutions to solve, or at least minimize, these problems. To meet the problem of rising crime, most cities followed the lead of New York, when in 1845 it replaced the traditional night watch of a few untrained and unarmed men with a paid professional police department. Large cities also disbanded their volunteer fire companies and invested in new fire-fighting technology, such as steam pumpers, and adopted tougher building codes. More dangerous to a city than fire—at least to its inhabitants—were the frequent outbreaks of cholera, diphtheria, typhoid fever, and other maladies. Drawing on increasing knowledge about germ theory, cities established boards of health and took steps to improve water quality, waste removal, and street cleaning. The latter half of the nineteenth century also witnessed a movement to build urban parks to provide the beauty and serenity of nature and offer wholesome and healthy recreation space (as opposed to alleys and saloons) for all. New York’s Central Park, built in the 1850s and 1860s, proved so successful that nearly every large city commenced its own park projects. Because most of the grand parks were located far from the slums, however, reformers in the 1890s pushed urban governments to condemn blocks of tenements and build parks within working-class neighborhoods. Urban reformers also expanded public education. Compulsory education laws (usually requiring schooling until age 14) and a massive building campaign saw public school enrollments surge from 6.9 million to 17.8 million between 1870 and 1910. Millions more students attended parochial schools established by the Catholic Church. This effort reflected the traditional belief that education made for a productive and informed citizenry. But as the photograph (17.7) of children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance illustrates, advocates also saw expanded urban public schooling as a means of Americanizing the immigrant masses, teaching them English and respect for democracy and the law. The pledge was first published in a youth magazine in 1892 to promote patriotism and civic pride among school children on the eve of the 400th anniversary of Read the Document Proposal to Buffalo, New York, Park Commission (1888)

 Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the New World. Educators quickly made its recitation a daily ritual in schools across the country. This earlier style, which required people to end the pledge by extending their arms out straight, was abolished in the 1930s because of its similarity to salutes used in fascist Germany and Italy.

Capturing a New
View of Poverty
 Reformers in the Gilded Age also developed a new way of thinking about poverty and its causes. Most Americans held to the traditional view that poverty was caused by personal or moral failures such as laziness or drunkenness. The poor, as Read the Document Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives

 Horatio Alger and others argued so persuasively in popular literature (see Chapter 16), needed only to abandon their dissolute ways and seize the opportunities for success that abounded in American life. But reformers began to challenge this view of poverty by arguing that factors beyond their control made people poor. A key figure in this new outlook was photojournalist Jacob A. Riis, who emigrated from Denmark to New York in 1870. After spending his first years in America in poverty, he gained a foothold in journalism. By the mid-1880s, he had earned a reputation as a reporter covering the city’s crime beat. But Riis was troubled by the poverty and suffering he saw and decided to publicize it to gain public support for reforms. In 1887, he started taking photographs of

 slum life to spark public awareness, and by 1888–1889, he began showing his photographs while giving lectures before reform societies and church groups. Spurred by the positive reaction to these talks, especially to the photographs (see Images as History: Seeing the Poor, page 509), he wrote the book How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York, which he published in 1890. Books providing shocking accounts of prostitution, drunkenness, and violence in America’s slums had appeared as early as the 1840s, but Riis’s book was different and it caused a sensation.

 Living among the Poor: Settlement Houses Riis was not alone in promoting a more progressive and sympathetic view of poverty and remedies to it. In the early 1880s, middle-class and collegeeducated women began establishing in immigrant neighborhoods settlement houses, or institutions dedicated to helping the urban poor by providing a wide range of social and educational services. Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr founded the most famous and influential settlement house, Hull House, in Chicago in 1889. Born to wealthy Illinois families, they had met in college and toured Europe together in 1888, where they were inspired by a visit to Toynbee Hall, a settlement house in London’s poor East End. There they saw educated, wealthy young men enter the East End to assist the poor. They vowed to establish a similar institution in Chicago. With financial backing from wealthy reformers, Addams and Starr rented an old mansion on Chicago’s Near West Side. The neighborhood was overwhelmingly foreign born (see 17.3) and its residents lived in dreary, run-down tenements. It also suffered from poor sanitation and high rates of crime. Unlike socially conscious elite women of earlier generations who simply raised money for the poor or lobbied the state legislature for laws against child labor, Addams, Starr, and the many women workers they attracted to Hull House chose to live among the poor to get to know them and understand their needs— even learn from them. The staff at Hull House first offered educational classes in literature and art. When these proved popular, they began to teach more practical subjects, such as cooking, sewing, hygiene, civics, the English

 language, and vocational training. They also opened their doors to fledgling labor unions, recognizing the vital role unions could play in raising the earnings of workers, especially the foreign born. Within a decade Hull House was a flourishing institution offering an array of services to the poor of Chicago. Addams and other Hull House workers like Florence Kelley also became activists to prod city authorities to improve tenement laws, increase street cleaning and garbage removal, and expand public education. They also lobbied state officials for laws against child labor and for improved factory safety. Hull House was not the first settlement in America, but it soon became its most famous, inspiring hundreds of successful imitators (400 by 1910), including Denison House in Boston (1889) and Henry Street Settlement in New York (1893).

The White City
 The optimistic vision of modern urban life articulated by reformers like Jane Addams and Jacob Riis found vivid expression in the City Beautiful Movement. Taking form in the late 1880s, it brought together architects, landscape architects, and urban planners who believed the many problems afflicting American cities could be ameliorated, even eliminated, through the comprehensive planning and grand redesign of urban spaces. City Beautiful proponents like Daniel Burnham and Frederick Law Olmsted argued for the creation of large parks and public squares linked by grand boulevards. They also emphasized classical architectural styles for both public and private buildings. Burnham, Olmsted, and others first demonstrated these ideas at the 1893 Chicago World’s Exposition, a grand celebration of the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the New World in 1492 and of Chicago’s recovery from its devastating fire in 1871. Like the many world’s fairs that preceded it, the Chicago Exposition celebrated technology, culture, and commerce. It contained thousands of exhibits on science, machinery, art, history, ethnic heritage, music, and theater. But its greatest significance was its impact on architecture, design, and urban planning. Given nearly 700 acres of waterfront property along Lake Michigan on which to erect buildings, Burnham and the extraordinary team he assembled, including landscape architect

Images as History
SEEING THE POOR
In 1890, Jacob Riis published a shocking exposé, How the Other Half Lives, of the dreadful conditions in which the poor lived. But unlike most Americans writing about urban poverty in that era, who attributed these problems to the moral failures of the poor, Riis argued that the poor were victims of unhealthy and unregulated tenements for which they were forced to pay most of their earnings. Adding to the book’s impact were his photographs and drawings made from photographs. His carefully composed photograph, “An Italian Rag-Picker in Jersey Street,” shows the woman’s desperate situation. 
 Riis convinced many of his readers that the growing numbers of impoverished slum dwellers were trapped in circumstances beyond their control largely due to unhealthy and expensive tenement housing. He called for improved tenements that would free the poor from their debilitating circumstances and allow them the chance to succeed. As a result of How the Other Half Lives and other books, not to mention magazine articles and speeches, many cities passed tougher laws regulating room size, windows, running water, and toilets.

 The ladder suggests her “apartment” is little more than a dingy, windowless basement room with only one piece of furniture (the chair on which she sits). Riis presents her not as filthy or drunk; despite the dreadful circumstances, she and her baby wear clean clothes. Riis often included babies and innocentlooking children in his photographs to prompt the viewer to wonder— and worry—about their fate if the plight of the poor was not alleviated.

17.8 The
White City
 Designed by some of the nation’s leading architects, Chicago’s White City consisted of 14 main buildings designed in the BeauxArts style, set in landscaped grounds featuring waterways and reflecting pools.

BECOMING A MODERN SOCIETY: AMERICA IN THE GILDED AGE, 1877–1900

 Frederick Law Olmsted and architect Louis Sullivan, developed a master plan that called for landscaped grounds featuring waterways and reflecting pools. Around the waterways, (17.8), Burnham placed 14 main buildings designed in the Beaux-Arts style, which emphasized logic, harmony, and uniformity. The Court of Honor buildings, shown in the image, lined the Grand Basin that formed the centerpiece of the exposition grounds. Covered in shimmering bright white stucco, the buildings of the White City astonished the estimated 27 million visitors who entered through the main gates.

 Yet as this image indicates, Burnham and his team sought not simply to wow the public with grand architecture. They wanted to showcase the potential glory of the modern city. All cities could be—should be—as impressive as the White City. All that was needed were civic leadership and enlightened urban planning. This grand vision never fully caught on, but many of the City Beautiful ideals and concepts exhibited in the White City influenced a generation of urban planners and architects committed to making American cities more beautiful, healthy, and efficient.

 How did the White City reflect an optimistic vision of urban life in the future?

NEW HABITS, ROLES, AND LIFESTYLES



New Habits, Roles, and Lifestyles
 The development of vast working-class districts was but one aspect of a broad trend that reshaped urban life in the late nineteenth century. Urban and suburban growth also led to the development of middle-class and elite residential neighborhoods and urban central business districts dedicated almost exclusively to commerce. Middle-class neighborhoods increasingly reflected the new values of the urban middle class, including a growing interest in leisure activities. The growth of leisure time allowed women to take on significant roles in public life through memberships in socially and politically active clubs.

The New Urban Landscape
 The evolution of mass transit systems like horse cars, steam railroads, and trolleys, led to explosive urban growth and specialized districts dedicated to specific functions. Most cities, for example, developed central business districts where almost no one lived. Instead the high-value real estate in downtowns from Baltimore to Chicago to San Francisco was dedicated to commerce: banks, department stores (see Chapter 16), and the offices of corporations, accountants, lawyers, and other professionals. Each day mass transit systems carried thousands of shoppers and workers to central business districts from sections of cities now dedicated almost exclusively to residential use, or from residential neighborhoods just beyond the city limits. Soaring real estate values and new technology led to another distinct feature in central business districts: skyscrapers. Before the Civil War few buildings exceeded six stories, but the invention of the elevator and new building materials like cast iron and steel led to ten- and twelve-story buildings by the early 1880s. The big breakthrough came in 1885 with the completion of the Home Insurance Building in Chicago. It was remarkable not for its height (ten stories), but for its internal steel skeleton that allowed for thin walls and large windows. This first true skyscraper led to a boom in tall building construction in downtowns across the country. By 1900, Lower Manhattan alone featured 12 buildings of 300 feet or more in height. Equally significant, although less dramatic, than the upward reach of city skylines was the outward sprawl of urban areas due to mass transit.

 families that could afford to buy a house and pay the cost of commuting to the city for work. Middle-class families found suburbs attractive for their serenity, cleanliness, and greenery—aspects that stood in sharp contrast to the crime, disease, violence, and noise of the inner city. Given the prevalence of racist and nativist attitudes in Gilded Age American society, suburbs also attracted people unwilling to live with immigrants and African Americans.

 dishonesty, immorality, and violence that threatened virtuous womanhood. Yet two trends in the late nineteenth century led directly to new, more public roles for middleclass women. The first was a rise in education, especially at the college level. By 1900, women constituted nearly 20 percent of college graduates, up from just 13 percent in 1890. Education allowed women, if only temporarily, to leave the domestic sphere to interact with other young women and encounter emerging ideas about women’s rights.

 men into public activism for reform, especially civil rights. By the 1890s, Americans had begun to use the term “New Woman” to describe middle-class women who pursued higher education, engaged in political activism, delayed marriage, and bore fewer children. The New Woman had a distinct look, donning the clothing, hair style, and air of the so-called Gibson Girl. A creation of illustrator Charles Dana Gibson in 1890s popular magazines, the Gibson Girl was tall and beautiful, with a tightly cinched waist that accentuated her bosom and with hair piled high on her head. Offsetting these traditionally feminine characteristics, however, was an outgoing, even mischievous spirit that reflected the greater independence and activism of younger American women. Symbolic of this attitude was the degree to which young women took part in the great national enthusiasm for bicycling in the 1890s. Note the striking contrast between these two images.

 The first from 1886 (17.10) shows a traditional Victorian-era wife in formal attire being carried as a passenger by her husband. The second image, an 1896 advertisement poster for the Stearns Bicycle Company (17.11), shows a self-confident and carefree woman in the Gibson Girl style breezing along on her own bicycle. Many conservative Americans condemned the bicycling craze as unnatural and immoral because it allowed young women and men the freedom to pedal off unchaperoned, away from the watchful eyes of parents and other guardians of respectability.

 “Bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance.” SUSAN B. ANTHONY, 1896 17.12 Selling Celebrity The booming tobacco industry created the original baseball cards to capitalize on the value of sports celebrity endorsements for their products.

New Forms of Leisure
 and Popular Culture As industrial life created sharp distinctions between time spent at work and time doing everything else, Americans in the Gilded Age developed the concept of leisure time. This trend

 was at the heart of the labor movement’s persistent demand for the eight-hour day as both a call for shorter hours of toil and an insistence on the right to leisure time. Many city dwellers spent their leisure time in informal activities in their neighborhood, such as walking about, playing games in streets and local parks, and socializing with their neighbors. For many working-class men, the local saloon was the preferred place of leisure. Increasingly popular, however, were more formal leisure opportunities such as amusement parks and organized spectator sports. Amateur, semiprofessional, and professional baseball teams, for example, drew large crowds. Entrepreneurs soon saw baseball as a business, despite its reputation as the “national pastime.” They built large baseball stadiums near streetcar lines and sold patrons not merely tickets but also food, beer, trinkets, and scorecards. By the 1880s, baseball stars like Mike “King” Kelly and Adrian “Cap” Anson were high-paid celebrities. Corporations, especially the booming tobacco industry, quickly realized the value of celebrity endorsements for their products and in the 1880s created the original baseball cards like the one shown here ( 17.12 ). To legitimize tobacco use, companies such as Old Judge portrayed players like Kelly as ideal men—the perfect blend of athletic masculinity and refined, almost gentlemen-like bearing. In an era when the press rarely reported on the bad behavior of athletes or politicians, few Americans could have known that the real Mike Kelly was a violent alcoholic who would drink himself to death in 1894 at age 37. Other spectator sports also enjoyed great popularity in the late nineteenth century. Professional boxing, horseracing, track and field competitions, and bicycle races drew large crowds to venues such as Madison Square Garden in New York City, the Chicago Coliseum, and the Boston Arena. By the 1890s, college football games in Boston, New York,

 Philadelphia, and Chicago often drew more than 50,000 fans. Baseball, football, and other urban spectator sports proved consistent money-makers for promoters, but they also attracted criticism from ministers and public officials who decried the violence, alcohol consumption, and gambling associated with them and the trend to play them on Sundays. Competing for the attention of the American with increased leisure time on his or her hands was a burgeoning theatrical entertainment industry. By the late nineteenth century, the typical city resident could choose from a vast array of entertainment forms on stage. In ethnic neighborhoods, for example, Old World productions like Italian melodramas based loosely on operas and Yiddish comedies drawn from Eastern European traditions flourished. Elsewhere in the city in more mainstream venues, people flocked to musical comedies, a distinctly American innovation pioneered by the duo of Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart. They were succeeded by others such as George M. Cohan and Irving Berlin, whose popular songs like “Give My Regards to Broadway” and “Alexander’s Ragtime Band” became enduring hits. Also popular was vaudeville, a kind of variety show featuring a series of acts by entertainers from jugglers, musicians, acrobats, and family routines, to singers, wild animal acts, ribald comedians, and scantily clad women. With its low admission fees and democratic approach, vaudeville was geared for the masses. At its peak circa 1900, vaudeville shows drew two million patrons a day. Many of the great American stage and film performers from the early twentieth century, such as James Cagney, Mae West, and Al Jolson, began their careers in vaudeville. Wealthier and better-educated city residents rejected vaudeville and the more raucous forms of musical comedy as undignified and coarse. Instead they went to opera houses to hear European music and to what they considered legitimate theater to see productions of Shakespeare and the classics. While these varied forms of entertainment were developed and popularized in large cities, they quickly spread via published sheet music and touring companies to communities across the nation. The result was the beginning of a national popular culture, one that would flourish more fully with the arrival of movies, radio, and television in the twentieth century.



Lifestyles of the Rich
 and Famous Another feature of urban life that became a defining feature of the Gilded Age (so much so that it gave the era its name) was lavish displays of wealth. Dubbed “conspicuous consumption” by sociologist Thorstein Veblen in 1899, this trend featured the construction of opulent mansions in elite urban districts such as New York’s Fifth Avenue, Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive, and San Francisco’s Nob Hill, as well as in exclusive summer retreats like Newport, Rhode Island. Wealthy families like the Vanderbilts and Astors competed to see who could throw the most extravagant balls, weddings, and parties.

 “There is many a palace in Europe that would hide its diminished roof beside the sheer luxury of Fifth Avenue homes.” EDGAR SALTUS One of the most famous was a ball hosted on March 26, 1883 by Alva Vanderbilt, wife of tycoon William K. Vanderbilt, to celebrate the opening of their new $3 million mansion on upper Fifth Avenue. The elite of New York arrived in costume (17.13). Many dressed as Marie Antoinette, Queen Elizabeth, and Louis XV. This choice of an ostentatious royal theme reflected the belief by the nation’s wealthy elite that they constituted an American aristocracy—a notion that ran counter to the longstanding American fear and loathing for such undemocratic pretensions (see Chapters 4 and 5). Labor activists and social critics castigated the ball and high society’s rejection of republican simplicity, but Mrs. Vanderbilt’s guests paid no heed. They reveled past dawn in a party that cost $250,000—in an age when an average worker could expect to earn less than $700 per year. By the mid-1880s, most newspapers featured “society” columns that devoted extensive coverage to the lives of the wealthy. While Americans followed the exploits of the rich with a certain wonder, the public would accept only so much extravagance before expressing

 revulsion. That finally occurred in February 1897, when the Bradley Martin family hosted a $400,000 party in which 800 guests arrived in costumes depicting European royalty. One society reporter described “a gorgeous, superb, and wonderful spectacle.” But in 1897, when the nation was suffering from a severe depression, public criticism of the ball erupted, including indignation from public officials, clergymen, and workers,. The Bradley Martins fled to Europe and settled permanently in England, ending the days of diamondnecklace party favors.

THE CHALLENGE FROM BELOW



 The Challenge from Below The revulsion expressed over the Bradley Martin Ball in 1897 reflected rising discontent. Many farmers and industrial workers felt exploited by powerful corporations. When they turned to elected officials to address these problems, they found them unresponsive. Most politicians remained committed to a laissez-faire philosophy, which argued against government intervention in the economy. As a result the period was marked by some of the most bitter and violent strikes in American history and by the rise of a third party comprised mainly of farmers, workers, and reformers—the People’s Party—to challenge the Republicans and Democrats.

Out of Touch Politics
 Popular enthusiasm for politics reached extraordinary heights in the Gilded Age. Indeed, American voters turned out in astonishing numbers, averaging 79 percent between 1876 and 1896 (as compared with between 50 and 60 percent in recent decades). Despite such intense interest, politicians made little progress in resolving the major issues that dominated national politics in this period. This political stalemate

 stemmed from several factors. First, as indicated in (17.14), the electorate was evenly divided between the two major parties, resulting in remarkably close presidential elections. For example, the five presidential elections between 1876 and 1892 were decided by tiny margins of 1 to 3 percent. Indeed, in 1876 and 1888, the candidate with the highest popular vote total lost because his opponent tallied more electoral votes. No incumbent president won reelection, and only twice (Republicans, 1889–1891 and Democrats, 1893–1895)

 did one party control both houses of Congress and the presidency. Political inaction in the Gilded Age also reflected the conservatism of most politicians who clung to longstanding political traditions that celebrated small, nonintrusive government, especially at the federal level. For many leaders government regulation of business appeared socialistic and harmful to both the economy and republican principles. Political paralysis stemmed from the power of corporate interests to use huge donations to political parties and bribery of lawmakers to stymie legislation they deemed harmful to their interests. For example, big business interests blocked efforts to lower the tariff because a high tariff protected their manufactures from foreign competition. The record for 1890, the year Congress took up the big issues of tariff, currency reform, and corporate regulation, provides a particularly vivid example of this ineffective political system. Support for corporate regulation reflected rising concern from many

 corners of American society. Industrial workers saw themselves as victims of corporate power that demanded long hours of dangerous toil for low wages. Many other Americans, as suggested by this 1889 Thomas Nast cartoon, The Rising of the Usurpers and the Sinking of the Liberties of the People (17.15), viewed trusts as a threat to democracy and equality. By monopolizing the necessities of life, trusts literally threatened to smother American liberty. The Sherman AntiTrust Act of 1890 promised to empower the federal government to crack down on business practices that diminished competition (see Chapter 16), but opposition from pro-business legislators weakened the law to such a point that it did little to slow the growth of big business. Indeed, the 1890s saw record numbers of mergers, and big business used the Sherman Act to weaken labor unions by arguing that strikes amounted to restraint of trade. In 1890, Congress also took up the contentious issue of currency reform to determine what constituted the proper basis for American currency. Advocates of “hard money,” which included most Republicans, businessmen, and the wealthy, argued for basing currency solely on the amount of gold in the U.S. Treasury. They opposed issuing paper money, popularly known as “greenbacks,” or minting more silver coinage, arguing that it contributed to inflation and lowered interest rates. “Soft money” proponents like farmers, workers, and Democrats, however, argued that the supply of gold, and thus of a currency based exclusively on it, was insufficient to meet the needs of an expanding commercial economy. They advocated the issuance of greenbacks and expanded coinage of silver, which was more plentiful than gold. More money in circulation would lead to inflation, but debtors, especially farmers, welcomed inflation because it promised to raise the prices of their goods and diminish the burden of their debts. In 1890, they supported the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the Treasury to purchase 4.5 million ounces of silver every month and issue notes (paper money) redeemable in either silver or gold. Republicans opposed the bill but wanted a higher tariff. Democrats opposed a higher tariff, arguing that it amounted to a huge subsidy paid by American consumers to business. Both sides therefore compromised, and both the silver act and a higher tariff became law. Neither bill, however, had the desired effect. The higher tariff caused consumer prices to

 surge, producing widespread discontent. The silver program caused the price of silver to fall, so most of the people holding the notes redeemed them for gold, which depleted the nation’s gold reserves and contributed to the Panic of 1893 and four years of severe depression. The one notable exception to the politics of stalemate was a civil service law to open certain government jobs only to those who demonstrated their competency on a civil service exam rather than those who merely possessed strong political connections. Neither party favored the law, since it threatened to undermine their ability to reward friends and campaign contributors. It took the assassination of President James A. Garfield in 1881 by a frustrated and apparently deranged office seeker to pass the Pendleton Act in 1883, which placed ten percent of federal jobs under civil service.

 The People’s Party Anger against the political system’s corruption and failure to act on critical issues like corporate regulation and currency and tariff reform gradually produced a popular reaction. In the late 1870s, farmers’ alliances, successors to the Granger movement (see Chapter 15), formed to alleviate the plight of farmers beset by rising costs and falling prices for their products. The Southern Farmers’ Alliance (1877) and Northern Farmers’ Alliance (1880) grew in the 1880s to a combined membership of more than five million. Excluded by the segregationist doctrines of the post-Reconstruction South, black farmers formed the Colored Farmers’ Alliance in 1886 and soon had more than 1.25 million members. The alliances argued that the economic woes of the American farmer were due to exploitive bankers who charged farmers exorbitant interest rates for farm mortgages, to railroads that charged them extortionate rates to transport farm produce to market, and to commodity brokers on Wall Street, who bought their crops at rock bottom prices and then resold them at many times the original price paid. To combat this injustice, the alliances promoted the establishment of cooperatives that combined the buying and selling power of farmers to gain them better prices for their produce and lower rates for loans and crop insurance. They also promoted education on agricultural topics. In 1889, the Northern Farmers’ Alliance and Southern Farmers’ Alliance united to form the

 National Alliance. One year later, convinced that the only way to combat the power of the monopolies and trusts was to transform the National Alliance into a political movement to elect pro-farmer candidates to office, delegates gathered in Ocala, Florida, and drew up a manifesto listing their grievances and proposed reforms. That fall National Alliance-backed candidates won complete or partial control of 12 state legislatures and elected 6 governors. They also sent 50 representatives and 3 senators to Congress. Because most of these men were Democrats, Republicans lost control of the House. These victories convinced many National Alliance activists like Ignatius Donnelly of Minnesota and Tom Watson of Georgia that they needed to form a third party and run a slate of candidates in the 1892 presidential contest. A National Alliance convention in St. Louis in early 1892 led to the formal creation of the People’s Party (its followers would be known as “Populists”) and the adoption of a platform that emphasized the plight of the American farmer and worker at the hands of greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians (see Competing Visions: Progress or Peril?). By now the People’s Party movement had begun to alarm the leaders of the mainstream political parties. Worried about the party’s potential to determine the winner in 1892 by taking votes from them, the major parties launched a campaign to discredit the Populists. In this political cartoon (17.16), which appeared on the cover of Judge, a pro-Republican magazine, the artist ridicules the Populists as a “patchwork” of strange and dangerous political and ideological movements like socialism and prohibition. The balloon’s basket, labeled “Platform of Lunacy,” carried the party leaders, depicted as eccentric fools. In July 1892, the Populists nominated Union Army veteran James B. Weaver for president and Confederate veteran General James G. Field of Virginia for vice president. Their convention adopted a platform aimed at the following: eliminating monopolies (abolition of national banks and government ownership of railroads and telegraphs); protecting small producers (free silver coinage and “sub-treasuries” to store surplus farm produce during times of low prices and to allow farmers to borrow money against it at low interest); strengthening democracy (the popular election of U.S. senators and the referendum and initiative); and promoting fairness (a graduated income tax to make the rich pay more of the tax burden).

Competing Visions
PROGRESS OR PERIL?
Americans in the Gilded Age interpreted the economic, political, and social developments of the era in very different ways. Some looked about them with enthusiasm at the sight of a nation growing in size, wealth, population, and international prestige. President Benjamin Harrison, in his inaugural address in 1889 reflects this optimistic view. Other Americans, however, especially many farmers and industrial workers who sympathized with the People’s Party, expressed alarm and dismay over the state of the nation. What key signs of progress and national strength does President Harrison cite? What dangers to American ideals such as equality and democracy do the authors of the People’s Party Platform identify? How do we account for these starkly different visions? President Benjamin Harrison, Inaugural Address, March 4, 1889 [O]ur growth has not been limited to territory, population and aggregate wealth, marvelous as it has been in each of those directions. The masses of our people are better fed, clothed, and housed than their fathers were. The facilities for popular education have been vastly enlarged and more generally diffused. The virtues of courage and patriotism have given recent proof of their continued presence and increasing power in the hearts and over the lives of our people. The influences of religion have been multiplied and strengthened. The sweet offices of charity have greatly increased.… We have not attained an ideal condition. Not all of our people are happy and prosperous; not all of them are virtuous and law-abiding. But on the whole the opportunities offered to the individual to secure the comforts of life are better than are found elsewhere and largely better than they were here one hundred years ago. No other people have a government more worthy of their respect and love or a land so magnificent in extent, so pleasant to look upon, and so full of generous suggestion to enterprise and labor. God has placed upon our head a diadem and has laid at our feet power and wealth beyond definition or calculation. But we must not forget that we take these gifts upon the condition that justice and mercy shall hold the reins of power and that the upward avenues of hope shall be free to all the people. I do not mistrust the future. Dangers have been in frequent ambush along our path, but we have uncovered and vanquished them all. Passion has swept some of our communities, but only to give us a new demonstration that the great body of our people are stable, patriotic, and lawabiding.… The peaceful agencies of commerce are more fully revealing the necessary unity of all our communities, and the increasing intercourse of our people is promoting mutual respect.…

Corruption dominates the ballot box, the Legislatures, the Congress, and touches even the ermine of the bench. The people are demoralized … The newspapers are largely subsidized or muzzled, public opinion silenced, business prostrated, homes covered with mortgages, labor impoverished, and the land concentrating in the hands of capitalists. The urban workmen are denied the right to organize for self-protection, imported pauperized labor beats down their wages, a hireling standing army, unrecognized by our laws, is established to shoot them down, and they are rapidly degenerating into European conditions. The fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few, unprecedented in the history of mankind; and the possessors of those, in turn, despise the Republic and endanger liberty. From the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed the two great classes—tramps and millionaires. … A vast conspiracy against mankind has been organized on two continents, and it is rapidly taking possession of the world. If not met and overthrown at once it forebodes terrible social convulsions, the destruction of civilization, or the establishment of an absolute despotism.

 farmers, the platform also expressed sympathy with industrial workers. In the end, the People’s Party was no match for the established parties. Democrat Grover Cleveland won the election with 46 percent of the vote to Republican incumbent, Benjamin Harrison’s 43 percent. Yet Weaver garnered more than one million votes (9 percent) and won Kansas, Colorado, Idaho, and Nevada. Results on the local and state levels were

People’s Party leaders hoped to build on this achievement in 1896, but they faced severe challenges.

 support for the People’s Party with attacks on white supremacy severely weakened the party in the South.

Industrial Conflict
 and Depression Events soon highlighted the unchecked power of big business and the severe consequences of a laissez-faire economy. Many People’s Party activists hoped the anger and suffering produced by the Homestead strike and Panic of 1893 would prompt workers and farmers to reject the mainstream political parties and join the Populists. Workers at the Homestead Steel Works, a mammoth plant near Pittsburgh owned by Andrew Carnegie, for years enjoyed a strong union (the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers), high wages, and decent living conditions. But in 1892, Carnegie decided to rid the company of the union to cut costs by introducing labor-saving machinery and reducing wages. To protect the public persona of a benevolent capitalist that he had worked for years to develop (see Chapter 16), Carnegie went on vacation in Scotland, leaving his hard-nosed business partner, Henry Clay Frick, to do the dirty work. On June 29, Frick announced a lockout and closed the mills. After a week the standoff turned violent when

 workers exchanged gunfire with heavily armed professional strikebreakers of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, whom Frick had brought by boat to the Homestead complex. Six strikers and five Pinkertons were killed. The national press gave extensive coverage to the strike, and its tone was surprisingly pro-worker, probably due in part to the Pinkertons’ negative reputation. Carnegie, despite his attempt to separate himself from the conflict, drew some of the harshest criticisms. His critics challenged his reputation as the great philanthropist who handed out libraries to communities in the United States and Europe by depicting him as a two-faced hypocrite who funded his philanthropic largesse by grinding down his workers with wage cuts (17.17). But the tide of public opinion soon shifted against the strikers, for on July 23 anarchist Alexander Berkman burst into Frick’s office and shot him. Remarkably Frick survived the assassination attempt. Even though Berkman had no connection to Homestead workers, his actions brought widespread condemnation upon the strikers. In September state officials arrested 33 members of the union’s leadership and charged them with treason against the state. On November 20, 1892, with nearly all the jobs at Homestead filled by replacement workers, the union ended the strike. Six months later, on May 5, 1893, a financial crisis rocked the nation, leading to the most severe economic depression in American history

 17.17 Carnegie’s Reputation Takes a Hit The Homestead strike tarnished Carnegie’s image as a benevolent capitalist and friend of labor.

 to that time. Within a year the Panic of 1893 led to the failure of thousands of farms and businesses, including almost 200 railroads and 600 banks closed, throwing millions out of work and pushing the unemployment rate to 20 percent. The depression produced two vivid images of the widespread suffering endured by millions and the unwillingness of public officials to do much about it. The first came from an Ohio Populist named Jacob Coxey, who called for the government abandon laissez-faire and create public works projects such as building roads to alleviate mass unemployment and stimulate the economy (programs the federal government adopted in the Great Depression of the 1930s). To draw attention to this idea, he organized 100 unemployed men in Massillon, Ohio, to march to Washington, D.C. (the first such march on the capital). Setting out on March 25, 1894 Coxey’s Army, as it came to be known grew in size as as various groups joined along the route. As this photograph (17.18) and nearly every other one taken of the march shows, Coxey and his followers sought to portray an image of patriotism, earnestness, and moderation. Dressing as decently as their poverty permitted and marching with dozens of



 American flags, Coxey and his men rejected the accusations of their critics that they were violent radicals determined to attack the government. Rather, they asserted, theirs was a campaign to save the republic from the trusts and laissez-faire policies. Most of the men and women who joined Coxey walked for only part of the march to Washington. Nonetheless, about 600 accompanied him when he entered the nation’s capital on April 30, 1894. Denied entry into the Capitol, Coxey delivered an impassioned address on its steps. We stand here to-day in behalf of millions of toilers whose petitions have been buried in committee rooms, whose prayers have been unresponded to, and whose opportunities for honest, remunerative, productive labor have been taken from them by unjust legislation, which protects idlers, speculators, and gamblers. Coxey and other activists were arrested for “disturbing the peace” but convicted only for walking on the Capitol lawns. Other groups of unemployed workers staged similar protest marches, but all met with frustration and inaction.

17.20 For Silver and the People
 The Democratic Party emphasized Bryan’s commitment to workers and farmers through his advocacy of free silver and his promise to protect Americans from being crucified on a “Cross of Gold.”

The Election of 1896 and
Political Realignment
 The turmoil caused by the depression and Pullman strike greatly affected the 1894 off-year elections. Dissatisfaction with Cleveland’s administration hurt the Democrats, who lost their brief hold on both houses of Congress. The shift in power meant more stalemate for the next two years, with a Republican Congress opposed by a Democratic president. The election of 1896, however, led to a major realignment in political affiliations among the American people. Republicans nominated former Congressman and Governor of Ohio William McKinley for president and affirmed their conservative commitment to the gold standard and a high tariff. The Democrats nominated a young and dynamic congressman from Nebraska, William Jennings Bryan. Just 36 years old, Bryan had earned a reputation for stirring oratory against the tariff and in support of free silver. The latter issue held great symbolic importance in the middle of the depression. Silver was the metal of the common man, argued its supporters, while gold was the metal of elites. In speeches, pamphlets, songs, and images, People’s Party activists had convinced millions of Americans that free coinage of silver (putting more money into circulation and thus lowering the value of the dollar backed exclusively by gold) would both end the depression and curb the monopolies and trusts. Recognizing the popularity of this policy, delegates at the Democratic Party convention made free silver a key plank in the party platform. Bryan then delivered one of the most famous speeches in American history, in which he argued that average Americans were being crucified on a “cross of gold,” forced upon them by Wall Street and big business. Capturing this theme, this campaign poster (17.20) included the text of the famous speech (framed by silver coins) and ribbons bearing two of its most memorable

BECOMING A MODERN SOCIETY: AMERICA IN THE GILDED AGE, 1877–1900

Choices and Consequences
THE PULLMAN STRIKE
Grover Cleveland was not the first president to face the choice of whether to send federal troops to quell a labor dispute. Andrew Jackson had dispatched troops in 1834 to end a strike by canal workers. Rutherford B. Hayes had sent troops to crush the great railroad strike of 1877. Despite these precedents, Cleveland was aware that many considered the use of the army against American citizens a violation of the key republican principles of limited federal power. He also worried that the public would condemn such use of federal power if violence ensued as it had in 1877. He spent days in late June and early July 1894, consulting with advisors and mulling over his options. 
Choices




 Take no action, allowing Illinois and its pro-labor governor to handle the matter.

Continuing
Controversies
 When is using federal troops in a strike compatible with republican principles? Subsequent presidents, including Woodrow Wilson, also ordered military intervention during labor disputes. In 1916, the National Security Act empowered the president to federalize a state’s National Guard to quell a disturbance like a natural disaster, riot, or strike. The two most notable uses of this law, however, came in 1957 (Little Rock, Arkansas) and 1963 (Tuscaloosa, Alabama) to enforce federal desegregation orders.



 Intervene as a neutral and insist that both sides negotiate an equitable settlement.



 Send in the army to break the strike and allow the railroads to use strikebreakers to operate the trains.

Decision
 Despite misgivings Cleveland was a pro-business conservative. He authorized Attorney General Richard Olney, a man with extensive ties to the railroad industry, to obtain a court injunction declaring the ARU boycott of Pullman cars a “conspiracy in restraint of trade” that unlawfully blocked the U.S. mail. When the union defied the injunction, Cleveland ordered the army to end the boycott and get the trains moving again. Debs and other ARU leaders were arrested.

 Federal troops sent by President Cleveland to break the Pullman strike escort the first meat train out of the Chicago stockyards.

Consequences
 Cleveland’s decision touched off violence. Workers destroyed railroad property, and soldiers killed 13 workers and wounded scores more. The boycott collapsed in mid-July and with it the ARU. The Pullman strike ended in early August in complete defeat for the workers. Public opinion, however, turned against Pullman for his obstinate refusal to negotiate with his workers. A government investigation later criticized him and argued that labor unions and government regulation were needed to curb corporate power. Yet in 1895, the Supreme Court (In re Debs) upheld the use of injunctions to end strikes.

 How did President Cleveland justify using federal power to break the Pullman strike?

 lines: “You shall not press down upon the brow of Labor this Crown of Thorns” and “You shall not crucify mankind upon a Cross of Gold.” A youthful Bryan flanked by his wife and children tops the poster, while images of a worker and farmer flank the speech text. That left the People’s Party facing a dilemma. Most of its activists had expected the Democrats to follow the Republicans and support the gold standard, leaving the silver issue to the Populists. Now the People’s Party had to decide whether to nominate their own candidate and divide support for the silver issue with the Democrats, or, as was common practice among small parties in the nineteenth century, to nominate Bryan as their candidate, a move that would diminish their standing as an independent party concerned with issues other than silver. In July the People’s Party nominated Bryan. But they nominated their own candidate for vice president, Populist leader Tom Watson of Georgia. Rejecting a longstanding tradition that considered campaigning by presidential candidates unseemly, Bryan embarked on one of the most remarkable campaigns in American history, traveling more than 18,000 miles through 27 states and delivering more than 600 stump speeches to three million people.



 Bryan’s campaign generated a lot of commentary and excitement, but not enough votes on Election Day. McKinley, backed with an unprecedented amount of corporate money, won with 51 percent of the vote to Bryan’s 47 percent. The most significant outcome of the contest was a new and enduring political alignment. The Republican Party became dominant in the Midwest and Northeast and dominated national political power for the next three decades. Republicans would portray themselves as the party of economic prosperity (the economy recovered under McKinley) and international power. The Democrats became the party of the South and West. They retained the Populist belief that government needed to do more to secure the wellbeing of the average citizen and limit the power of big business. Given its base in the South, however, the Democratic Party also upheld a states’ rights philosophy that protected white supremacy. The People’s Party disintegrated after 1896, but many of its core ideas, such as the graduated income tax and the direct election of U.S. senators, remained popular and were eventually adopted during the next two decades, a period known as the Progressive Era.

 “If they dare to come out in the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing, we will fight them to the uttermost. Having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world, supported by the commercial interests, the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere, we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them: ‘You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns! You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold!’” WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN

Creating a
Democratic
Paradise
The Progressive Era, 1895–1915
 Female employees of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, many recently arrived from Italy and Eastern Europe, worked on sewing machines 6 days a week, 12 hours a day, making blouses. On March 25, 1911, a fire engulfed the top floors of the building that housed the factory in New York City’s Lower East Side. As bundles fell to the street, onlookers below assumed that workers were throwing their best cloth out the window to save it. They soon realized their mistake. Female workers were jumping by twos and threes to escape the flames. In the end, 146 women and men perished. The memories of this horrific scene never left 18-year-old Victor Gatto, who stood on the corner and watched as women plunged directly onto the pavement. In 1944 Gatto, a self-taught artist, painted Triangle Fire: March 25, 1911. His painting depicted a woman plunging to her death past unprepared firefighters atop ladders too short to reach the victims above. On the ground indifferent police officers stand near the neat row of shroud-covered corpses that lined the sidewalk. By the time Gatto provided this visual indictment of the government’s inability to protect workers, Americans’ expectations of their government had radically changed. This new vision took hold during the Progressive Era, partially in response to events like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. In Gatto’s painting the immense stone buildings tower above the lifeless workers, the artist’s way of representing the complete domination of big business over labor at the beginning of the twentieth century. On the day of the fire, employers had locked the workshop doors from the outside to prevent the women from stealing materials or leaving early. With the doors bolted and flimsy fire escapes collapsing under the weight of fleeing workers, the windows offered the only means of escape for the rest. To many Progressive Era reformers, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire illustrated the tragic consequences of capitalist exploitation and the government’s lack of interest in the plight of workers. Middle-class activists championed an array of reforms that envisioned using local, state, and federal governments to protect Americans from the greed and indifference of big business. Their agenda aroused considerable criticism, but Progressives, aided by three reform-minded presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson, found enough common ground to construct cross-class alliances that sought to end exploitive business practices and class conflict. Progressive-led coalitions also tackled pressing political and social issues. From the mid1890s to the mid-1900s, Progressives transformed the role of government in American society and laid the foundation for the liberal reform movements of the twentieth century.

 “We have reached the point in our history when we realize that the nation has tremendous social, economic, and industrial problems.” THEODORE ROOSEVELT, 1912





 CHAPTER 18

CREATING A DEMOCRATIC PARADISE: THE PROGRESSIVE ERA, 1895–1915

The Progressive Impulse
 The tide of reforms that swept across America at the turn of the twentieth century had its roots in a range of middle-class concerns. Middle-class dismay over the dismal living and laboring conditions for most workingclass people turned to alarm as strikes and the appeal of socialism increased. The Progressives had unprecedented success building alliances that transcended class and political party affiliation, winning the support of three consecutive presidents. Dramatically reshaping the nation within a decade, the Progressive vision of an activist government that used regulation to safeguard the public challenged the prevailing laissez-faire notion that the government should not interfere with market forces. began to dominate the economy. Smaller businesses, many run by middle-class proprietors, found it increasingly difficult to compete with these immense corporations.

THE PROGRESSIVE IMPULSE

 Large corporate bureaucracies also employed middle-class clerks whose ranks grew from 4 percent of the working population in 1900 to 8 percent by 1920. Most earned enough to maintain an acceptable middle-class lifestyle, but the middle class worried that the growing divide between the “haves” and “have-nots” put them in a precarious position. Press reports focusing on the dire living and working circumstances of the working class aroused middle-class sympathies, but fear motivated them to act as well. The popularity of radical political ideologies, unions, saloons and dancing halls within working-class neighborhoods— each in its own way offering the promise of a better, easier life—alarmed the middle class. The classless paradise without private property championed by working-class radical leaders horrified most middle-class professionals, who owned their own homes and businesses. This 1912 image of state militia confronting a parade of striking textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, underscored the reality that strikes often turned violent ( 18.2).

 workers by organizing unions to improve wages and working conditions. Tragedies like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire brought these diverse female factions together, even winning support from appalled upper-class women. In the wake of the fire, this cross-class female coalition focused on bolstering city safety regulations, but only the labor activists emphasized the need for unions to end employer exploitation. One particularly effective cross-class female alliance lobbied for legislation to ensure that mothers had clean, disease-free milk for their children. These women succeeded in their quest for local laws that prevented distributors from using chalk to make dirty milk appear white. They successfully rallied for mandatory pasteurization to kill germs, and for milk to be transported in refrigerated containers. Femaleled reform campaigns also injected new energy into the suffrage movement.

 “Children need pure milk and good food, good schools and playgrounds, sanitary homes and safe streets.” A female trade-union activist on why women needed the vote Many middle-class female Progressive reformers and working-class labor organizers became convinced that without the right to vote, women lacked an essential tool they needed to keep themselves and their families safe. The National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) achieved notable successes between 1910 and 1917, winning the right to vote in Washington, California, Arizona, Kansas, Oregon, and New York. Defeats in other states, however, convinced the NWSA to seek a constitutional amendment guaranteeing all women the right to vote, a campaign that succeeded in 1920 (see Chapter 20). In a general sense the Progressives wanted to turn America into a middle-class paradise where economic security, education, health, and civility flourished. The tradition of Christian charity also helped shape the Progressive agenda. In the 1880s, Protestant ministers like Josiah Strong began preaching the Social Gospel, the religious belief that Christians had a responsibility to create an ethically sound and morally upright society. The settlement house movement, begun in the spirit of Christian charity, became the incubator for strategies

 How did the Progressive vision take shape?

 Progressives developed to attain these goals. As they confronted the problems of the poor at Hull House, a settlement house in a Chicago immigrant neighborhood, Jane Addams and Florence Kelley articulated the middle-class values that would form the cornerstone of the Progressive ethos. Foremost among these was an emphasis on how the environment, as well as individual traits, shaped the lives of the poor. Progressives argued that poor living and working environments created many of the social problems troubling the nation. Exhibiting a typical Progressive faith in the scientific method, Addams and Kelley compiled a statistical portrait of disease, over-crowding, and crime in their Chicago neighborhood that helped Hull House devise solutions to these problems. Improving sanitation and garbage collection, creating playgrounds for children, eliminating saloons, limiting the hours spent at work, reducing workplace accidents—these were all ways to improve the environment in working-class neighborhoods so that individuals could flourish. Personal responsibility also remained a bedrock principle for Addams and Kelley. While offering more respect for immigrant cultures than many past reformers, Addams and Kelley still believed strongly in teaching immigrants the importance of thrift, temperance, and self-discipline—lifestyle changes that some immigrants resisted. Finally, Progressives embraced a new vision of governmental power, one that Americans from many different walks of life challenged. Their notion that governmental regulation should protect workers and curtail the excesses of big business put them at odds with industrialists and unions. Industrialists embraced the laissez-faire ethos that they had the right to control their businesses as they saw fit without government interference. Unions also viewed potential government intervention with unease, mindful that during labor conflicts the government usually sided with industrialists. Labor leaders preferred using collective action, including strikes, to win concessions from industrialists. To socialists, who wanted to nationalize all major industries, the Progressive emphasis on regulation was too timid. Essentially the Progressives sought the middle ground between these competing views. They wanted to establish a balance that avoided the excesses of unfettered laissez-faire economics, unending class conflict, or complete government control of the economy. Their aim was notable—the creation of a socially just, capitalist America.

REINING IN BIG BUSINESS



Reining in Big Business
 When three consecutive presidents—Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson—embraced components of the evolving Progressive reform agenda, Progressivism entered the mainstream with a vengeance. What to do about big business aroused considerable debate within Progressive circles. Progressives held competing visions of whether to regulate, dismantle, or accept the trusts, making it hard to rally public opinion around one clear solution. Presidents Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson devised differing regulatory and antitrust strategies to reform business practices, and openly disagreed on how to tackle the problem. Curtailing big business’s access to the nation’s environmental riches also provoked debate. Did business have the right to fully exploit the country’s forests and water, or should these resources be preserved?

 Roosevelt’s Trust-Busting Roosevelt enthusiastically supported turning the government into a “steward of the public welfare.” While serving as New York City police commissioner from 1895 to 1897, Roosevelt had become friendly with pioneering photojournalist Jacob Riis (see Chapter 17). “The midnight trips that Riis and I took” to the tenements, Roosevelt later acknowledged, showed him “what overcrowding means, some hot summer night.” Roosevelt’s feats during the 1898 Spanish-American War made him a national hero, catapulting him into winning the New York governorship. In 1900, President William McKinley selected Roosevelt as his running mate for his successful reelection bid. On September 5, 1901, anarchist Leon Czolgosz shot McKinley with a pistol wrapped in a handkerchief while the president was shaking hands at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. When McKinley died eight days later, the 42-year-old Roosevelt became the youngest president in American history. A robust man who appeared to be in perpetual motion dictating letters, lecturing visitors, playing tennis, or having pillow fights with his younger children in the White House, Roosevelt captured the public’s affection. When Teddy Roosevelt saved a bear cub during a 1902 hunting expedition, a toymaker felt inspired to name a new children’s toy after him, and so the teddy bear was born. Like many Progressives Roosevelt believed that the country stood at a crossroads—either reform or face the end of democracy. He established his credentials as a Progressive reformer, and won public approval, by mediating the 1902 coal strike and

 filing suit against the Northern Securities and Standard Oil Trusts. On May 12, 1902, 140,000 northeastern Pennsylvanian miners walked off their jobs. They demanded an eight-hour day, a 20 percent wage increase, and recognition of their United Mine Workers (UMW) union. The mine owners refused to negotiate. “‘The public be damned,’ appears to be their motto,” decried one Illinois newspaper as coal shortages forced factories to close, and the poor began cooking food with oil-soaked asbestos. President Roosevelt viewed the miners’ predicament sympathetically. “I strongly favor labor unions,” he declared. “If I were a wage worker in a big city I should certainly join one.” Fearing widespread suffering and urban riots, Roosevelt threatened to use troops to take over the mines unless the owners agreed to let a government commission fashion an agreement. For the first time a president had stood up publicly against big business, winning him accolades in union circles. The resulting resolution reduced miners’ hours from ten to nine and awarded them a 10 percent pay hike without forcing the owners to recognize the union. “I wish the capitalists would see,” the president privately remarked, that the government-ordered compromise “is really in the interest of property, for it will save it from the danger of revolution.” Roosevelt also joined the Progressive campaign to remove the stranglehold that some trusts had on parts of the economy. In 1902, journalist Ida Tarbell began publishing a multipart series, “The History of the Standard Oil Company,” in McClure’s Magazine, a popular and influential middle-class news periodical. In her scathing critique Tarbell detailed the illicit deals that John D. Rockefeller had made with railroad companies to build his oil trust. Secret rebate

 agreements meant that Rockefeller paid considerably less than his competitors to ship oil. Many could not even get the railroads, which feared incurring Rockefeller’s wrath, to transport their oil. Tarbell had firsthand experience with Rockefeller’s cut-throat practices: They had bankrupted her father’s oil business. She was convinced that Rockefeller’s tactics would drive other small producers out of business, leaving a handful of industrialists in control of the economy. The titans of industry offered a competing vision. There was nothing wonderful about economic competition, Rockefeller contended. Destructive pricecutting drove down wages, over-production created depressions, and duplication of services wasted valuable resources. Rockefeller defended his railroad agreements as beneficial to all concerned. Standard Oil got lower rates while the railroads received guaranteed freight. Preventing too much oil from flooding the market stabilized prices and kept men in all oil-related industries profitably employed. The richest man in America also disputed claims that trusts made economic advancement impossible for average Americans, noting that he needed intelligent and skilled men to run his subsidiaries. President Roosevelt agreed with much of Rockefeller’s assessment. “The corporation has come to stay,” he conceded, acknowledging that the nation benefited from the economies of scale that “good” trusts offered. Nonetheless, Roosevelt maintained, the government needed to break up “bad” trusts when consolidation threatened the public interest. The president soon singled out the Northern Securities Trust for dissolution, earning a reputation for trust-busting by taking steps to break up the monopoly. In 1901, the financier J. P. Morgan had joined with two other powerful trust-builders, James J. Hill and E. H. Harriman, to form the Northern Securities Trust. The new transportation conglomerate meant “that you can ride from England to China on regular lines of steamships and railroads without once passing from the protecting hollow of Mr. Morgan’s hand,” announced journalist Ray Stannard Baker. With his eye on the 1904 presidential election, Roosevelt filed an antitrust suit charging the Northern Securities Trust with violating the 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act. A shocked Morgan rushed to the White House to broker a deal with the president. “If we have done anything wrong, send your man to my man and they can fix it up,” suggested Morgan, an offer for a backroom deal that Roosevelt refused. In 1904, the Supreme Court upheld a Justice

 Department order to dissolve the Northern Securities Trust into independent railroad companies, earning Roosevelt public acclaim. After Roosevelt easily defeated the lackluster Democrat Alton B. Parker to win reelection in 1904, one newspaper called him “the most popular man that has come into public life within recent times.” Standard Oil was next. In 1906 the Justice Department filed suit claiming that the trust had violated the Sherman AntiTrust Act. This political cartoon (18.3) depicts Standard Oil as a frenzied octopus that has consumed the entire oil industry. Tentacles grasp overweight steel and copper businessmen in suits on one side and steamboats on the other, symbolizing how Standard Oil’s control of the supply and price of oil strangled transportation and manufacturing industries. In the caricature state legislatures and Congress have succumbed to the monster’s strength, and a leg now reaches for the White House. When the Supreme Court finally ordered Standard Oil to dissolve in 1911, the justices avoided a blanket ruling that all trusts were illegal. The Court instead invoked a “rule of reason,” stating that only unreasonable restraints of interstate trade violated the law. The Court’s ruling aptly described expresident Roosevelt’s own trust-busting philosophy. Roosevelt launched highly visible assaults on the Northern Securities and Standard Oil Trusts. He did nothing, however, when Morgan bought Andrew Carnegie’s steel empire in 1901 to create U.S. Steel, a trust that employed nearly one million workers. Roosevelt balanced trust-busting with regulation to ensure that big business behaved responsibly. He strengthened the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), created in 1887 to address Western farmers’ criticism of high railroad freight rates and rebates (see Chapter 17). By 1900, Supreme Court rulings

REINING IN BIG BUSINESS

 had essentially stripped the ICC of real authority. During his second administration, Roosevelt reinstated the power of the ICC to regulate railroad monopolies, convincing a reluctant Congress to pass the 1906 Hepburn Act. Four years later the Mann-Elkins Act further bolstered the rate-setting powers of the ICC and put the telegraph and telephone communication industries under its purview as well.

 Roosevelt believed that Taft would continue his efforts to create a stronger, regulatory federal government. The Democrats countered by nominating the fiery William Jennings Bryan for a third time (see Chapter 17), trying to siphon Progressive votes away from a tepid Taft. Roosevelt’s tireless campaigning for his chosen successor undercut Bryan’s claim that he was the only real Progressive in the race. The Republican campaign slogan, “Vote for Taft now, you can vote for Bryan anytime,” reminded voters of Bryan’s two previous attempts to win the presidency and portrayed him as a perennial loser. Taft won easily, handing Bryan his worst electoral defeat. Once Taft became president important philosophical differences between Roosevelt and Taft emerged. Like Roosevelt, Taft had to work with a divided

 Republican party that controlled Congress. Roosevelt had sided with the Progressive faction, while Taft gravitated to the conservatives. Unlike Roosevelt Taft viewed the president as an executor of law and protector of existing social institutions, not someone who spearheaded new reforms. A stickler for the law, Taft proved less willing than Roosevelt to make any distinction between good and bad trusts, filing more antitrust cases over four years than Roosevelt had in eight. Taft’s decision to file charges against U.S. Steel enraged Roosevelt, who saw it as a personal attack on his earlier choice to leave this “good” trust alone. Unhappy with his successor Roosevelt decided to run for president again in 1912. When Roosevelt’s bid for the 1912 Republican nomination failed (the party renominated the incumbent Taft), Republican Progressives bolted and formed the short-lived Progressive (Bull Moose) Party, which nominated Roosevelt as their presidential candidate. The split in Republican ranks offered the Democrats an opportunity to capture the presidency for the first time since the election of 1892. They nominated New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, a Virginia-born politician with Progressive ideals. In contrast to the divided Republican Party, Wilson’s candidacy kept the Southern base happy and prevented Progressively inclined Northern Democrats from joining the Progressive Party.

 Taft, Roosevelt, and Wilson supported different degrees of federal activism, competing views that gave voters a clear choice in the election of 1912. Taft was willing to zealously enforce existing Progressive reforms but had no intention of initiating new ones. Roosevelt embraced a governing philosophy that he called “New Nationalism,” a vision that emphasized increased federal regulation and widespread political reform. In contrast to Roosevelt, who wanted to regulate but not destroy big business, Wilson’s “New Freedom” promised to restore a competitive marketplace where small businessmen and farmers thrived. The 1912 slate also included Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs, a railway trade union leader who had become a socialist after being jailed during the Pullman Strike of 1894 (see Chapter 17). Formed in 1905 the Socialists had won numerous local elections and grown to over 100,000 dues-paying members. Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson believed that with regulations in place (although each favored different amounts of regulation), capitalism would operate more fairly. Debs offered a competing view. He proposed transferring ownership of existing railroad, oil, and steel trusts to the government to ensure fair prices and wages. Government-run monopolies would be the first step toward ending the free-market system altogether. Most voters agreed that the time had come to reform how the economy operated, but they overwhelmingly chose Progressivism over Socialism. Wilson won the presidency in 1912 (18.4) by a landslide in the Electoral College, while receiving only 41.9 percent of the popular vote. Roosevelt came in second with 27.4 percent of the popular vote, followed by Taft’s 23.2 percent. Over 900,000 Americans, 6 percent of the electorate, voted for Debs. Nearly 70 percent of those who voted cast their ballots for Wilson or Roosevelt, a resounding public endorsement of Progressive principles and reforms. Once he entered the White House, President Woodrow Wilson went beyond trust-busting to weaken monopolies. He accepted the Democratic orthodoxy of cutting the tariff so foreign businesses could market lower-priced goods in the United States, thereby creating a more competitive marketplace where smaller businesses could thrive. By 1913, most industrialists had dropped their longstanding opposition to lowering the tariff. The heads of Singer Sewing Machines, Eastman Kodak, and U.S. Steel believed that other nations would reciprocate, allowing American captains of industry to conquer foreign markets as well. Wilson offset the lost tariff

 revenue (which the government needed to fund its operations) with the first federal income taxes, now constitutional thanks to the newly ratified Sixteenth Amendment (1913). Only people making more than $4,000 a year paid federal income taxes (less than one percent of the population) at a time when many workers felt lucky to make $1,000 a year. Wilson also tried to help small businesses by improving the flow of credit. Most small and big businessmen agreed with Wilson that the time had come to reform the country’s chaotic banking system. They vividly remembered the Panic of 1907 when financial giant J. P. Morgan had used his own funds and those of other bankers to shore up the national banking system. The nation’s 7,000 banks operated with complete independence, issuing all forms of currency, some backed by gold and silver, others backed by government bonds. No centralized authority existed to expand or contract the currency supply as the economy demanded, or to move money around the country to stave off panics. Conflicting visions soon arose over whether private financiers or the government should control the nation’s financial institutions. Southern and Western Populists wanted a federally run banking system that would destroy the Wall Street “money trust.” Eastern bankers likened government oversight to socialism. After much debate Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act (1913), creating a federally run Federal Reserve to serve as a “banker’s bank” that held a portion of bank funds in reserve to help member banks in time of crisis. The Federal Reserve also set rates for business loans and issued a new national paper currency. Wilson beefed up federal regulation of trusts as well. In 1914, the Clayton Anti-Trust Act prohibited interlocking directories, the practice of setting up shadow companies that appeared to compete but were actually run by the same board of directors. The law exempted trade unions from prosecution under the 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act, eliminating a tactic that businessmen had used to undercut the labor movement. The Federal Trade Commission (1914) had the power to order companies to cease unfair trading practices, although its decisions were subject to court review.

 forests, water, and minerals provoked another set of competing visions within Progressive circles. In 1867, John Muir suffered an eye injury that caused temporary blindness while working as a mechanic. After his eyes healed Muir walked 1,000 miles from Indianapolis, Indiana, to the Gulf of Mexico to rejuvenate his spirit. Like Muir, Roosevelt had turned to the revitalizing power of nature while recovering from personal tragedy when he retreated to his North Dakota ranch in 1884 after both his mother and 22-year-old first wife died on the same day in their New York City home. In 1903, President Roosevelt went camping with Muir in Yosemite, an area of the California Sierra Nevada Mountains filled with spectacular waterfalls, massive rock formations, and Giant Sequoia trees nearly 200 feet high and 3,000 years old. A photo of the pair on Glacier Point (18.5) before Yosemite Falls, the largest waterfall in North America, commemorated the trip. The two men dominate the frame, suggesting the power they had to decide the fate of such national treasures. This moment of unity was fleeting. Despite their mutual love of unspoiled forests, Muir and Roosevelt became formidable opponents who embraced different environmental visions. Muir was a preservationist who championed preserving nature in its unspoiled state as a refuge for a “tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people.” He accused businessmen of ravaging forests, polluting water, and destroying meadows with little regard for the long-term social costs of ruining the environment. Muir’s condemnation resonated well with members of the middle class, who wanted to escape the

 stress of urban life with holidays in the pristine wilderness. His influential writings led to the 1890 establishment of Yosemite as a national park and the creation in 1892 of the Sierra Club, an environmental group dedicated to preserving wilderness. Muir’s antibusiness message fit well with the Progressive determination to put the social good ahead of individual self-interest. Roosevelt agreed that a few unscrupulous entrepreneurs should not unfairly consume what belonged to the entire nation. To this end Roosevelt created 5 national parks, 18 national monuments, and bird reserves that placed millions of acres off-limits to development. The president parted company with Muir, however, by choosing to regulate, not ban, public access to other federally controlled lands, waterways, and mineral deposits. Roosevelt embraced a conservationist vision that tried to balance two goals: meeting present economic needs and conserving natural resources for future generations. When the U.S. Forestry Service Director Gifford Pinchot allowed timber companies to harvest trees in designated areas, the new regulations enraged both preservationists, who wanted all economic development to cease, and Western businessmen, who demanded unfettered access to federally controlled forests. Taft was sympathetic to Western complaints that Roosevelt had overstepped his authority. When

 How did Americans disagree about the environment during the Progressive Era?

 Taft fired Pinchot in 1910, Roosevelt and his Progressive followers took it as a sign that Taft had abandoned conservation, deepening the split between the two former colleagues. Environmentalists expressed great admiration for Native Americans’ ecologically friendly farming and hunting practices, fueling mainstream curiosity about Indian cultures at the turn of the century. In 1900, photographer Edward Curtis began a 30-year multivolume ethnographic project entitled The North American Indian, which recorded images of 80 different Indian civilizations. Many Indians willingly participated in Curtis’s photography project, proud of the beautiful portraits he took of them in their best festive dress. Curtis wanted to capture the variety and richness of Native American cultures before they completely disappeared. Considering himself a friend to the Indian, Curtis believed (like most of his generation) that to survive Native Americans needed to assimilate into mainstream American society. Curtis often photographed groups of Indians riding off into the distance ( 18.6 ) to symbolically convey the notion that, as Curtis wrote, “the Indians as a race, already shorn in their tribal strength and stripped of their primitive dress, are passing into the darkness of an unknown future.” Neither preservationists nor conservationists had any interest in reversing official policies of forced assimilation that divided collective reservation lands into individual farms, banned native languages, and sent Indian children to white-run boarding schools (see Chapter 15). Preservationists inadvertently hastened the demise of some Indian cultures by enticing Americans to visit national forests. Tourism undercut Indians’ access to traditional hunting grounds so that their economic survival increasingly depended on selling crafts to tourists and charging them to see performances of native dances.

COMPETING VIEWS ON TRANSFORMING THE WORKPLACE



Competing Views on Transforming
 the Workplace In 1900, the United States earned the questionable distinction of being one of the most strike-torn nations in the world. To end class conflict and introduce more social harmony, Progressives wanted to transform the workplace into an environment where workers labored a reasonable number of hours in safe conditions for decent wages. Industry and labor each presented a competing view that challenged the Progressive vision as they sought the upper hand in their decadeslong class struggle.

Capitalist Visions of
Industrial Harmony
 Industrialists differed on how to rid the workplace of labor conflicts that interfered with the smooth operation of their businesses. The National Civic Federation brought together moderate industrialists and labor union leaders dedicated to seeking industrial peace through compromise. Ohio Senator Mark Hanna, who made his fortune in coal, argued that industrialists should turn labor into “the ally of the capitalist, rather than a foe.” In return for a few minimal concessions, factory owners could demand that union leaders discipline their membership and keep workers on the job, thus ending the constant strife that permeated the industrial sector. Hanna’s voice was a decided minority. Most industrialists refused to compromise their authority. Staunchly antiunion they employed a host of methods to undercut unions. If forced to accept a union, they insisted upon an “open shop” that let workers choose whether to join a union, then used intimidation to stop workers from enrolling. Industrialists hired private security forces to spy on workers, fired identified union members, and put them on blacklists that prevented union members from getting another job. During strikes factory owners expelled families from company-owned housing and hired substitute workers (called scabs) to replace striking workers. To protect union members from these discriminatory industrialist policies and build strength, labor organizers fought to establish a “closed shop,” which required all workers in the same company to join the union. Other industrialists embraced benevolence to dissuade workers from organizing. Welfare capitalism, the notion of using benefits to gain workers’

 loyalty, aimed to improve worker morale and weaken interest in unions. Some large firms instituted free medical care, pensions, kindergartens, and even baseball leagues, but these services typically evaporated at the first sign of economic downturn. Unions did not want to leave it up to the employer to decide whether to offer benefits. They preferred using collective bargaining to negotiate a contractual agreement between workers and their employers that established such benefits as a permanent right. The drive for efficiency, a goal that many Progressives shared, was another way that industrialists undercut workers’ collective power. Henry Ford’s innovations in automobile manufacturing demonstrated how industrialists could boost profits by reducing manufacturing costs. The son of a prosperous Irish immigrant farmer in Dearborn, Michigan, Ford built his first car in 1896 in a shed behind his Detroit home. Forming the Ford Motor Company, Ford introduced the Model T in 1908, a moment when 515 separate companies were manufacturing automobiles. Ford standardized parts and constantly improved machinery—innovations that let him produce more cars for less money. Ford passed these savings on to consumers, lowering the price of his “car for the great multitudes” from $825 in 1908 to $345 in 1916. By then Ford had captured half the market for new cars. In 1914 Ford created headlines by offering male factory workers a five-dollar daily wage for nine hours of work (extended to female and male office employees two years later). Ford paid twice the standard wage rate, because he recognized that the common practice of paying workers subsistence wages limited the markets for many consumer goods. Ford wanted his workers to be able to afford his automobiles. Working nine instead of ten hours a day, Ford reasoned, reduced fatigue-induced mistakes and worker

 turnover, giving the company a loyal and experienced workforce. The moving conveyor belt in Ford’s assembly lines (18.7) meant that workers no longer had to lift or move the chassis as they assembled a car. Ford admitted that he “could not do the same thing day in and out,” but he condescendingly believed that the average worker “wants a job in which he does not have to think.” To keep workers focused and productive, Ford prohibited sitting, talking, singing, or whistling in his factories. Fearful of losing their jobs, workers only dared to criticize Ford’s iron control over the production process in private.

 How much did Ford’s innovations and paternalism benefit workers?

 Ford’s five-dollar/nine-hour-day came with strings attached. Ford instituted many reforms that Progressives sought because they made business sense, but he staunchly resisted government regulation and attempts to organize a union, retaining the right to make his own factory rules. Ford also firmly subscribed to industrialists’ long-standing belief that they had the right, and the duty, to interfere in the private lives of their employees. For Ford this meant offering benefits only to employees who met certain moral criteria. Married men, for instance, had to live with their families. Thirty investigators working for Ford’s Sociological Department visited workers’ homes and sometimes imposed other requirements, such as mandatory English classes for immigrants. Gambling, excessive drinking, or having sexual relations with a prostitute were all grounds for dismissal. A Ford Motor Company investigator had to verify that a male worker was morally upright (and not trying to organize a union) before he and his family could move into a spacious two-story home built by the company.

 from The Principles of Scientific Management (1911)

COMPETING VIEWS ON TRANSFORMING THE WORKPLACE

 Progressives valued efficiency and expertise, and Frederick Winslow Taylor took the drive for efficiency further than Ford by popularizing scientific management, the effort to use scientific knowledge to maximize output and profit. Taylor used stopwatches to evaluate how long each part of the manufacturing process should take. He then outlined the steps laborers should replicate to lay bricks without any wasted energy, and determined the perfect shovel size and the exact amount of rest workers needed to lift the maximum amount of pig iron each day. After establishing the optimal time and method for a specific task, Taylor argued, industrialists could then fine or fire unproductive workers who failed to maintain an acceptable pace. Taylor admitted that his system, dubbed “taylorism,” intentionally eliminated workers’ independence and creativity. Each man, he asserted, must “grow accustomed to receiving and obeying directions covering details, large and small, which in the past have been left to his individual judgment.”

Working-Class
Labor Activism
 The working class had long fashioned its own solutions to surviving difficult living and working conditions. Fraternal associations assisted those who lost their jobs or needed to bury a loved one, while urban political machines (see Chapter 17) secured voters’ loyalty by helping families endure personal tragedies such as fires or illness. Meanwhile unions tried to negotiate better wages and shop floor rules for dues-paying members, but organizing the working class so it could speak with one voice proved impossible. Ethnic and racial prejudices kept the working class fragmented. Italian strikebreakers, for instance, had few qualms about walking across a picket line manned by Slavic strikers. The craftbased American Federation of Labor (AFL), led by Samuel Gompers, organized only skilled, mostly white workers, refusing to let unskilled laborers, women, or blacks into its unions. Only a handful of industrial unions like the UMW and International Longshoreman’s Union adopted a big umbrella approach that organized all workers in one industry into the same union. Middle-class Progressives supported many union goals but deplored their methods. Strikes continually disrupted normal life by shutting down railroad lines, street cars, and coal mines.

Read the Document Profiles: Samuel Gompers




 Government regulation, they maintained, would improve workers’ lives and ensure that the economy functioned smoothly. Nevertheless, many unions remained skeptical about relying on the government to solve their conflicts. The AFL preferred using its collective economic power to force industrialists to negotiate. Its members had unhappy memories of what happened when state or federal officials intervened in labor conflicts, as during the 1894 Pullman Strike. The Roosevelt administration occasionally chose to aid labor, but Progressive Era courts nearly always favored industrialists. In 1908, the Supreme Court stopped workers from launching sympathy strikes or boycotts to support fellow workers, labeling them “restraints of trade” barred under the 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act, a law originally intended to curtail the creation of business monopolies. Another 1908 decision allowed employers to fire workers who joined unions. Reducing government interference in labor conflicts therefore remained the AFL’s primary goal. Radical trade unionists rejected the AFL vision of working within the free market system. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), formed in 1905, envisioned “one big union” that welcomed all workers regardless of sex, race, ethnicity, or skill, which would one day take over all means of production in the United States. “It is the historic mission of the working class to do away with capitalism,” declared the founders of the IWW, whose members were nicknamed “Wobblies.” The founding group included 75-year-old Mother Mary Jones, a tireless white-haired organizer for the UMW, and William D. “Big Bill” Haywood, an organizer for the Western Federation of Miners. Their drive to abolish private property and formal government struck many Progressives as anarchy. Government harassment of the IWW limited its formal membership to around 10,000.

The Progressives’
Limited Progress
 Employers had traditionally held employees responsible for workplace accidents, maintaining that workers knowingly accepted all job-associated risks. Carelessness caused most mishaps, they argued. Progressive organizations undertook detailed sociological studies to refute these self-serving generalizations. Lewis Hine’s photographic investigation into the lives of injured Pittsburgh workers

 suggested that few were responsible for their accidents. This young man (18.8) had his leg crushed when he fell under a coal car in a Pittsburgh coal mine. The company paid the hospital expenses for his amputation, but nothing else. In the image a nicely dressed passerby avoids making eye contact with the injured boy who stands idle on the street, suggesting that the well-off preferred to ignore the plight of disabled workers. The boy’s tidy appearance reveals an effort to maintain personal dignity while relying on private charity to survive. Studies like Hine’s convinced many states to establish worker compensation programs that provided employer-funded disability payments and medical care to injured workers. As a result employers began paying more attention to workplace safety. The drive to limit hours for male workers was less successful. Employers had traditionally maintained that as property owners they had the sole power to decide the terms of employment. In the 1874 Slaughter-House cases, the Supreme Court had ruled that a state could not deny individuals control over their own labor. Industrialists claimed that this decision granted individual workers the constitutionally protected right to negotiate wages, hours, and workplace rules. According to this line of reasoning, state laws or unions that tried to impose restrictions on individual workers violated their right to control their own labor.

 How effective were the different strategies that Progressives and unions employed to reform the workplace?

 The Supreme Court, however, proved willing to abridge this right to protect public health and safety. In 1898, the Court upheld an eight-hour day for Utah miners, deciding that guarding the health of workers engaged in a dangerous occupation served the public interest. Progressives failed in their efforts to extend these protections to the entire workforce. In Lochner v. New York (1905), the Court ruled that unless long work hours directly jeopardized workers’ health, the government could not abridge an employee’s freedom to negotiate his own work schedule with his employer. This decision is explored more fully in Choices and Consequences: Regulating Workers’ Hours. Miserable and unsafe working conditions also persisted. The Colorado mining town of Ludlow sat along the Purgatory River, a telling name that suitably described what working in a mine was like. In Ludlow, the Rockefeller-owned mining company paid miners $2 a day in company-issued currency (called scrip) redeemable only in the company-run store. The mining company required that workers live in company-owned housing, and claimed no responsibility for accidents that killed 200 miners between 1904 and 1914. In 1913, 12,000 miners, mostly Italian, Greek, and Serbian immigrants, went on strike to protest these conditions and demand company recognition of their UMW union. When the company expelled the strikers and their families from their homes, the workers erected tent cities in the nearby hills. After armed company detectives failed to dislodge the miners, the Colorado governor sent in state troops, whose wages Rockefeller agreed to pay. The Ludlow Massacre ensued on April 20, 1914 when troops set fire to one striking miners’ camp, and thirteen women and children suffocated to death in a shallow underground shelter where they had sought refuge. Throughout the nation outraged laborers temporarily put their ideological divisions aside to stage protest marches in every major city. The UMW issued “a call to arms,” and hundreds of neighboring miners flooded into Ludlow to defend their comrades against the state militia. Faced with the prospect of all-out class war, the governor requested federal troops, and President Wilson immediately complied. Federal intervention left the union in tatters and Rockefeller free to run his mining town as he saw fit. Incidents like these convinced many unions that the Progressive proposal to rely solely on the government to solve their problems was not the answer.

COMPETING VIEWS ON TRANSFORMING THE WORKPLACE



Choices and Consequences
REGULATING WORKERS’ HOURS
Most city residents, especially tenement-dwellers who did not have ovens, bought their bread from bakeries. Bakers worked long hours in hot, poorly ventilated kitchens, sleeping and washing where they baked bread. In 1895, New York State passed a law that set sanitary standards and limited bakers to ten hours of work per day, 60 hours per week. Joseph Lochner, a bakery owner in Utica, challenged the law after New York fined him $50 for making an employee exceed these limits. The Supreme Court faced three choices when it heard the case in 1905. 
Choices




 A state could use its police powers to protect workers’ health and safety.



 A state could not limit an individual’s right to buy or sell labor in nonhazardous occupations such as baking.



 States had the right to enact any laws not expressly forbidden by the Constitution to promote the general well-being of society.

Decision
 The Court ruled 5 to 4 that the Fourteenth Amendment, which declared that “no state shall … deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of the law,” prevented states from using their police powers to regulate work that did not imperil the health or safety of the public.

Consequences
 The decision curtailed Progressives’ attempt to use regulation to transform the workplace. During the subsequent 32-year “Lochner” era, the Court struck down maximum hour, minimum wage, and child labor laws if no clear risk to the public existed. Dismayed Progressives noted that many state laws restricted an individual’s ability to buy or sell labor, such as mandatory school laws or Sunday closures, to promote the general welfare. They also accused the Court of ignoring the disproportionate power that employers wielded over workers to set the terms of employment.

Continuing Controversies
 Should the government limit work hours or set a minimum wage? Lochner remained the law of the land until 1937, when the Supreme Court ruled that it was “reasonable” for Washington State hotel owners to pay female hotel maids the state-mandated minimum wage because the state had a right to protect its residents. Defining an acceptable standard for work and pay has been controversial ever since. Is a reasonable day’s work six, eight, ten, or twelve hours? Does it matter if the work involves strenuous physical labor or is sedentary? Is it better for unions to negotiate the terms of employment or for the government to step in? How does regulating hours of work or setting a minimum wage hurt or benefit the general public? These are questions that Americans have debated for more than 70 years.

CREATING A DEMOCRATIC PARADISE: THE PROGRESSIVE ERA, 1895–1915

Protecting Women and Children
 Progressives never convinced unions to give up strikes, but together they demanded laws protecting women and children. Relying on mountains of sociological data and heart-rending photographs, female activists helped secure protective legislation that reduced the hours women worked and kept children in school longer. Working-class men offered more resistance when female reformers tried to make temperance the law of the land.

 cultivated her notoriety as a Bibletoting, ax-wielding saloon smasher by selling portraits and pins to her admirers.

 In 1908, Curt Muller, a laundry owner in Portland, Oregon, challenged a recent state law granting a ten-hour workday for female laundry workers. In making his case before the Supreme Court, Muller followed the same line of reasoning used in the Lochner case, arguing that the law deprived his workers of their right to control their own labor. He disputed the reformers’ claim that scrubbing all day in a hot, wet workplace posed a serious risk to laundry workers’ health. In its unanimous 1908 Muller v. Oregon ruling, the Supreme Court upheld maximum hour laws for female workers, accepting lawyer Louis Brandeis’s argument that protecting women’s reproductive health served the public good. “As healthy mothers are essential to vigorous offspring, the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race,” the Supreme Court declared. Reactions to the ruling among women were mixed. Middle-class Progressive reformers and female trade unionists celebrated it as a victory for female workers, unperturbed by the Court’s emphasis on the biological inferiority of women to men. Feminists who believed in total equality were disappointed with the ruling, creating a fissure in the women’s movement that soon widened into an open split. The male-dominated AFL embraced the decision,

 Why did the campaign for maximum work hour laws succeed for women, but fail for men?

 believing it reduced employers’ incentive to hire women instead of men. As if to prove this point, Muller responded by firing his female workers and hiring Chinese men to take their place. Cross-class alliances between middle-class and working-class women flourished around other efforts to help working women. In 1898, the National Consumers’ League (NCL) formed to coordinate local consumer boycotts of department stores that mistreated their female clerks. The NCL made the long hours and low pay endured by female working-class clerks the responsibility of every middle-class female shopper. The group soon expanded its boycotts to include stores that sold clothing made in sweatshops or with child labor. Compiling “blacklists” of stores to boycott was illegal, so the NCL instead worked with female garments’ unions to create “white lists” of shops with equitable labor policies where socially conscientious women could shop without remorse.

Stamping
Out Vice
 Local and state reformers also took aim at alcohol, believing that prohibition would improve women’s lives by reducing domestic violence and bolstering family income. The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU; see Chapter 17) viewed the saloon as a haven for gambling, prostitution, corrupt city political machines, and excessive alcohol consumption. The WCTU crusade took a surprising turn on June 6, 1900, when a deeply religious 64-year-old woman named

PROTECTING WOMEN AND CHILDREN

 Carry A. Nation strode into a southwestern Kansas bar with a bag of bricks and smashed the liquor bottles, glassware, and mirrors, then calmly left. Nation’s tactics were extreme, but many Progressives shared her sense of urgency. Drinking was on the rise in America. From 1885 to 1900, beer consumption nearly doubled from 590 million to 1.2 billion gallons. Hundreds of inspired “Home Defenders” throughout the nation organized similar attacks on neighborhood bars, hoping to convince their communities to go dry. As her fame grew, Nation raised funds by selling miniature hatchet pins, her new weapon of choice (18.9), along with photos of herself holding her bible and hatchet. She spent time in jails from New York to Los Angeles publicizing the temperance cause before collapsing on a stage in 1911 and dying shortly thereafter. Working-class men resolutely defended their freedom to drink, and many upper-class men were reluctant to give up a pleasure-based lifestyle that included ready access to alcohol. Attacking on multiple fronts the nonpartisan Anti-Saloon League, founded in 1893, and the WCTU established an effective coalition that included Progressives, rural Americans, and industrialists. Prohibitionists linked ridding the nation of alcohol to the broader Progressive desire to eliminate the corrupting influences of big-city



 political machines. Saloons, temperance advocates maintained, served as the headquarters where dishonest city politicians paid immigrants for votes and dispersed favors to supporters. Temperance advocates drew rural folk into the movement by addressing their concerns about the growing cultural influence of urban pleasures and the beer-drinking immigrants who lived in the cities. Molding their message to appeal to industrialists, temperance advocates CARRY A. NATION explains her blamed saloons saloon-smashing ways for contributing to the nation’s labor troubles by giving unions a place to meet and recruit. Working through churches in the South and the West, the Anti-Saloon League and WCTU urged supporters to focus on making their state or county “dry” by banning the sale of alcohol. The “Prohibition 1904 and 1917” map (18.10) traces the rapid success of this strategy as the number of dry states grew from three to 23. Many western women had already secured the right to vote, and they flocked to approve prohibition in large numbers.

Restoring Childhood
18.11 “Models
 of 1898” The middle class believed that children should engage in healthy and creative play, not work in dangerous and dreary factories.

 Middle-class Americans believed that childhood should be devoted to education and play, not work. This advertisement (18.11) from an 1898 Sears and Roebuck catalog portrayed the type of idyllic childhood that many middle-class families tried to give their children. In the ad an immaculately dressed young girl rides joyfully in the sunshine on a new bicycle, a portrait of health and happiness. The reality for

 working-class children offered a stark contrast. Census records revealed nearly 1.75 million children ages 10 through 15 worked in factories full time, a figure that did not include children employed in home sweatshops or on family farms. To Progressives child labor epitomized the greed of employers who eagerly sent children into mining crevices where adults could not fit, used children to harvest crops in the Midwest, or dispatched an army of small

 boys to hawk newspapers in northern cities. Organized labor joined this crusade, certain that child labor drove down adult wages. Industrialists offered a competing vision, arguing that jobs provided valuable training for working-class children who needed to learn the importance of punctuality and hard work to become successful adult workers. Many working-class families shared employers’ beliefs that their children should work. In Chicago Hull House cofounder Jane Addams discovered that most immigrants, having worked themselves as children, found nothing wrong with putting their own children to work. “A South Italian peasant who has picked olives and packed oranges from his toddling babyhood, cannot see at once the difference between the outdoor healthy work which he has performed in the varying seasons, and the long hours of monotonous factory life which his child encounters when he goes to work in Chicago,” she noted, adopting the Progressive tendency to gloss over the drudgery of farm work. Rather than banning child labor, working-class parents often preferred making factories safer places for their children to work. They were not hardhearted, but pragmatic. Child labor provided onetenth of family income in the early twentieth century, and a family’s survival often depended on children’s meager wages. Recently arrived immigrant men, especially unskilled, non-English speakers, realized with dismay that their English-speaking children were more apt to be hired than they were. Children in these families became the breadwinners, while their fathers stayed at home. This reversal of normal family relations often created tensions within working-class households. “I left Europe and I was a man, and here I am a what?” lamented one Russian Jewish immigrant. The drive to end child labor gained momentum when the National Child Labor Committee formed in 1904 to lobby for state and federal laws prohibiting child labor. The group hired photographer Lewis Hine to help them build a scientific, legal, and moral case against child labor. In one photo-story, Hine paired images of children who worked in two textile mills owned by the same company. The company’s mill in Huntsville, Alabama, hired children as young as eight years old, Hine noted, while Massachusetts law prohibited the Lowell factory from employing children under the age of 14. The National Child Labor Committee presented such regional discrepancies as evidence that the nation needed a federal child labor law. Images as History: Exposing the Evils of Child Labor, page 550, explores Hine’s images more fully. The pervasiveness of child labor in the South particularly troubled him. In 1900, nearly 25 percent of

 the workers in Southern textile factories and cotton mills were white children ages 10 to 16. Some reformers viewed child farm work as a healthier alternative to long days in a factory. Hine disagreed. “The sunshine in the cotton fields has blinded our eyes to the monotony, overwork and the hopelessness of their lives,” he wrote. In 1916, President Wilson signed a law banning the interstate sale of products made by child labor that protected only about 150,000 industrial child laborers out of nearly 1.75 million. Two years later the Supreme Court sided with a father who argued that the law deprived him of his parental right to control his sons’ labor and declared the law unconstitutional. Progressives responded by trying to amend the Constitution. In 1924 Congress approved an amendment giving the federal government the power to regulate child labor, but southern opposition to any curtailment of states’ rights prevented its ratification. A nationwide ban on child labor did not come until the 1930s, when the Court upheld a New Deal federal child labor law. Ultimately child labor declined as states began to mandate school attendance. Embracing the notion that all children had the right to an education, local women’s groups pushed hard to ensure that their neighborhood schools received appropriate funding, provided free books, offered kindergarten, paid teachers adequately, and were equipped with satisfactory fire escapes. Throughout the Progressive Era school enrollments, the number of days in a school year, and money spent per pupil all rose. Other Progressive endeavors also aimed to improve the lives of working-class children. The allure of pleasure and hunger at home sometimes became too strong for children, who resorted to stealing to meet their needs. “Most of these premature law breakers are in search of Americanized clothing and others are only looking for playthings,” Jane Addams maintained. Some, she pointed out, were simply “eager to take home food or fuel which will relieve the distress and need they so constantly hear discussed.” Reformers spearheaded the creation of a juvenile criminal system that focused on rehabilitating young offenders. To keep young children safely off the streets when their parents went to work, Progressive activists established urban playgrounds with adult supervisors. To divert female teenagers from tempting dance halls and male adolescents from saloons or brothels, Progressives created local boys and girls clubs that included organized sports teams and art classes. Not every child appreciated becoming the object of reform. “I can’t go to the playgrounds now,” complained one 11-year-old boy. “They get on me nerves with so many men and women around telling you what to do.”

 What obstacles did reformers face while trying to eliminate child labor?

EXPOSING THE EVILS OF CHILD LABOR
Trained as a sociologist, photographer Lewis Hine took nearly 5,000 photographs as a staff photographer for the National Child Labor Committee from 1908 to 1918. Hine visited factories, canneries, textile mills, farms, and mines snapping photos and recording the experiences of each child, evidence the Committee used to argue that full-time work damaged children’s health, deprived them of an education, and ruined their childhood. Hine often posed as a factory inspector or salesman to gain access to factories or mines.

 purpose and refused to let him in, Hine took pictures of child laborers arriving at daybreak or leaving covered in grime. He carefully recorded the children’s names, ages, and stories to counter industrialists’ accusations that he staged his photos. His notes for this image of a young girl tending machines in a South Carolina cotton mill read, “Sadie Pfeifer, 48 inches high, has worked half a year. One of the many small children at work in Lancaster Cotton Mills.” Are Hine’s photographs best understood as historical evidence, propaganda, or both?

Reforming the Government
 Progressives recognized that passing laws governing the workplace or protecting women and children was not enough. Ensuring their enforcement through the establishment of regulatory agencies required reforming how local, state, and federal governments functioned. Only then could the government become a positive force in workers’ lives. Socialists agreed that the government should act, but ultimately wanted to give state and national governments control of all major industries. gave federal inspectors the authority to condemn meat unfit for consumption and established federal Progressives discovered an unexpected ally in their sanitary standards for meatpacking plants. drive to turn the government into a guardian that Reformers also wanted manufacturers of patent actively protected the public.

 proved willing to look the other way when businesses broke the law. Political parties sometimes stole elections, creating fictitious lists of voters that let individuals use multiple aliases to vote as often as they liked. Progressives disagreed over how to eliminate corruption. One answer was to get rid of politicians and instead rely on nonpartisan commissions of experts or city managers to run city services. Over 400 municipalities turned to commission-style governance, an approach that reflected the broad faith placed in expertise during the Progressive Era. Other Progressives replaced the ward system that let each neighborhood select its own councilman with city councils elected at large. Voters expected their ward representative to “bring home the bacon,” patronage that Progressives felt encouraged parochialism and corruption. Impoverished working-class residents offered a competing vision. Their ward representatives provided needed job opportunities or relief. Envisioning Evidence: The Family Economy (page 554) illustrates the hand-tomouth existence for many working-class families.



 In the absence of a comprehensive social welfare system, the patronage-based ward system gave many working-class urban residents a way to survive hard times. On the state level Progressives tried to reduce the power of corrupt political parties. Many states eliminated the practice of handing voters different colored ballots marked “Republican” or “Democrat” to stuff into the ballot boxes as party officials looked on. The secret ballot removed the threat of payback or shunning if one broke with the neighborhood party boss. Instead of letting party leaders choose candidates, some states introduced direct primaries that allowed party members to pick the candidates. A reform measure called the “initiative” provided a way, usually by gathering signatures on petitions, for the electorate to introduce legislation before state legislatures. The referendum put legislative proposals on the ballot, letting the voting public decide whether a measure became law. Finally, the recall used special elections to remove unpopular or corrupt officials from office before their term expired. Wisconsin, one of the most Progressive states, adopted all these measures under the leadership of Governor Robert Lafollette. In 1906, journalist David Graham Phillips detailed the close ties between big business and federal senators in a series of magazine articles entitled “The Treason of the Senate.” Phillips viewed this alliance as threatening to “the American people as any invading army could be.” Roosevelt charged Phillips with exaggerating the extent of corruption and urged the “men with the muckrakes” to avoid stirring up needless controversy. Roosevelt’s rebuke gave a new nickname to investigative journalists, “muckrakers.” Subsequent corruption scandals solidified public support for the Seventeenth Amendment (1913), which enabled voters, rather than state legislatures, to elect federal senators.

THE FAMILY ECONOMY
Stiff employer resistance to labor unions and the unions’ tendency to organize only skilled workers meant that few workers could use collective bargaining to increase their wages. Instead, working-class families relied on themselves or, if the main breadwinner fell ill, on community charities to survive. This working-class family’s expenses outweigh the income of one male wage earner, a common problem. Less than 3 percent of married women worked outside the home, but wives supplemented the family income by doing laundry for others or taking in boarders who paid for a room and meals. Putting children to work (at the expense of their schooling) helped families make ends meet even though children earned much less than adults. This responsibility never ended for some. Adult children continued to contribute to their family’s financial well-being by delaying marriage or supporting aging parents who could no longer work.

 The average laborer ate a more monotonous and less nutritious diet than a white-collar professional– consuming less meat, prepared foods (canned and dry goods), fruits, vegetables and sweets.

 Buying life insurance from a local fraternal organization ensured that if the father died, the laborer's family could afford his funeral and survive in the short term.

 The accountant drank and smoked less than the worker, leading to charges that the poor squandered their money. The similar amounts paid for rent do not mean comparable living circumstances. The accountant’s higher transportation costs indicate that he lived farther out of town, probably in a new suburb. The worker lived close to work, nearer to industrial pollution. High demand for tenement apartments meant landlords often charged laborers exorbitant rents.

 The accountant had an extra $23.33 a month to save, or give to his aged mother, along with $931 in household goods (including musical instruments and jewelry) that he could sell if necessary. This working-class family’s expenses outweigh the income of one male wage-earner, a common problem.

REFORMING THE GOVERNMENT

Accepting Separate but Equal
 The Progressive campaign to remake the government into a champion of the common man did not include challenging the legal edifice constructed in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 1896 “separate but equal” ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (see Chapter 14). By 1900, southern states had rushed to pass laws that formally segregated every public facility from railroad waiting rooms to cemeteries, parks, beaches, and water fountains. Use of poll taxes and literacy tests to disenfranchise blacks also exploded. When southern-born Woodrow Wilson took office in 1913, he let the heads of federal agencies segregate their offices. African American leaders cultivated their own reform impulse during the Progressive Era. Unlike white Progressives black leaders had little faith that government would solve their social problems. The most

 prominent African American of the Progressive Era, Booker T. Washington, instead embraced self-help as the best way to end poverty among African Americans. Born a Virginia slave in 1859, after the Civil War Washington developed an almost fanatical desire to get an education, arriving penniless at the doorstep of Virginia’s Hampton Institute, a vocational high school founded in 1868 to educate freed slaves and Indians. He passed his entrance exam—sweeping a floor—with flying colors. Hampton taught practical skills such as brick-making, blacksmithing, and shoemaking along with more traditional academic subjects like reading and math. This staged photograph (18.13) of a Hampton Institute carpentering class, taken 20 years after Washington attended, encapsulated the school’s educational philosophy. The photo underscored that these perfectly groomed, hard-working, and well-trained students had the skills they needed to advance step-bystep up the ladder (in this case staircase) of success.

 CHAPTER 18

CREATING A DEMOCRATIC PARADISE: THE PROGRESSIVE ERA, 1895–1915

 Washington followed the Hampton model when he established his own school in 1881, the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. A captivating orator, Washington popularized the notion that blacks should focus on economic advancement first, politics and civil rights later. Washington’s apparent willingness to accept social segregation, as long as blacks and whites worked together toward their common economic goals, won him a large white following. Roosevelt even invited him to dine in the White House, the first African American to ever receive this honor—an invitation that provoked howls of protest throughout the South. Washington’s private behavior, however, was often at odds with his public persona. Publicly he reassured whites that most blacks had little interest in demanding equality as long as they could prosper economically. Privately Washington helped fund court challenges to Plessy v. Ferguson and sent his own children to northern white colleges. Washington believed that American race relations would gradually improve. Methodist Bishop Henry McNeal Turner offered a competing vision, telling blacks to immigrate to Africa. Black journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett also disagreed with Washington. Rather than striving to prove their economic worth to whites, Wells-Barnett urged African Americans to use boycotts to win equal treatment from white-owned railroads. She also advocated armed resistance to lynch mobs. “A Winchester rifle should have a place of honour in every black home, and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give,” she declared. Wells-Barnett began lobbying for a federal anti-lynching law after a white mob in Memphis, Tennessee, lynched three friends of hers who had opened a grocery store that drew customers away

 from white businesses. With her life threatened Wells-Barnett moved to Chicago, where she worked with Jane Addams to prevent the segregation of city public schools and continued her anti-lynching campaign. The most powerful challenge to Washington’s vision came from the northern-born sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois, the first African American to attend Harvard University. Du Bois argued that individuals should receive the education that best suited them, regardless of their race. He emphasized that the African American community needed an educated elite of professionals and teachers, the so-called “Talented Tenth.” Economic progress was not possible without the right to vote, Du Bois contended, pointing out that discriminatory laws made it difficult for black sharecroppers or craftsmen to get ahead. Competing Visions: Seeking Racial Uplift offers more detail on the debate between Washington and Du Bois. In 1909, Du Bois joined with Wells-Barnett and Jane Addams, among others, to establish the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). This interracial civil rights organization demanded an immediate end to racial discrimination, beginning a decades-long struggle for racial justice that would eventually overturn Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s. Few white Progressives followed Addams’s lead in denouncing racial discrimination. Most northern Progressives remained content to let the South handle the “race problem” as it saw fit. They essentially chose social peace over racial justice, asserting that segregation would quell racial conflict. “Good fences make good neighbors,” declared southern Progressive leader Edgar Gardner Murphy.

REFORMING THE GOVERNMENT



Competing Visions
SEEKING RACIAL UPLIFT
In 1895, Booker T. Washington delivered his most famous speech, “The Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition Address,” before an audience that was composed mostly of Southern whites. The speech proposed a compromise that accepted social segregation in return for white support of blacks’ economic advancement. In 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois accused Washington of sending blacks down a path that ensured their permanent enslavement to white America. How does Washington take into account the racially hostile climate that prevailed in the South during the Progressive Era? Is Du Bois’s criticism of Washington accurate? In this passage from his 1895 “Atlanta Exposition Address,” Washington outlines his plan for racial progress and peaceful race relations. 
 In this excerpt from his book, The Souls of Black Folk (1903), Du Bois explains why Washington’s ideas would not work.

 Our greatest danger is that in the great leap from slavery to freedom we may overlook the fact that the masses of us are to live by the productions of our hands, and fail to keep in mind that we shall prosper in proportion as we learn to dignify and glorify common labour and put brains and skill into the common occupations of life…. No race can prosper till it learns that there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem. It is at the bottom of life we must begin, and not at the top. In all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress…. Nearly sixteen millions of hands will aid you in pulling the load upward, or they will pull against you the load downward. We shall constitute one-third and more of the ignorance and crime of the South, or one-third its intelligence and progress. The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremest folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than of artificial forcing. No race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long in any degree ostracized. It is important and right that all privileges of the law be ours, but it is vastly more important that we be prepared for the exercises of these privileges. The opportunity to earn a dollar in a factory just now is worth infinitely more than the opportunity to spend a dollar in an opera-house.

 Mr. Washington distinctly asks that black people give up, at least for the present, three things,— First, political power, Second, insistence on civil rights, Third, higher education of Negro youth, and concentrate all their energies on industrial education, the accumulation of wealth, and the conciliation of the South.… Is it possible, and probable, that nine millions of men can make effective progress in economic lines if they are deprived of political rights, made a servile caste, and allowed only the most meager chance for developing their exceptional men? If history and reason give any distinct answer to these questions, it is an emphatic No. And Mr. Washington thus faces the triple paradox of his career. 1. He is striving nobly to make Negro artisans business men and property-owners; but it is utterly impossible, under modern competitive methods, for workingmen and property-owners to defend their rights and exist without the right of suffrage. 2. He insists on thrift and self-respect, but at the same time counsels a silent submission to civic inferiority such as is bound to sap the manhood of any race in the long run. 3. He advocates common-school and industrial training, and depreciates institutions of higher learning; but neither the Negro common [elementary] schools, nor Tuskegee itself, could remain open a day were it not for teachers trained in Negro colleges, or trained by their graduates. His doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro’s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation.

Imperial America
The United States in the World,
1890–1914
 On February 15, 1898, a naval officer awoke President William McKinley in the middle of the night with the stunning news that the American battleship the Maine had exploded in Havana, Cuba, killing 266 of the 354 crew members. The explosion turned the battleship into a hunk of molten steel. This illustration depicted the blast propelling bodies and debris sky-high in Havana Harbor. Americans also read moving, first-hand accounts in the press, including one from survivor James R. Young. “I was feeling a bit glum,” Young recalled, “and in fact was so quiet that Lieutenant J. Hood came up and asked laughingly if I was asleep. I said, ‘No, I am on watch.’ Scarcely had I spoken when there came a dull, sullen roar. Would to God that I could blot out the sounds and the scenes that followed.” The United States and Spain had long been at odds over the question of independence for Cuba, then a Spanish colony. McKinley had sent the Maine to Havana to stop Spanish-instigated attacks on American-held property in Cuba. Many Americans suspected that Spanish saboteurs had blown up the ship to protest the U.S. incursion into Spanish territorial waters. The shocking images and accounts of the Maine explosion fueled public anger against Spain for its supposed attack on the U.S. Navy, creating a crisis between the two nations. An official investigation confirmed these widely held views, blaming the Maine explosion on a Spanish mine in the harbor. The exact cause of the blast, however, remained a mystery. Some experts now cite a spontaneous combustion from the coal stored alongside ammunition as the most likely culprit, a misfortune thirteen American naval vessels shared between 1895 and 1898. Others suggest that Cuban revolutionaries may have planted the explosives, expecting the United States to blame Spain and declare war. The Maine explosion ignited a four-month war between the United States and Spain in 1898. This “splendid little war,” as one official called it, ended with an overwhelming American victory. The overseas possessions that the United States gained from Spain, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, gave the nation a new formal colonial empire. The United States simultaneously constructed an informal economic empire throughout the Caribbean and East Asia. As the United States established itself as a budding world power, Americans offered conflicting visions of how the United States should behave outside its borders.

 hell with Spain!” Newspaper slogan urging war with Spain in the wake of the Maine explosion





 CHAPTER 19

IMPERIAL AMERICA: THE UNITED STATES IN THE WORLD, 1890–1914

Becoming a World Power
 Throughout the nineteenth century the Atlantic and Pacific oceans provided Americans with a sense of security and detachment from world affairs. By the 1880s, however, advancements in transportation and communication suddenly made the world seem smaller and more dangerous to Americans. Fear alone, though, did not explain Americans’ growing interest in venturing overseas. Americans looked outside their borders to find markets for U.S. goods and the raw materials needed to fuel a growing industrial economy. International recognition as a world power and spreading American values also appealed to the country’s growing sense of national greatness. C A

 In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Britain, France, and Spain had based their world prominence on far-flung colonial empires, places that they populated with settlers and soldiers to exploit economic resources and protect ocean trade routes. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, these settler communities launched a slew of successful revolutions that liberated colonies in North and South America from European rule. With the “old” colonial empires now defunct, European nations and Japan sought new ones. As Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Russia, the Netherlands, and Japan discovered vulnerable areas around the globe to colonize, they developed a new style of empire building. Imperialism, the late nineteenth-century term for colonizing foreign nations and lands, relied primarily on business, political, and military structures rather than settlers to rule colonized peoples and exploit their resources. Europe’s drive to create colonial empires in Africa and Asia in the late nineteenth century provided a model to either emulate or reject as the United States embarked on its campaign to become a world power. Besides exploiting colonies for economic gain, Europeans also drew satisfaction from fulfilling a self-imposed “civilizing” mission to spread Western culture and values to nonwhite and nonChristian populations throughout Africa and Asia. The drawbacks to empires, however, included the need to defend widely dispersed territories and suppress popular uprisings against colonial rule. Americans, therefore, developed conflicting visions from the lessons that they drew from the European experience. Some saw it as an inspiration; others, a cautionary tale.

 PORT

BECOMING A WORLD POWER

 As the map (19.1) indicates, the world situation in 1898 affected where the United States could hope to expand its influence. By the time the United States began exploring opportunities for expansion beyond the North American continent, Britain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands had already established colonial empires throughout Africa, East Asia, and South Asia. Great Britain exerted the greatest reach, making it the world’s preeminent imperial power. This left the Western Hemisphere and China as possibilities for U.S. colonial expansion.

The Impulse for Expansion
 Throughout American history territorial expansion played an important role in defining national identity and providing economic opportunity to Americans. In the early nineteenth century, Manifest Destiny, or the belief that Americans had a divine right to expand across North America, fueled expansion. Imbued with a sense of cultural and racial superiority over the indigenous peoples who inhabited these lands, Americans felt justified in taking away land from Indians. In their

 view, Native Americans had failed to make the land productive. The government relocated many Indian tribes onto reservations, where officials and missionaries embraced the goal of “civilizing” Indians by teaching them Western capitalist and Christian values (see Chapter 15). The same belief in Manifest Destiny, quest for economic opportunity, and ideas of racial superiority spurred interest in expanding American influence and trade overseas. Prominent businessmen, commercial farmers, and politicians urged the country to seek territory and markets outside the United States. In the 1890s, American companies and farmers sold 90 percent of their goods to other Americans. The time had come, these critics argued, to develop global markets and even colonies to ensure continued prosperity and economic opportunity at home. When the country suffered a devastating economic depression from 1893 to 1897, these calls crystallized into a resolve in some quarters to build a commercial and colonial empire overseas. Technological innovations also encouraged Americans to look beyond their borders. The laying of transatlantic telegraph cables increased both the speed and the volume of information sent throughout the world. The telegraph in many respects served as the Internet of the nineteenth century. Telegrams accelerated the exchange of diplomatic notes between governments, while dispatches from journalists overseas connected Americans on a daily basis to events around the world. If the telegraph hastened the flow of information, the advent of steam-powered ships dramatically reduced the time needed to move people and goods throughout the world. In his seminal 1890 work, The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660–1783, U.S. Navy Captain Alfred T. Mahan traced a direct correlation between a strong navy and world power. In the new age of steampowered battleships, the navy’s outdated wooden sailing ships, described by one congressman as “floating washtubs,” were ill-suited for advancing U.S. interests in the world. From 1890 onward, the United States built battleships to match its growing economic power and its expansionist ambitions, and it soon boasted the third most powerful navy in the world after Great Britain and Germany. In 1907, President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt sent the nation’s 16 battleships and four destroyers on a global tour to show off America’s

 How did technology and ideology fuel the nation’s expansionist impulses?

 world-class steam-powered navy, a trip that took two years to complete. Americans’ growing pride in their nation’s economic might and technological prowess encouraged the United States to seek international recognition as a world power. So did the ideological vision encapsulated by social Darwinism, an ideology that applied nineteenth-century naturalist Charles Darwin’s theory of biological evolution to human society through the notion of “survival of the fittest.” At home Americans often used social Darwinism to justify the dominance of the wealthy and powerful, considered “the fit,” over the poor and weak, or “the unfit.” These ideas also shaped how Americans viewed the world. In the social Darwinist view, the “racial superiority” of Northern Europeans explained why Britain, France, and Germany were world powers that easily colonized nonwhite peoples. To take its rightful place alongside, or even above, these world powers, the United States needed to demonstrate its fitness by entering the global competition for colonies. In making a case for expansion, the Congregational minister Josiah Strong linked older ideas of Manifest Destiny with this newer emphasis on survival of the fittest. “It seems to me that God, with infinite wisdom and skill, is training the AngloSaxon race to prevail” in the competition to control lands throughout the world, Strong wrote in his influential book, Our Country: Its Possible Future and Its Present Crisis (1885). In Strong’s view the United States risked losing its chance for global eminence if it failed to join the scramble for colonies underway worldwide. Driven to perfect democracy at home, many Progressives found the call to spread American values abroad appealing. Their reform impulse extended beyond U.S. borders to imagine a world freed from tyranny and injustice. In many respects the strong, activist government that Progressives helped construct at the turn of the century made it possible for the United States to extend its imperial reach during the Progressive Era. Progressives never spoke with one voice on domestic matters, and they also offered competing visions on expanding U.S. influence in the world. Progressives who opposed the nation’s overseas forays feared strengthening big business at the expense of exploited foreign peoples and American workers. They also believed that imperial ventures drew attention away from Progressive reform projects at home.

 Read the Document Josiah Strong, from Our Country (1885)

THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR



The Spanish-American War
 The first significant opportunity to expand U.S. influence overseas came when Cuba rose in revolt against Spanish rule. Extensive press coverage of Spanish atrocities and U.S. economic interests in Cuba prompted the nation to take note of this colonial struggle for independence. After a mysterious explosion sank the Maine and killed hundreds of American sailors, many Americans accused Spain of deliberately attacking the ship. Fearing that Congress might declare war on its own, a reluctant President William McKinley finally agreed to an armed intervention. The war with Spain was short, but the outcome was dramatic. The peace treaty with Spain granted the U.S. island possessions in the Caribbean and Pacific that became the territorial foundation for the new U.S. colonial empire.

The Growing Conflict
 with Spain In the early nineteenth century, when Spain’s other Western Hemisphere colonies successfully fought for independence, Cuba (and Puerto Rico) remained loyal to Spain. By 1868, however, oppressive Spanish rule provoked a rebellion in Cuba that ended ten years later with Spain’s pledge to grant the island increased autonomy. Failure to fulfill this promise, economic hardships inflicted by the 1890s depression, and continued agitation by exiled Cuban rebels living in the United States fanned the flames of rebellion again in 1895. By the time the second revolt began, the United States and Cuba had established strong commercial ties. Cuba sent over 90 percent of its exports to the United States, and American investment totaled nearly $50 million in Cuban sugar, cattle, mining, and tobacco industries. Spain paid a heavy price to maintain this symbol of its imperial past. Of the 278,000 Spanish troops sent to Cuba to suppress the revolt, nearly 50,000 had died of yellow fever or malaria by 1898, and an equal number lay too sick to fight. A much smaller force of 20,000–30,000 Cuban rebels drew on their knowledge of the terrain and support from civilians to fight a guerrilla war that ravaged tobacco and sugar plantations to deprive the Spanish government of revenue. Rebels purposefully steered clear of American-owned plantations to avoid antagonizing the United States. Cuban exiles in the United States drew appealing analogies between their struggle for independence and the American Revolution, highlighting the similar desire of Cuban and American colonists

 to free themselves from an exploitive ruler and establish democratic self-rule. If any uncertainty existed among the American public over which side they supported, Spanish General Valeriano Weyler’s infamous reconcentration policy ended those doubts. Through reconcentration Spanish soldiers tried to crush the Cuban rebellion by herding peasants off their farms into heavily fortified camps and then systematically destroying the crops that fed the rebel armies. This policy created a humanitarian crisis in Cuba, as famine and disease ravaged the civilian population, killing nearly 100,000 civilians. Outraged Americans denounced reconcentration as uncivilized and illegal warfare. The yellow press, tabloid journalists and newspapers that reported sensationalist stories with a strong emotional component, fueled public anger against the Spanish. This unique name for nineteenthcentury tabloid journalism derived from competing “Yellow Kid” comic strips in leading New York newspapers that portrayed the antics of a precocious boy living in the city’s tenements. Yellow journalism emerged in the 1880s when Joseph Pulitzer began using melodramatic, partly fictionalized stories to bolster sales of his newspaper, the New York World. After William Randolph Hearst took over the New York Journal in 1895, the two newspapers waged daily battles over who could print the most lurid tales. In the Cuban crisis both papers saw a chance to report the kinds of scandal-driven stories guaranteed to sell newspapers. Exiled Cuban rebels living in the United States provided a steady supply of atrocity stories (some fabricated, some true) to the yellow press, and the vivid illustrations accompanying these accounts helped the public visualize Spanish brutality.

 Why did Americans take an interest in the Cuban rebellion against Spain?



 CHAPTER 19

IMPERIAL AMERICA: THE UNITED STATES IN THE WORLD, 1890–1914

 The importance of illustrations to the yellow press became clear in a fabled exchange between Hearst and the artist Frederic Remington. Remington, already famous for his portraits of the American West, went to Cuba to draw illustrations for the New York Journal. Tiring of the rebellion’s slow pace, Remington told Hearst he was leaving Cuba. Hearst supposedly replied, “Please remain. You furnish the pictures, and I’ll furnish the war.” This exchange passed quickly into American folklore as proof of Hearst’s determination to use shocking images, real or staged, to provoke a war with Spain. No evidence exists, however, that Hearst ever wrote or sent this reply. Images as History: Atrocity Stories and Public Opinion examines how yellow press illustrations shaped American public opinion.

 Next the Maine exploded in Havana Harbor. After a month of press speculation about the cause of the explosion, an official naval investigation erroneously blamed a Spanish harbor mine for the disaster, rather than the real culprit: faulty ship design that caused an internal explosion, or perhaps sabotage by Cuban rebels who wanted the United States to declare war on Spain. In the weeks immediately following the sinking of the Maine, McKinley tried unsuccessfully to convince Spain to grant Cuba independence and to calm calls for war from Congress. “I have been through one war,” McKinley told a friend, referring to his service in the Civil War. “I have seen the dead piled up, and I do not want to see another.” For many other Americans, however, memories of brutal Civil War battles had faded. They enthusiastically viewed war as a manly adventure that would instill discipline and vigor in American men. The assistant secretary of the navy, Theodore Roosevelt, championed this competing view, writing to a friend in 1897, “I should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one.” With the yellow press clamoring for military action, With the Democrats championing war, RepubPresident McKinley turned to diplomacy to end the licans feared that McKinley’s resistance to fighting impasse over Cuba peacefully and repeatedly asked might hurt the party at the polls.

ATROCITY STORIES AND PUBLIC OPINION
Ever since the yellow press helped raise American ire against Spain in the years leading up to the Spanish-American War, Americans have pondered the power of the press in the United States. How much power do atrocity stories and pictures have to shape public opinion? Can the press convince the public to fight a war? On February 12, 1897, the New York Journal published a story by Richard Harding Davis about a young Cuban woman whom Spanish authorities had expelled for carrying secret messages between Cuban rebels. Davis reported that “Spanish officers” followed Clemencia Arango and her companions onto an American ship. The Spanish officers “demanded that a cabin should be furnished to them to which the girls might be taken, and they were then undressed and searched” for messages to exiled Cuban rebels living in the United States. Frederic Remington’s illustration “Spaniards Search Women on American Steamers” accompanied Davis’s story. The paper next took up the cause of Evangelina Cisneros. Sentenced to 20 years in prison for trying to lure a Spanish officer into a rebel death trap, Cisneros was awaiting deportation to an African penal colony. According to the New York Journal, her only crime was calling for help from nearby Cuban rebels to stop a Spanish officer, “a beast in uniform,” from raping her. On October 10, 1897, the paper triumphantly announced that a New York Journal reporter had helped Cisneros break out of jail and sail to the United States. The yellow press presented Clemencia and Evangelina as symbols for the virtuous and victimized Cuban people, fueling public sympathy for the Cuban rebellion.

 Congress complied. On April 24, 1898, however, Spain declared war on the United States. The next day Congress responded with its own declaration of war, dating it retroactively to April 21, 1898. To underscore the nation’s altruistic motives, Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller added an amendment to the war resolutions that disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba. The Teller Amendment (1898) promised “to leave the government and control of the [Cuban] Island to its people” at the end of the Spanish-American War. Congress made no such promise to other colonized peoples under Spanish control in the Caribbean and Pacific.

 rebellion against Spain. At first the Filipino rebels, who controlled much of the interior, welcomed the Americans as liberators. “I have studied the Constitution of the United States, and I find in it no authority for colonies and I have no fear,” rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo told one American general. Time would prove him wrong. Besides securing a foothold in the Philippines, the McKinley administration also used the war against Spain as a pretext for settling the festering question of annexing Hawaii that had divided Americans for the past six years. Americans had a long history of involvement in Hawaiian affairs.

 America’s victory in the Spanish-American War, which lasted from April to August 1898, paved the way for U.S. territorial expansion in the Caribbean and Pacific. One week after the war began, Commodore George Dewey sailed into Manila Harbor, in the Spanish colony of the Philippines, (19.2) and destroyed the Spanish Pacific fleet. Why, Americans wondered, did the navy fight the first battle to liberate Cuba halfway around the world in the Philippines, an archipelago of 7,000 islands in the Pacific Ocean?

THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR

 By the 1880s, American-owned sugar plantations dominated the Hawaiian economy, American missionaries had waged a successful campaign to eradicate native religions, and the U.S. Navy had established a permanent base at Pearl Harbor on the island of Oahu. Responding to popular discontent over the erosion of native Hawaiians’ economic standing and cultural traditions, Queen Liliuokalani promised to curtail U.S. dominance, when she assumed the throne in 1891. In 1893, however, American businessmen and missionaries working on the islands (representing 5 percent of the islands’ population) overthrew Queen Liliuokalani. U.S. Marines sent ashore from a nearby warship, ostensibly to protect American property, ensured the revolution’s success. Thousands of Hawaiians took to the streets to protest the coup, to no avail. The new Hawaiian republic’s immediate request for annexation by the United States proved controversial, however. Disavowing the role that U.S. officials had played in the coup, President Grover Cleveland apologized to the Queen and demanded her restoration to the throne. The new Hawaiian government ignored Cleveland’s request, choosing



 instead to renew its appeal when the pro-annexation McKinley became president five years later. McKinley believed that acquiring Hawaii would foster U.S. commercial interests in the Pacific. This time the Hawaiian Patriotic League blocked a formal U.S. takeover by presenting the Senate with a 556-page anti-annexation petition signed by over half of native-born Hawaiians. Faced with Hawaiians’ overwhelming opposition to annexation, the Senate voted the measure down in 1897. A year later, however, with the Spanish-American War underway, Congress reversed course. Supporters of annexation argued that U.S. ships headed to the Philippines needed guaranteed access to the naval base in Pearl Harbor. Putting its own strategic and economic needs ahead of Hawaiians’ desire to remain independent, the United States assumed sovereignty over Hawaii on July 7, 1898. Without enough votes in the Senate to approve a formal annexation treaty, McKinley settled for a congressional joint resolution that authorizied annexation with a majority vote. The president appointed a territorial governor to head the Hawaiian government, and in 1900, Congress granted Hawaiians the right to elect a territorial legislature.

19.3 Charge
 up the San Juan Heights, 1898 This painting depicted a horseback charge up the San Juan Heights that was glorious and heroic, with flags flying and no casualties. In reality, the soldiers advanced slowly on foot to reach the crest.

IMPERIAL AMERICA: THE UNITED STATES IN THE WORLD, 1890–1914

 Meanwhile military planners focused on defeating the Spanish in Cuba. The accompanying map, “Spanish-American War, 1898” (19.2) illustrates how the navy immediately blockaded Cuba, trapping the Spanish Atlantic Fleet in Santiago. America’s small peacetime army, however, was woefully unprepared to train and equip the thousands of volunteers enlisting throughout the country. Theodore Roosevelt resigned as assistant secretary of the navy and formed the First U.S. Volunteer Calvary by recruiting Americans from wildly diverse backgrounds. Many of the recruits had personal connections to Colonel Roosevelt, a result of his eclectic lifestyle that included attending Harvard, hunting expeditions in the West, and a stint as police commissioner in New York City. Dubbed the Rough Riders, this collection of cowboys, Ivy League athletes, policemen, and Pawnee scouts was one of the few volunteer units that actually fought in the war. Although American forces swelled from 28,000 to 275,000, most never left the United States. On June 22, 17,000 U.S. troops landed in Cuba to join Cuban rebels on a slow march through heavy jungle to the port of Santiago, which sheltered the

 bulk of the Spanish navy and army. Hidden Spanish sharpshooters harassed U.S. soldiers as they made their way to the San Juan Heights, the hills that encircled Santiago. On July 1, the Americans, under the command of General William Shafter, attacked 750 Spanish soldiers along the San Juan Heights. “I have seen many illustrations and pictures of this charge on the San Juan hills, but none of them seem to show it just as I remember it,” recalled journalist Richard Harding Davis, who watched the battle from the sidelines as the Americans walked up the hill. Like most illustrations of the battle seen in newspapers at the time, this painting (19.3) erroneously shows waves of eager American soldiers advancing on horseback with the flag flying, suggesting “an invincible overpowering weight of numbers,” Davis noted. Yet, he continued, “I think the thing which impressed one the most, when our men started [walking] from cover, was that they were so few. It almost seemed as if someone had made an awful and terrible mistake. One’s instinct was to call to them to come back.” Roosevelt led the Rough Riders to the top of the San Juan Heights, a feat that garnered him and the unit acclaim. They stood alongside African American

 troops from the Ninth and Tenth Calvary who had actually reached the top first, which Roosevelt and the mainstream media failed to mention when celebrating the victory. The battle provided another opportunity for the yellow press to whip up war fervor on the home front. Responding to (false) rumors that Spanish soldiers had mutilated the corpses of American servicemen killed during the clash, a Judge magazine cover (19.4) pictured a Spaniard drenched in the blood of American soldiers who lay at his feet. In one hand the ape-like figure holds the bloody knife responsible for the atrocity. His other hand rests on the gravestone of U.S. sailors whom he allegedly killed by exploding the Maine. This image of a brute that trampled on the American flag reinforced yellow press portrayals of Spain as a beast that the United States needed to subdue. The caricature also fed into racist notions of white supremacy—just like African Americans at home, and soon the Filipinos abroad, the dark-skinned Spanish posed a threat to the civilized world. In future conflicts American propaganda used strikingly similar images to arouse passionate hatred of the nation’s German and Japanese enemies. Legendary accounts attributed the American success in charging up the San Juan Heights to heroic frontal charges; in fact, the Americans’ three Gatling machine guns made the decisive difference. Believing his exhausted troops could go no farther after reaching the top, General Shafter decided to lay siege to Santiago instead of attacking the city directly. While American troops encircled the city atop the surrounding hills, U.S. ships blocked the port, thus trapping the bulk of the Spanish navy and army in Santiago. When the Spanish fleet made a dash to leave on July 3, American ships sank or beached every Spanish vessel. In both Manila and Santiago, the newly modernized U.S. navy outclassed the decrepit Spanish fleet, scoring easy, one-sided victories. On July 17, the Spanish surrendered the city and Cuba to the Americans. After defeating the Spanish in Cuba, U.S. forces landed in Puerto Rico, also a Caribbean Spanish colony, where they encountered only token opposition. American troops fought one more battle to take Manila on August 13, having not yet received word that the war between the United States and Spain had ended the day before. The war concluded on a sour note, however. With limited understanding of how malaria, yellow fever, and typhoid spread, Army physicians could not stop these diseases from ravaging

 the troops that occupied Cuba during the summer of 1898. Victory celebrations among U.S. troops soon gave way to panic, when hundreds of soldiers fell ill and healthy young men became hollow-eyed, walking skeletons. It was “a heartbreaking sight” to see her husband, a yellow fever victim whose weight had dropped from 165 pounds to 89 pounds, Grace Paulding recalled. He needed a year’s nursing before he could work again. Despairing over the lack of qualified hospital attendants, the surgeon general turned in desperation to the female nurses offering their services to the military. Eventually, 1,500 professional and Red Cross female nurses worked side by side with army doctors at home and overseas. Overall the Americans counted 385 officers and soldiers killed in combat (excluding those killed on the Maine), and nearly 2,000 deaths from disease. The peace treaty, signed on December 10, 1898, set the terms of the U.S. victory. In the Treaty of Paris, Spain relinquished its claim to Cuba, and the United States received Puerto Rico

 in the Caribbean and Guam, the largest of the Mariana Islands, in the Pacific. In return for $20 million, Spain also ceded the Philippines to the United States. How this land transfer would affect the political future of the Philippines remained in doubt. Did the United States intend to grant the Philippines independence or keep it as a colony? Americans soon offered competing visions on how to resolve this question. Despite the idealistic guarantees given in the Teller Amendment, Cuba became an independent nation in name only. The United States linked the withdrawal of American occupation troops to concessions from Cuba. The Platt Amendment (1901) required Cuba to give the United States the right to maintain a naval base at Guantánamo Bay and to intervene militarily to protect “life, property, and individual liberty.” Besides granting the United States a privileged trading relationship, the Cuban government also needed permission from the United States before entering into treaties with other nations. The former Spanish colony essentially became a U.S. protectorate, a relationship in which a superior power assumes authority over a weaker country or territory to protect it from invasion and dominate its affairs. The United States took advantage

 of these rights and occupied Cuba numerous times until Congress repealed the Platt Amendment in 1934. The United States continues to maintain a naval base at Guantánamo Bay, using it to jail and interrogate prisoners captured during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that began in 2001 and 2003, respectively. In his successful 1900 reelection bid against Democrat William Jennings Bryan, McKinley made a strong connection between events at home and abroad. One campaign poster (19.5) featured portraits of the president and his war hero running mate, Theodore Roosevelt. The individual images reminded Americans of Cuban suffering under Spanish rule and blamed the devastating depression of the 1890s on the Democrats. The poster then noted that domestic prosperity returned and social justice prevailed overseas, once the United States led by the Republicans stepped out into the world. The claim that American intervention improved life for both U.S. and world citizens became a powerful argument in favor of constructing an American empire. Bryan focused his campaign on the evils of imperialism, but McKinley carried the election with a “full dinner pail” slogan that emphasized restored prosperity.

CREATING AN AMERICAN EMPIRE



Creating an American Empire
 The Senate’s razor-thin ratification of the Treaty of Paris, with just two votes to spare, ignited a strident internal debate over whether the United States should annex or free the Philippines. In the wake of ratification, both imperialists and anti-imperialists offered competing economic, political, and racial arguments about the wisdom of colonizing the Philippines. Unwilling to leave their fate in the hands of American politicians, Filipinos revolted against U.S. forces. The rebellion soon evolved into a vicious all-out war with high casualties on both sides.

 The Debate over Colonies

 countries, the league asked? Instead of economic gains anti-imperialists foresaw decades of expenses to maintain colonial outposts. Debate also centered on the ability of the Filipinos to govern themselves. On the imperialist side, McKinley adopted a strong paternalistic stance, arguing that “We could not leave them to themselves—they were unfit for self-government, and they would soon have anarchy and misrule worse then Spain’s was.” Caricatures helped imperialists

 In a risky strategic move that divided Democrats, party leader William Jennings Bryan had urged anti-imperialist Democratic senators to support ratification of the Treaty of Paris, so that the United States could grant the Philippines independence, once Spain relinquished control. But after the Senate had ratified the treaty, the majority of Republicans fought to keep the Philippines as a colony. Maps in the popular press helped Americans visualize the strategic and commercial importance of the nation’s new island possessions. The “Map of the China Seas … Under the National Flags, 1898” (19.6), published in Harper’s Weekly, portrayed key parts of the imperialist argument for building an American empire in East Asia. By showing the proximity of the Philippines to European colonial possessions in East Asia, the map reinforced McKinley’s claim that another European power would colonize the islands if the United States withdrew. The map also illustrated the imperialist slogan, “trade follows the flag.” The closeness of the Philippines to China, for example, underscored the usefulness of the colony for developing a strong trading relationship between the United States and China. A competing economic argument came from the Anti-Imperialist League, an organization that attracted a broad cross-section of politicians, Progressive reformers, writers, industrialists, and labor activists who opposed overseas colonial expansion.

 Uncle Sam protects a Filipino child from ignorance and crime, portrayed as a savage black nurse, by feeding him education and civilization.

 publicize their case, incorporating popularly accepted notions of Americans’ racial and moral superiority to so-called uncivilized peoples. This political cartoon (19.7) contained strong racial undertones, depicting Uncle Sam as a nurturing white father who protects the wailing savage Filipino child from Independence (pictured as a depraved mammylike figure) and from anti-imperialists like Senator George Hoar, a Republican from Massachusetts. Most Filipinos had converted to Catholicism under three centuries of Spanish rule, a religion that many Americans distrusted. Besides spreading AngloSaxon cultural and political values, McKinley called upon Americans to take control of Filipinos’ spiritual lives by turning them into Protestants.

 How did white Americans’ racial views influence the debate over colonizing the Philippines?

 Anti-imperialists viewed the question of governing the Filipinos differently. They claimed that subjugating the Philippines to imperial rule violated the principles of representative government outlined in the Constitution. Their slogan, “the Constitution follows the flag,” conveyed their belief that Congress could not withhold constitutional rights, including the right to self-government, from colonial subjects. In the 1900–1904 Insular Cases, the Supreme Court affirmed Congress’s authority to govern the Philippines, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico as colonies. The Court upheld the acquisition of colonies as constitutional and ruled that colonial populations did not become American citizens until the United States incorporated the colonies as territories. The justices offered a more mixed response on the question of extending constitutional rights to colonial subjects. In these cases the Court denied colonial subjects some constitutional protections, such as procedural rights that guaranteed a fair trial, but held that Congress could not abridge the “natural rights” of free speech and religion. Recognition of these limited rights did not appease anti-imperialists, however. “Yes, as near as I can make out the Constitution follows the flag—but doesn’t quite catch up with it,” quipped Secretary of War Elihu Root. In 1900, Congress granted inhabitants of Hawaii and Alaska American citizenship, making them eligible for full protection under the Bill of Rights. Puerto Ricans had to wait until 1917 and residents of Guam until 1952. Filipinos never held American citizenship. This 1899 editorial cartoon (19.8) by Louis Dalrymple, School Begins. Uncle Sam (to his new class in Civilization) encapsulated the debate between imperialists and anti-imperialists over whether the United States needed the consent of colonized peoples to govern them. Appearing in Puck, a magazine that specialized in political satire, the cartoon portrays Uncle Sam as an annoyed teacher pointing sternly at frightened black pupils representing the Philippines, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. Getting ready to teach from a book entitled U.S.— First Lessons in Self Government, the teacher tells the students that they have to “learn these lessons

Or is he referring to the African American boy washing windows, the Indian sitting in the corner reading a book upside down, or the Chinese child refused entry into the classroom—all previous subjects of missionary zeal? The satirical signs on the wall trumpet the imperialist emphasis on precedents—in this case the willingness of Britain and the Union to govern colonies and the former Confederacy, respectively, without their consent. The debate between imperialists and anti-imperialists is explored further in Competing Visions: Annexing the Philippines (page 576). In 1899, the British poet Rudyard Kipling entered the American debate over colonizing the Philippines when the popular magazine McClure’s published his poem, “The White Man’s Burden—The United

 States and the Philippine Islands.” Kipling pictured Americans embracing “the white man’s burden,” the Anglo-Saxon quest to better the lives of so-called racially inferior peoples by spreading Western economic, cultural, and spiritual values and institutions. Black newspapers offered a competing vision, publishing an array of poems and editorials that detailed “the black man’s burden” of living in a country that accepted Jim Crow practices in the South.

 The PhilippineAmerican War On June 12, 1898, the Filipino leader Emilio Aguinaldo declared the Philippines independent of Spain. In January, 1899, he formed a provisional government that concentrated power in the hands of elites from the main island of Luzon to rule the ethnically and religiously diverse societies that inhabited the archipelago.

Competing Visions
ANNEXING THE PHILIPPINES
Debate over annexing the Philippines did not follow party lines, as revealed in the differing views of two leading Republicans, Carl Schurz, a former secretary of the interior and senator from Missouri and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts. Schurz and Lodge both evoked the nation’s previous expansionist drives to strengthen their arguments, offering historical analogies between the nation’s prior success acquiring and absorbing new territories and the present dilemma over the Philippines. Did annexing the Philippines represent a continuation or break with past expansionist methods and policies? In this 1899 anti-annexation speech, Carl Schurz argued that the past offered no guide to the present crisis. 
 In 1900, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge saw strong continuities between the past and present in urging for annexation of the Philippines.

 Has not the career of the Republic almost from its very beginning been one of territorial expansion? Has it not acquired Louisiana, Florida, Texas, the vast countries that came to us through the Mexican war and Alaska, and has it not digested them well?... If the Republic could digest the old, why not the new? What is the difference?...

 It has been stated over and over again that we have done great wrong in taking these islands without the consent of the governed, from which, according to American principles, all just government derives its powers. The consent of the governed! It is a fair phrase and runs trippingly upon the tongue, but I have observed a great lack of definite meaning in those who use it most … What do we mean by the “consent of the governed?” We quote it from the Declaration of Independence. What did Jefferson mean by the phrase? … The Declaration of Independence was the announcement of the existence of a new revolutionary government upon American soil. Upon whose consent did it rest? Was it upon that of all the people of the colonies duly expressed. Most assuredly not. In the first place we must throw out all negroes and persons of African descent, who formed about one quarter of the population, and who were not consulted at all as to the proposed change of government …. Were women included in the word “governed?” They certainly were not permitted by voice or vote to express an opinion on this momentous question. They must, therefore, be excluded…. Did the revolutionary government rest on the consent of all the white males in the colonies? Most assuredly not. There was the usual age limitation … Everywhere the suffrage was limited, generally by property qualifications, sometimes by other restrictions… … Under the guidance of Thomas Jefferson … we took Louisiana without the consent of the governed, and ruled it without their consent so long as we saw fit. Who is there to-day who will stand up and say that Thomas Jefferson did not do well and rightly when he bought Louisiana? … Then came the Mexican war, and by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo we received a great cession of territory from Mexico, including all the California coast … There were many Mexicans living within the ceded territory. We never asked their consent….

 1. All the former acquisitions were on this continent and, excepting Alaska, contiguous to our borders. 2. They were situated, not in tropical, but in the temperate zone, where democratic institutions thrive and where our people could migrate in mass. 3. They were but very thinly peopled in fact, without any population that would have been in the way of new settlements. 4. They could be organized as territories in the usual manner, with the expectation that they would presently come into the Union as self-governing States with populations substantially homogeneous to our own. 5. They did not require a material increase of our Army and Navy, either for their subjection to our rule or for their defense against any probable foreign attack provoked by their being in our possession.

 defected to the Filipino army shortly after arriving in the Philippines. He was one of five black soldiers who deserted to the other side. Fagan’s reputation grew to mythic proportions as he eluded capture and organized guerilla raids on his former comrades-in-arms. Emilio Aguinaldo was not so fortunate. In March 1901, a prisoner revealed the location of Aguinaldo’s hideaway 50 miles into the jungle. To capture Aguinaldo, General Frederick Funston assembled a group of Macabebe scouts, a Philippine ethnic group that had traditionally served Spain and now aided the United States. Posing as reinforcements, the Macabebe soldiers entered Aguinaldo’s camp accompanied by five American soldiers pretending to be prisoners. The group arrived as a birthday celebration for Aguinaldo was underway, and when the infiltrators reached for their weapons, Aguinaldo’s guards assumed they were preparing to fire an honor salute. Instead the Macabebe scouts began shooting, the signal for the rest of Funston’s men, who were waiting on the perimeter, to invade the camp. Aguinaldo’s guards fled in panic, leaving him in the hands of the Americans. A chastened Aguinaldo called on his followers to lay down their arms and accept U.S. rule. One by one his generals surrendered, and the war ground to a halt. Theodore Roosevelt, who became president after McKinley’s 1901 assassination (see Chapter 18), declared the war over on July 4, 1902. American troops nonetheless remained in the

 Philippines for another 11 years to subdue separate revolts by Muslim Moro tribal leaders in remote islands. In 1900, William Howard Taft became the first civilian governor general of the Philippines. When the war ended, he expanded efforts to build roads and schools and improve sanitation. Taft also convinced Congress to purchase church-held land from the Vatican, which the colonial administration then helped peasants buy with low-cost mortgages. To put the debate over annexing the Philippines to rest, the government sponsored exhibits at the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair that championed the imperialist vision of colonization. In the Philippine Reservation display, visitors walked through six reconstructed Filipino villages and watched partially clothed members of remote Filipino tribes demonstrate native practices that included feasts of dog and headhunting. By inviting tribes with the most exotic customs to participate, organizers intended to juxtapose the primitiveness of Filipino culture with the civilizing influence of U.S. rule. Photographs captured the U.S.-sponsored effort to provide illiterate, nearly naked Filipinos with a Western education. In this image (19.9) an educated Filipina instructor wearing a traditional butterfly dress (representing the positive aspects of modernization) teaches her “uncivilized” pupils before a gallery of onlookers who appear unconcerned about putting these people on display as a tourist attraction. Instead Americans who talked with villagers at the exhibit quickly “disabused themselves of any impression that the natives could take care of themselves,” one newspaper reported. Other displays at the World’s Fair championed America’s scientific, economic, and cultural achievements. Collectively these exhibits suggested that as a leading nation in the civilized world, the United States had the duty and right to become a colonial power.

AMERICA AND EAST ASIA



America and East Asia
 The United States fought a war of conquest in the Philippines to secure an independent trade route to East Asia only to discover that the coveted China market was in danger of disappearing. To prevent the world’s leading powers from carving China up into formal colonies, the United States turned to diplomacy, convincing these nations to keep Chinese trade open to all. Americans also viewed their nation’s role in negotiating an end to the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 as a sign of America’s growing world stature. Not all international conflicts in this period originated outside the United States, however. In 1907, President Roosevelt used diplomacy to smooth over the crisis that arose in Japanese-American relations when California initiated a campaign to segregate and ban Japanese immigrants. American access to these potential customers, however, appeared in danger of evaporating at the Throughout the nineteenth century China granted turn of the century.

 the militants’ martial arts training. When thousands of Boxers began roaming the countryside, attacking foreigners, an international force of ground troops and battleships assembled to crush the insurgency. Tensions escalated dramatically when the Boxers besieged foreign diplomats and businessmen in Beijing (called Peking by Westerners). Throughout the crisis Secretary Hay worked frantically to prevent the involved nations from using the Boxer Rebellion as an excuse to colonize China. In a second round of Open Door Notes, Hay asked the same nations that had accepted the first Open Door Notes to respect the “territorial and administrative integrity” of China. To avoid negative responses, Hay did not ask for a formal reply to his request. To further protect American missionary and economic interests in China (pictured in 19.10), McKinley sent 2,500 U.S. soldiers to join a

By January 1900, Hay reported that all nations with a sphere of influence in China had agreed to abide by these terms. For the time being the allure of trading opportunities in the spheres of others outweighed the desire for fullfledged colonies in China. Hay neglected to consult China in his diplomatic negotiations. Angry over the humiliating foreign domination, Chinese militants vowed to restore Chinese sovereignty over its land and economy. In 1900, a secret society called the Righteous and Harmonious Fists initiated a terrorist campaign to drive the “foreign devils” out of China, a crusade that members of the Chinese imperial government secretly funded. Westerners called this group the Boxers because of the clenched fist they adopted as their emblem and

 multinational force in rescuing the foreigners and ending the Boxer Rebellion. As punishment for the imperial government’s support of the Boxers, the international coalition demanded $333 million in indemnities from China. The United States used its share to provide scholarships for Chinese students studying at American universities.

 Relations with Japan Despite the Open Door Policy, the competition for rights to control railroads, mines, and ports in China continued, and within a few years, Japan and Russia fought to control China’s resource-rich Manchurian province and the Korean peninsula. The RussoJapanese War of 1904–1905 threatened to topple the balance of power that the United States was trying to maintain in China. Concerned that an overwhelming Japanese victory “may possibly mean a struggle between them and us in the future,” President Roosevelt offered to negotiate a peace settlement. In August 1905, a financially exhausted Japan and a militarily defeated Russia came to the peace table in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Many Americans delighted at the sight of their president mediating a conflict between two world powers. In 1906, Roosevelt received the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending the Russo-Japanese War. But Roosevelt soon faced the possibility of losing the Japanese friendship he had worked so hard to protect. In 1905, California legislators, newspapers, and labor leaders mounted a strident campaign to halt Japanese immigration. Japanese and Korean exclusion leagues urged Congress to follow the precedent of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and prohibit Asians from entering the nation. These groups denounced Asians as a degenerative element that threatened American culture and unfairly competed for jobs that rightfully belonged to native-born white workers. California legislators lumped all Asians together when they spoke about defending the nation from the “Yellow Peril,” but Roosevelt understood the vast difference between a weak, humiliated China and a powerful, proud Japan. “If we show that we regard the Japanese as an inferior and alien race, and try to treat them as we have treated the Chinese; and if at the same time we fail to keep our navy at the highest point of efficiency and size—then we shall invite disaster,” Roosevelt wrote privately. In 1906, the San Francisco Board of Education decided to send Japanese, Chinese, and Korean children to one set of segregated schools. With Japan bristling at



 the insult of Americans lumping Japanese together with Asian peoples whom they viewed as inferior to themselves, Roosevelt intervened to control the damage to U.S.-Japanese relations. California agreed to revoke the segregation order in return for an end to Japanese immigration, but Hawaiian sugar planters protested that they needed Japanese workers. As a compromise Roosevelt issued an executive order that allowed Japanese workers into Hawaii. The president then negotiated a reduction in Japanese immigration to the mainland. In the Gentlemen’s Agreement (1907–1908), Japan agreed to deny passports to Japanese workers intending to immigrate to the United States. This informal agreement helped Japan escape the indignity of joining China as the only other nation legally banned from sending immigrant workers to the United States.

Angel Island
 In the Gentlemen’s Agreement Japan reserved the right to issue passports to professionals and the relatives of Japanese migrants or citizens already living in the United States. Until the United States closed this loophole in 1921, Japan gave passports to Japanese wives so they could join their husbands in the United States. Americans called these women “picture brides” because couples often exchanged photos of each other through a matchmaker who arranged long-distance marriages for Japanese men residing in the United States. The 300–500 Japanese “picture brides” who immigrated annually to the United States met their new husbands for the first time when they arrived. Chinese immigration also surged during this period. The 1906 earthquake in San Francisco destroyed the city’s birth records and without any way to prove otherwise, hundreds of Chinese men successfully claimed that they were American-born. As citizens they asserted their right to bring their families to the United States. Many brought in “paper sons,” boys whose families paid a fee to Chinese men already in the United States to fraudulently claim to be their fathers. In 1910, U.S. authorities opened up an immigration processing station on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay to verify the identities of Japanese and Chinese immigrants claiming the right to enter the United States. Chinese “paper sons” endured long periods of detention on Angel Island while authorities investigated their background. Before leaving China “paper sons” memorized details about their “fathers,” including descriptions of relatives, houses, and key events in a family’s history. Once these men arrived

 at Angel Island, inspectors quizzed sons and fathers separately and refused entry to those whose answers failed to match. Chinese men detained on Angel Island sometimes passed the time by etching poetry onto the barrack walls, including one anonymous poet who expressed his angst by writing, “who was to know two streams of tears would flow upon arriving here?” In 1919, California politicians reignited their campaign against the Japanese, making it illegal for Japanese immigrants to own property. Naturalization laws allowed only people of white or African ancestry to become citizens, preventing Japanese immigrants from seeking U.S. citizenship to circumvent these restrictions. In Takao Ozawa v. United States (1922), the Supreme Court held that Japanese immigrants were indeed ineligible for citizenship because they were not white.

 brides bore children who were U.S. citizens, and therefore eligible to own property, did not escape the notice of those campaigning for a ban on Japanese property ownership. Senator James D. Phelan, a California Democrat, led the campaign to stop admitting picture brides to the United States, ominously predicting that a booming birthrate among Japanese immigrants would lead to Japanese dominance of California agriculture. To garner publicity for their anti-Japanese crusade, a congressional delegation traveled to Angel Island in 1920. The legislators invited news photographers to take photos (19.11) as they sternly lectured a group of bewildered, frightened young women, dressed in their best clothes to meet their new husbands. Fearful that rising anti-Japanese prejudice might lead to a Japanese exclusion law, Japan agreed to stop issuing passports to picture brides in 1921. Congress banned all immigration from Asia in 1924 (see Chapter 21).

AMERICA AND EAST ASIA



Choices and Consequences
THE LEGAL CONSTRUCTION OF “WHITENESS”
Takao Ozawa was a Japanese immigrant who lived in California and Hawaii for 28 years before he applied to become a citizen of the United States. Aware that naturalization laws allowed only Caucasians and people of African ancestry to become citizens, Ozawa argued that he was white. He emphasized his complete assimilation into American society and the lightness of his skin. When the Supreme Court heard his case in 1922, the justices faced four options about how to define “whiteness.” 
Choices




 Differing physical features divided the human species into white, black, and yellow races.



 Skin color established racial identity.



Whiteness was a
 socially constructed notion with no scientific basis.



 Assimilating into American culture made one “white.”

Decision
 The Court rejected Ozawa’s contention that skin pigmentation signified whiteness and his claim of complete assimilation. In a unanimous decision the justices ruled that “the words ‘white person’ are synonymous with the words ‘a person of Caucasian race.’” This decision accepted contemporary anthropologists’ assertions that measurements of facial features provided scientific evidence to classify the Japanese as members of the “Mongolian race.”

Consequences


Measurement of the Head and Face, 1883


 Within three months the court unanimously reversed its reasoning, deciding instead that whiteness was a socially, not scientifically, constructed category. When Indian immigrant Bhagat Singh Thind applied for citizenship, he argued that anthropologists categorized Asian Indians as Caucasians. In rejecting Thind’s claim of whiteness, the Supreme Court now ruled that “the words ‘free white persons’ are words of common speech, to be interpreted in accordance with the understanding of the common man.” Deciding who was legally white now depended on the whims of the larger culture, not the claims of scientists.

Continuing Controversies
 What determines racial identity? Well into the twentieth century, many Americans continued to believe that biologically based racial differences existed, even within the Caucasian race. In the 1920s, the United States severely curtailed immigration from eastern and southern Europe, viewing northern Europeans as racially superior (see Chapter 21). The fear that light-skinned blacks were “passing” as whites caused many Southern states to bar individuals with any African ancestry, the so-called “one-drop” of blood rule, from using “whites-only” facilities. The view of racial identity as a social construct also drew adherents. Radical black civil rights leaders tried to cultivate a racial identity based on African Americans’ cultural distinctiveness, while others sought a color-blind society that did away with racial identities completely.

 What different methods have Americans used to define racial identity?



 CHAPTER 19

IMPERIAL AMERICA: THE UNITED STATES IN THE WORLD, 1890–1914

 In America’s Backyard Establishing a U.S. presence and maintaining favorable relations in East Asia became key aims of American foreign policy at the turn of the century. Americans also, however, explored opportunities to expand closer to home. The government focused on constructing a canal through Central America to facilitate U.S. trade with China and better protect the nation’s coastlines. Earlier transportation breakthroughs such as the Erie Canal, National Road, and transcontinental railroad quickened the movement of people and goods and helped the United States expand across the continent. The Panama Canal secured U.S. dominance of the Caribbean, and the government resolved to keep foreign powers out of the region.

The Panama Canal
 At the end of the nineteenth century, American canal advocates emphasized increased trade and better defense as reasons for building the Panama Canal, a manmade waterway through Panama completed in 1914 to link the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The canal project received a boost when one of its strongest supporters, Theodore Roosevelt, became president in 1901. Roosevelt took up the canal project immediately. “No single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this continent is of such consequence to the American people,” he told Congress the first time he addressed the legislators. Roosevelt intended to take up where Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French mastermind who built the 1869 Suez Canal in Egypt that linked the Mediterranean and Red Seas, had left off. In the 1880s, de Lesseps had begun building a canal through Panama (then part of Colombia). Battling mudslides, earthquakes, and disease, de Lesseps eventually abandoned the project and sold his concession from the Colombian government to the New Panama Canal Company, a French company headed by Philippe Bunau-Varilla, a longtime engineer on the project. In 1902, the United States offered the New Panama Canal Company $40 million for its concession and assets, a sum that Bunau-Varilla eagerly accepted. Colombia, however, rejected Roosevelt’s offer of $10 million to secure the rights to maintain a U.S.-controlled canal in Panama indefinitely. The New Panama Canal Company’s concession expired in 1904, and by stalling, Colombia expected to pocket the $40 million earmarked for the company. “Those contemptible little creatures in Bogotá [the capital of Colombia] ought to understand how much they are jeopardizing things and imperiling their

 own future,” Roosevelt wrote in frustration to Secretary of State John Hay. In 1903, Panama revolted against Colombia. The timing was not coincidental. Fearing it would lose everything, the New Panama Canal Company encouraged and financed the rebellion by Panamanian business and political elites who did not want to share revenue from the projected canal with the rest of Colombia. Bunau-Varilla not only set the date for the revolution but also provided its leader, Manuel Guerrero Amador, with money, defense plans, a declaration of independence, and even a flag. Roosevelt never gave Bunau-Varilla a direct promise of U.S. support but, the president later recalled, it was Bunau-Varilla’s “business to find out what he thought our Government would do . . . in fact, he would have been a very dull man had he been unable to make such a guess.” Once the Panamanian revolt began, Roosevelt ensured that events favored the United States. The mountainous terrain separating the rest of Colombia from Panama forced Colombian troops to move by sea. When they arrived, U.S. naval ships patrolling both coasts prevented them from landing in Panama. Roosevelt claimed that an 1846 agreement with Colombia gave the United States the authority to control transit across Panama. The nineteenth-century pact, however, envisioned using U.S. forces to protect, not destroy, Colombian sovereignty in Panama. In the 1920s, Congress apologetically sent Colombia $25 million for Roosevelt’s transgression. With America’s help the revolution in Panama succeeded. The United States immediately received its reward from Bunau-Varilla, the new minister to the United States for the Republic of Panama. The Hay– Bunau-Varilla Treaty (1903) gave the United States perpetual control over a strip of land ten miles wide that included the Panama Canal for $10 million and

 an annual rent of $250,000. These terms remained in effect until December 31, 1999, when the United States turned control of the canal over to Panama. When American engineers took over building the Panama Canal in 1904, they confronted a host of geological challenges. The Chagres River crisscrossed the route selected for the canal. Tropical rains regularly poured down the mountains into the Chagres, which, if not diverted, would dump floodwaters and silt into the planned canal. By damming the Chagres, U.S. engineers created the artificial Gatun Lake that ships reached through a stairway of locks on either side. This approach used water rather than shovels to create much of the waterway. The accompanying map (19.12) shows the 164 square miles of rain forest that construction crews flooded to create Gatun Lake. The 5,000 American engineers, skilled workers, and foremen at the construction site relied on thousands of foreign workers, mostly blacks from the British West Indies, to dig the rest of the canal.

 President Roosevelt shared the public’s fascination with the feat of building the canal, and visited the site in 1906. His two-week trip made Roosevelt the first American president to leave the country while in office. Not content merely to watch the huge steam shovels through the window of the train bringing him to the Culebra Cut, the project’s largest excavation site, Roosevelt tramped through the mud to reach a steam shovel and climbed into the driver’s seat. As photographers snapped away, Roosevelt learned that the Bucyrus steam shovel picked up eight tons of dirt in a single scoop, required a crew of ten, and dug five times more than older machines.

 “It is an epic feat, and one of immense significance.” President ROOSEVELT, after visiting the Panama Canal construction site

 of lives. Nonetheless, poor sanitation in the black workers’ camps (which Roosevelt criticized during his visit) and the dangers posed by mudslides and working with dynamite exacted a toll. Nearly 4,500 foreign black workers and 500 white Americans died during the American phase of construction.

The Roosevelt
Corollary
The Panama Canal
 was a symbol of U.S. technological achievement, naval power, and economic strength. The canal also increased the importance of the Caribbean to U.S. national security. “America’s interests in this hemisphere are greater than those of any European power,” Roosevelt stated. Therefore the United States intended to “police and protect” the canal alone. Roosevelt had reason to worry about European naval incursions into the region. Anxious about overdue debts, Britain, Italy, and Germany blockaded Venezuela in 1902, and two years later European nations threatened to intervene in the Dominican Republic for the same reason. To head off a European invasion, the Dominicans asked Roosevelt to accept the nation as a protectorate. Roosevelt privately remarked he had “about the same desire to annex it as a gorged boa constrictor might have to swallow a porcupine wrong-end-to.” He nonetheless agreed to help, but only after deciding to use the incident to establish a new principle in U.S. foreign policy. To prevent European military incursions into the Western Hemisphere, Roosevelt announced a corollary to the 1823 Monroe Doctrine (see Chapter 7), which had declared the Western Hemisphere off-limits to further European colonization. The Roosevelt Corollary of 1904 stated that when confronted with “flagrant cases” of wrongdoing by Latin American nations, such as not paying their debts to Western nations, the United States intended to act as an “international police power” in the region.

Americans dubbed the Roosevelt Corollary the “big stick” policy in reference to a West African proverb that Roosevelt favored: “Speak softly and carry a big stick, and you will go far.” The corollary exempted Argentina, Brazil, and Chile because Roosevelt considered them civilized nations capable of meeting their international commitments and running their own domestic affairs. Satisfied that the United States would help Europe recoup its loans to Central and South American nations, European governments reacted positively to the Roosevelt Corollary. How did the Roosevelt Corollary bolster U.S. stature as a world power?



 CHAPTER 19

IMPERIAL AMERICA: THE UNITED STATES IN THE WORLD, 1890–1914

 Roosevelt’s successor in the White House, William Howard Taft, expanded U.S. influence over Latin America. Not content with ensuring that Caribbean nations paid their debts, Taft initiated a policy of Dollar Diplomacy that encouraged U.S. investment in Latin America to maintain U.S. economic dominance over the region. Hoping to substitute “dollars for bullets,” Taft shared Roosevelt’s desire to turn the Caribbean into an American lake. In Taft’s formulation enlarging America’s commercial presence required the establishment of American banks, English-language news bureaus, and trained foreign service personnel in Latin American countries. These would provide U.S. businesses with the credit, information, and active government support that they needed to penetrate the region.

 When Democrat Woodrow Wilson became president in 1912, he followed in Roosevelt and Taft’s footsteps by aggressively protecting U.S. business interests and curtailing European access to the Western Hemisphere. The map, “American Involvement in Latin America, 1898–1939,” (19.15) lists the many U.S. military incursions that occurred in areas where American businessmen had invested heavily in fruit and sugar industries. Like his predecessors Wilson denied any intention of seeking “one additional foot of territory by conquest.” He acknowledged that U.S. intervention protected America’s national security and commercial interests, but also asserted that the nation’s main goal was to spread democracy and law and order. Even Wilson’s secretary of war William Jennings

 Bryan, who had vehemently opposed annexation of the Philippines, supported an active U.S. presence in Latin America. During this period U.S. troops invaded Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba for strategic, commercial, and humanitarian reasons. American armies often stayed for years, and in 1915 Haiti joined Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Panama as a U.S. protectorate. By creating protectorates, rather than colonies, the government avoided re-igniting the divisive arguments between imperialists and anti-imperialists that had surrounded the decision to annex the Philippines. Military intervention also allowed the United States to control all direct approaches to the Panama Canal and to protect access to raw materials and markets for U.S. exports (19.16). Exerting influence over its Caribbean neighbors, through military invasions and protectorates, became a mainstay of twentieth-century U.S. foreign policy.

 On August 15, 1914, the Panama Canal officially opened. Newspapers buried this news about America’s crowning achievement of the imperial age in their back pages, instead devoting their headlines to the 11-day-old war in Europe. The beginning of World War I ushered in a new era in world history, one of global warfare made possible by the powerful empires constructed in the late nineteenth century. Now actively engaged in the world, the United States would find it difficult to stay out of this spreading conflict, especially as its trade with Great Britain and France in war-related goods exploded.

 4. How did American views about race and racial identity shape the nation’s development as a world power? 5. What different tactics did the United States use to protect its economic and strategic interests in East Asia versus those used in the Caribbean at the turn of the century?

Key Terms
 Imperialism The late nineteenth-century term for colonizing foreign nations and lands, relying primarily on business, political, and military structures rather than settlers to rule colonized peoples and exploit their resources. Teller Amendment (1898) Congressional promise “to leave the government and control of the [Cuban] Island to its people” at the end of the Spanish-American War. Treaty of Paris Agreement that ended the Spanish-American War, with Spain relinquishing its claim to Cuba and the United States receiving Puerto Rico and Guam. In return for $20 million, Spain turned the Philippines over to the United States. Platt Amendment Granted the United States the right to maintain a naval base at Guantánamo Bay, to intervene militarily in Cuban domestic affairs, and a privileged trading relationship with Cuba. The Cuban government also needed permission from the United States before entering into treaties with other nations.

 “The white man’s burden” The Anglo-Saxon quest to better the lives of so-called racially inferior peoples by spreading Western economic, cultural, and spiritual values and institutions. Sphere of influence The term used to describe the exclusive political and trading rights that a foreign nation enjoyed within another nation’s territory. Open Door Policy A U.S.-sponsored nonbinding international agreement that kept the Chinese market open to all foreign nations. Gentlemen’s Agreement (1907–1908) Japanese agreement to deny passports to Japanese workers intending to immigrate to the United States. 581 Panama Canal A manmade waterway through Panama completed in 1914 to link the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

The Great War
World War I, 1914–1918
 On May 7, 1915, Ernest Cowper was chatting with a friend aboard the Lusitania, a British passenger ship traveling from New York to the British Isles, as it passed the lush, green coast of Ireland. Looking into the water, Cowper suddenly felt a stab of terror when he spotted a German torpedo just seconds before it hit the ship. Peering through the periscope the German submarine captain watched hundreds of people jumping into the water in a desperate attempt to reach empty lifeboats. The ship sank within 18 minutes, killing 1,198 passengers, including 128 Americans. Cowper, a Toronto newsman whose vivid recollections soon appeared in American newspapers, was one of the lucky survivors. The sinking of the Lusitania was a defining moment for the United States during World War I, often also called the Great War. The nation had remained neutral when the war began nine months earlier in August 1914, refusing to chose sides among the European powers involved, led by Great Britain, France, and Russia (the Allies) on one side and Germany and Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers) on the other. When, however, the war spread to the high seas and American business initiated a lucrative arms trade with Britain and France, Americans increasingly found themselves in the line of fire. American newspapers highlighted the tragic deaths of innocent women and children on the Lusitania, stirring outrage against Germany. One U.S. news report described the corpse of a mother embracing her three-month old baby, noting that “her face wears a half smile. Her baby’s head rests against her breast. No one has tried to separate them.” This description inspired the first American war-era propaganda poster, pictured here. The image, by Fred Spear, showed a mother and her baby sinking into the depths of the sea accompanied by one word—“Enlist.” Not all Americans, however, blamed Germany for the attack. German Americans claimed that the Lusitania was secretly transporting munitions from New York to Britain. Rural Americans castigated Northeast business interests for trading primarily with the Allies, fearful that favoring Britain and its allies would draw America into the war. President Woodrow Wilson offered a competing vision of the Lusitania’s importance. Through increasingly strident diplomacy Wilson decided to defend the rights of neutrals to travel wherever they liked. This stance put the United States on a collision course with Germany that resulted in America entering the war two years later. Once America declared war, Wilson gave the country a larger purpose than defeating Germany. Introducing a new, and controversial, vision of American global leadership, he promised to achieve a lasting peace by spreading democracy worldwide. To mobilize the nation’s resources to fight the grim trench warfare underway along the Western Front, the government unfurled a far-reaching propaganda campaign, offered unprecedented support to labor unions, and raised a mass army through conscription. Americans suffered severe casualties in a short time, and their war effort helped the Allies defeat Germany by November 1918. The nation expected a peace treaty that embodied Wilson’s promise to make this conflict “the war to end all wars.” Americans held conflicting visions, however, over how to achieve this goal.

 “The world must be made safe for democracy.” President WOODROW WILSON, 1917 War Address





 CHAPTER 20

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

The Decision for War
 In the summer of 1914, Europe ignited as war swept across the continent (20.1). Instead of the easy victory that many Europeans expected, the war turned into a prolonged global struggle that took the lives of millions of men. World War I pitted the Allies, initially composed of Britain, France, Belgium, Serbia, and Russia, and eventually totaling 18 nations including Japan, Italy, and the United States, against the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary, who were joined by the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. Most Europeans rushed into battle without considering what a general war would mean. Americans, however, followed a completely different road to war, openly debating whether this was their war to fight. It took two and a half years for the United States to enter the war. By then few illusions remained about the horror of modern warfare. Unlike Europeans in 1914 Americans knew they were committing to total war—and that winning would require the complete economic and psychological mobilization of the home front.

The War in Europe
 On June 28, 1914, a 19-year-old Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip arrived in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, as part of a terrorist band that intended to assassinate the heir to the AustroHungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who was also visiting the city. Princip belonged to the Black Hand, a Slavic nationalist group based in the neighboring Kingdom of Serbia that longed to unite Bosnia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with Serbia. The group’s first attempt to assassinate the archduke failed when the bomb that one of Princip’s coconspirators threw at the archduke’s motorcade bounced off the side of his car, injuring two Austrian officers instead. Eluding the police Princip disappeared into the crowd. Later in the day the archduke made a fateful decision to visit his injured staff members. On the way to the hospital, the driver made a wrong turn down a narrow street and slowed down to put the car in reverse. Standing at the end of the street was Princip, who could barely believe his good fortune as he saw the archduke and his wife coming toward him. Seizing the opportunity he stepped forward, pulled a pistol from his pocket, and fired, killing them both. World War I began with these two deaths and ended four years later with over nine million more. In responding to the assassination, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Germany tried to leverage the crisis to fulfill longstanding territorial ambitions. These events are summarized on the timeline, “Countdown to War, 1914” (20.2).

 What role did nationalism and imperialism play in bringing about World War I?

 “Mr. Mayor, it is perfectly outrageous! We have come to Sarajevo on a visit and have had a bomb thrown at us.” ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND after surviving the Black Hand’s first assassination attempt

 Austria-Hungary and Russia vied for control of the Balkans, which offered ready access to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Germany hoped to become the dominant power in Europe and had recently challenged the world dominance of France and Britain by building a strong navy, acquiring colonies, and defeating France in the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible for the assassination and demanded that the Serbian government make amends. In response Serbia chose appeasement over confrontation. Serbia accepted all of Austria-Hungary’s demands except the one insisting that Austro-Hungarian judges and police participate in the investigation and trials of any Black Hand terrorists captured in Serbia. In early July, German Kaiser Wilhelm II encouraged AustriaHungary to quickly invade and punish Serbia. But on July 28, when the Kaiser finally read the Serbian response, he jotted in the margins: “a great moral victory for Vienna; but with it every reason for war

 is removed.” His comments came too late. An hour later, on July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. As Austro-Hungarian warships on the Danube River bombarded Belgrade, Serbia’s capital city, Russia resolved to stand by Serbia and defend its own interests in the Balkans. Tsar Nicolas II ordered a general mobilization of his army on July 30, 1914. It was a momentous decision. Germany viewed Russia’s mobilization as a direct threat. Ever since the 1894 alliance between Russia and France, Germany had worried about fighting a two-front war. In 1905, the German Chief of Staff Alfred von Schlieffen developed a plan that called for Germany, in the event of war, to attack and quickly defeat France in the west, while the cumbersome Russian army mobilized in the east. The Schlieffen Plan avoided the well-defended border between France and Germany and instead sent German troops on a northward arc. Passing quickly through Belgium, German troops would enter France through its unfortified northern border and capture Paris within six weeks. Germany could then turn its full forces against the much larger Russian army. For the Schlieffen Plan to work, Germany needed to strike first. With Russia refusing to halt its mobilization, Germany declared war on Russia on August 1, 1914, and put a modified version of the Schlieffen Plan into motion. Two days later Germany declared war on France. When German troops crossed into Belgium on August 4, Britain declared war on Germany, fulfilling its 1839 pledge to guarantee Belgium independence and neutrality. The Schlieffen Plan quickly unraveled. The Germans encountered unexpected resistance from the Belgians and had difficulty resupplying a mass army on the move, giving the French and British time to mobilize. In the east Russia attacked with its partly mobilized army sooner than Germany expected, prompting German Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke to divert troops from France to defend East Prussia. At the Marne River, 35 miles northeast of Paris, the French and British successfully stopped the German drive toward Paris. Instead of defeating France quickly, Germany’s attack ignited a general European war. As each army dug defensive trenches in France and Belgium, the trench deadlock of the Western Front took shape. For nearly four years men would live and die in the complex system of earthworks that ran for 460 miles from the North Sea to Switzerland. To bolster their forces, Britain,

 What miscalculations stymied German expectations of a short war?

 France, and Germany began immediately enlisting men and resources from their colonies. When the Ottoman Empire (which ruled Turkey and most of the Middle East) joined the Central Powers and Japan and Italy joined the Allies, the conflict became a true world war. American society contained many first- and second-generation immigrants from both the Central Powers and the Allied nations who disagreed over which nation had started the war. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson believed that all belligerents shared collective responsibility for the war. Wanting both to stay out of the war and prevent bitter divisions from ripping America apart, Wilson proclaimed the United States neutral.

The Perils of Neutrality
 As war engulfed Europe Wilson advised Americans to avoid “passionately taking sides” and to “remain impartial in thought, as well as action.” Neutrality, however, turned out to be a difficult concept for Americans to define and maintain. Did it mean trading with both sides selectively, or with no one? Did Americans have the right as members of a neutral nation to travel wherever they liked without coming under attack? The conflicting visions that emerged as Americans confronted these questions created strident debate as the war wore on. The dilemma was how to remain neutral without inflicting serious damage on the American economy. Since the 1890s, American foreign policy had focused on protecting American business interests abroad (see Chapter 19). Cutting off trade completely with Europe would have had severe consequences for Americans. At first Wilson tried to limit America’s financial involvement in the war by banning private American bank loans to the belligerent nations. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan believed the ban would “hasten a conclusion to the war” by making it impossible for the warring countries to buy what they needed to continue fighting. Wilson, however, lifted the ban in 1915. The Allies were running short of cash, and Wilson feared a widespread U.S. recession if these nations stopped buying American goods. Trading with or loaning money to both sides was another possible way to stay neutral. In theory American manufacturers and banks were free to do business with both the Allies and Germany. In practice, however, the chart of U.S. Exports to Europe, 1914– 1917 (20.3) reveals that they chose primarily to help the Allies. By 1917, American banks were loaning

 *Italy joined the Allies in April 1915.

 Britain an average of $10 million a day. In contrast American trade with Germany had dropped to less than one percent of what it had been in 1914. Even if American manufacturers and banks had wanted to help Germany, trade became nearly impossible when Britain used its navy to blockade Germany and cut the international cable between the United States and Germany. America’s financial elite, however, had no desire to trade with both sides. Many upper-class Americans revered British culture and had warm feelings toward the French. Widespread publicity of German atrocities against Belgian civilians also fanned anti-German sentiment. Newspapers published vivid accounts of German soldiers burning homes, ransacking museums, and executing Belgian civilians in retaliation for guerilla attacks against the German army. The press embellished these stories with fabricated tales of German soldiers cutting off women’s breasts and children’s hands. Some Americans saw such reports as little more than British propaganda. America’s disproportionate aid to the Allies alarmed the sizable German American and Irish American communities (the latter hated British rule of Ireland). Midwesterners and Southerners accused Eastern banks of violating the principle of neutrality, thereby pulling the nation slowly into a war most Americans did not want to fight. These critics embraced a strict vision of neutrality and wanted the government to announce an arms embargo that would prevent American companies from trading with nations at war. When the war spread to the high seas, these conflicting visions provoked heated debate over America’s role in the war. Facing a trench stalemate

 on the Western Front, Britain used its superior navy to establish a blockade around the Central Powers that included mining the North Sea. The blockade immediately affected American trade. American ships could not sail through the North Sea to Germany without first allowing the British to search their cargo for contraband, merchandise such as guns or ammunition that Britain wanted to stop from entering Germany. Britain soon violated international law by adding cotton and food to the contraband list. In March 1915, Wilson formally protested British blockading practices. The British eventually agreed to buy enough American cotton to offset the loss of the German market. The president proved less accommodating when Germany declared the waters around Britain a war zone and threatened to attack any ship that entered the area. To combat the British blockade, Germany turned to a new weapon, its U-boat, or submarine, to launch surprise torpedo attacks against Allied merchant and naval ships. International law recognized a naval blockade as a legal weapon of war, but required that the attacking ship give the merchant vessel’s crew time to evacuate, and if necessary, take them aboard before sinking the ship and cargo. These prewar rules rendered the U-boat useless, removing the element of surprise that made it so effective. Once spotted, armed merchant vessels did not hesitate to attack fragile U-boats. On May 7, 1915, a German U-boat sunk the Lusitania, a British passenger ship sailing off the coast of Ireland. Calls for war swept through the press. “Germany must surely have gone mad,” surmised one Richmond newspaper. Wilson sent a

 CHAPTER 20

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

 “The American people do not want to go to war to vindicate the right of a few people to travel or work on armed vessels.” Missouri Senator WILLIAM J. STONE to President Wilson, 1916 20.4 German Warning to Travelers in the War Zone When Wilson criticized Germany for sinking the Lusitania, German Americans pointed out that the German government had published warnings like this ahead of time urging Americans to stay off ships headed to the war zone.

 series of notes demanding that Germany pay reparations and accept the right of Americans to travel on any ship they wished. The Germans defended the sinking, pointing out that they had published warnings to passengers in American newspapers (20.4) and claiming that the Lusitania was carrying munitions as part of its cargo. The Lusitania sinking was an ideological turning point for the United States. In reaction to the crisis, Wilson redefined the meaning of neutrality, thus putting the United States on a collision course with Germany. The president moved away from his initial definition of neutrality as remaining “impartial in thought, as well as action.” He now embraced neutrality as a concept that first and foremost gave neutral nations the indisputable right to trade and travel wherever they liked. Secretary of State Bryan urged Wilson to ban Americans from traveling on ships headed to the U-boat–patrolled waters around Great Britain. Wilson refused. Convinced that the president’s preoccupation with the rights of neutrals would lead to war, Bryan resigned in protest.

 Why was the sinking of the Lusitania a turning point in the neutrality debate?

 “I cannot consent to any abridgement of the rights of American citizens in any respect. The honor and self-respect of the nation is involved.” WILSON’S reply

 As the United States and Germany argued over the Lusitania, a German U-boat sunk another British passenger ship, the Arabic, in August 1915, leaving two Americans among the dead. Worried about further provoking the United States, on September 1, 1915, Germany issued the Arabic Pledge, promising not to sink passenger ships without warning. Germany renounced surprise attacks on merchant ships in May 1916 following another controversial torpedoing. For the moment these pledges averted war with the United States. The debate deepened when prominent pro-Ally political, business, and financial leaders formed the National Security League and began lobbying for universal military training to instruct all men of fighting age in drilling and marksmanship. In response Progressive reformers formed the American Union Against Militarism to denounce preparations for war. The appeal of the pacifist vision made the 1916 song “I Didn’t Raise My Son to be a Soldier” a hit. Taking stock of the preparedness versus peace debate, Congress authorized only a modest, but still controversial, expansion of the peacetime army. Recognizing the potency of antiwar sentiment, Wilson ran for reelection in 1916 on the slogan “He Kept Us Out of War.” The banners covering a Wilson reelection campaign truck (20.5) revealed the strong connections that he drew between domestic and foreign issues. Wilson reminded voters of his Progressive reform agenda, which included a Federal Reserve System that “broke the money trust” and passage of an eight-hour day for railroad workers (see Chapter 18). The slogan “Peace with Honor” referred to his success in securing pledges from Germany that respected America’s right to trade with the Allies. This overseas commerce created the prosperity that Democrats boasted about on the same sign. During the campaign Wilson noted that twice he had sent his trusted advisor

 Europe to negotiate a peace settlement, lamenting that House had returned empty-handed each time. Wilson also campaigned on the slogan of preparedness to underscore his commitment to defending the country if necessary. In contrast Wilson’s Republican challenger, former Supreme Court Justice Charles Evan Hughes, never developed an effective slogan or theme. The Hughes campaign believed that Woodrow Wilson had won the presidency in 1912 because progressive Republicans had supported Theodore Roosevelt’s run as a thirdparty Progressive candidate over the incumbent Republican President William Howard Taft (see Chapter 18). With the conservative and progressive factions of the Republican Party now reunited, Hughes tried to avoid controversy with vague calls “for law and liberty” and “undiluted Americanism.” On election night, with returns from California still uncounted, Wilson went to bed certain that he had lost. He awoke to discover that he had carried California and won reelection by only 23 electoral votes, 277–254. Foreign affairs now dominated Wilson’s thoughts. Throughout 1914–1917, German spies spent nearly $12 million to support rebel factions in Mexico, who resented the U.S. government’s intervention in Mexican domestic politics. In 1916, Francisco “Pancho” Villa raided American border towns, hoping to draw U.S. troops into Mexico and destabilize the new U.S.-backed constitutional government headed by Venustiano Carranza. Much as Villa anticipated, Wilson sent a 12,000-troop punitive expedition under the command of Brigadier General John J. Pershing into Mexico to arrest Villa. Carranza denounced the American expedition as an invasion of Mexico. Tensions between the two countries escalated dramatically after a deadly clash in Carrizal on June 21, 1916. Wilson began planning for war with Mexico until he learned that American

 troops had attacked first at Carrizal. After months of talks between U.S. and Mexican negotiators, American troops left Mexico in January 1917. That same month Wilson tried again to negotiate a European peace settlement. On January 22, 1917, he outlined a plan for “peace without victory” based on “American principles, American policies.” Democracy, freedom of the seas, no entangling alliances, and equality of rights among nations were, Wilson asserted, “the principles and policies of forward-looking men and women everywhere, of every modern nation, of every enlightened community.” Wilson’s desire to export democracy overseas while simultaneously protecting American access to foreign markets promised to greatly expand America’s imperial reach. No longer limiting American intervention to its Pacific colonies or nearby Latin American countries (see Chapter 19), Wilson proposed remaking Europe in the image of America. His words had little effect on European leaders. Unbeknownst to the president, Germany had

 CHAPTER 20

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

The War at Home
 America could not mobilize, supply, and feed an army without granting new powers to the federal government. The federal government used a mix of incentives, threats, and patriotic appeals to negotiate the preexisting class, gender, and racial conflicts that threatened to make wartime cooperation difficult. Official propaganda urged unity, but Americans retained conflicting visions about regulating big business, unionizing, female suffrage, and racial equality.

Gearing Up for War


20.7 “Little
Americans Do
Your Bit!”
 This propaganda poster showing a three-year-old saluting a bowl of corn-based porridge underscored the total mobilization of American society.

 Wilson’s democratic rhetoric convinced many Progressive reformers that they could count on the president to use his wartime powers to rein in big business (see Chapter 18). The president, however, feared that the war would make corporations more powerful than ever. “We shall be dependent upon the steel, oil, and financial magnates,” Wilson privately worried. “They will run the nation.” His concerns were well-founded. Increased wages and federal protections for unions improved the lives of many workers, but the resurgent power of big business prevented Progressives from making these wartime reforms permanent. In the winter of 1917, gridlock paralyzed the railroad system. Blizzards, fuel shortages, and poor coordination among private railway companies prevented trains from delivering tons of war-related freight. Labor unrest also created havoc as skilled railway workers left in droves for better-paying factory jobs, and railway unions prepared to strike. To sort out this mess, the federal government took over management of the railroads for the

 duration of the war. The Railroad Administration met union demands for high wages, standardized equipment, and coordinated the use of tracks. To improve the flow of needed materials, the new War Industries Board (WIB) ranked industries, so that those most critical to the war effort received raw materials ahead of nonessential wartime businesses. Steel, for example, went first to manufacturers producing guns and ships, while factories making civilian cars, freezers, and corsets (they needed steel for the inner stays) had to wait. The government paid railroad companies handsomely for wartime use of their trains and track to mute their objections to government management of the railroads. When private companies regained control of railroad lines in 1920, the nation’s railroad network lay in shambles, a victim of heavy wartime traffic and the government’s failure to maintain the lines. Food Administration Director Herbert Hoover chose a different path to ensure that the country produced enough to feed civilians at home, soldiers, and refugees overseas. Congress had given the president near dictatorial powers to regulate the food and fuel industries in the 1917 Lever Food and Fuel Act. Hoover, however, opted to use high prices and patriotic appeals to control the nation’s food supply rather than rationing. To stimulate production, he had the American and Allied governments pay high prices for agricultural goods. To curb civilian demand, Hoover organized a massive propaganda campaign around the slogan “food will win the war.” Citizens signed pledge cards vowing to observe wheatless Mondays, meatless Tuesdays, and porkless Saturdays. Urging Americans to conserve wheat for shipment overseas, the Food Administration plastered the country with posters that tried to popularize cornmeal, which did not transport well, as a tasty substitute for wheat flour. The agency offered housewives cornmeal recipes and cooking classes, and even tried to enlist the cooperation of finicky toddlers (20.7) by urging them to eat cornmeal instead of oatmeal.

 What varying strategies did the government use to mobilize economic resources?

THE WAR AT HOME

 Americans responded well to Hoover’s patriotic appeals to conserve food, but whether the government could quell labor unrest for the duration of the war remained questionable. Wilson quieted industrial class conflict by throwing money at the problem. The steel, copper, petroleum, and meatpacking industries enjoyed a healthy increase in profits, once they began selling their products to the government. Wilson also offered industrialists, still bristling over Progressive-era laws that curtailed monopolies and regulated working conditions (see Chapter 18), an olive branch by giving them a role in setting the government’s wartime price, wage, and production codes. Labor also benefited during the war. The government built high wages and union protection into its wartime contracts in exchange for a no-strike pledge from labor. The National War Labor Board (made up of representatives from government, business, and labor) required industries that accepted government contracts to honor the eight-hour day and fortyhour week. These companies also had to pay a living wage, maintain high safety standards, and recognize a union’s right to recruit members at work. Not all labor groups benefited equally from the sudden government attention. Official support for collective bargaining helped the more moderate unions that formed the American Federation of Labor. Radical labor groups that continued to oppose the war suffered when the government arrested their leaders and members for sedition. Even the gains for moderate labor unions proved fleeting, however. Workers received higher wages, but after adjusting for wartime inflation, real wages only increased four percent. When the war ended and the government canceled its contracts, workers lost federal protection for organizing unions. Without the government stopping them, many manufacturers quickly returned to their old union-busting ways (see Chapter 21).



Black Migration
 Immigrants had long provided American industry with inexpensive labor. The war disrupted the flow of immigrants to the United States just when the demand for industrial goods exploded. In 1914, 1.2 million immigrants entered the country. In 1917, only 110,618 arrived. Labor-recruiting agents soon turned to white and black Southerners to fill the void. During the war over 500,000 African Americans migrated from southern farms and cities to the North, lured by high-paying industrial jobs. The African American painter Jacob Lawrence celebrated this mass exodus in a series of paintings he completed in the 1940s. His first painting showed brightly dressed streams of families preparing to board trains through doors marked “Chicago,” “New York,” and “St. Louis” (20.8). Many migrants exalted at their newfound freedom in the North. “I can quit any time I want,” one noted, without forfeiting a year’s pay as in the sharecropping system. Another man realized that in Chicago he was no longer afraid “to rub up against a white person” accidentally on the street or sit down next to one on a streetcar. In the South he had constantly feared the consequences of an unintended breach of Southern racial etiquette. Migrants also discovered, however, that despite the absence of overt segregation or intimidation, racial prejudice existed in the North.

20.8 The First Wave of the Great
Migration (1916–1919)
 “Around the time of WWI, many African Americans from the South left home and traveled to cities in the North in search of a better life,” wrote artist Jacob Lawrence to explain this 1940 painting.

 CHAPTER 20

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

 The migration of Southern blacks northward also unveiled regional and class tensions within the black community. Working through organizations like the Urban League and the Young Men’s Christian Association, paternalistic Northern middle-class blacks tried to help Southern migrants adjust to the rhythms of industrial jobs and urban life. Besides wanting to genuinely assist recent arrivals, middle-class blacks worried that migrants’ rural customs might harm the reputation of the entire Northern black community. A list of dos and don’ts published by the Chicago Defender, a newspaper serving the African American community, entreated migrants to watch their language, mind their manners, respect the law, keep their houses clean, and send their children to school. The Urban League had reason to fear that racial rioting might accompany the arrival of black workers from the South. The explosive combination of economic competition, housing shortages, and latent racial hostility triggered racial riots in Northern cities during the war. The most deadly one occurred in East St. Louis, Illinois, in July 1917. In East St. Louis companies recruited immigrants and Southern blacks to undermine union activism. Company owners knew that racial and ethnic prejudices would prevent native-born whites from allowing these new workers to join their unions, which in turn undermined the union’s ability to mount a strike. Viewing black migrants as potential strikebreakers, white workers initiated minor attacks on black workers that escalated into a full-fledged racial riot on July 2, 1917. The antilynching black crusader Ida B. Wells-Barnett interviewed over 50 black eyewitnesses for a report that she submitted to Congress. One witness recalled seeing black men exit homes with their hands raised. As they pled for their lives, mobs stoned them to death. Overall the riot left nine whites and 39 blacks dead and hundreds wounded on both sides. The subsequent Congressional investigation held white employers, labor leaders, and politicians responsible, but 6,000 African Americans left the city anyway.

Female Suffrage
 The war inadvertently provided an opportunity for women to gain suffrage and for the temperance reform movement (see Chapter 21), where women held leading roles, to build momentum. Mobilizing the home front meant securing the

 active cooperation of women. During the war, savvy female leaders successfully parlayed their newly recognized economic clout into a demand for political power. Women did the shopping and cooking in most homes, so the Food Administration needed their full support for its food conservation efforts to succeed. “Will you have a part in Victory?” queried one propaganda poster above the image of a young woman in a stars and stripes gown scattering seeds in a “victory garden” to provide vegetables for her family. Over eight million women volunteered for Red Cross work, producing surgical dressings, sweaters, socks, and mittens for soldiers and refugees. With workers in short supply, companies increasingly recruited women to fill positions in factories, and the government hired many as clerks. In desperate need of laborers, companies in Bridgeport, Connecticut, even hired airplanes to scatter leaflets throughout residential neighborhoods that urged housewives to apply for jobs in munitions factories. Overall, however, few homemakers entered the workforce. Instead, the eight million women already at work shifted positions, taking advantage of new, albeit temporary, opportunities to work at better paying and higher skilled jobs. Suffragists wanted the nation to thank women for their war work by giving them the right to vote. The vision of an engaged female citizenry working to defend the nation reduced the appeal of longstanding arguments against votes for women. In the past the close ties between female suffragists and the temperance movement had led some urban and midwestern males to resist enfranchising women, because so many women supported prohibition. The South feared that female suffrage meant extending the right to vote to black women. Other opponents argued that the male head of the household adequately represented his family’s interests in the public domain, holding fast to a vision of women as primarily domestic, not public, figures. In the 1910s, the middle- and upper-class women leading the suffragist movement had divided into radical and conservative factions (see Chapter 18), and each offered a competing vision of how to obtain the vote for women. For months members of the militant National Woman’s Party stood outside the White House with banners asking “how long must women wait for liberty?” Once the United States entered the war, militant suffragists turned Wilson’s democratic rhetoric against

 him. They erected a sign (20.9) intended to embarrass Wilson as he greeted a delegation from the parliamentary government that ruled Russia for a short time in 1917, before Lenin seized power. Wilson hoped to convince the delegates to keep Russia in the war so democracy could triumph over autocracy in Europe. The suffragists instead focused on the recent introduction of female suffrage in Russia, urging the envoys to “help us make this nation really free” by convincing Wilson to support female suffrage. Daily scuffles broke out between outraged war supporters and the picketing suffragists, whom the press vilified as unpatriotic. After the police arrested the suffragists, the women initiated a hunger strike to protest their poor treatment in prison. When accounts of prison guards forcing feeding tubes down the throats of suffragists leaked out, Wilson pardoned them. Unbowed the female militants burned him in effigy at the White House gates. The more moderate National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) followed a different tack. It presented the vote, not as a question of equality or democracy, but as a way to reinforce the traditional desire of women to protect their families (see Chapter 18). The NAWSA also seized on wartime prejudices against German Americans, whose loyalty many Americans increasingly questioned. “It is a risk, a danger to a country like ours to send 1,000,000 men out of the country who are loyal and not replace those men by the loyal votes of the women they have left at home,” NAWSA president Carrie Chapman Catt proclaimed. All these arguments eventually swayed Wilson. In September 1918, he became the first president to endorse national female suffrage, convinced that women’s supposedly pacifist nature could help secure his postwar goals for a lasting peace. Congress sent the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women the right to vote, to the states on June 4, 1919, seven months after the war ended. Final ratification came on August 26, 1920.

Rallying the Public
 To control the flow of information and shape public opinion about the war, Wilson formed the Committee on Public Information (CPI). Headed by George Creel, a Progressive muckraking journalist, the CPI disseminated propaganda posters, press releases, and films. It translated its pamphlets into multiple languages to reach the nation’s huge immigrant population. The agency also recruited socalled Four-Minute Men to speak before audiences in movie halls, markets, fairs, and churches. The CPI limited each speech to four minutes to fill the time that it took to change the reels for silent films in movie theatres. Creel estimated that 75,000 FourMinute Men gave nearly seven million impassioned speeches during the war on topics such as German submarine warfare and German espionage. Hollywood helped the propaganda effort by making movies like To Hell With the Kaiser, which depicted the German leader as a depraved lunatic who receives a much-deserved punch in the mouth from the American soldier who captures him. The government also used war bond campaigns to win over hearts and minds. Rather than

Teaching Americans to despise anything German had negative consequences on the home front, where German Americans went from being one of the most respected immigrant groups to one of the most hated. Wartime propaganda also questioned the patriotism and masculinity of men who refused to serve. What made these wartime posters effective propaganda? 
 In his war address Wilson told the American people that “we have no quarrel with the German people.” But he also privately predicted that “a nation couldn’t put its strength into a war and keep its head level; it had never been done.” The government soon plastered the country with propaganda posters that relied on negative images of Germany and Germans to rally support for the war. This 1917 army recruiting poster depicts the Germans as savage beasts who raped, pillaged, and killed.

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

20.10 Tarring
 and Feathering a German American, German-American farmer John Meints from Luverne, Minnesota sued the members of the mob that tarred and feathered him, and they eventually paid him $6,000 in 1922 to settle the case.

 Some Americans took matters into their own hands, attacking German Americans and their businesses. In the war’s most infamous incident of vigilante justice, a mob murdered Robert Prager in Collinsville, Illinois, after he challenged the local mining union for expelling him because of his German descent. When the first attempt to hang Prager failed, the assailants granted his request to write a letter, expecting him to detail a plot to dynamite a mine. Instead Prager wrote to his mother and father who still lived in Germany. “Dear parents,” he wrote in German, “I must on this fourth day of April, 1918, die. Please pray for me, my dear parents.” The murder went unpunished. To protect themselves from similar assaults, many German American families changed their names, stopped teaching German to their children, and purchased war bonds. Germans Americans occasionally fought back. Responding to rumors that German-American farmer John Meints would not buy war bonds, 75 of his Luverne, Minnesota neighbors abducted him one summer evening in 1918. Driving Meints to the South Dakota border, the mob beat, whipped, and finally tarred and feathered him. Ignoring warnings to leave the state forever, a defiant Meints sued his assailants for $100,000 in 1919. He used these photos as evidence of the assault (20.10). After the presiding judge told the jury

 “that the evidence was overwhelming in support of the contention that Meintz [sic] was disloyal,” the jury acquitted the defendants (even though they admitted taking part in the attack). Meints appealed, and won a new trial in 1921. Rather than risk public censure now that the war was over, his assailants paid him an out-of-court settlement of $6,000 in 1922. Besides routing out suspected spies, the Espionage and Sedition Acts also helped the federal government suppress pacifists who refused to give up opposing the war and radical political groups like the Socialist Party and Industrial Workers of the World that had long opposed capitalism. “The master class has always declared the wars; the subject class has always fought the battles,” declared Eugene Debs, the leader of the Socialist Party. During the debate over declaring war, before passage of the Espionage Act, members of Congress had uttered similar denunciations of the rich and powerful. But as punishment for uttering these words in 1918, a federal judge sentenced Debs to ten years in prison. Debs became a hero in some quarters for his steadfast opposition to the war. In 1920, two years after the war ended, Debs made his fifth and final bid for the presidency from his jail cell and received one million votes. President Warren Harding pardoned him in 1921.

Fighting the War
 Germany had good reason to assume that it would take time for the United States to pose a threat on the Western Front. The country confronted significant challenges raising and training an army quickly. In 1917, the American armed forces numbered just over 300,000. Over the next 19 months, however, the military grew to more than four million and arrived overseas in time to prevent a German victory.

Raising an Army
 When the nation entered the war, the government faced the choice of raising its armed forces with volunteers, instituting conscription immediately, or waiting until enlistments began to flag before turning to a draft. In previous wars the government had selected the third option. Wilson, however, chose to implement conscription immediately. He knew that the United States needed to supply the Allies with troops, munitions, and food. The draft gave the government the power to decide who worked in essential wartime industries and who went into the army. Letting individuals decide might deprive industry of its best workers or leave the military understrength once the initial enthusiasm for enlisting subsided. To combat the impression that conscription forced reluctant men to fight, the government renamed the draft “selective service.” Selective service, the government repeatedly told the American public, placed men where they could best serve the war effort. To offer the public a visible demonstration of male patriotism, all men registered publicly for selective service on the same day. On June 5, 1917, ship horns, church bells, and factory whistles rang out, and crowds gathered to cheer for men filling out their draft registration cards. Three million men, or 11 percent of the draft-eligible population, refused either to register or serve. Some went to jail; others eluded authorities by changing jobs often. The Selective Service Act allowed conscientious objectors from recognized pacifist religious sects like the Quakers to apply for noncombatant duty. Those who opposed fighting for philosophical or political reasons had no legal way to stay out of fighting units. The most famous conscientious objector of the war was Sergeant Alvin C. York who, like 80 percent of drafted conscientious objectors, eventually agreed to fight. Choices and Consequences: Alvin C. York, Deciding to Serve (page 610) explores York’s decision to serve in the army. Conscripts ultimately accounted for 72 percent

 of the four million men in the wartime army. Overall, 20 percent of draft-eligible males (ages 18–45) served in the wartime military, 15 percent of the total adult male population.

 “You’re in the Army Now” In makeshift training camps across the country, soldiers trained (sometimes with wooden rifles) and spoke eagerly of getting to France before the “big show” ended. The army reflected the diversity of the American population. Approximately 18 percent of the entire force, or one in five, were foreign-born. Nearly 12,000 Native Americans served, composing only a small fraction of the total military force, but representing nearly 25 percent of the Native American male population. Sixteen thousand women went overseas as nurses, telephone operators, or welfare workers working in army canteens. African Americans made up 13 percent of the military, though they were only 10 percent of the country’s population. The army remained strictly segregated. Black soldiers received few chances to demonstrate bravery or leadership, since 89 percent served as labor troops under mostly white officers. Although they received little recognition from white authorities, these troops built the roads and bridges required to keep a modern army in the field. In France many black troops discovered a more racially tolerant environment where white French had no qualms socializing with African American soldiers. “You now know that the mean contemptible spirit of race prejudice that curses this land is not the spirit of other lands,” noted the African American minister Francis J. Grimké to a group of returning black soldiers. The fear that black servicemen intended to bring the fight for democracy home provoked postwar riots and lynchings that often targeted black veterans in uniform. Determined to fight back against white supremacists, black veterans helped forge a more militant postwar civil rights movement (see Chapter 21).

 Why did the government choose to draft the wartime army?

Choices and Consequences
ALVIN C. YORK, DECIDING TO SERVE
Alvin C. York grew up poor in the Tennessee Appalachian Mountains, where he became an expert marksman hunting wild turkeys in the forests. He spent his youth carousing, gambling, and drinking. As an adult he underwent a religious conversion and joined the Church of Christ in Christian Union, a pacifist Christian sect. Drafted six months before his thirtieth birthday, York faced an agonizing decision on whether to fight. “I believed in my Bible,” he said. “And it distinctly said, ‘THOU SHALT NOT KILL.’” But, York acknowledged, “I wanted to be a good Christian and a good American too.” 
Choices




 Request noncombatant duty as a conscientious objector.



 Refuse to perform any military duty.



 Agree to serve and fight.

Decision
 Like many men claiming conscientious objector status, York faced intense pressure to fight once he entered a training camp. After conversations about the Bible with his commanding officers, York decided that the biblical

 injunction “Blessed are the peacemakers” overrode the Sixth Commandment prohibiting killing because the war promised to be “the war to end all wars.” York agreed to fight.

Consequences
 York became the most celebrated American hero of the war for his feats on the battlefield in France. On October 8, 1918, York was credited with killing 24 Germans, silencing 35 machine guns, and capturing 132 enemy soldiers during

 the Meuse-Argonne offensive. Surviving combat without a scratch reaffirmed York’s faith in God, but on his deathbed he still wondered whether God would punish him for killing men in battle.

Continuing Controversies
 What is the ultimate meaning of York’s experience? Some historians note that York’s transformation from pacifist to warrior demonstrated that Wilsonian ideals inspired many Americans to fight in World War I. With Americans divided in 1941 (before the Japanese attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii) over the merits of entering World War II, the Hollywood film Sergeant York sent the message that fighting to defend the country was a citizen’s Christian and patriotic duty. Others note that York personified the poorly educated and underprivileged conscript who did the bulk of the fighting along the Western Front. Some believe that the army exaggerated York’s feats to boost morale. Rather than a

 To help the army turn this polyglot force into a functioning military force, civilian psychologists administered intelligence tests to soldiers in the training camps. Quickly assessing a recruit’s intelligence could help the army immediately identify whether a man was officer material or better suited for unloading boxes of supplies off ships in France. To the psychologists’ surprise, 25 percent of the soldiers had to take the test designed for illiterates. Most native-born white soldiers had completed only seven years of school. Foreignborn men averaged 4.7 years and Southern black men 2.6 years of schooling. Psychologists claimed their exams measured native intelligence, but the questions suggest the tests primarily assessed level of education, economic background, and familiarity with mainstream American culture (20.11). Tabulated results claimed that the white American soldiers had a mental age of 13, while the average for Russians was 11.34, for Italians 11.01, for Poles 10.74, and for American-born blacks 10.41. Critics argued that the tests only showed that



 immigrants and blacks needed more comprehensive schooling. Social Darwinists, who used Charles Darwin’s ideas of survival of the fittest to establish a hierarchy of superior and inferior human races, believed these figures validated their ideas about white northern European superiority. After the war public schools began administering intelligence tests to determine the aptitude of their pupils, a trend that continues today.

On the Western Front
 The United States entered the war at a critical moment. The peace with Russia gave Germany a clear numerical advantage on the battlefield. As U-boats began sinking Allied shipping indiscriminately, the Germans transferred over one million men from the Eastern Front with Russia to the Western Front in France. In March 1918, the Germans accomplished what many had thought impossible: They broke through the trench stalemate and began marching once again toward Paris.

20.11 Intelligence Tests for Soldiers
 These questions come from an intelligence test on logic given to literate soldiers in training camps. The pictorial exam for illiterates and non-English speakers required that soldiers draw in the missing item.

 The map (20.12) reveals how much French territory the Germans captured during their spring offensives against the British and French. As in 1914, however, the pace of the offensive exhausted German troops, who quickly outran their supply lines. The arriving American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), the American soldiers who fought overseas under the command of General John J. Pershing, played a critical role in stopping the German drive toward Paris in battles at Cantigny, Belleau Wood, and Château-Thierry. In July American soldiers fought with the French in

 a six-week counteroffensive that pushed the German army back to where it had begun the spring offensives. These campaigns initiated American soldiers to the reality of fighting along the Western Front. Men collapsed from the strain of continuous artillery bombardments and the sight of bodies blown to bits. Soldiers diagnosed with shell shock suffered from panic attacks, and some could not sleep or speak. Private Duncan Kemerer arrived at a military hospital in such poor condition that the sound of a spoon dropping sent him frantically searching for cover under his bed. American soldiers soon settled into the predictable routine of trench warfare. The three-dimensional trench shown in the feature Envisioning Evidence: Understanding the Battlefield portrays the components of a working trench. A strip of territory known as No-Man’s Land separated the Allied and German trench systems. The actual distance between the two lines averaged 250 yards. Scores of barbed wire entanglements covered this barren area, which was filled with huge craters formed by artillery shells. The U.S. Army rotated soldiers, putting them in the trenches for 21 days, with a week to recuperate in the rear before their next rotation. Each day just before sunrise, the men assembled and went on alert. If dawn passed with no enemy attack, then the men spent the day trying to stay out of sight from snipers and airplanes that strafed troops with machine gun fire. By feasting on corpses rats grew to gigantic proportions and multiplied by the thousands. Troops became infested with lice and fleas. Adding to the misery of trench life, the constant rain in northern France created a thick, gooey mud in which troops had to stand and often sleep. At night, No-Man’s Land came alive as small patrols scrambled out of the trenches to repair damaged wire or raid enemy lines for prisoners who might reveal valuable information. German artillery bombarded the Allied lines, day and night. “To be shelled is the worst thing in the world,” noted one American soldier. “It is impossible to adequately imagine it.” Troops developed an array of superstitions to try to make sense of who lived and who died in the trenches. “They claim that a man’s shell has his name on it, if it’s for him,” joked Sergeant Harry Weisburg. “But it is the part of a wise man to keep his nose out of the way of another man’s shell.” By 1918, one of

The trenches along the Western Front were intricate defense systems that both protected soldiers and added to their misery in the front lines. As a straight line, the trenches ran for 460 miles from the North Sea to Switzerland. The network of trenches, however, encompassed nearly 35,000 miles, disfiguring the Belgian and French countryside. To survive, soldiers had to learn how to negotiate the complex trench network.

 every four shells fired on the Western Front contained poison gas. Troops especially feared mustard gas, which caused painful burns on exposed skin and was deadly if inhaled. Slow-moving tanks also made their first appearance on the battlefield, but the war ended before either side could exploit their full offensive potential.

Flu Epidemic


 20.14 AntiSpitting Campaign, 1918. Trying to stem the influenza epidemic, employers cooperated with public health officials by posting reminders that spitting spread germs.

 In 1918, in the midst of mounting battlefield casualties, the world suddenly encountered a new vicious killer. Without warning, a lethal strain of influenza traversed the globe. The virus became known as Spanish Influenza because the Spanish press first reported its outbreak. Biologists speculate that the influenza germ began as a mutated version of avian (bird) flu in the American Midwest in March 1918. American soldiers carried the germ to France, and the virus spread rapidly from Europe to Africa, Asia, and Central America. Nearly 25 million Americans fell ill, a quarter of the entire population, and 675,000 died. The virus also sickened over one million American soldiers, hampering the overseas military campaign. General Pershing, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, and

 What impact did the flu epidemic have at home and worldwide?

 President Wilson all suffered from the flu, but survived. Anecdotes of people who went to work healthy in the morning, only to die before dinnertime, illustrated how suddenly the lethal virus could strike. Influenza was usually most severe for children and the elderly, segments of the population with weak immune systems. This flu virus, however, attacked young adults especially hard—making it particularly terrifying. When the flu struck, victims first felt pain in their muscles. Within hours high fevers made them delirious. Most victims recovered after weeks of bed rest, but 25 percent developed influenza-related pneumonia. Already weakened, half of these patients suffocated to death when their lungs filled with fluid, turning healthy pink tissue into blue sodden masses almost overnight. Influenza was an airborne virus that could easily penetrate masks or screens, but scientists did not identify disease-causing viruses until the 1940s. Instead, medical experts incorrectly believed that droplets spread the disease, reasoning that sneezes, coughs, or touching contaminated objects transmitted flu germs from person to person. Physicians consequently devised useless precautionary measures to prevent transmission, such as spraying public areas with a topical disinfectant. Public officials closed movie houses, schools, churches, and office buildings in an effort to contain the epidemic. Masked mailmen ( 20.13) and police became familiar sights on city streets, and masked conductors refused to let unmasked passengers board streetcars. Posters, like this one in a naval aircraft factory in Philadelphia alerted people to the dangers of spitting ( 20.14). In mid-1919, as suddenly as it had come, the virus disappeared, having run out of susceptible human beings to infect. The Spanish Influenza pandemic had a catastrophic effect worldwide. From 1918 to 1919, the disease killed 30 million people. Nine million men died in battle from 1914–1918. The bloodiest war to date thus coincided with the deadliest influenza epidemic yet recorded.

FIGHTING THE WAR

The Final Campaigns
 In September 1918, the AEF attacked at St. Mihiel (see 20.12). The battle reduced a bulge in the lines (called a “salient”), thereby weakening German defenses. Two weeks later, the Allies began a massive coordinated assault along the entire Western Front. The Americans hit the Germans hard in the Meuse-Argonne region, while the British and French struck farther north and west. Advancing in heavily wooded and hilly terrain against dense German fortifications, the American effort stalled. Regrouping, the Americans began pushing the Germans back in October. Battle casualties averaged 2,550 a day, with 6,000 Americans dying each week of the 47-day Meuse-Argonne offensive, making it the most costly battle in U.S. history. “It was most assuredly the Americans who bore the heaviest brunt of the fighting on the whole battle front during the last few months of the war,” the German General Erich Ludendorff later recalled. Besides making headway on the battlefield, Allied convoys also stymied the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign. Instead of letting individual ships take their chances at sea, British and American naval vessels began escorting groups of Allied merchant vessels through U-boat infested waters in convoys. In November, the German government requested an armistice. On the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918, the Armistice went into effect and guns fell silent along the Western Front.



 What overall contribution did American troops make to the final victory? During the victory celebrations, American enthusiasts wildly claimed that the United States had single-handedly won the war. Allied critics contended that the British and French had dealt the final devastating blow on the battlefield. The truth lay somewhere in-between. The Americans may not have won the war for the Allies, but they certainly kept them from losing it. At key moments in the German spring offensives in 1918, American soldiers helped stop the Germans from taking Paris. American divisions provided key strength for the French-led counteroffensives over the summer, and in the Meuse-Argonne campaign, American soldiers leveled a devastating blow to the German army that helped make British and French advances to the north possible. Also important, the prospect of fighting a million more fresh American recruits in 1919 convinced Germany to seek a negotiated peace. The Allies bore a heavy cost for their victory. The numbers of war dead: France (1.3 million), Britain (722,000), and Germany (1.8 million). By comparison, the 116,516 American deaths seem slight. Other figures tell a different story. In the last six months of the war, the American death rate jumped to 820 a day as U.S. troops experienced their share of brutal fighting, fewer than the 900 Frenchmen, but more than the 457 British, who died each day. The “America at War” chart (20.15) suggests yet another way to assess the impact of the war on the United States revealing that more Americans died on the battlefield in World War I than in Korea or Vietnam, both much longer wars.

 CHAPTER 20

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

Peace
 The Armistice ended active fighting in Western Europe, but the peace settlement took months to negotiate. Twenty-seven nations and four British dominions sent delegates to the Paris Peace Conference. Germany expected to join the negotiations, but instead the terms of peace were determined in secret by the Big Four: Wilson, French Premier Georges Clemenceau, the British Prime Minister Lloyd George, and the Italian Premier Vittorio Orlando. The Versailles Peace Treaty (named after the palace outside Paris where the treaty was signed) required Germany to pay reparations and disarm. Germany signed the treaty under protest on June 28, 1919, the fifth anniversary of Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s assassination. In the end the flawed and controversial Versailles Peace Treaty laid the groundwork for future conflict in Europe and raised questions at home about the role America wanted to play in the world.

The Paris Peace Conference
 Woodrow Wilson enjoyed worldwide popularity on Armistice Day. Throughout the United States and Europe, his idealistic pronouncements had raised hopes that the slaughter might pave the way for a lasting peace. Wilson broke with tradition and decided to travel overseas to negotiate the peace treaty himself, rather than sending representatives to hash out the details. As he toured Paris, London, Rome, and Milan, newspapers greeted him as “The Savior of Humanity.” British and French leaders, however, knew that four years of suffering had created a deep-seated desire for revenge against Germany within their nations. The war had also hardened Wilson’s view of Germany, and he agreed to weaken postwar Germany by eliminating its navy and colonies. He disagreed, however, with the French insistence on eviscerating the German economy and military permanently. Certain that America had played a vital role in winning the war, Wilson felt confident asserting his right, along with Britain and France, to shape the terms of peace. British and French leaders, however, publicly downplayed America’s contribution to defeating Germany, hoping to limit Wilson’s say in the peace treaty. At the request of Allied leaders, the British and French press began printing disparaging reports about the American army’s inexperience and leadership. Resentful over the Allies’ apparent ingratitude for their wartime sacrifices, Americans’ postwar disillusionment grew as the treaty-making process got underway. Wilson’s domestic political problems weakened his negotiating position. In November 1918,

 the Republicans won control of Congress despite Wilson’s plea to voters to return a Democratic majority as a vote of confidence for his peace proposals. The reasons for the Republican victory were complex, a result of unease with conditions at home and concern about Wilson’s ideals. The Democrats’ loss energized opponents of the League of Nations, a Wilson-supported collective security organization whose member nations agreed to mediate future international disputes to prevent wars and work together to improve global conditions. Domestic opponents of the League worried that by joining the international organization America would lose control over its own foreign policy and invite international meddling in the Western Hemisphere. They also doubted that the League could maintain world peace. League critics divided into two camps, each offering conflicting visions of America’s role in the postwar world. Isolationists, led by Republican Senator William E. Borah from Idaho, preferred adopting an official policy of neutrality. The isolationists believed that if the United States kept out of all foreign disagreements, the country could avoid going to war in the future. By contrast the faction headed by Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, the Republican majority leader and chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, favored a return to the former balance of power system in Europe. Lodge wanted the United States to help rebuild, and perhaps join, a strong alliance among democratic European nations that could contain Germany indefinitely. Eager to shore up support for the League of Nations at home, Wilson briefly sailed home to

 confer with Republican leaders who were still upset that he had not invited any leading Republicans to join his negotiating team. The possibility of compromise appeared slim. Lodge detested Wilson, whom he regarded as sanctimonious. Wilson returned the distain, viewing Lodge as narrow-minded. Discussion soon stalled. On the day before Wilson returned to Paris, Lodge handed the president a pledge signed by 39 senators who vowed to reject the League covenant in its present form. Hoping to appease his Republican critics, Wilson managed to incorporate key Republican demands in the final League covenant. The covenant now stated that the League of Nations would respect the Monroe Doctrine, the 1823 American pronouncement that the Western Hemisphere was off-limits to other world powers, and allow nations to withdraw from the League. Wilson also tried outmaneuvering his domestic critics. He opted against creating two international agreements, a peace treaty and a covenant creating the League of Nations that would each require a separate Senate ratification. Instead Wilson decided to incorporate the League covenant into the peace treaty. The Senate, he gambled, would never refuse to ratify the peace treaty, even one that contained a controversial League of Nations.

 “With his mouth open and his eyes shut, I predict that he will make a Senator when he grows up.” WILSON’S joke about his infant grandson touched upon his political troubles with Republican Senators Allied leaders also pressured Wilson to compromise. To get them to accept the League, Wilson gave up his idea of peace without victory. When Supreme Commander of Allied Armies Marshal Ferdinand Foch read the harsh demands of the Peace Treaty, he accurately predicted, “this isn’t a peace, it’s a twenty year truce.” The treaty required that Germany pay reparations to French and Belgian civilians for the mines, factories, and fields its troops had destroyed during “the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany.” This war guilt clause held Germany alone responsible for starting World War I. The treaty also forced Germany to



 disarm. The Reparations Committee set Germany’s initial bill at $33 billion in gold, although commissions in the 1920s significantly reduced this amount. The United States accepted no reparation payments and in the 1920s even loaned Germany money to help it pay this debt. The war guilt clause and the reparations bill created tremendous resentment in Germany. In the 1930s, Adolf Hitler cultivated this anger to fuel a resurgent national fervor dedicated to restoring German economic and military strength. Other nations also left the conference feeling slighted. Italy resented the Allies for denying it more Austrian territory along the Adriatic Sea, a humiliation that the fascist leader Benito Mussolini vowed to avenge when he took power in 1922. Japan protested the failure to incorporate into the League covenant a statement protecting the rights of nonwhite nations, helping breed Japanese resentment against the West. In the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, the peace treaty transferred colonial possessions from the losers (the Ottoman and German empires) to the victors—Britain, France, Belgium, and Japan— under a mandate system. In theory the mandate system named a Western nation as a League of Nation trustee for territories in need of political instruction before they assumed the responsibilities of self-government. In reality the mandate system simply cloaked old-style imperialism in the new rhetoric of self-determination. By redrawing the map of the Middle East to expand their global influence, Britain and France set in motion political, religious, and cultural conflicts in the region that created tremendous strife throughout the twentieth century and beyond. Denying Arab nationalist demands for independence, France took control of Lebanon and Syria. Britain ruled Transjordan (present-day Jordan) and brought together three distinct groups—the Kurds and Sunni and Shiite Arabs—who had previously lived in semi-autonomous regions under the Ottomans to form the Kingdom of Iraq under a puppet monarch. When the British took over Palestine, they kept wartime promises to open up part of it to Jewish immigration, angering its Arab inhabitants. Competing claims to this territory continue to this day. The Versailles Treaty settled old territorial disputes in Europe, but the dismemberment of the Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian empires created new sources of tension. The map of Eastern Europe was redrawn to reflect

But the Allies disregarded the desires of German-speaking peoples in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the new republic of Austria to unite with Germany. These three weak independent states remained vulnerable to German and Soviet expansionist schemes.

The Treaty Fight at Home
 Wilson saw the flaws in the final treaty, but he hoped that over time the League of Nations could modify the treaty’s worst excesses. To counter the initial burst of enthusiasm for joining the League, Republicans challenged Wilson’s idealistic pronouncements promising world peace. “Are you ready to put your soldiers and your sailors at the disposition of other nations?” Senator Lodge asked the American people.

 a Gift Horse in the Mouth (20.17) captured the public’s mounting concern about the League. While Wilson tries to assure Uncle Sam that the League is better than nothing, the Senate carefully examines the mule. Wary of going against public opinion too strongly, Lodge did not urge outright rejection of the Versailles Treaty. He instead proposed adding 14 American reservations. The most important one required explicit Congressional approval before American troops went overseas. Wilson refused to accept modifications. Instead he tried to create a groundswell of support for the League that would force the Republicans to accept the treaty as written. To reignite public enthusiasm for the League of Nations, the president traveled 10,000 miles in three weeks by train and made 40 speeches to hundreds of thousands of people. The political cartoon Ratification Rapids (20.18) offered a sympathetic portrayal of Wilson, shown here using all his strength to steer the treaty and League



 Covenant to safety. In the cartoon a young woman clutches both documents to her breast, symbolizing both the besieged nation and innocent victims of war. Wilson dismissed Republican concerns about sending American troops throughout the world as impractical. “If you want to put out a fire in Utah, you don’t send to Oklahoma for the fire engine. If you want to put out a fire in the Balkans, if you want to stamp out the smoldering flames in some part of Central Europe, you don’t send to the United States for troops,” Wilson told an audience in Salt Lake City. Competing Visions: Joining the League of Nations (page 620) explores the debate between Wilson and Lodge. Pushing himself to the limit, an exhausted Wilson paid the price. On September 25, 1919, hours after he reminded a Pueblo, Colorado, audience that American soldiers had died to protect “the liberty of the world,” the president fell ill.

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

Competing Visions
JOINING THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson and Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge debated the wisdom and value of joining the League of Nations. Consider the exact wording of Article X, and then the differing interpretations of it offered by Lodge and Wilson. What changes in American foreign policy does each foresee arising from the League? Are there any points of agreement between the two about the future world role of the United States? Article X of the League Covenant ignited tremendous controversy over whether the United States should join the League of Nations. The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all the members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled. 
 Lodge contended that the League Covenant stripped Congress of its power to declare war in this August 12, 1919, congressional address. We should never permit the United States to be involved in the internal conflict in another country, except by the will of her people expressed through the Congress which represents them. With regard to wars of external aggression on a member of the league, the case is perfectly clear. There can be no genuine dispute whatever about the meaning of the first clause of article 10. In the first place, it differs from every other obligation in being individual and placed upon each nation without the intervention of the league. Each nation for itself promises to respect and preserve as against external aggression the boundaries and the political independence of every member of the league. … It is, I repeat, an individual obligation. It requires no action on the part of the league, except that in the second sentence the authorities of the league are to have the power to advise as to the means to be employed in order to fulfill the purpose of the first sentence. … We may set aside all this empty talk about isolation. Nobody expects to isolate the United States or to make it a hermit Nation, which is a sheer absurdity. But there is a wide difference between taking a suitable part and bearing a due responsibility in world affairs and plunging the United States into every controversy and conflict on the face of the globe.

 Who has the more compelling argument regarding the League of Nations, Wilson or Lodge?

 Wilson defended the League in a speech on September 25, 1919, in Pueblo, Colorado, that recalled the sacrifices of soldiers during the war, bringing many in the audience to tears. But you will say, “what is the second sentence of article 10? That is what gives very disturbing thoughts.” The second sentence is that the Council of the League shall advise what steps, if any, are necessary to carry out the guaranty of the first sentence, namely, that the members will respect and preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of the other members. I do not know of any other meaning for the word “advise” except “advise.” The Council advises, and it can not advise without the vote of the United States [as a member of the Council]. … Whether we use it wisely or unwisely, we can use the vote of the United States to make impossible drawing the United States into any enterprise that she does not care to be drawn into… My friends, on last Decoration Day I went to a beautiful hillside near Paris, where was located the cemetery of Suresnes, a cemetery given over to the burial of the American dead. … I wish some men in public life who are now opposing the settlement for which these men died could visit such a spot as that. I wish that the thought that comes out of those graves could penetrate their consciousness. I wish that they could feel the moral obligation that rests upon us not to go back on those boys, but to see the thing through, to see it through to the end and make good their redemption of the world. For nothing less depends upon this decision, nothing less than the liberation and salvation of the world.

 PEACE

 back to Washington, D.C., where two days later he suffered a stroke. Permanently paralyzed on his left side, he spent the rest of his presidency hidden in the White House. Wilson, the British Prime Minister Lloyd George remarked, was “as much a victim of the war as any soldier who died in the trenches.” The White House kept the president’s illness a secret, issuing a vague statement that he was recovering from exhaustion. For weeks, however, Wilson only spent three hours a day out of bed and saw no one except his physician and his family. His wife, Edith Wilson, controlled all correspondence reaching the president and helped compose his replies. Critics later accused her of serving as a shadow president during Wilson’s convalescence, but she maintained that the president made every decision himself. Wilson rejected all private suggestions that he resign and still refused to accept any reservations to the Versailles Treaty. With Wilson absent from the public stage, opposition to the League of Nations spread. His refusal to compromise doomed the treaty. The Senate rejected both the original treaty and one with Lodge’s reservations attached. The Senate therefore never ratified the Versailles Treaty. It also refused to accept Armenia as a mandate, despite Wilson’s plea to become the “friends and advisors” of a people ravaged by wartime Turkish massacres and deportations. It took two more years for the war to end officially for the United



 States. In October, 1921, the Senate finally ratified separate peace treaties with Germany, Austria, and Hungary (the United States had never been at war with the Ottoman Empire or Bulgaria). Nations that ratified the Versailles Peace Treaty also agreed to join the League, with the exception of Germany, which was not allowed to join until 1926. The League remained headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, from 1920 until 1946, when the United Nations took its place. Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919 for his efforts to establish the League of Nations, but without American membership the League became little more than a place to air grievances. Wilson never regained his health, and he died in February 1924. (Senator Lodge, his unyielding opponent, died just eight months later.) John Steuart Curry’s 1938 painting Parade to War, Allegory (20.19) captures the growing feeling by the 1930s that U.S. participation in World War I had been a mistake. In the painting uniformed men march off to war, slowly turning into corpses before the cheering crowds. The young boy running alongside them fails to notice this transformation, and instead remains mesmerized by the pageantry and excitement of war. Only the two mothers in the scene (one to the left weeping quietly and the other on the right whom a policeman stops from interfering with the parade) understand the true sorrow that war brings to families and the nation.

 What ideals informed American foreign policy in the 1920s?

 On a cold December afternoon in 1926, two young women posed for the camera as they danced on the ledge of a Chicago hotel. With their short skirts, bobbed hair, and heel-kicking dance steps, they displayed a carefree lifestyle that defied the stricter morals embraced by their mothers’ generation. The pair embodied the high spirits of a generation ready to put the tragedy of World War I behind them and move forward into the modern era. Novelists and journalists referred to these women as flappers, an old slang term for young girls. Now it was used to describe independent young women who smoked, drank, danced to jazz, and flaunted their sexual liberation by wearing revealing clothes. Rebellious postwar writers made flappers a cultural icon. Their youthful exuberance and daring behavior excited some Americans and created a sense of moral outrage in others. The flapper controversy was one of many cultural conflicts that turned political in the turbulent twenties. Flappers and the equally controversial birth control movement championed the right of women to take control of their bodies. Other Americans preferred using the government to control behavior. Prohibition of the manufacture and sale of alcoholic liquors became the law of the land in 1920, promising to rid the nation of poverty, crime, and disease. To prevent the communist-inspired Russian Revolution of 1917 from spreading to the United States, the government arrested suspected political radicals and drastically reduced the flow of European immigration. Meanwhile religious fundamentalists argued that the country was morally adrift and launched a well-publicized crusade against teaching evolution in public schools. African Americans, too, played an important role in changing America’s cultural landscape, creating new artistic centers and political movements that challenged the methods of established civil rights leaders. Putting the Progressive Era faith in trust-busting aside, the government allowed large industrial conglomerates to dominate key industrial sectors, such as steel and automobiles. Still staunchly antiunion, some factory owners nonetheless became more responsive to workers’ grievances to reduce labor strife. Mass production, accompanied by mass consumption, spurred the decade’s economic prosperity. Cars, suburbs, and asphalt highways soon dotted the American horizon, changing the living habits of millions. In the twenties domestic cultural conflict dominated political discourse, yet a distinct foreign policy also took shape. Despite its refusal to join the League of Nations, the country remained active in world affairs. By exerting rising international influence through diplomacy and foreign aid, Republican presidential administrations offered an alternative way to maintain world peace. How much of the old order would America jettison or protect as it entered the postwar age? Throughout the twenties Americans held competing visions of what modernity had to offer.

 CHAPTER 21

A TURBULENT DECADE: THE TWENTIES

Cars and Planes:
The Promise of the Twenties
 During the twenties America became a car culture. Car registration jumped from 9.2 million in 1920 to 26.5 million ten years later. By 1927, 80 percent of the world’s cars were in the United States. Conflicting ideas soon emerged, however, over how much car-based commerce should transform the American landscape and whether all Americans could be trusted with the new freedom their cars bestowed. The push to produce cars and other consumer goods more efficiently caused industrialists to change how they treated their workforce. Competing visions of industrial work culture between industrialists and workers emerged alongside ongoing clashes over wages and hours. Could man and machine coexist harmoniously?

The Car Culture


21.1 Cottage
Gas Station
 Many businessmen built gas stations that looked like country cottages to assure passing motorists that their establishments were safe and clean.

 At the turn of the century, cities were smelly, dirty places. In New York City alone, horses dumped 2.5 million tons of manure and 60,000 gallons of urine on streets yearly. The car seemed to offer a clean, flexible solution to city transportation problems. Paving the streets with asphalt would remove the dust that often forced dwellers to keep their windows shut. No one foresaw that a fleet of privately owned cars would soon clog city streets, or that their exhaust would become a public health hazard. Although initial expectations focused on the improvements that cars would make in cities, farmers also benefited from the new technology. Tractors made plowing easier, while trucks transported produce more quickly to market. Whole families piled into cars on Saturday morning to head into town, ending the isolation that had characterized farm life.

 A car represented a significant purchase for a family. Cars cost between 20 and 45 percent of a non-farm family’s annual income, and between 50 and 100 percent of a farm household’s yearly earnings. Credit plans required that purchasers pay one-third in cash as a down payment and spread the remaining payments over one year. Most plans also came with hefty interest rates averaging around 16 percent. Besides enriching automobile manufacturers, the explosion in car ownership meant boom times for numerous other industries. To satisfy the unquenchable thirst for gasoline, the petroleum industry underwent a major expansion with new oil wells appearing daily in Texas and California. The building trades saw their business take off, when millions took advantage of the mobility that cars afforded and moved to the suburbs. An acute need soon developed for tunnels and bridges to link cities by car to ever-dispersed commuter suburbs. In 1927, the Holland Tunnel, the nation’s first underwater motor vehicle tunnel, opened between New York City and New Jersey. On its first day of operation, nearly 50,000 people paid 50 cents to drive through the tunnel that ran under the Hudson River.

On the Road
 The ease of car travel encouraged many Americans to take vacations away from home for the first time, and to satisfy their wanderlust, the public demanded good roads through rural areas. The government responded with a massive

 road-building and paving program. Following the precedents set in the nineteenth century when the federal government had funded canal construction and given railroad companies huge land grants to build railroads (see Chapter 15), the federal government now helped states build a new national highway system. Car travelers also needed food, lodging, and gas. To entice tourists to stop at their establishments, rural businessmen erected eye-catching signs and buildings. A revolution in commercial roadside architecture was soon underway. Small clusters of cottages where tourists could spend the night on long road trips, forerunners of today’s motels, appeared in remote areas. The miniature house (21.1) emerged as the most popular type of commercial roadside building in the twenties, a way to assure the passersby that the restaurant, store, or gas station was a safe and respectable establishment. Other retailers used surreal images to entice motorists to stop. An array of giant milk bottles, toads, and hot dogs soon lined the highways of America. The Teapot Dome Service Station (21.2), built in 1922 along a highway in Zillah, Washington, humorously reminded patrons of the Teapot Dome political scandal that rocked the Harding

 White House in the early twenties. The Republicans had selected Warren Harding, an unassuming senator from Ohio, as their 1920 presidential candidate because his easygoing nature and call for “a return to normalcy” presented the electorate with a welcome respite from Democrat Woodrow Wilson’s stern wartime leadership. Winning 60 percent of the popular vote, Harding easily defeated Democrat James Cox, who suffered when he stood by Wilson and his failed League of Nations crusade (see Chapter 20). Harding’s two years in office (he died of a heart attack in 1923, making his vice president Calvin Coolidge president) were, however, tarnished by scandal. The largest scandal involved Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall, who went to jail for accepting bribes from two wealthy businessmen to lease government-controlled oil reserves in Teapot Dome, Wyoming. The enterprising owner of this service station gave his customers a laugh at the president’s expense by selling oil and gasoline in a teapot-shaped gas station. Cars also transformed recreational habits. Ministers complained that instead of spending Sundays in church,

 many families chose to take all-day drives. Cars let teenagers take their courting out of the family parlor and into the backseat of the family automobile, to the dismay of parents everywhere. “The best way to keep children home is to make the home atmosphere pleasant—and let air out of the tires,” quipped author Dorothy Parker. Automobiles also made it harder for town officials to regulate red-light districts, causing one judge to declare that “the automobile has become a house of prostitution on wheels.”

Welfare Capitalism and
Consumer Culture
 During World War I the government had mandated that industrialists with wartime contracts pay high wages, provide clean and safe working conditions, and allow unions to organize within their factories (see Chapter 20). In return for this official protection, the government demanded a no-strike pledge from unions. When the war ended in 1918, the government abruptly canceled its orders and withdrew from managing worker-industrial relations. The government’s handsoff attitude emboldened many industrialists to reinstate low wages, long hours, and blacklists for union members. To protect their war-time gains, unions orchestrated the greatest wave of strikes in American history in 1919. Although they rallied millions of workers to the picket lines, out-matched unions lost this battle. Industrialists accused unions of following in the footsteps of the recent Russian Revolution and trying to spread communism in the United States. These accusations won industrialists the support of local governments, who again forcefully broke up many picket lines. Defeated steel, coal, and garment unions, however, did not give up organizing and continued to attract members. In the early 1920s, union ranks grew to five million, the largest to date. When faced with the dismal vision of unending labor strife, Progressives had crafted government regulation to rein in business and improve working conditions (see Chapter 18). In the 1920s, industrialists used the guarantee of government noninterference to pursue a different vision. Throughout the decade the Harding and Coolidge administrations left industrialists free to fashion their own solutions to such labor troubles, adopting an openly pro-business stance. The Wall Street Journal exulted that “never before, here or anywhere else, has a government been so completely fused with business,” referring to Commerce Department workshops that helped businesses

 How did welfare capitalism promise to help industrialists run their factories more efficiently?

 eliminate wasteful practices, a Justice Department that largely stopped enforcing anti-trust laws, and a high protective tariff that made imported goods more expensive than American industrial products. The Progressive Era effort to improve industrial efficiency, however, remained popular. Envisioning Evidence: Scientific Management in Action shows how industrialists tried to standardize hiring practices by relying on the “scientific” insights of Social Darwinism. Innovative industrialists also tried to put aside the prevailing idea that the interests of capitalists and workers inevitably clashed. Rather than driving their workers relentlessly to secure a profit, advocates of welfare capitalism suggested that industrialists offer a wide range of benefits such as medical insurance, pensions, and stock ownership plans to create a loyal workforce. As the vogue for welfare capitalism spread, many industrialists began to change their management practices. To develop a stable, well-trained workforce, industrialists introduced fringe benefits (including paid vacations and sick pay), created industrial committees where workers could air grievances, and offered bonuses for workers who exceeded production quotas. A worker usually needed at least 25 years with one company to qualify for a pension, so this policy alone could potentially keep workers from leaving to pursue other job opportunities. Industrialists also experimented with offering employees stock options, hoping to dilute class antagonism by making each worker an investor who would share in the company’s profits. Despite workers’ enthusiasm for welfare capitalism, the reality rarely matched the rhetoric. Seasonal layoffs continued, wage rates fluctuated constantly, and long hours in unhealthy factories persisted. As one worker complained, “we had to wait five years for one week’s vacation. And I’ve seen men work four and one-half years and then get laid off.” Industrialists’ promises ended up simply whetting workers’ appetites for stable well-paid jobs with benefits. During the Great Depression in the 1930s (see Chapter 22), the labor movement would demand that the government fulfill the hopes that industrialists had raised in the twenties. Increased industrial productivity and efficiency created an unprecedented abundance of affordable goods in the twenties. Blue-collar workers toiling in dead-end jobs in factories staffed with salaried whitecollar employees performing unsatisfying clerical tasks produced these items. Frustrated at work, many working- and middle-class Americans used their growing leisure time and access to material goods to create more fulfilling lives. A modern consumer culture arose

 Scientific management, the effort to use scientific knowledge to maximize output and profit, took many forms in the 1920s. Mirroring how army psychologists had used intelligence tests to rank the aptitudes of different racial and ethnic groups in World War I (see Chapter 20), the Central Tube Company in Pittsburgh devised a chart to assess the abilities of various nationalities to perform skilled and unskilled jobs. The new profession of psychology accepted pseudoscientific social Darwinian ideas that “race” determined aptitude and the factory owner devised his own “scientific” chart to organize and run his business more efficiently. Rather than assessing the experience or capabilities of an individual, an employment agent only had to consult this chart to match the right man with the right job.

 Unsurprisingly, given the prevailing racial climate, white Americans topped the list as good in nearly all tasks.

 that deemphasized traditional Victorian values of thrift and restraint. Americans instead increasingly relied on credit to buy cars, radios, and household appliances. Radio played a key role in forging a national mass culture. Over 60 percent of American homes acquired radios in the twenties, which until 1924 required headphones. Americans from all walks of life now simultaneously gathered around their radios to learn election results. Baseball fans throughout the nation listened to the play-by-play of the World Series, radio broadcasts that made New York Yankee player Babe Ruth a national hero. Farmers closely followed weather reports, and bankers digested the day’s financial news. “There is radio music in the air, every night, everywhere,” one

 newspaper observed. Big companies like Walgreen Drugs and Palmolive Soap started sponsoring nationally syndicated radio shows to boost sales of their products. These weekly comedies and dramas, filled with plugs for the sponsor’s merchandise, cultivated shared tastes in entertainment and products. Americans increasingly bought the same brand-name toothpaste at a chain store like Woolworths. Big business was not alone in recognizing the power of radio, however. Local radio shows designed specifically for union members, religious groups, immigrant communities, or African Americans helped strengthen bonds within these subcultures as well. Movie stars and athletes enjoyed nationwide adulation in the twenties. Silent-film actors like the comedian Charlie Chaplin, the sex symbol Rudolph Valentino, and “America’s Sweetheart” Mary Pickford became household names among a movie-going public that avidly purchased fan magazines filled with glossy photos of their favorite stars. By the end of the decade, Hollywood was producing films with sound, a novelty highlighted in this 1929 poster (21.3) for the Marx Brothers’ first film. The verbal repartee of the comedy trio delighted audiences. As silent films disappeared, so did the careers of many silent-film stars whose artistic talents lay in physical, not vocal, expression. Meanwhile professional sports gave rise to a slew of national sports heroes, such as the boxer Jack Dempsey. In an era dominated by cultural heroes, none rose to greater prominence than the pilot Charles A. Lindbergh.

The Age of Flight:
Charles A. Lindbergh
 The feats of pilot Charles A. Lindbergh ushered the nation into the age of flight. Commentators called the sky the new frontier, a label loaded with potent historical significance for Americans. By the late twenties, a time when machines seemed to matter more than people, the image of the lone pilot against the vast blue sky recalled the pioneer spirit of the nineteenth century. Lindbergh piloted his plane, the Spirit of St. Louis, on the first-ever nonstop solo flight from New York to Paris on May 21, 1927. Flying without the radio or radar that help modern pilots navigate, Lindbergh relied on a few navigational instruments and looking out the window to locate his position on a paper map as he flew. Sitting in a wicker chair with sandwiches and water under it, Lindbergh had a rubber raft on board in case he was forced to land in the cold Atlantic and a flashlight to examine his wings for ice.

CARS AND PLANES: THE PROMISE OF THE TWENTIES



 “The Spirit of St. Louis is a wonderful plane. It’s like a living creature, gliding along smoothly, happily, as though a successful flight means as much to it as to me.” CHARLES A. LINDBERGH, evoking the perfect symmetry between man and machine Lindbergh’s flight lasted 33.5 hours, enough time to make him the hero of the decade. This photomontage (a composite photo made by pasting together separate images) of the Spirit of St. Louis passing the Eiffel Tower combined the symbol of Paris with the image of Lindbergh’s iconic plane (21.4). “Had we searched all America we could not have found a better type than young Lindbergh to represent the spirit and high purpose of our people,” the jubilant American ambassador wired President Coolidge amid the celebrations that followed Lindbergh’s landing in Paris. Lindbergh’s triumph assured Americans that individual initiative still mattered and that technological advancement benefited humankind at a time when the recent industrialized slaughter on the Western Front (see Chapter 20) suggested otherwise. The vision of planes serving a peaceful purpose by transporting mail and tourists replaced wartime images of aerial dogfights. Lindbergh toured the nation tirelessly to promote commercial air travel, and in 1931 also flew flood relief missions in China with his wife, the author Anne Morrow Lindbergh, to demonstrate the humanitarian good that planes made possible. In exalting Lindbergh’s achievement Americans channeled their own conflicting visions of the modern age. Some praised Lindbergh for exhibiting the same adventurous spirit that had propelled American pioneers across the West in the nineteenth century, values that seemed increasingly at risk in a machine-dominated age. “Charles Lindbergh is the heir of all that we like to think is best in America,” opined Outlook magazine. Others, including Lindbergh, rejected the idea that his flight epitomized a return to the past. Lindbergh asserted that his flight illustrated the nation’s industrial march forward, “the culmination,” he said, “… of all that was practicable and best in American aviation.” Although differing on whether the flight represented the revival of traditional values or the modern ethos of industrial might, Americans agreed that his flight renewed faith in the benefits of technology. Lindbergh suffered, however, in the public spotlight. The 1933 kidnapping and murder of his firstborn son became the most reported tabloid story

 of the day. Later in the decade Lindbergh tarnished his image by expressing anti-Semitism and admiration for Nazi Germany and joining with those who argued against American intervention in World War II. After Japan’s bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Lindbergh changed his position. He flew combat missions against the Japanese, and his reputation recovered among many, when he took a strong anticommunist stand during the Cold War in the 1950s.

 CHAPTER 21

A TURBULENT DECADE: THE TWENTIES

Cultural Unrest
 Celebrating Lindbergh’s achievement was a unique moment of national unity in a decade dominated by cultural turbulence and strife. During the 1920s, societal-wide debates reflected competing visions over what values the nation should embrace as it entered the modern age. Cultural conflict turned political in the twenties as Americans debated the need for legislation to protect the nation’s morals, ethnic purity, and capitalist economy.

The Lost Generation
 “I’ve kissed dozens of men. I suppose I’ll kiss dozens more,” declared the flapper heroine of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel This Side of Paradise (1920), announcing a new attitude of living for the moment that defined the era’s youth culture. With his wife Zelda by his side, Fitzgerald put this philosophy into practice, moving from party to party in his fast-paced life as an expatriate in Europe. The Parisbased American writer Gertrude Stein coined the term “the Lost Generation” to describe white intellectuals and artists like Fitzgerald who rebelled against Victorian values in the twenties and lived primarily overseas. Lost Generation writers used Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud’s theories to justify their revolt against “repressive” codes of conduct. Freud believed that subconscious sexual impulses drove human behavior and that repressed desires sometimes found expression in dreams. Fitzgerald was one of a host of writers including Ernest Hemingway, e. e. cummings, and John Dos Passos who championed sexual liberation as one way to escape the sterile and deadly confines of modern life. Men and women “spend their lives going in and out of doors and factories … they live their lives and find themselves at last facing death and the end of life without having lived at all,” asserts a character in Sherwood Anderson’s Many Marriages (1923) who, in the throes of a passionate extramarital affair, is preparing to end his marriage and leave his job. The hedonistic lifestyles depicted in many Lost Generation novels, while rarely bestowing lasting happiness on the protagonists, still rankled more traditionally minded Americans. Agreeing that modern culture was flawed, these Americans wanted to bolster, rather than reject, traditional values. These clashing cultural visions had strong political overtones. Alcohol remained central to

 the Lost Generation ethos of pleasure-seeking, an indulgence that became illegal in the twenties, thanks to temperance reformers who felt that drinking threatened the moral fabric of American society.

Prohibition
 Temperance, one of the nation’s longest lasting reform movements (see Chapters 17 and 18), took on a new life during World War I. Wartime temperance propaganda claimed that “German brewers in this country have rendered thousands of men inefficient.” Organized “wet” opposition to the “dry” campaign materialized slowly, partly because critics of the temperance movement could not easily counter its emphasis on health, thrift, and morals. Some wets focused on personal freedom. Senator James Wadsworth contended that it seemed unfair to tell exhausted workers at the end of the day “you shall not have a glass of beer.” Other critics felt uneasy about increasing the power of the federal government so it could enforce prohibition. They argued that a proposed constitutional amendment prohibiting alcohol would violate states’ rights. The middle-class AntiSaloon League’s highly structured propaganda and lobbying campaign, however, easily overpowered this disjointed wet response on the local, state, and national level. Evangelical preacher Billy Sunday converted many churchgoers to the temperance cause, delivering impassioned sermons on the evils of alcohol. Sunday, a former professional baseball player, littered his sermons with slang, winning a large following among the rural poor and urban working class, who flocked to his revival meetings throughout the Midwest. The political elite also embraced the preacher. Sunday often dined at the White House and considered the oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller a friend. In his most famous

 temperance speech, Sunday urged his listeners in 1908 to “get on the water wagon; get on for the sake of your wife and babies, and hit the booze a blow.” On December 18, 1917, Congress approved the Eighteenth Amendment, which banned the sale, manufacture, and transportation of intoxicating liquors. By January 16, 1919, the required 36 states had ratified it. By the time every state had voted, only Rhode Island and Connecticut had rejected it. When prohibition went into effect in 1920, Congress clarified what constituted an intoxicating beverage in the Volstead Act (1919), which defined any beverage with more than 0.5 percent alcohol as intoxicating liquor and established criminal penalties for manufacturing, transporting, or possessing alcohol. Congress never appropriated enough money for wide-scale enforcement, hampering Justice Department efforts to curb illegal drinking. The police raided working-class neighborhoods to shut down illegal distilleries, but the well-to-do drank their bathtub gin or homebrewed beer without interference. Many reform goals of the temperance movement remained unmet. Belying the expectation that it would create a more virtuous, law-abiding society, prohibition gave birth to a much more insidious form of crime. Organized crime syndicates ran profitable bootlegging operations that financed beer breweries and liquor distilleries, bribed cops, and stocked the shelves of illegal bars throughout major metropolitan areas. Trafficking in forbidden alcohol, the publicity-crazed gangster Al Capone became a powerful figure in the Chicago underworld, a position he maintained with unprecedented violence. In the 1929 St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, Capone’s men, posing as cops, pretended to arrest rival gang members and then lined them up against a wall and mowed them down with machine guns. Tabloid papers vividly recounted every detail of Capone’s “new technique of wholesale murder” to a shocked public. Suffering from syphilis that he contracted from a prostitute in one of his own brothels, Capone became increasingly unstable and violent before he went to prison for tax evasion in 1931. Secret bars called speakeasies proliferated. To demonstrate Americans’ widespread disrespect for prohibition, federal agent Izzy Einstein timed how long it took him to find alcohol in most major cities. It took him 21 minutes in Chicago, and only 31 seconds in New Orleans, when he asked a taxi driver where he could get a drink and the man replied, “right here,” as he pulled out a bottle. Einstein

 personally shut down over 4,000 speak easies nationwide, prompting bartenders to post his picture with the caption “watch for this man.” Illicit drinking became fashionable among the young urban elite, whose escapades Lost Generation writers helped glamorize. This image of a welldressed woman barhopping with her male companions (21.5) revealed new social acceptance for public drinking by respectable middle- and upper-class women. Americans had previously viewed saloons as male establishments that only women of low moral character, like prostitutes, dared to enter. The competing visions of whether illegal drinking was harmless fun or a vice that destroyed families kept the political debate over prohibition alive throughout the 1920s. Drys credited prohibition for the prosperous economy. By putting alcohol aside, they claimed, workers had become more productive, could afford to buy cars and furniture, and had more savings. Wets argued that the amendment generated

A TURBULENT DECADE: THE TWENTIES

 disrespect for the law as it became socially acceptable for Americans to commit a crime by purchasing alcohol. States’ rights advocates increasingly resented the arrival of federal officials trying to track down bootleggers. Picking up the Anti-Saloon League’s longstanding emphasis on protecting women and children, the wet lobby emphasized the dangers of teenagers drinking contaminated “moonshine” (a slang term for illicitly manufactured alcohol) in speakeasies run by the mob. Better to have them drink safely in public cafes, they argued. The beginning of the Great Depression in 1929, which thrust the nation into an unprecedented financial crisis, undermined the dry claim that prohibition brought prosperity. Wets made headway with the argument that enforcing the law drained the federal treasury. When Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt entered the White House in 1933, he immediately asked Congress to repeal prohibition. With lightening speed the states ratified the Twenty-First Amendment (1933), which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment. The temperance vision remained regionally popular, however, especially in the rural South and Midwest which continued to enforce local prohibition statutes. A few states also passed minimum-age drinking laws in the 1930s, but most states did not enact such laws until the 1980s.

The First Red Scare and
Immigration Restrictions
 The vision of America as the land of opportunity for peoples worldwide came under attack in the 1920s. Debates over immigration were not new, but for the first time the nativist vision prevailed. In the early twenties the United States underwent a historic shift, changing from a nation that admitted over one million immigrants a year in the decade leading up to World War I to one that grudgingly allowed fewer than 200,000 to enter the country annually. World War I was the catalyst that turned longstanding nativist attacks against immigrants into a mandate for dramatic change. Alarm over German Americans’ continued ties to Germany linked concerns about assimilation to the more potent political question of national security. The 1921 Emergency Immigration Act temporarily allowed 350,000 European immigrants to enter the country each year and set limits on how many immigrants could come from each European nation. Three years

 Why did the nation enact strict immigration restrictions in the twenties?

 later Congress made these quotas permanent. The Immigration Act of 1924 allowed unrestricted immigration from the Western Hemisphere, curtailed all Asian immigration, and used quotas to control how many immigrants emigrated from individual European nations. The law authorized a total of 165,000 immigrants from Europe, a figure that Congress reduced to 150,000 in 1929 at the start of the Great Depression. Assumptions about the racial superiority of northern Europeans strongly influenced the new national quotas portrayed in the “Immigration Act of 1924” chart (21.6). In this new quota system, Germany received the highest quota. If Americans no longer feared German immigrants, then why did the country feel compelled to adopt immigration restrictions? The answer: the communist-inspired Russian Revolution of 1917, a critical event that some Americans envisioned immigrants from Russia and Eastern Europe recreating in the United States. To meet this threat, the Justice Department arrested and deported alien anarchists and Communists suspected of trying to destroy American democracy and capitalism during the First Red Scare (1919–1920). Like Communists, anarchists believed that capitalist exploitation of the working class created widespread social suffering. While Communists wanted to create a workers’ government that controlled property, anarchists viewed all governments as corrupt. The anarchist movement’s most famous spokesperson was Emma Goldman, an eloquent speaker who had emigrated from Russia as a young girl. Anarchism, she wrote, “stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government.” Some anarchists felt justified using violence to advance their cause (one had assassinated President William McKinley in 1901). Goldman, however, disavowed armed conflict and instead tried to popularize the anarchist philosophy through lectures and the magazine that she founded, Mother Earth. In 1919, post office clerk Charles Kaplan helped avert disaster. Reading a newspaper account, as he rode the subway home, of two anarchist mailbomb attacks, one against the mayor of Seattle and another against a senator from Georgia.

 ensure that their nationality received the highest quota possible. Official quotas, however, do not reveal the exact numbers of immigrants who entered the country. If denied entry under the quota system, which remained intact from 1924 through 1965, determined immigrants exploited loopholes. The 1924 law contained two key provisions that have remained staples of American immigration legislation: the principle of family reunification, which let resident immigrants bring in members of their immediate families, and the desirability of certain skills. The law, for example, established exemptions for trades facing worker shortages in the United States, such as domestic service. Other savvy European immigrants simply entered the country illegally, often by way of Mexico or Canada, two nations that still enjoyed unrestricted immigration to the United States.

Fundamentalism
 The cultural debates surrounding prohibition and immigration restrictions assumed a decidedly political edge in the 1920s. Christian Fundamentalists added to the decade’s cultural turbulence when they initiated a campaign to stop the teaching of biologist Charles Darwin’s views on evolution. Religious conservatives felt that Darwin’s theories contradicted the Bible’s depiction of God creating the world and humankind in seven days. They instead subscribed to the tenets of fundamentalism, an evangelical Christian theology that viewed the Bible as an authentic, literal recounting of historical events and the absolute moral word of God. By critiquing Darwin, Fundamentalists offered a conservative alternative to modernism, a liberal Christian theology embraced in many urban areas that emphasized the ongoing revelation of divine truth. Offering competing religious visions Fundamentalists accepted the Bible as errorless, while Modernists reinterpreted the Bible when confronted with new scientific knowledge (such as fossil evidence of evolution). Believing that “monkey men mean monkey morals,” the World Christian Fundamentals Association lobbied for state laws that prohibited teaching evolution in public schools. In 1925, Tennessee made it a crime to teach “any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” Passed

 Why did Fundamentalists object to teaching evolution in public schools?

 mostly to make sweeping school reforms more palatable to Fundamentalist voters, the state made no effort to enforce the law and even adopted a biology textbook that included an extended discussion of Darwin’s ideas. The ACLU viewed the law as a violation of the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech. Hoping to test its constitutionality, the ACLU offered to help any teacher in Tennessee who wanted to challenge the law in court. Civic boosters in Dayton, Tennessee, responded to the offer. A trial highlighting the clash between science and religion was bound to attract huge crowds, they reasoned, and by hosting this national extravaganza, Dayton expected to draw an influx of visitors with cash to spend. John Scopes, a 24-year-old science teacher and part-time football coach, agreed to step forward, so officials in Dayton could arrest him. The infamous Scopes trial was underway. Interest in Scopes, the ACLU, and Dayton faded once William Jennings Bryan agreed to prosecute the case and Clarence Darrow arrived to defend Scopes. Bryan was the former leader of the Democratic Party, who had unsuccessfully run for president three times and resigned as secretary of state when President Woodrow Wilson abandoned complete neutrality during World War I. The devout Bryan blamed Germany’s embrace of evolutionary notions like “survival of the fittest” for causing the brutal global war. Darrow was an agnostic, famous for defending both radical labor leaders, such as the socialist Eugene Debs, and wealthy murderers. Hundreds of journalists descended on the town to observe the courtroom confrontation between Bryan and Darrow. Their dispatches helped build publicity for the “monkey trial,” a reference to evolutionists’ claim that humans had descended from apes. Urban-based reporters billed the case as a conclusive struggle between modern America and the ignorant rural masses (few of whom shared in the general prosperity of the 1920s) whose alleged backward thinking threatened to impede the country’s progress. In his widely read reports, nationally syndicated columnist H. L. Mencken regularly referred to Fundamentalists as hillbillies and yokels. Fundamentalists fought back. The carnival-like atmosphere outside the courtroom soon included Fundamentalist revival meetings and performances by trained chimpanzees that mocked evolutionists.

Both Bryan and Darrow argued that they were protecting American democratic institutions. Bryan maintained that the Tennessee legislature had the right to pass any law that the majority wanted; Darrow contended the state had violated the constitution by establishing Christianity as an official religion and limiting freedom of expression. The mainstream press viewed the trial as a showdown between science and religion, with science winning a decisive victory. In their account, the climatic moment came when Darrow called Bryan to the witness stand and trapped him into confessing he did not accept the entire Bible as the literal truth. “We have the purpose of preventing bigots and ignoramuses from controlling the education of the United States,” Darrow declared in court, expressing Modernists’ view of fundamentalism. The national press labeled Bryan a broken man when he died in his sleep five days after Scopes was found guilty and fined. The courtroom, however, had burst into applause when during his crossexamination Bryan had thundered, “I am simply trying to protect the word of God against the greatest atheist or agnostic in the United States.” Southern folk songs popularized this competing heroic image of Bryan as someone who “fought for what was righteous and the battle it was won / Then the Lord called him to heaven for his work on earth was done.” After Scopes’s conviction the ACLU appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court, which upheld the law’s constitutionality and then overturned the verdict because the judge rather than the jury had imposed the fine. Scopes’s acquittal meant that the ACLU had to find a new case to take before the U.S. Supreme Court. After the ridicule heaped

 on Dayton, however, no town or teacher was willing to help the ACLU try again. Tennessee did not repeal the law until 1967. A year later the U.S. Supreme Court declared anti-evolution laws unconstitutional. Although soon forgotten by mainstream America, throughout the twentieth century Fundamentalists created a thriving minority subculture of churches, schools, universities, publishers, radio ministries, and missionary societies. Fundamentalists rejoined the cultural and political mainstream in the 1970s and are generating headlines again with their challenges to teaching evolution in public schools. In one striking break from the past, Fundamentalists now use Darrow’s line of reasoning to argue that keeping the biblical theory of creation out of high school biology classes violates the constitutional guarantee to freedom of expression.

A TURBULENT DECADE: THE TWENTIES

Racial Violence and Civil Rights
 Advocates of prohibition, immigration restrictions, and fundamentalism had varying degrees of success reshaping American society after the war. African Americans were also active, employing new strategies to advance racial equality. A new generation of black political activists emerged, determined to fight back when whites attacked. The Harlem Renaissance, an outpouring of African American artistic expression in the 1920s and 1930s, also stirred debate within the African American community over the best way to improve the lives of African Americans.

 to perpetrators and witnesses, who put them in family scrapbooks or sent them to friends and relatives. Besides buying souvenir postcards, whites sometimes took other relics from the victim, including hair, clothing, fingers, and ears. Both the existence of this postcard and the scene it depicts raise chilling questions about the ritual of lynching. Rather than viewing their murderous act as shameful or believing that they needed to conceal their identities to avoid prosecution, these participants smile openly for the camera. Police rarely arrested anyone for a lynching, preferring to claim that the victims died “at the hands of persons unknown.” Trumped-up accusations that the victim had raped or murdered a white person usually fueled a lynching frenzy. Police had arrested Shipp and Abram for robbery, murder, and rape. The purpose of lynching, however, went beyond administering extralegal justice. Lynching also created a climate of terror that helped whites maintain social control over all blacks, not just thosee killed. James Weldon Johnson, a well-regarded poet who served as director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the twenties,

RACIAL VIOLENCE AND CIVIL RIGHTS

 coined the term “The Red Summer of 1919” to describe the wave of vicious assaults against black communities that left at least 43 African Americans dead. Some whites also used organized violence to prevent blacks from competing with whites economically. Mobs attacked thriving black business centers and middle-class homes in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921, and in Rosewood, Florida, in 1923. A headline in a Tulsa newspaper even helped mobilize whites by issuing the call “To Lynch A Negro Tonight.” In both the Tulsa and Rosewood race riots, African Americans fought back, but enraged white crowds still burned both communities to the ground. Officials in Tulsa declared martial law and imprisoned one-half of the city’s black population in internment camps. After gaining their freedom a few weeks later, 1,000 families spent the winter in tents before beginning the huge task of rebuilding their community. In 1994, Florida awarded survivors of the Rosewood race riot $150,000 each in reparations. For the first time African Americans received compensation for past racial injustices, raising the question of whether victims of other racially motivated attacks deserved financial settlements. With the states unwilling to prosecute the members of lynch mobs, the NAACP lobbied to make lynching a federal crime. Hoping to shock the nation into supporting an anti-lynching law, the NAACP used graphic images of lynchings in their pamphlets, parades, and posters. Southern congressmen, however, blocked passage of a federal anti-lynching bill by claiming that it violated the constitutional right of states to police themselves. This photograph of Shipp and Smith “haunted me for days,” recalled Abel Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from New York active in leftist politics. It inspired him to compose “Strange Fruit,” a song denouncing lynching that Billie Holiday recorded in 1939. Meeropol’s stanzas painted a gruesome picture: “Southern trees bear strange fruit/Blood on the leaves and blood at the root/Black body swinging in the Southern breeze/Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.” The lyrics also partly misinterpreted the image. Although most lynchings took place in the South, the attack pictured here occurred in Marion, Indiana. Indiana was home to the largest chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s, enrolling nearly one-half of the

 state’s white male population even though only three percent of the state’s population was black. The federal government had suppressed the original Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction (see Chapter 15). The Klan revived in the 1910s and became a national organization that drew members from all parts of the country with membership fluctuating between three and six million throughout the twenties. The new Klan organized their call for white Protestant supremacy under the banner of 100 percent Americanism, and their list of enemies included any group that threatened the traditional order. Anxieties aroused by blacks’ wartime migration to northern and midwestern industrial centers, the Red Scare, women’s suffrage, mass immigration, prohibition, and postwar strikes caused many conservative whites to listen sympathetically to Klan outbursts against blacks, Jews, Catholics, immigrants, radicals, feminists, and bootleggers. The 1925 Klan march in Washington, D.C. (21.9), exposed the group’s national appeal. City officials required the 40,000 assembled Klan members to march from the White House to the Capitol without their masks. Like lynch mobs these Klan members were unafraid to reveal their identities as they proudly unfurled an American flag that championed the Klan’s “patriotic” slogan of “Native, white, Protestant supremacy.” The march represented the high tide of Klan power in the twenties. As fears of social upheaval diminished, Klan membership also decreased.

Marcus Garvey


21.10 Marcus
Garvey
 The leader of the UNIA often appeared in full military dress to project an image of strength and racial pride. He challenged prevailing racial stereotypes of black subservience by adopting regalia usually worn by kings.

 The African American community had long debated how to end racial attacks and segregation. In the 1890s, Booker T. Washington squared off against W. E. B. Du Bois over whether blacks should focus first on improving their economic position or demanding political rights (see Chapter 18). Washington died in 1915, and in the 1920s, Jamaican immigrant Marcus Garvey took up his idea of empowering blacks economically. Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) to encourage economic self-sufficiency by creating black-owned businesses. The UNIA organized the Black Star Line, a short-lived capitalist venture that sold $5 stock certificates to finance the world’s only black-owned and staffed fleet of steamships. Garvey’s working-class followers, native-born African Americans and recently arrived immigrants from the West Indies, purchased stock enthusiastically. Poor management, however, forced the Black Star Line to dissolve in 1922. Despite their shared message of economic empowerment, the black nationalist Garvey was much more militant than Washington. There was nothing shameful in being black, Garvey told

 his audiences, criticizing African Americans who used skin lighteners and hair straighteners to make themselves appear more white. “God,” Garvey said, “made no mistake when he made us black with kinky hair. We have outgrown slavery, but our minds are still enslaved to the thinking of the Master Race. Now take these kinks out of your mind, instead of out of your hair.” Like Washington, Garvey rejected the political goal of dismantling Jim Crow that dominated other civil rights organizations. But unlike Washington, who wanted to improve life for blacks within the United States, Garvey spoke often of acquiring enough economic power to establish an independent African nation that could reunite the world’s dispersed black peoples. Pageantry was a hallmark of the UNIA. Its meetings often included a uniformed male African Legion dressed in blue, and female Black Cross Nurses in white. To give these gatherings an official air, participants waved tri-color flags that Garvey described as,“Black for our race, red for our blood, and green for our hope.” Black middleclass detractors ridiculed Garvey’s tendency to appear, as pictured here (21.10), wearing a plumed hat and military regalia. These critics called him “a clown” in a “gaudy uniform” who led “big parades of ignorant people down the street selling pie in the sky.” Garvey, however, believed that seeing a black man dressed as an aristocrat inspired confidence among his followers and challenged the stereotype of black subservience perpetuated by white America. The Justice Department took note of Garvey’s theatrics. Worried that his movement was sowing the seeds of a violent black rebellion, government spies monitored his activities. Competing Visions: Debating Garveyism explores Garvey’s vision for black America and the criticism of W. E. B. Du Bois, a leader in the NAACP who supported immediate integration. Some of Garvey’s black critics organized a “Garvey Must Go” campaign and helped the government convict him of fraudulent use of the mails in 1923. He served four years in prison and was then deported. Without Garvey the UNIA collapsed. Garveyism, however, offered African Americans an alternative to the integrationist vision of the NAACP and introduced separatist ideas that Black Power advocates would resurrect in the 1960s (see Chapter 27).

 Why did Garvey elicit such strong emotions among both followers and critics?

RACIAL VIOLENCE AND CIVIL RIGHTS



Competing Visions
DEBATING GARVEYISM
Many of the traditional civil rights elite despised Marcus Garvey, whom they accused of swindling the poor of their hard-earned money and stirring up racial animosity within the United States. Garvey in turn accused lightskinned African American leaders of racial prejudice, arguing that they could not accept the dark-skinned Garvey as their equal. In the following excerpts Garvey lays out his reasons for urging black Americans to go “Back to Africa,” while W. E. B. Du Bois, one of the light-skinned elites Garvey attacked, criticizes Garvey’s vision. How does Garvey propose to stop “crimes against the race”? What portrait does Du Bois offer of Garvey? In “The True Solution of the Negro Problem” (1922) Marcus Garvey argued that creating a homeland in Africa could solve the problem of racial violence in the United States. 
 In this 1923 biographical sketch, “Marcus Garvey,” W. E. B. Du Bois views Garvey as misguided and inept.

 Garvey soon developed in America a definite and in many respects original and alluring program.

 In these poems how do responses to racism vary?

 Garvey based the UNIA in Harlem, a thriving African American neighborhood in New York City that became the hub of black politics and culture in the 1920s. African American artists, photographers, musicians, and writers celebrated the distinctiveness of black culture. Many writers published their works in black magazines such as The Crisis and The Messenger. White literary figures like Carl Van Vechten also helped black writers publish their works with commercial presses, exposing white America to black artistic endeavors. The African American philosopher Alain Locke captured the creative impulse of the Harlem Renaissance in 1925, when he published The New Negro, an anthology of essays and poems by emerging literary voices. According to Locke the New Negro embodied a spirit of black racial pride and militancy that set a younger generation of African American artists and civil rights leaders apart from their predecessors, who had emphasized assimilating into white culture. Harlem Renaissance writers took up themes previously absent from serious works of literature. Poet Langston Hughes discussed black Americans’ aspirations; Jean Toomer’s novel Cane explored the rhythms of working-class life in the countryside and city; Zora Neale Huston exposed the power of female sexuality in her novel Their Eyes Were Watching God; poet Countee Cullen confronted the psychological impact of racism; and Claude McKay celebrated manly violence in his poems and novels. The poems displayed here show how McKay, Cullen, and Hughes protested racial discrimination. The Harlem Renaissance also included the jazz music innovations of trumpeter Louis Armstrong, pianist and arranger Fletcher Henderson, and pianist and composer Ferdinand “Jelly Roll” Morton. Jazz was an original American musical style that melded African American and European musical traditions. White and black patrons flocked to Harlem to listen to black bands at venues like the Cotton Club and the Savoy, while white musicians nationwide formed jazz bands of their own. Thanks to new commercial radio stations and the growing record industry, jazz became so popular that Americans began calling the twenties “The Jazz Age.” Jazz music, the white conductor Leopold Stokowski rejoiced, was “an expression of the times, of the breathless, energetic, superactive times in which we are living.” James Weldon Johnson’s poem “The Prodigal Son” highlighted the dangers awaiting recent southern migrants, unschooled in big-city ways,

 who flocked to Harlem’s jazz clubs. In the twodimensional drawing by African American artist Aaron Douglas that accompanied the poem (21.11), female dancers surround a young man and gyrate to the music provided by a hovering jazz trombone. The fragments of a dollar, playing card, and gin label evoke the temptations confronting this young man. Johnson’s poem echoed the rhythms of sermons that folk preachers delivered to their rural southern congregations about the evils of city life: “With the sweet-sinning women of Babylon / And they stripped him of his money / And they stripped him of his clothes / And they left him broke and ragged / In the streets of Babylon.” As Johnson’s poem suggested, African Americans expressed conflicting views about jazz. Many artists celebrated the music’s originality and exuberance. Like Southern preachers, however, the urban black middle class viewed jazz as “the devil’s music,” believing that its syncopated rhythms aroused sexual impulses and encouraged lewd behavior. Jazz clubs often served illegal alcohol purchased from organized crime rings, linking jazz music to the immoral lifestyle that many black middle-class prohibition

 advocates wanted to eradicate. The middle class preferred religious spirituals, a distinctive African American musical tradition that they felt projected a more respectable image of black culture to mainstream America. The literature of the Harlem Renaissance also drew fire. Du Bois criticized Claude McKay for depicting black working-class culture as a collection of pimps, criminals, drunks, and whores in his 1928 novel Home to Harlem. Du Bois lambasted McKay for reinforcing the negative stereotypes that white America held of African American culture, thereby undermining the possibility of using art to challenge the racial status quo. Defending New Negro aesthetics and the principle of artistic freedom, Langston Hughes countered, “We younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn’t matter. We know we are beautiful.”

 CHAPTER 21

A TURBULENT DECADE: THE TWENTIES

The New Woman
 Women began the decade with a significant political victory when the Nineteenth Amendment gave them to right to vote in 1920. Female reformers expected newly enfranchised women to care deeply about issues affecting their gender, but the much-anticipated “women’s vote” never materialized. Throughout the twenties Americans offered competing visions of women’s proper place in American society. Former suffragists envisioned modern women playing an active role in politics. Popular culture, however, consistently defined the “new woman” as someone who kept herself thin, pretty, and lively for her husband.

Women in the Twenties
 When women got the right to vote nationwide, an aging generation of feminists tried immediately to organize the female vote behind causes that particularly affected women. Black women had supported suffrage as a step toward politically empowering the African American community. Southern authorities, however, used poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation to stop black women from registering to vote. The League of Women Voters, created by the National American Women Suffrage Association in 1920, drew up a list of issues that it expected to resonate among female voters including child labor, protective legislation for female workers, and cleaning up city politics. This list did not include demanding that the Nineteenth Amendment be enforced for black and white women alike. Responding to studies that revealed high rates of infant and mother mortality in childbirth, the League of Women Voters lobbied Congress for the nation’s first major social welfare measure to help impoverished women and children. The SheppardTowner Act (1921) offered eight years of matching funds to states for classes that taught poor mothers about nutrition, hygiene, and prenatal care. It also provided visiting nurses for low-income pregnant women and new mothers. By 1929, however, it became clear that women did not vote as a bloc. Therefore despite the law’s success, Congress did not renew the program. Rather than rallying to gender-specific causes, the best predictor of how a woman would vote was how her husband voted. Feminists also failed to amend the constitution by adding an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which stated that “equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” The radical

 What strategies did women develop to improve their lives in the twenties?

 National Women’s Party, chaired by Alice Paul, argued that such an amendment would eradicate in one fell swoop all the legal barriers that a dizzying array of archaic state legislation created for women. These laws, Elsie Hill noted, denied a woman “control of her children equal to the father’s; they deny her, if married, the right to control her earnings; they punish her for offenses for which men go unpunished,” such as adultery. Moderate Progressive reformers, who dominated the League of Women Voters, like future first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, worried that the ERA might endanger the protective legislation for women that they had so carefully crafted in recent years, such as the maximum hour laws designed to shield mothers from overwork (see Chapter 18). They opposed the amendment, arguing that it was better to remove troubling laws individually, like those that prevented women from serving on juries or inheriting property. In the twenties, younger women displayed little interest in the social movements championed by their elders. Instead many women in their twenties and thirties focused on their economic prospects. Women made up 23.6 percent of the work-force by 1920, although they remained restricted to professions considered appropriate for their gender. During the decade women were primarily employed as secretaries and telephone operators. Rapid expansion of corporate bureaucracies created a new need for office workers, a demand that the growing numbers of white female high school graduates filled. Women earned less than men, but companies were certain that married women made most of the purchasing decisions in American households. Product advertising in the 1920s, therefore, targeted female consumers. Images as History: Advertising the New Woman explores how advertisements in the popular media also helped define the feminine ideal in the twenties.

ADVERTISING THE NEW WOMAN
Popular advertising characterized the “new woman” as an efficient homemaker, devoted mother, high fashion sophisticate, and engaging spouse with the time and energy for a dizzying circle of friends and club activities. Manufacturing discontent about a woman’s lifestyle and insecurity about her looks was another advertising strategy designed to get women to purchase products. Advertisements that featured attractive women to entice potential customers, as in the Fisher car ad pictured here, reflected changing ideas about

 the ideal female body type. In the nineteenth century upper-class women proudly displayed their corpulence as evidence of their wealth and health. In the twenties, the popular media depicted the vigorous, alert modern woman as thin and tall. But according to a 1928 study, only 17 percent of American women were both slender and over 5 feet 3 inches tall. How does this Fisher car ad both celebrate the new freedoms that women enjoyed in the twenties and perpetuate traditional stereotypes about women? These tall, elongated figurines depicted an ideal female body that was slim and youthful with legs that formed a straight line from toe to thigh, pointed toes, and a giraffe-like neck. These proportions suggested the women were nearly 9 feet tall!

 additional time to raise children properly. Birth control advocate and trained nurse Margaret Sanger viewed the mother’s plight differently. Too many children, Sanger argued, ruined women’s health and relegated them to the ranks of the poor. In her view providing women with information on safe and reliable contraception was more important than dispensing advice on how to raise children. In 1916, Sanger opened the nation’s first birth control clinic in Brooklyn, New York, where she passed out flyers to advertise the benefits of contraception over illegal and dangerous back-alley abortions. For nine days Sanger dispensed information on diaphragms, condoms, douches, and withdrawal to women who waited in long lines to enter the clinic. The police then shut the clinic down and arrested Sanger for distributing information about birth control. Since 1873, the Comstock Act had prohibited sending information about contraception, abortion, or pornography through the mails, and by 1878, every state except New Mexico banned all means of circulating material about contraception. Sanger served 30 days in jail, one of many unsuccessful attempts to silence her. In 1929, after she spoke on birth control before the Harvard Liberal Club in Boston, the mayor threatened to revoke the license of any hall that allowed her

 to speak again. In response Sanger appeared with her mouth bandaged before an audience in Boston’s Ford Hall Forum (21.12). Her silent protest won headlines across the nation, helping Sanger publicize her cause even more widely. By openly discussing birth control, Sanger made public the private contraception practices of middle-class couples. Poor mothers, she said, pleaded for her to share “the secret the rich have.” Studies suggested that at least twice in their lifetimes, women living in poverty pulled their shawls over their heads to visit the five-dollar abortionist down the street. Sanger often told the story of Sadie Sachs (whose authenticity was never verified), a woman whom Sanger, as a young nurse, met when she accompanied a physician into the tenements to care for Sadie after she fell ill from a botched self-induced abortion. When Sadie begged the middle-class doctor to give her the information she needed to avoid another pregnancy, he replied, “Tell Jake to sleep on the roof.” The next time Sanger saw Sadie, she lay in a coma dying from another abortion. Sanger used the story to personalize the extent of the abortion problem (nearly one million abortions that resulted in 50,000 female deaths each year) and to dispel the misguided belief that no “decent” woman needed information about contraception. Rather than counseling women to avoid sex, Sanger asserted that women had as much right as men to enjoy sexual intercourse without fearing for their lives. Contraception would not make women more promiscuous, she predicted. Once freed from the constant strain of childbearing, women would become more interesting spouses by developing their intellectual, political, and cultural interests much as popular advertising encouraged them to do. Through her arrests, clinics, and public lectures, Sanger gradually helped change attitudes toward birth control. Although laws censoring information about birth control remained part of the legal code until the 1970s, enforcement became rarer and rarer. By the late 1920s, 30 birth control clinics operated nationwide. Eugenicists, who wanted to improve the human race by controlling its hereditary qualities, also developed an interest in birth control. For eugenicists, contraception could prevent those they viewed as “unfit” from reproducing. Under their influence many states authorized compulsory sterilization of the institutionalized mentally handicapped, criminals, and epileptics until the 1960s.

ENSURING PEACE: DIPLOMACY IN THE TWENTIES



Ensuring Peace:
Diplomacy in the Twenties
 Leaders in the birth control movement developed close ties with women’s right groups in other countries, just one example of the global presence that Americans maintained throughout the twenties. Although the nation focused mostly on domestic concerns, international issues sometimes dominated the headlines. In 1920, the Senate refused to ratify the Versailles Treaty, which officially ended the war with Germany, or to join the League of Nations, which President Woodrow Wilson had championed to protect world peace. Rejection of Wilson’s vision of collective security through the league did not signal a withdrawal from world affairs. Presidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge tried instead to use disarmament and dollars to prevent armed conflict.

Disarmament
 The high point of the disarmament movement came when Republican President Warren Harding convened the Washington Conference (1921–1922) in Washington, D.C., to negotiate agreements that would limit warships. The conference also reaffirmed America’s Open Door Policy (see Chapter 19) that kept Chinese trade open to all and secured pledges of cooperation among the world’s leading military powers, including Britain, Japan, Italy and France. The White House and press referred to the meetings in Washington as a “peace conference”” to cultivate the image that the negotiations would d correct Wilson’s blundering in Paris during the Versailles Treaty proceedings. The opening ceremonies underscored the symbolic comparisons that the Harding administration wanted to draw between the two international conferences by inviting delegates to the solemn burial of an unidentified American soldier who had fallen on the he battlefields of France. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (21.13) memorialized all deceased soldiers who went missss-ing or unidentified during the war. On the morning ing of November 11, 1921 (the third anniversary of the th he Armistice that ended the war), thousands of Americans lined the streets as a horse-drawn carriage carried a flag-draped coffin from the U.S. S. Capitol to Arlington National Cemetery. Harding, ng,, the entire Congress and Supreme Court, along with witth

 foreign dignitaries, followed the procession. After the Unknown Soldier was laid to rest, millions of Americans across the nation observed two minutes of silence to honor the fallen warrior and pray for a peaceful future. The nation subsequently buried unknown soldiers in the same tomb after World War II, and the Korean and Vietnam Wars. In 1999, DNA genetic testing determined the identity of the Vietnam serviceman, and it is unlikely that the nation will ever have another “unknown” soldier.

21.13 The Tomb

21.14 Looking
 into the Black Hole of Ruin This 1927 political cartoon forecast disaster if the world powers failed to reach a second naval disarmament agreement. In the cartoon the world is in disarray after a naval gun had showered it with gun powder.

A TURBULENT DECADE: THE TWENTIES

Through the
Washington Conference, Harding
 reshaped the political vision of his Democratic predecessor, Woodrow Wilson. Harding rejected Wilson’s idea of using an open-ended commitment to the League of Nations to ensure world peace. He agreed with other Republicans who felt membership in this world body would restrict America’s ability to set its own foreign policy. Harding instead sought to prevent another war by convincing all major powers to disarm and agree to mediation when disputes arose. Harding knew that Congress’s pennypinching mood meant certain rejection of any administration proposal to maintain a large military or embark on a major shipbuilding campaign. What better way to balance this domestic reality with the need to protect American shores from heavily armed naval competitors than by negotiating multinational disarmament treaties? To contain Japan in the Pacific and Britain, which still controlled the world’s largest navy, Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes proposed scrapping 30 American, 23 British, and 17 Japanese battleships. One thrilled observer noted that Hughes had single-handedly sunk more British battleships “than all the admirals of the world had destroyed in a cycle of centuries.” Japan’s 1905 victory in the Russo-Japanese War had signaled its emergence as the premier military power in East Asia. The Japanese, who unlike the British and Americans had only one ocean to patrol, accepted a naval tonnage ratio of 5:5:3 among the United States, Britain, and Japan. This meant that for every five tons of naval shipping that America and Britain maintained, Japan retained three. Besides arms limitation, negotiations focused on settling potentially explosive issues in the Pacific.

 What benefits and drawbacks did the Washington Conference agreements offer the United States?

 There American objectives included curtailing Japanese expansion in East Asia and preserving the Open Door in China. The American delegation met these goals, but at some cost. Japan accepted a smaller navy in return for a pledge that the others would refrain from improving their naval bases or fortifications in the western Pacific. Experts warned that this concession would leave American Pacific possessions vulnerable to a Japanese attack. Hughes, who doubted that Congress would approve funds to improve naval defenses, accepted the deal. The resulting Five Power Treaty (which included smaller tonnage limits for France and Italy) set a ten-year moratorium on battleship construction and limited the guns that ships could carry. The treaty, however, did not set limits for submarines, light cruisers, aircraft, or land forces. In an accompanying Four Power Treaty, France, the United States, Britain, and Japan agreed to respect one another’s Pacific possessions and consult if any dispute arose. The Nine Power Treaty was the conference’s final achievement. In this agreement the above five nations and Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, and China all agreed to respect the Open Door in China, a policy advocated by the United States since the turn of the century (see Chapter 19). The resulting agreements essentially protected the United States, Britain, and Japan from an aggressive naval attack. They left Britain in control of the European seas, gave the United States charge of the Americas, and recognized Japanese predominance in East Asia. For the time being, avoiding an arms race and maintaining the status quo served the interests of the world’s major powers. Calvin Coolidge, Harding’s successor in the White House, continued the Republican effort to find alternative ways to maintain world peace. Leading powers met again in Geneva in 1927 to broker another disarmament pact. This 1927 political cartoon (21.14) offered support for the proceedings by showing a disheveled world covered with gunpowder from a naval gun. This time, however, the leading powers failed to reach an agreement. Secretary of State Frank Kellogg had more success negotiating the Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928), whose signatories renounced aggressive war as an instrument of national policy and agreed to resolve their disagreements through peaceful means.

Wartime Debts
 World War I revealed the importance of European trade to American prosperity, but in the twenties the politically sensitive question of securing repayment from Allied nations for American wartime loans threatened to undermine Europe’s economic recovery. From 1914 to 1925, the United

 States had loaned the Allies nearly $10 billion to finance war-time purchases of American goods and rebuild war-torn Europe (21.15). In the 1920s, the Allied governments urged the United States to cancel the loans. How, they asked, could America insist on repayment when the Allies had sacrificed a whole generation of men to the joint cause of defeating Germany? Americans had supplied money while the Allies gave their blood, they argued. The United States, the Allies claimed, could easily afford to cancel the loans as the country had profited enormously from the war.

Choices and Consequences
PREVENTING WAR IN EUROPE
In 1928, France invited the United States to sign a treaty renouncing war between the two nations, hoping to coax the American government into playing a more active peacekeeping role in Europe. President Coolidge faced four choices on how to respond. Americans had conflicting visions of the best way to avoid another war, and vocal supporters backed each option. 
Choices




 Adopt a noninterventionist policy that kept the United States out of European affairs.



 Sign a nonaggression pact with France as the first step toward creating a formal defensive alliance that would recreate the pre-World War I balance of power system in Europe.



 Reject bilateral agreements and join the League of Nations.



Negotiate a
 multinational nonaggression pact.

Decision
 Coolidge refused to join the League of Nations but knew that outlawing war had strong appeal at home. Consequently he agreed to let Secretary of State Frank Kellogg meet with French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand to fashion a multinational nonaggression pact. By opening the treaty up to other nations, Coolidge avoided the impression that the United States was allying itself with France. The resulting KelloggBriand Pact was eventually signed by 62 nations, including Germany and Japan.

Consequences
 The Kellogg-Briand Pact proved popular with Americans because its vagueness allowed it to be all things to all people. Non-interventionists saw the pact as insulating the country from ever fighting another war overseas. They liked the U.S. resolution to stay peaceful yet make no binding commitments to defend other nations. Internationalists, who wanted the United States to play a more active role in maintaining world peace, saw the treaty as the first step toward creating an American presence in international arbitration bodies like the World Court and the League of Nations.

 When Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) accepted the Democratic nomination for president in 1932, he promised to remember “the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” FDR won the election and took office in the throes of the Great Depression, the most devastating and longest economic crisis in American history. Four years later the photographer Walker Evans traveled to Alabama to document the hardships of three struggling sharecropping families. While there he photographed Floyd Burroughs, who spent his days toiling in the cotton fields alongside his wife and children. For seven years, through the worst of the Depression crisis, Burroughs had struggled to provide the minimal basic needs for his family without government help. To gain public support for new government programs designed to help sharecroppers, the Farm Security Administration had commissioned this and photos like it to show Americans the faces of poverty-stricken farmers. Evans’s portrait of the “forgotten man” aroused more than sympathy, however. Americans had different visions of how the government should respond to the crisis, and throughout the 1930s, political debate centered on whether and how much the government should intervene. Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt both championed initiative, freedom, and opportunity. They disagreed, however, over what government action preserved or destroyed these values. In the early thirties Hoover, who preferred minimal government intervention in the economy, took a few historic steps by lending money to banks and businesses and helping farmers. More attuned to the public mood, Roosevelt initiated a broad array of public works programs and social reforms to satisfy the demand for direct government intervention in the economy. Taken together, policy initiatives by Hoover and Roosevelt paved the way for a complete transformation of the federal government’s role in American society. The New Deal did not end the Depression; that honor belonged to World War II. It was, however, one of the most important periods of legislative activity in American history. Farmers, migrants, and industrial workers did not just passively wait for help during these hard times. They demanded a “new deal” from the federal government that alleviated the sufferings of common people. Organized labor and charismatic populist politicians on the left helped create a groundswell of support for active government intervention in the economy. The Great Depression, therefore, was not just the story of unrelenting hardship. The era also had moments of triumph for ordinary Americans, like Burroughs, who found their political voice.

 CHAPTER 22

A NEW DEAL FOR AMERICA: THE GREAT DEPRESSION, 1929–1940

The Early Days of the Depression
 In 1928, the future looked rosy to most Americans, and even President Herbert Hoover believed that permanent prosperity was at hand. Americans venerated Hoover as the “Great Humanitarian” when he began his term. He left four years later amid bitter denunciations that he cared more for banks than for people, earning him the new nickname of the “Great Scrooge.” The causes of the Depression were complex, giving rise to competing visions over what action, if any, the government should take and how far it should go to engineer an economic recovery. Hoover went further than any other president to date in offering federal assistance to businesses and farmers, but by 1932 his awkward manner along with his refusal to approve direct governmental relief made him appear uncaring to most Americans.

THE EARLY DAYS OF THE DEPRESSION

 automobile, construction, and appliance industries found it difficult to turn a profit. Cooling demand for automobiles soon rippled outward to industries such as steel and rubber. Some of the reasons for the slump lay in the unequal distribution of income in American society. From 1923 to 1929, corporate profits rose 62 percent, while workers’ hourly wages increased by only eight percent. With economic growth now linked to consumer spending, the limited purchasing power of working-class Americans contributed to the growing financial crisis. High tariffs (taxes levied against imported products) kept foreign-made goods expensive, protecting American companies from overseas competition. Foreign countries responded by levying high tariffs against American goods, reducing overseas markets for U.S. companies. When demand for Americanmade goods declined at home, American companies were slow to lower prices. By the time they did, demand had fallen so dramatically that massive layoffs were inevitable. As the chances for making money in manufacturing lessened, investors stopped buying industrial stocks. This loss of capital further dampened manufacturers’ efforts to recover their earlier momentum. Together, these problems revealed an ailing industrial sector. More evident problems existed in agriculture. Farmers’ boom times had come during World War I, when high demand, generous prices, and easy access to credit induced many to expand their crop production. When the war ended and demand fell, farmers were left with debts, larger farms, and falling crop prices. The long-term trend toward mechanized farming also contributed to the country’s looming agricultural crisis. With tractors, farmers could plow and harvest more land on a daily basis. The ability to grow more crops, more easily, paradoxically hurt farmers because overproduction drove prices down even further. Even before the Depression officially began, Hoover had devised a plan to help farmers escape the vicious cycle of over-production and low prices that kept them from sharing in the prosperity of the twenties. The Agricultural Marketing Act (1929) created a Farm Board with the power to buy and store crops to reduce the harvest-time market glut, which lowered crop prices. In keeping with his ethos of self-help, Hoover expected farmers to do their part to keep agricultural prices high by growing less. These measures, however, were too little, too late. Unsure about what his neighbors would do, no farmer wanted to be the only one to reduce his crop and then suffer both low prices and a small harvest. The nation’s farmers continued to plant crops in record numbers.



 “In the 93 years of my life, depressions have come and gone. Prosperity has always returned and will again.” Oil Magnate J. D. ROCKEFELLER, doubting the need for government action

The Stock Market
Crash of 1929
 These underlying problems all laid the foundation for an economic downturn, but by themselves did not predict a worldwide depression. Any chances for a mild recession disappeared in the stock market crash of 1929, a ten-day period beginning on October 20, 1929, when the value of stocks plummeted as panicked investors sold off their stock in droves. This is usually considered the official start of the Depression. Before the crash the stock market promised investors easy profits. When investors buy stock, they own pieces of the company and receive dividends (their share of the profits). Normally the price of a share fluctuates in relation to the expected profitability of the company. By the late 1920s, however, speculators, who did not care about holding on to their share purchases to earn dividends, had taken over the stock market. Instead, they sold their shares as soon as the share price rose. The epidemic of speculation created three key financial problems: 1. The influx of money into the stock market inflated share prices to such an extent that a stock’s price soon bore little relation to the actual worth of a company. 2. Many speculators bought on margin, the name given to the short-term loans used to purchase stock, and planned to cover these loans by quickly reselling their shares at a higher price. When stock prices began to fall, too many investors could not pay these debts. 3. Many investors were speculating with other people’s money, funds from ordinary Americans’ savings accounts that banks used to finance speculative stock market purchases. That explains why, although only 10 percent of Americans actually owned stock, the life savings of millions disappeared in October 1929.

 Why did farmers not prosper in the 1920s?



 CHAPTER 22

A NEW DEAL FOR AMERICA: THE GREAT DEPRESSION, 1929–1940

 On Monday, October 20, 1929, the downward spiral began. Stock prices plummeted three days later on Black Thursday when a record 12.9 million shares changed hands. On Black Tuesday the following week, October 29, 1929, 16 million shares were traded and losses totaled $14 billion. That evening James Rosenberg, a Wall Street bankruptcy lawyer who was also an artist, etched an expressionist portrait of the chaotic scenes he had witnessed.

 Rosenberg’s Oct. 29 Dies Irae (Day of Wrath) 1929 (22.1) captured the panic that swept Wall Street as investors raced to the New York Stock Exchange. In the lithograph the nation’s financial institutions teeter on the verge of collapse, frightened crowds gather in the streets, and dark clouds hover over a sky filled with stockbrokers jumping to their deaths. Throughout the crisis rumors circulated about ruined investors committing suicide by leaping from the city’s skyscrapers, and ambulance sirens wailed continually as crews responded to false alarms.

 To convey the panic that swept Wall Street after the stock market crashed, James Rosenberg employed apocalyptic biblical imagery traditionally used to depict God’s wrath as the world comes to an end. The photo shows investors racing to the New York Stock Exchange.

 What factors led to the stock market crash in 1929?

THE EARLY DAYS OF THE DEPRESSION

 Hoover’s Response to the Depression When the stock market crashed, no one knew that this was the beginning of a ten-year ordeal. The Great Depression lasted from 1929 to 1939, the most devastating and longest economic crisis in American history. In the 1920s, the federal government played a relatively minor role in the economy, and conservative businessmen urged Hoover to keep it that way. Do nothing, the laissez-faire capitalists told the president, setting in motion a political debate over government intervention that would dominate the Depression era. Rejecting the laissez-faire suggestion, Hoover envisioned the government fostering a spirit of teamwork that encouraged Americans to work together as the nation weathered the



 economic downturn. In keeping with his ideas of service-minded individualism, he brought the leaders of banking, industry, and labor to the White House and urged them to do their bit to keep the economy afloat. Responding to Hoover’s plea, industry agreed not to lay off workers or cut wages, and labor leaders accepted a shorter workday to create more jobs. Hoover asked state governments to accelerate their road and public building projects to add jobs in their communities. Hoover also stepped up hiring for long-planned federal construction projects including the Hoover Dam in the West and asked Congress to extend the tariff on manufactured goods to agricultural imports. Congress complied in 1930, raising tariffs to their highest level ever. When other nations retaliated with their own high tariffs, American companies and farmers lost overseas markets. As a result the world and the United States plunged deeper into economic depression. In orchestrating this unprecedented federal response to an economic depression, Hoover stayed within limits acceptable to conservatives. Most fiscal conservatives wanted government-built roads and a high protective tariff and preferred non-governmental solutions to economic problems. When it came to helping needy citizens directly, Hoover went no further than asking local governments and charities to assume their traditional role of distributing food and clothing to the poor. This stance surprised Hoover’s Progressive supporters, given his previous triumph organizing massive international relief efforts to feed hungry Europeans during and after World War I. It was not a question of helping people, Hoover asserted. “It is solely a question of the best method by which hunger and cold shall be prevented,” he explained. To Hoover the American tradition of self-help made relief the responsibility of local governments and charities. When the crisis entered its second year, U.S. Steel announced a ten percent wage cut. Other companies followed suit, and within ten days American business had slashed millions of workers’ wages and begun massive layoffs. The nation’s deepening financial woes convinced Hoover to lend federal money to businesses and states. This decision was a dramatic break from past practice. In previous financial panics and depressions, private bankers had put up the money needed for recovery, and presidents had cut federal spending to ensure a balanced budget. In 1932, by proposing a direct economic role for the government in ending the Depression, Herbert Hoover—the man who wanted to decrease

22.2 Bread
Line—No One Has
Starved (1932)
 Breadlines became an iconic symbol of Depression-era suffering when private charities began providing free meals to the unemployed. Rather than forming bonds with one another over their shared plight, the men in this drawing remain isolated islands of desperation.

 Americans’ reliance on the government to solve their problems—went further than any previous peacetime president in similar circumstances. By providing money to banks, insurance companies, farm mortgage associations, and railroads through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) Act of 1932, Hoover helped institutions that were vital to the prosperity of any community. In its first year the government loaned more than $1.5 billion to these businesses, but little relief trickled down to workers. When critics pressured the president to provide direct help to those without work or food, Hoover responded with the Emergency Relief Act (1932), which lent money to the states for public works programs. Although his farm program, the RFC, and state loans failed to bring about recovery, Hoover had unknowingly set a precedent for direct governmental management of the economy that Franklin D. Roosevelt would expand. “We didn’t admit it at the time, but practically the whole New Deal was extrapolated from programs that Hoover started,” Rexford Tugwell, a key advisor to FDR, later acknowledged. Reginald Marsh’s Bread Line—No One Has Starved (22.2) depicts a group of downtrodden men waiting for a free meal, visual evidence of the growing crisis. The hunched posture of these former wage-earners symbolizes the shame associated with accepting charity. The men stand close together to keep their place in line, but do not converse or even look at each other. Keeping their hands in their pockets, they have been paralyzed by poverty. Marsh based his title on Hoover’s remark that “no one is

 actually starving.” The president had hoped to boost morale, but Marsh’s satire portrayed Hoover as out of touch with reality. With unemployment hovering around 20 percent in 1932, Hoover’s popularity declined steadily. Shantytowns constructed by the homeless became known as “Hoovervilles,” and people waved “Hooverflags” (empty pockets turned inside out) in street protests. A well-circulated joke began with Hoover asking an aide for a nickel to call a friend from a public telephone. “Here,” said the man, tossing him a dime, “call them both.” In the 1932 presidential campaign, Hoover faced off against FDR, a fifth cousin of Theodore Roosevelt. In sharp contrast to how he would govern, Franklin D. Roosevelt ran a fairly conservative campaign and let Hoover’s missteps win him the election. One of those mistakes was the violent eviction of war veterans from the nation’s capital. Throughout the summer of 1932, the Bonus March, a two-month-long demonstration by 40,000 impoverished World War I veterans and their families in Washington, D.C. transfixed the nation. The veterans demanded early payment of a bonus promised them by Congress. The Bonus March ended violently when the army expelled the protesters using tanks, cavalry, and troops with fixed bayonets, further damaging Hoover’s popularity at a key moment during the presidential campaign. Choices and Consequences: Evicting the Bonus Marchers explores how Hoover lost control of the decision to evict the Bonus Marchers from the city and paid the consequences.

THE EARLY DAYS OF THE DEPRESSION



Choices and Consequences
EVICTING THE BONUS MARCHERS
In 1924, World War I veterans had received a federal bond certificate (worth an average of $1,500) set to mature in 1945. In May, 1932, veterans and their families arrived en masse in the nation’s capital to demand immediate payment of this bonus. They set up a huge “Hooverville” of makeshift shacks and tents and staged continuous demonstrations on the Capitol steps. Hoover faced three choices about how to deal with the demonstration, depending on what interpretation of the protest he embraced. 
Choices




 Accept the veterans’ argument that the government should pay the bonus immediately to alleviate their Depressioncaused suffering.



 Accept his advisers’ view that the Bonus March was a communist-inspired plot to incite revolution, and use force to suppress it.



 Reject their claim but treat the veterans as essentially harmless, if misguided, citizens in desperate financial straits.

Decision
 While many in the general public and press viewed the Bonus Marchers as down-on-their-luck citizens, Hoover grew convinced that they were a

 dangerous, radical force. After a skirmish between veterans and the police in August, Hoover opted to send in troops with instructions to restore order.

Consequences
 Once the troops were deployed, Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur exceeded Hoover’s orders and decided to drive the veterans out of the city using tear gas, tanks, and bayonets. Hoover

 never publicly revealed MacArthur’s insubordination. When Franklin D. Roosevelt heard of the violent eviction, he reportedly told an adviser, “Well, Felix, this will elect me.”

Continuing Controversies
 Was the government right to use force to evict the Bonus Marchers? To justify the eviction, the White House mounted a furious public relations campaign that included false accusations of discovering dynamite in the main veterans’ encampment. Some upper-class Americans applauded the government’s actions, hoping to dampen any revolutionary impulse among the poor. But many working- and middle-class Americans saw their own destroyed lives in the smoldering ruins of the veterans’ shantytown and turned against Hoover for refusing to aid men who had served the nation loyally.

A NEW DEAL FOR AMERICA: THE GREAT DEPRESSION, 1929–1940

A
New President and a New Deal  FDR became president in 1933 during the lowest moment of the Depression with 25 percent of the workforce unemployed. Half of those with home mortgages had defaulted on their loans, and the entire banking system appeared ready to collapse. Empathy for the common people encouraged FDR to act, but so did fear that a social revolution might result if Washington did nothing for them. “I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people,” FDR had proclaimed during his campaign. He entered office dedicated to protecting America as a capitalist society, and his vision of government activism came under severe scrutiny from both sides of the political spectrum.

 How did the competing social philosophies of Hoover and FDR differ?

 the New Deal, an avalanche of legislation from 1933 to 1938 intended to promote economic recovery, reform American capitalism, and offer security to ordinary Americans. The chart “Key New Deal Legislation” (22.3) shows the most significant laws passed under Roosevelt’s watch. Having campaigned as a fiscal conservative who would balance the budget, FDR did not have a blueprint for ending the Depression when he came into office. He did, however, have a fairly well-shaped social philosophy. “He had a profound feeling for the underdog, …a very keen awareness that political democracy could not exist side by side with economic plutocracy,” according to a key adviser. “We are going to make a country,” the president told a Cabinet member, “in which no one is left out.” FDR sought advice for specific programs and regulations from the Brain Trust, leading academics who served as presidential advisers in the early years of the New Deal. The Brain Trust wanted to revive the Progressive-era practice of using government regulation to solve economic problems and protect the common good (see Chapter 18). Brain Trust members Raymond Moley, Rexford Tugwell, and Adolf Berle diagnosed under-consumption as the main cause of the Depression, blaming the unequal distribution of income, the farm crisis, rigid prices, and low wages as the key culprits.

 (like too many pointless operations) would do more harm than good. In formulating his policies FDR leaned on another critical adviser: his wife. Eleanor Roosevelt served as the president’s “eyes and ears” by traveling around the country and reporting to him what she observed. In 1933 First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt traveled 30,000 miles visiting Americans where they worked and lived. Two years later, the Washington Star felt it newsworthy to print the headline “Mrs. Roosevelt Spends the Night at the White House.” Over time Eleanor Roosevelt became more outspoken in advancing causes dear to her heart concerning racial injustice and poverty. She invited prominent African Americans to the White House to talk directly to the president about civil rights. Eleanor Roosevelt’s visible participation in political affairs set her apart from former First Ladies, who had mainly served as official hostesses at White House functions. Her activism opened up political opportunities for other women. There were many firsts for women in the thirties: first ambassador, first judge on the Court of Appeals, and first cabinet secretary, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins.

 Americans differed in their reactions to Eleanor Roosevelt’s left-leaning political activities. Conservative detractors advised her to “stay at home and make a home for your husband.” Her civil rights activism particularly upset southern Democrats in Congress. She had equally ardent supporters and consistently won a two-thirds approval rating in Gallup polls—often bettering her husband. Thousands of Americans wrote to her each week, to ask for financial help, or to praise her work. Like his wife, FDR connected well with the public. Throughout his presidency FDR used weekly radio addresses that he called “fireside chats” to speak directly to the nation. After the president’s death in 1945, people stopped Eleanor on the street to tell her how much “they missed the way the President used to talk to them. They’d say, ‘He used to talk to me about my government,’” she recalled. FDR was often photographed smiling and smoking from an elegant-looking cigarette holder (22.5), and the public found his visible cheerfulness refreshing. FDR infused hope into a time of trouble and confusion. Yet little in his background suggested that he would understand the plight of common people. The only son of doting, wealthy parents who imbued him with tremendous self-confidence, the athletic, charming, and brilliant FDR attended Harvard and passed the New York State bar exam after just one year at Columbia Law School. In 1929, he became governor of New York. A personal tragedy in his life, however, convinced the public that FDR understood what it meant to overcome adversity. In 1921, at the age of 39, polio left him partially paralyzed for the rest of his life, and in pain much of the time. His disability “made it possible for the common people to trust him to understand what it is to be handicapped by poverty and ignorance, as well as by physical misfortune,” Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins noted.

 Although FDR benefited from people knowing that he had overcome a misfortune, he also believed that visual images of his handicap would convey the impression that he was weak and physically unfit for his responsibilities. He made a personal and political decision to conceal his paralysis. To hide his heavy leg braces, FDR wore extra long pants and had the visible portion of the braces painted black to blend with his shoes. He learned to stand upright by holding onto a cane with one hand and the arm of an aide, usually his son, with the other (22.6). He would then use his hips to swing his legs forward in a semi-arch to give the illusion of walking. All of this required tremendous physical exertion. James Roosevelt later noted that he often had bruises on his arms from the force of his father’s grip. Father and son disguised their physical effort by smiling and joking as they “walked” together before audiences. Away from the crowds, aides carried FDR up stairs or from the car to a wheelchair. In public he often used his automobile as a prop to hide his disability, and by holding a bar installed in the backseat of an open touring car, he could pull himself up to address crowds. At one stadium rally a ramp was constructed so that the president’s car could be driven onto the stage in the center of the field. FDR gave his speech without leaving the car. The press obeyed White House rules that prohibited taking photos of the president in a wheelchair or being carried. As a result there are only two known photographs of FDR in a wheelchair. This

 self-censorship even extended to political cartoons, which never once depicted the president as incapacitated.

 to help? Two competing images of the poor soon emerged. One emphasized their helplessness and suffering; the other saw them as teetering on the brink of revolt. Countless government investigators detailed the plight of hardworking family men suddenly without jobs. “I find them all in the same shape—fear, fear driving them into a state of semi-collapse; cracking nerves; and an overpowering terror of the future,” reported one social worker. Many Americans chose to suffer silently, making their own decisions about how to cope, sometimes blaming themselves rather than the Depression for their troubles. This portrait by Dorothea Lange (22.8) conveys this “quiet desperation” of the poor. In Lange’s image an unemployed man grasps his empty tin cup and leans over the rail as if he is kneeling at a church altar praying for salvation. The man’s plight is moving, but his passivity is also vaguely reassuring to those who feared angry demonstrations or social revolution. As the Bonus March revealed, however, not all Americans were waiting patiently for conditions to improve. Federal investigator Lorena Hickok feared that a social revolution was brewing: “I still feel that vast numbers of unemployed in Pennsylvania are ‘right on the edge,’ so to speak—that it wouldn’t take much to make Communists out of them.” The Communist Party hoped that she was right. Unlike Roosevelt and his conservative critics, Communists had no interest in saving capitalism. They hoped that the crisis would provoke a social revolt that abolished private property. The 1930s were the “heyday of American Communism,” as the party grew from 7,000 members in 1930 to 100,000 in 1939. Across the country Communists organized unemployed councils that blocked evictions from city apartments, mounted hunger marches, and reconnected gas and electricity lines for workers who could not pay their bills. Grocery store robberies were also common, although newspapers rarely reported these crimes. When the manager of a grocery store in Detroit denied a group of men credit, they ransacked his store. Witnessing the food riot, the novelist John Dos Passos wondered why the manager did not call the police. “If more people heard about affairs like this, there would be more trouble,” the manager replied. While the urban poor stole food, farmers demonstrated to demand higher prices for their

 crops. Across the Midwest farmers disrupted food shipments by blocking highways with logs and pouring milk onto roads. When banks seized land, cattle, or farm machinery from farmers who defaulted on their loans, they needed help from the police to ensure that public sales of the confiscated property went smoothly. At some farm auctions farmers devised an effective strategy to help their neighbors by offering only a penny for the property on sale. Nooses hung on barn doors at penny auctions warned prospective buyers that bidding on a farm family’s possessions would not be wise. “If anyone in the farmyard might be so ignorant of what was going on as to put in a serious bid, a suitably burly man would be likely to step up and put a hand on his shoulder with the words, ‘That bid’s a little high, ain’t it?’” one farmer recalled.

 CHAPTER 22

A NEW DEAL FOR AMERICA: THE GREAT DEPRESSION, 1929–1940

 Recovering from the Depression “First of all,” FDR stated in his first inaugural address, “let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” These courageous words inspired confidence in the country’s new leader at a time when financial institutions were on the brink of collapse. Jump-starting the economy involved restoring confidence in the banking system, putting people to work, and keeping businesses afloat. Following Hoover’s lead, FDR established a cooperative relationship between the government and business and provided federal money for banks and businesses. But unlike Hoover, he was willing to provide jobs through extensive public works programs and to fund temporary direct relief for average citizens.

Revamping Banking and
Financial Institutions
 By the time FDR took office, Americans had lost nearly $2.5 billion in 9,000 bank failures. The new president declared an immediate bank holiday on March 6, 1933, that closed the nation’s banks for a week. An obedient Congress quickly passed emergency banking legislation that allowed only banks with the Federal Reserve’s stamp of approval to reopen. “I can assure you that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress,” FDR told the public in his first fireside address. When the “holiday” ended, millions of Americans demonstrated their faith in the president by depositing more money than they withdrew in the weeks that followed. “Capitalism,” a FDR adviser said later, “was saved in [those] eight days.” “It was the Government’s job to straighten out this situation,” FDR told radio listeners. His administration soon proposed more reform measures to inspire public confidence in the nation’s banks. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), insuring the accounts of small depositors in member banks. The FDIC still exists. The same legislation protected the deposits of ordinary Americans by separating investment and commercial banking, so bank officials could no longer make speculative loans or stock purchases with depositors’ money. This provision was repealed in 1999. Finally, the New Deal tackled the problems caused by an unregulated stock market that had contributed to the crash of 1929. Laws established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and reformed the practices of buying and selling stock. The SEC required companies to disclose financial

 details to potential investors, so they could make an informed stock purchase. The SEC also regulated the practice of buying stocks on margin. Reforms in home mortgage lending practices probably had a more immediate impact on the lives of ordinary Americans than stock market reform. In 1933, 40 percent of homeowners were on the brink of losing their homes to bank foreclosures. In response FDR created a program that refinanced one out of every ten home mortgages and spread the payments over 20 years instead of the usual five. Designed to encourage Americans to purchase homes (and thereby boost the construction industry), the Federal Housing Authority (FHA), founded in 1934, offered insurance to private lenders who financed home mortgages for new homes. FHA backing allowed creditors to reduce the down payment required, lower interest rates, and lengthen the life of the loan. These government-supported initiatives helped form the modern mortgage-lending practices that enabled the percentage of Americans who owned their own homes to increase by one-third over the next 40 years.

Father Charles Coughlin
 Many businessmen and bankers supported these reforms because they renewed public faith in the basic structures of capitalism. With internal squabbles dividing its members, the Communist Party never effectively challenged the New Deal. Instead, the most influential challenger on the left to New Deal banking reforms was Father Charles Coughlin. A popular “radio priest” from Detroit who spoke with an Irish brogue, Father Coughlin gave sermons on a weekly radio program that drew audiences of 30 to 40 million. In 1934, he received more mail

 Besides shoring up banks, FDR also immediately sought to get people back to work. As the graph (22.9) reveals, FDR faced the most severe jobs crisis in American history. At first he followed in Hoover’s footsteps. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation continued to make loans and began buying bank stocks to help banks acquire the liquid capital

 than anyone in the United States, including Roosevelt, most of it from adoring fans making donations to Coughlin’s cause. Coughlin singled out financiers and international bankers as the culprits who caused the Depression. The popularity of his relentless attacks on the elite helped push FDR increasingly to the left during his first administration. Following the lead of the Populists of the nineteenth century (see Chapter 17), Coughlin focused on how existing currency and banking arrangements helped bankers but hurt the common people. With currency in short supply, average citizens had to work harder to pay off their debts. Putting more money into circulation made sense in the midst of a depression. Bankers, however, held firm to their orthodoxy that all sound economies were based on the gold standard, which required that money be redeemable in gold, thereby limiting the amount of money that the government could print or coin. Coughlin proposed a revaluation of the price of gold and the monetization of silver (letting people also redeem paper money in silver, which was cheaper and more plentiful than gold) to allow the government to put more dollars into circulation. Finally he wanted to nationalize the banks to take money lending out of the hands of private bankers. Coughlin initially supported the New Deal in sermons like “The New Deal Is Christ’s Deal” and praised the president when he took the country off the gold standard in 1933. FDR welcomed Coughlin’s support at first but eventually grew tired of the priest’s impromptu visits to the White House. As their relationship soured, Coughlin began criticizing the administration for doing too little to rein in powerful banking and capitalist interests. Many of his followers begged him to reconsider his break with FDR, before they withdrew from the short-lived third party that he headed. By 1938, Coughlin’s star was in decline. His broadcasts became increasingly strident, filled for the first time with anti-Semitic diatribes against an imagined international Jewish banking conspiracy. He stayed on the air until 1942, when his bishop ordered him to cease all political activities.



 needed to stay open. The National Recovery Administration (NRA), established by the 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act, was the cornerstone of FDR’s efforts to devise a Hoover-like cooperative solution to the crisis. Suspending antitrust laws, the NRA established industrial boards for each sector of the economy that brought competitors together to set prices, production quotas, and wages. Architects of the NRA believed these industrial codes would stop manufacturers from cutting wages to subsidize lower prices, a practice that reduced the purchasing power of workers, contributing to overproduction and under-consumption. When prices rose without a corresponding increase in wages, however, many Americans became unhappy with the NRA. Even the larger corporations that benefited from the price codes remained leery of it, fearful that the agency might force them to negotiate with labor unions. To everyone’s relief the Supreme Court declared the NRA unconstitutional in 1935, ruling that it delegated too much

 power from the legislative to the executive branch and regulated more than interstate commerce. FDR’s reading of the public mood encouraged him to depart from Hoover’s policies and offer direct financial relief to individuals out of work. FDR encouraged Americans to write to him, and in their correspondence destitute Americans bared painful details of their poverty and often asked for specific items, such as a coat or shoes. Attuned to the widespread misery, FDR created the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), which worked with state governments to distribute direct relief to the unemployed. Although many Americans were grateful for this help, applying for relief or a “dole” was humiliating for previously self-sufficient working people. Even at the height of the Depression, accepting relief carried the stigma of personal failure. Although they envisioned the roots of poverty differently, both conservatives and Progressives viewed relief with suspicion. Conservatives felt that laziness, alcoholism, lack of ambition, and a poor work ethic created a class of indigent poor undeserving of help. Progressives thought that dismal living and working conditions caused the poor to turn to drink or succumb to apathy, but believed that handouts would further discourage workers from trying to support themselves. One could feel sympathy for the poor, therefore, and still worry about the negative consequences of distributing charity or relief. Like many of his contemporaries, FDR disliked using federal monies to fund direct relief. He always preferred federal programs that employed the poor to those that simply handed out food or money. In 1935, he decided to stop providing direct cash grants to the needy. “To dole out relief in this way is to administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit,” FDR told Congress. From this point on the

 states handled relief, while the federal government tackled the problem of putting “employable” persons to work.

Putting People to Work
 To the dismay of conservatives and the gratitude of the unemployed, the New Deal created a variety of programs, each administered by a different agency, that provided 15 million jobs during the Depression. The Civil Works Administration (CWA), Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and Public Works Administration (PWA) were all founded in 1933. During its four-month existence, the CWA provided jobs that helped more than four million workers survive the winter of 1933–1934 and stemmed growing unrest among the unemployed. The CCC (which lasted until World War II) focused on giving economically disadvantaged young men a chance to gain work experience. It undertook major reforestation projects, constructed campgrounds, restored historic battlefields, and stocked rivers and lakes with fish. The PWA, run by Harold Ickes, funded public works projects, especially roads and buildings, to help revive the construction industry. After deciding in 1935 to fund only work relief programs, Roosevelt created the Works Progress Administration. The WPA, managed by Harry Hopkins, was a major public works program that from 1935 to 1943 employed more than eight million workers, one-fifth of the workforce. During its existence, the WPA constructed 200,000 buildings and bridges along with 600,000 miles of roads. It also funded the arts, subsidizing painters and writers. Thanks to massive New Deal government spending on work-relief, and the subsequent strengthening of consumer spending power, the economy began gradually recovering in the mid-thirties.

 “I gave the best part of my life to the American country, and I spent every cent I made here. They owe it to me to take care of me.”

22.10 Turning a Corner
 Like most Depression-era post office murals, this one celebrated workers as the backbone of the nation. “My interest,” artist Joe Jones noted, “was in portraying man at work—his job before him—and how he goes about it with his tools—man creating.”

 Even permanent government agencies put Americans to work during the Depression. The Treasury Department, for instance, hired artists to decorate post offices throughout the nation. Edward Bruce, who directed the program, wanted to “enrich the lives of all our people” by making “beauty part of their daily lives” when they visited the post office. Post office murals celebrated working Americans and their communities, but eschewed controversial themes like class conflict. In rural areas these murals projected images of prosperous farmers running family farms. Joe Jones painted Turning a Corner (22.10) for the Anthony, Kansas, post office, a mural that showed a farmer using a tractor to harvest a field of golden wheat before an approaching storm damaged his crops. The mural made no reference to the drought or dust storms that ravaged farms during the thirties, nor criticized farmers for overproducing and causing crop prices to fall. Instead, Jones celebrated farmers for growing the food that fed the nation and romanticized their relationship with the land. Americans disagreed over whether work relief was ruining or saving the country. For critics of work relief, the sight of WPA construction crew workers standing around talking instead of working led to jokes that WPA stood for “We Piddle

 Around.” Farmers looking for day laborers also complained bitterly that federal work relief often paid more than working in the fields. Many WPA employees, however, saw government-provided jobs as a right that they had earned. In a 1935 Fortune magazine survey, nearly 90 percent of lower-middle-class and working-class respondents answered yes when asked, “Do you believe that the government should see to it that every man who wants to work has a job?” Roosevelt agreed to a point. He consistently tried to terminate these programs at the slightest sign of recovery to rein in deficit spending, remaining true to his conservative fiscal values. The government reduced funds to the WPA when unemployment dropped in 1937 to 7.7 million from a high of 12.8 million in 1933. However, the sharp reduction in government spending, combined with new taxes and higher interest rates, caused the fledgling recovery to grind to a halt. During the subsequent 1937 recession, automobile production declined by 50 percent, steel by 70 percent, rubber by 40 percent, and the unemployment rate rose to 9.5 million (17 percent of the working population). With no federal funds for new relief projects available, New Jersey issued licenses to beg on the streets. The next year FDR restored public works funding.

A NEW DEAL FOR AMERICA: THE GREAT DEPRESSION, 1929–1940

A
New Deal for Farmers  New Deal public works programs dotted the American landscape with new roads, bridges, murals, and dams, a lasting legacy of Depression-era recovery efforts. Reforms in the agricultural sector also outlived the immediate crisis, part of FDR’s commitment to save American capitalism and create “greater security for the average man than he has ever known before in the history of America.” Americans from all walks of life, however, questioned the government’s desire to help displaced farm workers.

Handling the Farm Crisis


22.11 “Approaching Dust Storm”
 Ominous clouds of dirt descend on a small town in Colorado during one of the dust storms that plagued the plains states and the southwest in the thirties. The storms killed livestock and kept people inside for days.

 Assisting farmers protected an American way of life that had strong mythic connections to the nation’s beginnings as a land of opportunity. Farmers received more direct aid than any other group during the Depression. The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) of 1933 tried to ensure that farmers earned an adequate income by paying them to take land out of cultivation, which the administration hoped would cause crop prices to rise. When reducing acreage failed to sufficiently lower output, FDR approved laws that established marketing quotas for each commodity. If farmers tried to sell more than their allotted quota, they were hit with a heavy fine. The administration departed temporarily from this approach when the Supreme Court ruled the AAA unconstitutional in 1936. The Court decided that the tax on food-processing plants used to

 finance the acreage-reduction program violated the Tenth Amendment by usurping regulatory rights reserved for the states. Congress passed a second AAA in 1938, but by the mid-1930s the problems facing farmers in parts of the country had changed. In the Dust Bowl drought and soil erosion caused massive dust storms across southern and plains states throughout the thirties. During one storm in May 1934, experts estimated that the winds transported 350 million tons of soil from the West to the East. Dust fell like snow on Chicago, the sun was obscured in Washington, D.C., and ships 300 miles out to sea reported dirt settling on their decks.

 in its wake as residents barricaded themselves inside their houses with damp towels over their mouths to avoid suffocation or wore Red Cross-provided gas masks. But even these precautions did not completely prevent deaths from occurring when a duster hit. To encourage better farming practices, the government began paying farmers in the Dust Bowl to plant soil-improving crops like legumes instead of traditional cash crops such as wheat, cotton, and tobacco that exhausted the soil. In one innovative program the government planted 220 million trees in a 100-mile-wide swath from Childress, Texas, to the Canadian border. These trees stopped western dust from traveling east by cooling the air and reducing the wind velocity of dust storms. Bringing electricity to rural areas was another way the New Deal improved daily life for the rural poor. Most of the urban population had electricity to ease the daily tasks of pumping water and washing clothes, advantages available to only one in ten rural families in 1930. Begun in 1933, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was a government-owned utility company that provided thousands of jobs as it built dams that generated power, provided flood relief, and created recreational lakes throughout the seven states (Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia) serviced by the Tennessee River. These areas soon enjoyed good fishing, cheap electricity, and relief from debilitating floods. Government-sponsored low-interest loans enabled rural cooperatives to string electrical lines and manufacture power. “The women went around turning the switches on and off,” noted an observer after one home received its hookup. “The light and wonder in their eyes was brighter than that from the lamps.” By 1941, almost half of all American farms had access to electricity, a figure that rose to 90 percent by 1950. Native Americans were another rural population aided by New Deal policies. Commissioner for Indian Affairs John Collier pressed successfully for passage of the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act that ended the land allotment policies sanctioned under the 1887 Dawes Act (see Chapter 15) and returned some self-government to Indian reservations. The stage was set for a gradual rebirth of Native American cultures in the twentieth century. Overall, New Deal subsidies improved farm owners’ lives. Farm income doubled from $2 billion in 1929 to $4.6 billion in 1939. Although farmers



 still made only 37.5 percent of what nonfarm workers earned, farming had become a much more profitable business. These agricultural policies created unexpected problems, however, by helping landowners at the expense of tenant farmers and farm laborers whose services were no longer needed once the government began paying farm owners to take land out of cultivation. The Farm Security Administration helped a few tenants purchase land, offering share–croppers a way to break out of the traditional cycle of debt that bound them to landowners. But millions of tenant farmers and farm laborers, white and black, had to find their own way out of the crisis.

Hitting the Road
 Over 2.5 million farmers hit the road in search of work in the thirties. Besides families traveling together in cars, nearly 250,000 teenagers, usually young men, “rode the rails” by hopping into empty freight cars. Constantly on the move, these youths found companionship in “hobo jungles” (homeless encampments) as they looked for jobs, lived off handouts, and sometimes stole to get by. Nearly 400,000 Americans left farming areas in the middle of the country and headed to California. Old trucks piled high with personal belongings flooded western highways, demonstrating how completely the United States had become a car culture. The United States was “the only Nation in the history of the world that ever went to the poorhouse in an automobile,” quipped the cowboy humorist Will Rogers. California state officials tried to discourage migrants. Near Tulsa, Oklahoma a billboard on Route 66, the main highway that migrants took west, proclaimed: “NO JOBS in California, If YOU are looking for work—KEEP OUT, 6 men for Every Job, No State Relief Available for Non-Residents.” The signs did little to discourage families from heading to California. Most new California arrivals settled into the nomadic life of the migrant worker, traveling an average of 516 miles during the six-month harvest season. Despite their dependence on migrant workers to pick the crops, native Californians did not welcome “Okies,” the pejorative term for Dust Bowl refugees, with open arms. “Okies” were now subject to the same kinds of discrimination that migrant workers of Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino descent had suffered for years in California. Migrant workers often lived in makeshift roadside camps

Left lame by polio, she believed that her own disability made strangers trust her. Her photographs, discussed more fully in Images as History: “Migrant Mother”— An American Icon, had a distinct political purpose: to cement public support for migrant worker aid programs.

 near disease-ridden water ditches. When the government tried to create camps that offered migrants better and cleaner facilities, some Californians objected. Growers worried that concentrating migrant workers in government-run camps would make it easier for them to organize unions and strikes. Other Californians believed that improving living conditions would draw even more displaced farmers to their state. In 1935, California-based photographer Dorothea Lange began taking photographs for the Resettlement Administration to document migrant workers’ suffering and arouse the public’s sympathy. This photo (22.12) shows a father from Arkansas changing the tire on his truck as he and his seven

 Reducing competition from immigrants seeking work was another way the government tried to help native-born farm workers. In 1929, the government effectively ended legal immigration from Mexico for the duration of the Depression to protect jobs for American citizens. Foreshadowing today’s debate over the benefits and drawbacks of immigration, California officials argued that alien workers held jobs that should go to native-born Americans. Owners of large farms disagreed, predicting that they would face a serious labor shortage if they lost their traditional workforce since few Americans wanted these jobs. Anti-immigration forces prevailed. Faced with the offer of a free trip back to their original homes (financed by the United States and Mexico) or the option of staying in a country where employment options had dwindled, thousands of Mexican workers accepted repatriation. Local and federal officials arrested and then deported others who had entered the country illegally. With the advent of the New Deal, immigrants’ interest in voluntary repatriation dwindled. New Deal regulations made legal aliens eligible for food relief, although most public works programs gave jobs only to citizens. Overall approximately 415,000 Mexicans left the United States during the 1930s, both voluntarily and involuntarily.

MOTHER”—AN AMERICAN ICON
In March 1936, the photographer Dorothea Lange entered a makeshift migrants’ camp and saw a 32-year-old woman sitting with four of her seven children and all the family’s possessions. Taking six quick pictures, Lange jotted down notes about the family: “Destitute in pea pickers’ camp, Nipomo, California, because of the failure of the early pea crop. These people had just sold their tires in order to buy food. Of the 2,500 people in this camp most of them were destitute.” Lange’s final portrait, “Migrant Mother,” was a masterpiece. The viewer has the sense of intruding on an intensely personal moment, but Lange made no apologies for invading this woman’s privacy. “She asked me no questions,” the photographer later recalled. Instead, the woman “seemed to know that my pictures might help her, and so she helped me.” When these photographs appeared in the San Francisco News, relief authorities immediately sent food to the entire camp of starving pea pickers. “Migrant Mother” and her family, however, had already left the camp. In later years, Florence Thompson, the subject of “Migrant Mother,” tried to suppress the diffusion of this photograph because she felt that it stigmatized her as poor. As she lay dying of cancer in 1983, however, her children used the image to raise funds for their mother’s medical expenses.

 In her next shots, Lange carefully framed out the open luggage and trash to erase any suggestion that the family lacked discipline.

 The presence of an older daughter raised potentially troublesome questions about when the woman began having children, why she continued to have so many, or why the teenager was not working to help the family.

 Because they wanted their photographs to arouse public sympathy and support for federal aid, government photographers always depicted the migrants as heroic victims. They were never shown smiling, angry, or as responsible for their misery.

 The father was nowhere in sight, conveying either the comforting possibility that he was out looking for work or the discomforting suggestion that he had abandoned the family.

 This initial photograph did not send the clear message that Lange wanted. In subsequent photos she focused on the despair of the mother and her small children rather than their general poverty.

 As adults Thompson’s daughters believed that this image underscored the importance of individual initiative, not the need for federal aid. To make sure that they “never lived like that again, we all worked hard and we all had good jobs and we all stayed with it,” one explained.

 CHAPTER 22

A NEW DEAL FOR AMERICA: THE GREAT DEPRESSION, 1929–1940

Reforms to Ensure Social Justice
 In 1935, the New Deal moved beyond measures intended to help the nation recover from the Depression to policies designed to correct basic inequities in American society and provide security to ordinary Americans. Reforms protected unions, guaranteed many elderly a government pension, established a minimum wage for factory workers, and abolished child labor. The momentum for these New Deal reforms came from the growing strength of left-leaning politicians, unions, and senior citizens who were unafraid to press FDR to adopt their vision of a more just society.

 The Challenge from Huey Long: “Share Our Wealth” Roosevelt’s move to the left toward the end of his first administration was partially a response to the popularity of Father Coughlin and Senator Huey Long of Louisiana. Before he became a senator, Long was an adored, although corrupt, governor of Louisiana who provided free school textbooks, built roads and hospitals, and curbed the power of the state’s oil industry. “They do not merely vote for him,” a reporter wrote of Louisianans in 1935, “they worship the ground he walks on.” Long supported the New Deal at first, but his dissatisfaction with the pace of change and his own political ambitions caused a break with FDR. As an alternative to the New Deal, Long proposed his Share Our Wealth plan to redistribute money from the rich to the poor. Long wanted to limit every person to $1 million in income and $8 million in capital investments each year. The government would confiscate all other personal income and corporate profits and redistribute $2,000 annually to every American family. Besides offering Americans a guaranteed income, Long also championed oldage pensions, expanded veterans’ benefits, a shorter working day, and government support for education. He created a Share Our Wealth Society and claimed a membership of five million, promising to make “every man a King.” Long argued that under his plan the rich would still enjoy a life of luxury, and even published a budget for a family of four on $1 million a year to show that they could easily afford $10,000 of jewelry each season and a new $100 suit a day. Yet even the great fortunes amassed by the richest Americans were too small to support the kind of program Long proposed. Despite the flaws in his plan, Long tapped into public anger

 at the rich, whom many blamed for causing the Depression, and long-standing resentments about the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few. Long never had a chance to challenge FDR as a third-party candidate, however, because a disgruntled man who detested Long assassinated him on the steps of the Louisiana state capitol in the fall of 1935. “I wonder why he shot me,” Long asked before he died, a question the assassin, killed on the spot by Long’s bodyguards, could never answer. Competing Visions: Sharing the Wealth explores the Depression-era debate over redistributing income.

Social Security
 Alongside the larger-than-life personas of Huey Long and Father Coughlin stood Dr. Francis Townsend, an unassuming sixty-six-year-old physician who organized a campaign for old-age pensions in 1933 after seeing three old women outside his house in Long Beach, California, rummaging through the trash. The combined activism of these three men, and the support each enjoyed, convinced FDR in 1935 to create a comprehensive social-welfare system that protected the aged, the unemployed, and those unable to care for themselves. Townsend’s call for government pensions for the elderly set in motion a powerful grassroots

Competing Visions
SHARING THE WEALTH
Should money be redistributed from the haves to the have-nots? During the Depression, many Americans answered a resounding “yes.” Below are two views, reflecting different visions of how income redistribution might affect American capitalism and democracy. What justification or objection does each give for redistributing wealth throughout the population? In this 1935 radio address, Senator Huey Long outlines his proposal to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor. We find not only the people going further into debt, but that the United States is going further into debt…. And with it all, there stalks a slimy specter of want, hunger, destitution, and pestilence, all because of the fact that in the land of too much and of too much to wear, our president has failed in his promise to have these necessities of life distributed into the hands of the people who have need of them…. But we have been about our work to correct this situation. That is why the Share Our Wealth societies are forming in every nook and corner of America … Here is what we stand for in a nutshell: Number one, we propose that every family in America should … have a home and the comforts of a home up to a value of not less than around $5,000 or a little more than that. Number two, we propose that no family shall own more than three hundred times the average family wealth, which means that no family shall possess more than a wealth of approximately $5 million—none to own less than $5,000, none to own more than $5 million. Number three,… We propose that no family will have an earning of less than around $2,000 to $2,500 and that none will have more than three hundred times the average less the ordinary income taxes, which means that a million dollars would be the limit on the highest income. We also propose to give the old-age pensions to the old people, not by taxing them or their children, but by levying the taxes upon the excess fortunes to whittle them down, and on the excess incomes and excess inheritances, so that the people who reach the age of sixty can be retired from the active labor of life … We also propose the care for the veterans, including the cash payment of the soldiers’ bonus. We likewise propose that there should be an education for every youth in this land and that no youth would be dependent upon the financial means of his parents in order to have a college education.

 In the following letter to Eleanor Roosevelt, a woman from Columbus, Indiana, protests that governmentdistributed relief robbed hardworking honest men to help “good-for-nothing loafers.” Dec. 14, 1937 Mrs. Roosevelt: … We have always had a shiftless, never-do-well class of people whose one and only aim in life is to live without work. I have been rubbing elbows with this class for nearly sixty years and have tried to help some of the most promising and have seen others try to help them, but it can’t be done. We cannot help those who will not try to help themselves and if they do try a square deal is all they need and by the way that is all this country needs or ever has needed: a square deal for all and then, let each one paddle their own canoe, or sink …. As for the old people on beggars’ allowances: the taxpayers have provided homes for all the old people who never liked to work, where they will be neither cold nor hungry: much better homes than most of them have ever tried to provide for themselves. They have lived many years through the most prosperous times of our country and had an opportunity to prepare for old age, but they spent their lives in idleness or worse and now they expect those who have worked like slaves, to provide a living for them and all their worthless descendants…. There is many a little child doing without butter on its bread, so that some old sot can have his booze and tobacco: some old sot who spent his working years loafing around pool rooms and saloons, boasting that the world owed him a living….. During the worst of the depression many of the farmers had to deny their families butter, eggs, meat, etc. and sell it to pay their taxes and then had to stand by and see the dead-beats [who qualified for relief] carry it home to their families by the arm load, and they knew their tax money was helping pay for it…. Is it any wonder the taxpayers are discouraged by all this penalizing of thrift and industry to reward shiftlessness, or that the whole country is on the brink of chaos? What competing images of the poor do Long and this Indiana woman offer?

 movement. For many working-class Americans, their final years had always been a steady decline into poverty. Unable to work due to age, illness, or the unwillingness of employers to hire them, most relied on family members or charities to survive. The plight of the aged assumed crisis proportions when Depression-era bank failures swept away much of their savings. Townsend clubs, formed to promote government pensions for the elderly, barraged Congress with petitions signed by ten million supporters, sending a clear message to the president and legislators in Washington, D.C. Sensing an opportunity to enact other reforms long-championed by the left, Roosevelt attached

 some controversial measures to the bill that provided pensions for the elderly. Unwilling to risk voting against the extremely popular pension proposal, conservative congressmen grudgingly voted for a law that also provided unemployment benefits, assistance to the disabled, and aid for dependent children. FDR wanted to help the “deserving poor,” needy Americans legitimately entitled to public support, a category open to differing interpretations. What made someone deserving of aid in the new social security system? This poster (22.13) urging Americans to apply for their old-age benefits clearly noted that only industrial workers working for a salary or wage were eligible for the new pension program. The system did not cover agricultural and domestic workers until 1950, a concession to southern and agricultural business interests, who claimed they could not afford the mandatory employers’ contribution to their employees’ Social Security accounts (employers paid half). The Social Security Act of 1935 also set the following criteria for its other categories of aid: being laid off (not fired for cause) from an industrial job, being physically disabled or a widow (not an unwed mother) with children to raise. The Social Security pension system operated along the same lines as private insurance by collecting premiums from individual subscribers in the form of payroll taxes. The public embraced Social Security as a system that simply returned these earlier deposits to retirees. Retired workers, however, began receiving checks in 1940, clearly too soon for them to have paid enough to cover the costs of their pension benefits. Ida May Fuller, a retired legal secretary, received the nation’s first Social Security check for $22.54 after paying a total of $24.75 in payroll taxes. She collected more than $22,000 in Social Security checks before she died at age 100 in 1975.

Supporting Unions
 Political pressures from the left and empathy for the poor had encouraged Roosevelt to create the Social Security system. These same forces influenced the president as he faced a different set of choices concerning the standoff between business and labor. His desire to curtail political challenges from the left and solidify his voter base by building a new coalition that included unions encouraged Roosevelt to choose the side of labor in this simmering industrial dispute. Business leaders’ open hostility to New Deal

REFORMS TO ENSURE SOCIAL JUSTICE

 relief and public works programs also prompted FDR to ally himself with labor in 1935. When he proposed a heavy tax on the rich (again inspired by Long), the business elite denounced the wealthy president as “a traitor to his class.” FDR openly mocked his opponents when running for reelection in 1936. “I should like to have it said of my first Administration that in it the forces of selfishness and of lust for power met their match. I should like to have it said of my second Administration that in it these forces met their master,” declared Roosevelt in his last campaign speech before defeating the Republican candidate, Kansas Governor Alf Landon. The general public’s antipathy to the rich was captured perfectly in this photo (22.14) by Dorothea Lange of a gas station in Kern County, California, which displayed a sign declaring “This is your country, don’t let the big men take it away from you” next to the free air pump. Roosevelt’s actions matched his rhetoric. Throughout the great strikes of the nineteenth century, the federal government had usually sided openly with industrialists to break workers’ movements. Thanks to legislation passed during the New



 Deal, the federal government suddenly became labor’s friend. The National Industrial Recovery Act (1933), the same law that created the NRA, provided the first hint of things to come by declaring that workers had the right to organize and bargain collectively. Labor officials often referred to this section of the law, 7(a), as the “Magna Carta” of organized labor because it recognized a right that many industrialists still refused to acknowledge. (Issued in 1215, the real Magna Carta established the basic liberties of Englishmen.) When the Supreme Court declared the National Industrial Recovery Act unconstitutional, FDR signed the Wagner Act (1935), a law sponsored by Senator Robert Wagner (D-NY) to increase the purchasing power of workers by giving them the power to negotiate for higher wages. The Wagner Act created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to supervise unions’ elections for their collective bargaining agents. The law prevented employers from firing or blacklisting workers who joined a union, or from infiltrating unions with spies. With this government protection, the union movement exploded. Between 1933 and 1941, union membership rose from 2.9 million to 8.7 million workers. In 1938, FDR went even further with the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established a national minimum hourly wage (set initially at 25 cents, rising gradually to 40 cents), set maximum hours for the workweek (44 hours), and outlawed labor by children under 16 (with some exemptions, such as newspaper carriers). Aimed at industrial workers, the act excluded agricultural and domestic workers. FDR again demonstrated political savvy in maneuvering the bill through Congress. He attached the controversial wage and hours measures to a bill prohibiting child labor, knowing that few congressmen would vote against such a popular measure. 22.14 This Is Your Country This sign reflected the general resentment toward the rich that encouraged Roosevelt to attack business and support unions in 1935.

 How did government support of unions change during the 1930s?



 CHAPTER 22

A NEW DEAL FOR AMERICA: THE GREAT DEPRESSION, 1929–1940

The Resurgence of Labor
 Government regulation gave crucial support to unions, but the task of building a successful labor movement lay with workers. Overcoming workers’ fears that they would lose their jobs if they joined a union posed a significant hurdle for all organizers. When the United Auto Workers (UAW) took on Henry Ford, a strident opponent of unions, organizers passed out handbills assuring workers that “the Wagner Bill is behind you! Now get behind yourselves!” Ford had offered the best terms of employment with his $5-a-day wages and eighthour workdays in the 1910s and revolutionized American industry with his introduction of the assembly line (see Chapter 18). By the thirties, however, workers in unionized auto plants had much higher wages and guaranteed benefits.

 Ford ruled his plants with an iron fist, and in 1937 when five labor organizers tried to pass out handbills to workers entering the Ford motor plant in Dearborn, Michigan, 40 members of the company’s private security force attacked them. As seen in this photo (22.15), the guards unleashed a flurry of punches and kicks, throwing each man face first onto the pavement before tossing him down a set of stairs. One man’s back was broken, and another recounted how two men held his legs apart while the security guards kicked him repeatedly in the groin. A few news photographers managed to smuggle out photographs of the attacks, thwarting the attempt by Ford’s security force to confiscate their film. The shocking images caused a public outcry. The NLRB ordered Ford to stop interfering with union organizing, but securing industry-wide recognition of the UAW required more dramatic action at Ford Motor Company and elsewhere. Ford’s antiunion intimidation had worked in the past, but by the mid-1930s, many workers were ready to fight back. In 1934 alone, 1.5 million workers participated in 1,800 strikes. Support from the government helped the labor movement grow, but so did a new vision of who could join a union. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) was a craft-based union that accepted only skilled workers, like carpenters or cigar makers, who practiced a trade. Excluding unskilled workers from the labor movement made little sense once assembly-line mass production began to dominate the manufacturing process. John L. Lewis, head of the United Mine Workers, argued that to become truly powerful unions needed to find room for unskilled workers, no matter their race or ethnicity. When the AFL expelled Lewis for trying to organize these groups, he formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), a new type of labor union that organized workers within an entire industry rather than by their trade orientation. Within two years of its founding, the CIO boasted 3.7 million members as compared to

 the 3.4 million workers who belonged to the AFL. CIO organizers warned the diverse ranks of unskilled workers not to fall for their employers’ old tricks. “The man working beside you, be he Negro, Jew or Pollock [Polish] is a working man like yourself … You work together—FIGHT TOGETHER,” one CIO labor organizer told steelworkers. “We were making a religion of racial unity,” noted another CIO official. In sharp contrast to its enlightened racial views, the CIO joined with the AFL in urging women to voluntarily leave their jobs so men could have them. The CIO did, however, reverse the labor movement’s indifference to electoral politics. Now that the government was actively supporting unions, keeping sympathetic officials in public office became a major CIO goal. Recruiting members became easier when the CIO devised new methods of collective action that bore results. Automobile workers seized the spotlight when they pioneered a new and effective tactic: the sit-down strike. During a sit-down strike workers occupied a factory to paralyze production lines and prevent strikebreakers or management from entering the building. Because sit-down strikes caused the employer, as well as his striking employees, to lose money, this tactic brought employers to the negotiating table more quickly than traditional picket lines. Nearly 400,000 workers participated in sit-down strikes in 1937 alone, causing Time magazine to comment that “sitting down has replaced baseball as the national pastime.” When the UAW took over the main General Motors plant in Flint, Michigan, in 1937, the governor of Michigan and FDR (who had just received 84 percent of the votes cast by organized labor and 81 percent from low-income voters in the 1936 presidential election) refused to authorize the use of troops to retake the plant. By standing with the strikers, FDR solidified his support among the working class. Within six weeks General Motors capitulated and recognized the union. Ford finally recognized the UAW in 1941. Having lost the battle on the ground, the automobile companies fought back through the courts. In 1939, the Supreme Court ruled that sit-down strikes were illegal seizures of property. The union movement’s successes in the automobile, steel, and textile industries markedly improved the daily lives of workers, but even with these gains, workers had few material comforts compared to laborers today. By 1941, factory workers earned an average of $1,449 a year, enough

A
New Deal for African Americans
 As late as 1932, most black northern voters (few African Americans could vote in the South) remained loyal to the Republican Party and Herbert Hoover. Four years later Gallup polls estimated that 76 percent of northern blacks had voted for FDR. What had FDR done to deserve this newfound loyalty among black voters? Little, it seemed at first glance. During his first administration, powerful Southern Democrats in Congress prevented FDR from proposing any civil rights legislation or guaranteeing equal treatment by New Deal agencies. Still, New Deal programs offered African Americans more federal and state aid than they had ever received before. Southern blacks usually received smaller relief payments than whites, but before 1933, most state agencies had given them nothing. In the 1936 presidential election, Democrats emphasized the benefits that the New Deal had brought to the African American community, proclaiming on billboards: “Do not bite the hand that feeds you.” Eleanor Roosevelt’s well-known interest in civil rights also helped draw black voters to FDR. When black voters abandoned the Republicans for the Democratic Party, they joined the New Deal coalition, a political partnership formed in the mid1930s among liberals, trade unionists, Catholics, and northern blacks that redrew the nation’s political map. The strength of the New Deal coalition increased FDR’s freedom to pursue his legislative agenda. In the newly elected 75th Congress, he did not need a single Southern or Republican vote to pass New Deal legislation. As the black vote gained new importance to the Democratic Party, the administration became more responsive to African American demands. During FDR’s second term, public works projects hired more black workers. FDR also appointed the first black federal judge and convened an unofficial Black Cabinet to investigate civil rights abuses and advise him on racial matters. Nonetheless, racial discrimination continued to plague the lives of African Americans in

 the thirties. In Margaret Bourke-White’s 1937 photo (22.16), black residents wait for emergency relief during the Louisville, Kentucky flood, while above them, a billboard poster shows a carefree well-dressed white family driving a car. The image symbolically showcased the racial divide that remained intact throughout the decade. The fate of the Scottsboro Nine, nine black teenagers accused of rape by two young white women while riding on a freight train through Alabama in 1931, underscored the persistence of racial prejudice. The NAACP and the Communist Party took up their defense in well-publicized court cases, while the nine struggled to survive inmate violence, chain gangs, and guard abuse. The last of the Scottsboro Nine was not freed until 1950.

The Supreme Court Weighs In
 In 1936, FDR won reelection with 61 percent of the popular vote, carrying every state except Maine and Vermont. By the late 1930s, Gallup public opinion polls offered another way besides elections to measure support for the president and his policies.

 legislation, and two remained unpredictable. By 1937, the Court had declared two major pieces of early New Deal legislation, the NRA and AAA, unconstitutional. With lawsuits against the Wagner Act and Social Security Act on the Court’s docket, Roosevelt decided to act. Suggesting that advanced age (rather than conservative ideology) was hampering the work of the Court, FDR proposed increasing the number of justices to a maximum of 15 by adding one new justice for every one over age 70 who had served more than ten years on the Court. With the conservative bloc all over age 70, Roosevelt’s plan would either increase the size of the court or force the older justices to retire. Either way he would have a chance to appoint judges who were sympathetic to the New Deal. Dubbed the “Court-packing scheme” by detractors, the clash consumed a whole session of Congress and ended with a resounding defeat for FDR. He always maintained that though he lost the battle, he won the larger war with the Court. As Congress debated his proposal to add more justices, the Supreme Court surprised everyone by upholding the constitutionality of the Wagner Act and the Social Security Act. Over the next few years, death and retirement gave FDR the chance to appoint seven justices. The fallout from the Court struggle had negative repercussions for the president, however. Although the Court began upholding New Deal legislation, the battle alienated progressive Republicans who had previously supported the president and pushed conservative Democrats into an alliance with likeminded Republicans. In 1938, Republicans narrowed the Democratic majority in Congress. The bipartisan conservative coalition was now strong enough to thwart new reform initiatives and begin cutting expenditures for New Deal recovery programs. The New Deal thus ground to a halt in 1938, after five years of public policy initiatives, experiments, and reforms. The federal government was now an active presence in the lives of millions, provoking a debate that continues into the twenty-first century over the proper role of the government in the economy and who is deserving of help.

INTERPRETING PUBLIC OPINION POLLS
Claiming to offer insight into the mindset of the common man, George Gallup’s American Institute of Public Opinion began publishing its well-received public opinion polls in 1935. Previous polls had based their accuracy on collecting as many responses as possible. Relying on new statistical sampling theories, Gallup instead interviewed small (3,000–4,000) demographically representative groups in person and through mail questionnaires. Gallup viewed popular opinion polls as a way for “the plain people of the United States” to communicate directly to their elected representatives, but Gallup played a critical role in that conversation. The wording of questions affected responses and Gallup freely interpreted the meaning of his surveys through regular newspaper columns. “What are the main cleavages that exist today in American public opinion?” he asked.

World War II
Fighting the Good War, 1939–1945
 In early December 1941, a Japanese fleet secretly steamed toward Hawaii, stopping within 250 miles of the Hawaiian island of Oahu. At 6:00 a.m. on December 7, Admiral Chuichi Nagumo launched two consecutive waves of bombers, torpedo planes, and dive-bombers. As Japanese pilots approached Pearl Harbor, a naval station on Oahu, they saw American warships parked in a neat row. Moments later those battleships, cruisers, and destroyers were engulfed in flames. It took the government nearly a year to release photos, like the one here, of American ships under attack. Before Pearl Harbor debate raged in the United States over how to respond to the growing threat of war in the Pacific and Germany’s conquest of Europe. Noninterventionists and interventionists offered competing visions of how to protect America’s vital interests in a world torn apart by war. The Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor ended this debate. Questions instead arose over why the United States had given the Japanese such an inviting target. Hoping to pressure Japan into withdrawing from China, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had sent the U.S. Pacific Fleet to Hawaii. There, he believed, the battleships were far enough away from Japan to escape attack but close enough to convince Japan to end its expansionist drive into East Asia. Roosevelt erred on both counts. Instead, Japan resolved to drive the Western powers—the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and France—out of East Asia. In their attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese sank or damaged 18 ships and killed 2,405 Americans. Congress declared war on Japan the day after the attack. On December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, and Germany’s allies Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary quickly followed suit. The United States now faced the challenge of fighting resolute and capable enemies in Europe and the Pacific against whom victory was not certain. The attack on Pearl Harbor silenced debate about whether America needed to fight, but were all the changes the war caused in American society positive ones? World War II thrust the United States into a new position of global leadership. Mobilizing the nation’s resources to fight also created vast economic and social changes at home. The United States eventually prevailed against its enemies, but the cost of victory was high on the battlefield and on the home front.

 “Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.” President FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT

WORLD WAR II: FIGHTING THE GOOD WAR, 1939–1945

The Approaching War
 From 1939 to 1945, war engulfed nearly the entire globe, as shown on the map (23.1). Huge areas fell under German and Japanese control, naval battles occurred on vast stretches of sea, and colonies provided key materials needed by warring nations. Until 1941, however, the United States remained on the sidelines as Germany attacked continuously in Europe, and Japan launched steady invasions in East Asia. As long as the fighting remained far from their shores, Americans disagreed over whether these wars were theirs to fight. Still coping with the social and financial problems created by the Great Depression, non-interventionists urged the nation to put “America First” and stay out of overseas conflicts. By the late 1930s, however, interventionists increasingly challenged this view, arguing that only direct engagement could prevent the world conflagration from reaching American shores. in 1935, and the Spanish Civil War in 1936–1939.

THE APPROACHING WAR

 War I. Senator Gerald P. Nye, a Republican from North Dakota, chaired a series of Senate investigations in the mid-1930s into the role that American arms manufacturers had played in the nation’s decision to enter World War I. Although the investigations unearthed little hard evidence of a conspiracy, they did reinforce the consensus that the United States had entered that war to continue profitable arms sales and to guarantee that the Allies, the powers who had fought Germany, repaid their war loans to private banks. When these European countries defaulted on their loans during the Depression, public sentiment hardened against helping foreign nations. To ensure that trading with belligerent nations did not drag the country into another war, Congress passed the Neutrality Acts from 1935 to 1939, which restricted arms sales, loans, and transport of goods with nations at war (see U.S. Countdown to War timeline, 23.2). These popular laws encapsulated the widespread non-interventionist vision of avoiding involvement in overseas conflicts that did not directly threaten U.S. territory. Depending on the official policy pursued, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans could serve as buffers protecting the nation or as pathways to war. Trying to ensure the former, the 1935 Neutrality Act prohibited the sales of arms and ammunition to nations at war. In 1936, Congress barred all loans to warring nations. The 1937 Neutrality Act allowed belligerent nations to purchase non-war-related goods if they paid cash for them and transported them on their own ships, a policy known as “cash and carry.” FDR challenged the non-interventionist vision with his 1937 Quarantine Speech which urged peace-loving countries to isolate aggressor nations and seek peace. Outraged non-interventionists accused him of trying to turn the United States into the world’s policeman. “It’s a terrible thing to look over your shoulder when you are trying to lead— and find no one there,” the president remarked to

 an aide before he publicly reaffirmed his support for the Neutrality Acts. Non-interventionist sentiment peaked in 1938, when Congress debated but did not approve a constitutional amendment that required a national referendum for any declaration of war, except in response to an enemy invasion. The United States was not alone in its desire to remain at peace. Eager to avoid war with Germany, Britain and France recalled how a relatively minor incident (the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand) had become the catalyst for war in 1914 (see Chapter 20). Instead of mobilizing their armies when Germany violated the Versailles Treaty by rearming and threatening its neighbors, France and Britain tried to negotiate. In 1938, Germany annexed Austria and then demanded the Sudetenland, a German-speaking province made part of Czechoslovakia against its will by the Allies, when the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed at the end of World War I. By the 1930s many Europeans felt that the Versailles Peace Treaty had punished Germany too severely, creating the widespread impression that Hitler’s actions and demands were reasonable. Taking Hitler at his word that he was interested only in reuniting German-speaking peoples into one nation, Britain and France agreed at the Munich Conference in 1938 to let Germany occupy the Sudetenland. Instead of dampening Hitler’s ambitions, the Munich Conference convinced him that the Western democracies were too weak to oppose him militarily. Arguing that Germany needed “living space” in the East for its people, Hitler initiated his master plan to displace what he demeaningly called the “inferior” Slavic “races,” the peoples living in Eastern Europe, and to exterminate the Jews. Intent on avoiding the mistakes of World War I, when Germany had fought a two-front war, Hitler resolved to fight one war at a time. To accomplish this, in August 1939, he signed a non-aggression pact with Josef Stalin, the dictator of the Soviet Union (USSR). Germany and the USSR

 CHAPTER 23

23.3 Hitler in Paris
 Hitler’s quick subjugation of Western Europe brought him to Paris by June 1940. He posed in front of the city’s most recognizable monument, the Eiffel Tower, to underscore France’s defeat and his own power.

WORLD WAR II: FIGHTING THE GOOD WAR, 1939–1945

 secretly agreed to partition Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe, and the USSR offered Hitler supplies for his pending attack on France and Britain. The non-aggression pact ensured that Germany’s eastern border remained peaceful when it attacked Western Europe and the Balkans. Only days after signing the pact, Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, bringing a declaration of war from Britain and France. World War II had officially begun. In April 1940, Hitler began his massive assault on Western Europe by invading Norway and Denmark. He then marched through Luxembourg, Holland, and Belgium to invade France in May. Unlike in 1914, when Germany’s broad attack against French lines ended in a trench stalemate, in 1940, Germany’s Blitzkrieg (lightning war) punched holes in the French defense system and then sent tanks, infantry, artillery, and aircraft through these openings to disrupt communications and threaten the French army from the rear. When German troops entered Paris on June 14, Hitler underscored his triumph by visiting the Eiffel Tower. In this photograph (23.3) Hitler is posing before the landmark, transforming a banal tourist excursion into an act that, by symbolizing his control of Western Europe, carried sinister and tragic overtones. With France under Nazi domination, Italy entered the war on the side of Germany. Through a combination of alliances and force, the Axis, those nations fighting on the German side, quickly took control of the rest of Eastern Europe and the Balkans. As German troops were rolling toward Paris, the British army had escaped capture by evacuating its forces from the French port of Dunkirk. For a full year Britain fought Germany alone, surviving a massive bombing campaign known as the Battle of Britain. That changed in June 1941, however, when Hitler invaded the USSR. Frustrated in his efforts to subdue Britain, Hitler decided that with British forces off the continent, it was time to conquer Russia. Until this point Hitler had fought and won a series of isolated wars, but he made his first major strategic error when he invaded the Soviet Union. Instead of advancing quickly to Moscow, German troops

 found themselves bogged down by the late autumn in a massive campaign along an Eastern Front that stretched for thousands of miles from the Baltic to the Black Seas.

The Arsenal of Democracy
 As these events developed in Europe, both President Franklin D. Roosevelt and most of the American people opposed entering the war. Publicly embracing non-interventionist measures during his first two terms, Roosevelt adopted an officially neutral stance as the war spread. Unlike Wilson in World War I, however, FDR did not ask Americans to remain impartial in thought. Immigration restrictions had limited the number of first-generation immigrants from Europe, and Roosevelt had few concerns that well-assimilated Americans of German ancestry might retain strong loyalties to Germany. Indeed, public opinion polls in 1939 revealed that nearly 84 percent of Americans supported the Allies, the powers fighting Germany, with only two percent expressing pro-German views. Despite FDR’s public declaration of neutrality, in private the interventionist argument that inaction would invite catastrophe increasingly influenced his thinking. For the time being Roosevelt tried to satisfy both non-interventionists and interventionists by finding a way to defeat Hitler without actually declaring war. “Our national policy is not directed toward war,” Roosevelt assured Americans. “Its sole purpose is to keep war away from our country and our people.” To help Britain and France without risking the direct involvement that non-interventionists opposed, the Neutrality Act of 1939 revised the “cash and carry” policy to include munitions as well as non-war-related goods. Breaking with the self-imposed two-term limit set by George Washington and respected by every other subsequent president, Roosevelt made the unprecedented decision to run for a consecutive third term in 1940. FDR, who typically kept even his closest advisers guessing before he reached an important decision, surprised everyone, even his wife, with his

THE APPROACHING WAR

 announcement. He never explained his decision, but the shock of France falling to Nazi control undoubtedly influenced him to run again. FDR’s candidacy and his selection of a liberal New Dealer, Henry Wallace, as his vice president caused grumbling among conservative Democrats, who nonetheless rallied around him in the general election. The Republican challenger Wendell Willkie and Roosevelt each argued that the nation should offer all the help it could to the Allies short of entering the war. Willkie tried to paint Roosevelt as bent on direct intervention, but this charge and Willkie’s anti-New Deal rhetoric resonated poorly with voters. Roosevelt easily won a third term. FDR saw his task as satisfying “the wish of 70% of Americans to keep out of the war” and “the wish of 70% of Americans to do everything to break Hitler, even if it means war.” To accommodate the public’s conflicting emotions, Roosevelt proposed turning the nation into a “great arsenal of democracy.” By telephone and telegraph, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill pressed FDR continually for aid. Stressing America’s vulnerability, Churchill warned that “overwhelming sea power would be in Hitler’s hands” if Germany defeated Britain, threatening America’s well-being. FDR responded as Churchill hoped. Besides selling Britain arms, FDR agreed to trade 50 old American destroyers for 99-year leases on seven British air and naval bases in the Western Hemisphere. Britain needed these ships to transport weapons overseas. FDR also supported a peacetime draft and invited a leading interventionist, Republican Henry Stimson, to become secretary of war. By 1941, Britain had run out of cash, and neutrality laws still prohibited the United States from loaning the British the money they needed to buy munitions. FDR circumvented these restrictions with a policy called Lend-Lease that loaned rather than sold arms to Britain. The United States would “say to England, we will give the guns and ships that you need, provided that when the war is over you will return to us in kind the guns and ships that we have loaned you,” Roosevelt told Secretary

 of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau. Lend-Lease, FDR explained to the nation, was simply one neighbor helping another to put out a fire. No one would say, FDR noted, “Neighbor, my garden hose cost me $15; you have to pay me $15 for it … I don’t want $15—I want my garden hose back after the fire is over.” Congress, however, prohibited the U.S. Navy from escorting British convoys carrying American goods across the Atlantic. Fittingly, given the analogy that FDR used to explain LendLease, one of the first shipments to Britain contained boxes of fire hoses. When Hitler attacked the USSR in 1941, the United States extended Lend-Lease aid to the Soviets. FDR had formally recognized the Soviet Union in 1933, hoping to find another overseas market for American goods. Trade with the Soviets remained minimal during the Depression, but exploded during the war. By 1945, the United States had provided $50 billion of materiel to the Allies under this program. No one, however, expected Britain and the Soviet Union to return “loaned” ammunition or arms to the United States. Instead, the law left it up to the president to decide what form repayment would take. After the war President Harry S. Truman accepted favorable postwar trade relations as repayment from Britain and demanded $2.6 billion from the Soviet Union for nonmilitary lend-lease goods. Russia did not pay its debt until after the fall of communism in 1991. The debate between non-interventionists and interventionists intensified throughout 1941. Noninterventionists embraced the slogan “America First” and urged Americans to remember the debt and death wrought by the last war. As part of this heated exchange, Dr. Seuss (the alias used by Theodore Geisel, who was to gain fame in the 1950s as the author-illustrator of The Cat in the Hat and other children’s books) drew editorial cartoons for PM, a short-lived left-wing New York magazine that denounced non-intervention as folly. Dr. Seuss depicted non-interventionists as ostriches with their heads in the ground, anti-Semites, and appeasers.

 This Seuss cartoon (23.4) shows a non-interventionist wearing an “America First” hat in a bathtub that is jumping with predatory sea creatures adorned with swastikas, the symbol of the Nazi Party. His eyes closed tight, the man ignores the danger, saying with a satisfied smile, “The old Family bath tub is plenty safe for me.” As he moved closer to the interventionist position, FDR voiced similar concerns about the vulnerability of the American coastline. Non-interventionists challenged this assertion. “Water Hazards” (23.5) appeared in the Chicago Tribune, a staunchly Republican newspaper that criticized both the New Deal and intervention. The cartoon ridicules the notion that Germany posed a danger to the United States, arguing that since Hitler (the inept golfer) had yet to land his forces (the golf ball) 22 miles across the English Channel in Britain, the United States had nothing to fear. The false alarms spread by interventionists (the hysterical golf caddy) hurt the nation by drawing Uncle

 Sam’s attention away from addressing the nation’s domestic problems (in this case, playing his own golf game). As non-interventionists feared and interventionists hoped, Lend-Lease opened the door to further U.S. involvement in the European war. Securing American guns and ammunition solved only half the problem for Britain. Because of the number of German submarines patrolling the Atlantic, Secretary of War Henry Stimson warned, sending arms to Britain was like pouring water into a leaky bathtub. When the American destroyer Greer exchanged fire with a German submarine, FDR used the incident to invoke his authority as commander in chief by ordering U.S. naval ships to escort all ships headed to Britain as far as Iceland, which the United States also occupied, and “shoot on sight” any German submarine or ship. Although it remained unclear whether the Germans knew that the Greer was an American ship, FDR denounced the skirmish as a deliberate attack in American waters. “We have sought no shooting war with Hitler. We do not seek it now,” FDR declared in September 1941. “But when you see a rattlesnake poised to strike, you do not wait until he has struck before you crush him. These Nazi submarines and raiders are the rattlesnakes of the Atlantic.” Three months before Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States was fighting an undeclared naval war with Germany.

THE APPROACHING WAR

 War with Japan The catalyst for America’s formal entry into the war did not come in the Atlantic, however, but on the other side of the globe when Japanese pilots attacked Pearl Harbor, a large naval base in Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. The attackers discovered a neat line of battleships, reproduced in this miniature version of Pearl Harbor (23.6) that Japanese filmmakers constructed for a wartime propaganda film that reminded Japanese audiences of their nation’s great victory against the United States. The attack on Pearl Harbor was the culmination of two decades of tension and mistrust between the two nations. Japan’s desire to establish itself as the major power in the Pacific alarmed the United States, which maintained an array of island possessions and a strong naval presence in the Pacific to support its trade with China. Access to Chinese markets had been a cornerstone of American foreign policy since the SpanishAmerican War. For the Japanese, claiming East Asia as their proper sphere of influence was no different from the United States declaring the Western Hemisphere off-limits to foreign powers through the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and 1904 Roosevelt Corollary. Japan aimed to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, creating satellite states throughout Asia that would free Japan from dependence on Western-controlled

 resources like oil, tin, and rubber. In the 1920s the United States and Japan mediated their differences, with Japan agreeing to reduce the size of its navy and renouncing war as an instrument of foreign policy (see Chapter 21). The Japanese army’s 1931 invasion of Chinese-held Manchuria (land long disputed by China, Russia, and Japan), however, signaled the beginning of a direct confrontation between Japan and the United States. Claiming that Manchuria rightfully belonged to Japan, the Japanese army assumed control of all raw materials and industry to support Japan’s military endeavors. In July 1937, Japan attacked China, unleashing a brutal war of conquest. During the infamous Rape of Nanking, a Chinese city, over 250,000 Chinese perished, including 20,000 women, who were raped, tortured, and then executed. “Soldiers impaled babies on bayonets and tossed them still alive into pots of boiling water,” a Japanese soldier later admitted. The Japanese killed more than six million Chinese over the next eight years. American sympathy for Chinese victims and concern over protecting American economic interests in Asia coincided with rising tensions in Europe. By 1940, aiding Britain had become FDR’s foreign policy priority. Containing Japan through escalating economic sanctions and warnings, FDR reasoned, was the best way to defuse the situation in the Pacific,

 CHAPTER 23

 so the nation could focus on the war in the Atlantic and Europe. Hoping that a show of force would convince Japan to abandon its imperialist ambitions, the United States began building ships and stationed the Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, 2,500 miles from California (see 23.1). Roosevelt also sent aid to China and in July 1940 imposed a limited embargo on scrap iron and high-octane aviation fuel to Japan. Japan was not deterred. Instead of withdrawing from China, Japan seized parts of French Indochina, in present-day Vietnam. In response, on September 26, 1940, the United States announced a total embargo on scrap metal shipments to Japan. The following day Tokyo signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, an agreement dedicated to “the establishment of a new order” in East Asia and Europe. Aimed at offering mutual aid if the United States attacked, the pact did not lead to strategic coordination between the European and Asian theaters of war. Japan and Germany shared mutual enemies during the war, but little else. When Japan strengthened its occupation of French Indochina in the summer of 1941, the American government froze Japanese assets in the United States and stopped oil shipments (which accounted for four-fifths of Japan’s oil supply). Diplomatic exchanges continued until the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbor, even though Japan decided in September to launch an expansionist war into resource-rich Southeast Asia to push the United States, the Netherlands, and Britain out of the region. The Japanese calculation that the United States would withdraw from East Asia after a devastating attack on Pearl Harbor proved as faulty as the American belief that sanctions would prevent a war with Japan. The assault on Pearl Harbor ended all debate over entering the war. Having agonized over how far to pull the country toward war, Roosevelt reportedly told an aide that the attack took the matter “entirely

 out of his hands, because the Japanese had made the decision for him.” Despite catching the Americans by surprise, the Japanese victory at Pearl Harbor was far from complete. Although the attack prevented the United States from interfering with Japan’s subsequent invasion of Southeast Asia, Japan failed to destroy America’s Pacific Fleet. Fearing a counterattack Nagumo, on the day of the attack, called off a third air strike on storage tanks containing millions of gallons of fuel oil and on repair facilities. Most American sailors in Hawaii survived the attack, and the navy eventually repaired six of the eight damaged battleships. In another stroke of luck, the Pacific Fleet’s two aircraft carriers were at sea and escaped the attack. The navy also had eleven battleships and two aircraft carriers stationed elsewhere to defend the nation from further attack. Nonetheless, the short-term damage was severe. Over the next 24 hours, Japan attacked American, British, and Dutch territories throughout Southeast Asia. While the attack on Pearl Harbor horrified Americans, it brought hope to the British. Churchill knew immediately that the United States would soon be in the war against Germany. After Pearl Harbor die-hard non-interventionists questioned whether the Japanese attack could have been prevented. Charges of dereliction of duty against the commanders of Pearl Harbor and suspicions that Roosevelt had allowed the attack to take place to enter the war against Hitler (through the back door) surfaced. By early December, American commanders expected a Japanese attack against American Pacific possessions. Most intelligence data, however, indicated that the Japanese would invade the Philippines and mainland Southeast Asia, as they subsequently did. American officials simply overlooked the few bits of information indicating that Hawaii was both a possible and a probable first target.

ON THE HOME FRONT



On the Home Front
 The U.S. government made the formal declaration of war, but winning it required the active participation of the American people. Americans remember World War II as the “good war” not only because it ended the Depression, but also because it united the nation against its enemies. While unified in the desire to prevail on the battlefield, Americans embraced conflicting visions that kept ethnic, gender, race, and class divisions intact.

Images of the Enemy
 Americans had long exhibited disdain for Asian immigrants and Americans of Asian descent. Before the war discriminatory laws targeted Asian immigrants and their American-born children. These laws segregated swimming pools and dance halls, denied Asians the right to own land, prohibited intermarriage with whites, and prevented Asian immigrants from becoming citizens. The attack on Pearl Harbor provoked more virulent expressions of hatred for the Japanese, leading to even greater discrimination. In the opening days of the war, Life and Time magazines offered the nation a crash course in “how to tell a Chinese from a Jap.” Understanding the difference was crucial, Life magazine asserted, to protect the Chinese Americans, “whose homeland is our staunch ally,” from unwarranted attacks. As the Chinese embassy prepared to hand out identification buttons for Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans to wear, Life and Time instructed the nation in distinguishing pseudoscientific, stereotypical “racial” characteristics. Life used photos (23.7) to compare the facial features and expressions of a Chinese civil servant with those of General Hideki Tojo, the prime minister who ruled Japan until 1944. The magazine called on readers to note Tojo’s heavy beard and cheekbones and humorless expression, all supposedly key traits of Japanese physiognomy. Time and Life were not alone in feeling a sudden need to distinguish members of the “yellow race.” Congress lifted the ban on Chinese naturalization and granted China an annual quota of 105 immigrants a year. This act symbolically differentiated the Chinese from the Japanese (banned as immigrants in 1924 and prohibited from becoming naturalized citizens, see Chapters 19 and 21), but protected the nation from any substantial increase in Chinese immigration. Renewed outrage against Japan greeted news of atrocities in the Pacific war, such as the April 1942

 23.7 “How to Tell Japs from the Chinese” Lamenting the American tendency to lump all Asians together, Life magazine analyzed the facial features of Chinese and Japanese men to instruct readers in the difference between the two groups—one an ally, the other the enemy.

 soldiers finally surrendered their position on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines, their Japanese captors forced the sick, starving troops to walk almost 90 miles through the intense heat and jungle to a prisoner of war camp. Out of 70,000 men who began the trek, between 5,000 and 11,000 succumbed to illness, starvation, and beatings from Japanese soldiers. Still these horrors were not enough to explain Americans’ deep-seated hatred for the Japanese. “In Europe we felt that our enemies, horrible and deadly as they were, were still people,” Ernie Pyle wrote in one of his newspaper columns toward the end of the war. “But out here I soon gathered that the Japanese were looked upon as something subhuman and repulsive; the way some people feel about cockroaches or mice.” As Pyle noted, general views toward the Germans were decidedly different.

 In the immediate wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Americans were eager for explanations. Rumors circulated that Japanese-American farmers on Hawaii had plowed arrows in their fields to show Japanese pilots the way to military installations. Yet no evidence of internal spying ever surfaced, and suggestions that the government round up and quarantine these Hawaiian residents went nowhere. Composing one-third of Hawaii’s population, people of Japanese descent were too important to the local economy to deport, and there were no ships available to transport replacement workers to the islands. The 110,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans who lived in California, Oregon, and Washington, where they were less vital to the economy, met a different fate. The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, air raid sirens wailed in San Francisco. Then, when a Japanese submarine torpedoed an American ship off the California coast, Americans feared that the West Coast would soon be under attack. Frenzied officials instituted blackouts; Coast Guard units patrolled the seas. Throughout the war West Coast defense factories camouflaged their plants, as illustrated in these “Plant Camouflage, Before and After” photos (23.8). This aircraft factory in Burbank, California, stretched a tarp over its facilities to make it look like suburban housing from the air. The camouflagers hoped to fool an attacking Japanese pilot seeking a more recognizable military target. Within this atmosphere of heightened anxiety, many viewed Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans on the West Coast as potential enemy agents. Increasingly the larger public and the government believed that their presence near vital ports and military bases posed a threat to national security. On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, permitting the military to declare certain areas off-limits to any or all persons. General John L. DeWitt, head of the Western Defense Command, immediately declared the entire West Coast a military zone closed to “all persons of Japanese ancestry, both alien and non-alien.” His order called for the evacuation of anyone of Japanese descent; even orphanages had to relocate Japanese-American babies. In mid-March 1942, Roosevelt created the War Relocation Authority to oversee the forced removal

 of 38,000 Japanese immigrants and 72,000 JapaneseAmerican citizens to internment camps, where they were held under armed guard. Posted “Instructions to All Persons of Japanese Ancestry” informed Japanese inhabitants that they had only a few days to sell their belongings and settle their affairs. “It is difficult to describe the feeling of despair and humiliation experienced by all of us,” one internee later said, “as we watched the Caucasians coming to look over our possessions and offering such nominal amounts knowing we had no recourse but to accept whatever they were offering.” Evacuees could take only what they could carry. With numbers pinned on their coats, they rode trains to recently abandoned stables or stockyards to await transport to one of ten internment camps in remote areas of the interior West. Offering a conflicting vision that emphasized their loyalty to the United States, most Japanese and Japanese Americans complied quietly with the evacuation order. A few, however, registered their protest against this wholesale violation of their civil rights. For propaganda purposes the Office of War Information hired photographer Dorothea Lange to document that the government was treating evacuees humanely as it contained this suspect population. Sympathetic to the plight of Japanese Americans, Lange managed to capture this scene (23.9) of a Japanese-American veteran reporting to a Santa Anita assembly center in his old military uniform, a silent demonstration of his longstanding loyalty to the country. In January 1943, the army decided to recruit Nisei men, the American-born children of Japanese immigrants. While their parents remained in the camps, these men joined with Japanese Americans from Hawaii to form the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which became the most decorated American unit in the nation’s history. These men opted to prove their loyalty by fighting for their country in Europe. Other Japanese Americans sought redress in the courts, but the Supreme Court upheld the government’s evacuation policy in 1944. Competing Visions: Civil Liberties and National Security Clash (page 696) examines this civil liberties controversy in more detail. As the tide of the war began to turn in America’s favor, the justification for interning people of Japanese descent weakened. In 1945, the government let inmates return to the West Coast. In 1948, the government offered some restitution to those who had lost homes or businesses. It took until 1988, however, for Congress to offer an apology and a reparation payment of $20,000 to each of the 60,000 surviving internees.



Prosperity, Scarcity, and
Opportunities for Women
 Japanese Americans were among the few to suffer financially from the war. For most Americans jobs were plentiful and wages high. During the war the nation’s gross national product rose 60 percent, and 17 million new jobs were created. To mobilize the economy, the government quickly established a slew of agencies to allocate scarce resources, help businesses convert factories to a wartime footing, and enlist the public’s support for the war. After the difficult years of the Depression, the war-fueled boom was a welcome relief. “People are crazy with money,” one store owner exclaimed. “They don’t care what they buy. They purchase things … just for the fun of spending.” Madison Avenue advertising firms assured the public that consumerism was essential to the American way of life. “Will you ever own another car?” asked one ad. “Another radio? Another gleaming new refrigerator? Those who live under dictators merely dream of such possessions.” Concerns over unemployment gave way to worries about inflation as the money flowing into the economy sent prices soaring. The government tried to curb inflation by instituting price and wage controls. Because the nation’s resources were now being poured into producing military equipment and supplying the troops, consumers faced shortages of all kinds. To deal with the scarcity of resources, the government rationed many goods, including gas, butter, and sugar, by distributing coupon books that allotted families a set amount of each item.

CIVIL LIBERTIES AND NATIONAL SECURITY CLASH
In Korematsu v. United States (1944), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of relocating and interning Japanese Americans as a justifiable military measure. Three justices dissented from the majority opinion, concluding that internment violated the constitutional rights of Japanese-American citizens. Which side made the stronger argument? How has America resolved a similar dilemma over national security versus civil rights in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks (see Chapter 29)? Justice Hugo Black wrote the majority opinion that upheld the constitutionality of interning Japanese Americans. Exclusion of those of Japanese origin was deemed necessary because of the presence of an unascertained number of disloyal members of the group, most of whom we have no doubt were loyal to this country.… We are not unmindful of the hardships imposed by it upon a large group of American citizens.… But hardships are part of war, and war is an aggregation of hardships. All citizens alike, both in and out of uniform, feel the impact of war in greater or lesser measure. Citizenship has its responsibilities as well as its privileges, and in time of war the burden is always heavier. Compulsory exclusion of large groups of citizens from their homes, except under circumstances of direct emergency and peril, is inconsistent with our basic governmental institutions. But when under conditions of modern warfare our shores are threatened by hostile forces, the power to protect must be commensurate with the threatened danger.… Regardless of the true nature of the assembly and relocation centers—and we deem it unjustifiable to call them concentration camps with all the ugly connotations that term implies…. Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race. He was excluded because we are at war with the Japanese Empire, because the properly constituted military authorities feared an invasion of our West Coast and felt constrained to take proper security measures, because they decided that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West Coast temporarily, and finally, because Congress, reposing its confidence in this time of war in our military leaders—as inevitably it must—determined that they should have the power to do just this. There was evidence of disloyalty on the part of some, the military authorities considered that the need for action was great, and time was short. We cannot—by availing ourselves of the calm perspective of hindsight—now say that at that time these actions were unjustified. 
 Did a legitimate military reason exist to place Japanese Americans in internment camps?

 Justice Frank Murphy dissented, arguing that internment was racially motivated. This exclusion of “all persons of Japanese ancestry, both alien and non-alien,” from the Pacific Coast area on a plea of military necessity in the absence of martial law ought not to be approved. Such exclusion goes over “the very brink of constitutional power” and falls into the ugly abyss of racism … it is essential that there be definite limits to military discretion, especially where martial law has not been declared. Individuals must not be left impoverished of their constitutional rights on plea of military necessity that has neither substance nor support.… No one denies, of course, that there were some disloyal persons of Japanese descent on the Pacific Coast who did all in their power to aid their ancestral land. Similar disloyal activities have been engaged in by many persons of German, Italian and even more pioneer stock in our country. But to infer that examples of individual disloyalty prove group disloyalty and justify discriminatory action against the entire group is to deny that under our system of law individual guilt is the sole basis for deprivation of rights.… To give constitutional sanction to that inference in this case, however well-intentioned may have been the military command on the Pacific Coast, is to adopt one of the cruelest of the rationales used by our enemies to destroy the dignity of the individual and to encourage and open the door to discriminatory actions against other minority groups in the passions of tomorrow.… I dissent, therefore, from this legalization of racism. Racial discrimination in any form and in Japanese-American girl any degree has no justifiable part saying the Pledge of whatever in our democratic way Allegiance of life.

23.10 Norman Rockwell, “Rosie,” Saturday Evening Post, 1943.
 The lyrics to a popular 1942 song, “There’s something true about/Red, white, and blue about/Rosie the Riveter,” inspired Rockwell to set his Rosie against the backdrop of an American flag and place her foot on Hitler’s Mein Kampf. Rockwell thus assured Americans that patriotism, rather than money or career ambitions, encouraged women to take factory jobs.

 To save wool, cotton, and nylon, the War Production Board (WPB) dictated fashion trends by forbidding tailors to make cuffs, vests, or double-breasted jackets for men. The WPB’s demand that bathing suit manufacturers use ten percent less material meant that skintight onepiece bathing suits replaced billowing bathing costumes on beaches. Skirt hemlines also rose to save fabric. The government spent as never before, expanding the federal budget from $9 billion in 1939 to $106 billion by 1945. As in World War I, the nation used conscription to fill the ranks and enlisted the help of big business to provide the guns, tanks, ships, airplanes, and bullets that a modern army needed. Numbers help convey the immensity of the American war effort. The military grew from 227,000 to 16 million, of whom 10 million were conscripted. American industry produced 77,000 ships, 300,000 airplanes, 2.5 million trucks, and 20 million small arms for the American and Allied armed forces. Nearly 15 million civilians relocated during the war to take advantage of opportunities in cities with booming wartime industries such as Los Angeles, New Orleans, Seattle, Detroit, and Philadelphia. The sudden growth of many cities forced hundreds of thousands of recent migrants to live in “the backs of stores, in public buildings, warehouses, and garages,” the Bureau of Labor reported.

 Nearly 19 million women held jobs during the war, for the moment a record high. Many of these women would have worked anyway. Only three million new female workers entered the wartime workforce. Norman Rockwell’s cover illustration for the Saturday Evening Post’s 1943 Memorial Day edition (23.10) introduced the public to “Rosie the Riveter,” an iconic figure representing all female defense workers. Rosie is strong and confident, containing both masculine and feminine attributes. Her bulging biceps offer assurance that she has mastered the skill of shooting rivets through sheets of metal to fasten them together, traditionally a job for men. But she also wears lipstick and rouge as she munches her home-made sandwich, demonstrating her feminine interest in cosmetics and cooking. Rockwell’s Rosie wears no wedding ring, and most working women were single. The War Manpower Commission, a wartime agency charged with keeping American workers on the job, tried with mixed success to lure “Mrs. Stay-atHome” into the wartime 23.11 “Mothers at Work” workforce. Many moth- As the war drew to a close, official posters and private ers, however, expressed advertisements encouraged women to revert to their traditional roles as homemakers. mixed feelings about leaving their children in day care. Once victory seemed ensured in 1944, government-sponsored propaganda reversed course, emphasizing women’s domestic responsibilities instead of their public duties. Toward the end of the war, the Saturday Evening Post carried this “Mothers at Work” ad (23.11) that urged women to consider the toll that working outside the home had on their children. The ad also emphasized this woman’s imminent postwar need for new appliances.

 CHAPTER 23

WORLD WAR II: FIGHTING THE GOOD WAR, 1939–1945

 As expected the overall percentage of women working fell to 28 percent (from a wartime high of 36 percent) in 1947 as women quit their jobs to raise families or employers fired them to free up positions for returning veterans. Over 350,000 women served in the armed forces, including 150,000 in the Women’s Army Corps (WAC). Most women in uniform served as nurses and clerks, fulfilling vital communication and record-keeping services. Many men and the media mocked these clerical roles. The press nicknamed the WACs the “Petticoat Army” and their quarters “Fort Lipstick.” The recruiting slogan for the WACs—“Release a man for combat”—underscored the different risks faced by women and men in the military. Female soldiers also performed more traditionally “male” tasks, serving as gunnery instructors, mechanics, and truck drivers, and 1,000 women even flew combat aircraft from domestic manufacturers to overseas bases. General Douglas MacArthur called female troops “my best soldiers.” At least one congressman, however, offered a competing vision, wondering “what has become of the manhood of America?” now that women had a formal place in the armed forces. After the war only a few thousand women remained in uniform as the military cut slots reserved

 for female troops. Their position within the armed forces rebounded a bit, however, in 1948, when Congress gave women a permanent, though segregated, place in the army, navy, and air force. The debate over whether to limit female soldiers to support tasks or use them in active operations was only beginning. Even children pitched in to help the war effort. To encourage children’s active participation, the government released photographs of small girls and boys doing their bit (23.12). This young boy takes care of the family shopping while his parents work in war-related jobs, handing the family’s ration card to the merchant. At home this little girl carefully saves tin and foil in separate jars for the local scrap drive. Millions participated in these morale-building activities, but weapons manufacturers discarded most of the poor-quality aluminum and rubber collected. Money, however, was always in short supply. Classrooms across the nation collected pennies and nickels for war bonds, which the federal government sold to Americans to help finance the war. The remoteness of the war often made it seem like a great adventure to children. War games gained popularity on the nation’s playgrounds, and children joined the Junior Commandos, which trained young uniformed recruits, only a few years away from qualifying to fight in the army, on a rugged obstacle course.

 With the economy booming, many Americans concluded that wars, by nature, were good for the economy. However, several unique factors made World War II particularly beneficial for the American economy: • The war effort withdrew 16 million servicemen and women from the workforce just as millions of new positions were created, absorbing all surplus labor and creating a labor shortage. • Massive government spending on the war, not the war per se, ended the Depression. If the government had been willing to spend $323 billion (the total cost of the war) on New Deal programs, the economy would likely have rebounded earlier. • The wartime boom years came at the expense of future generations. Taxation paid for less than half of the war’s cost. The government did not pay off its war debts until 1970.



 During the war, labor’s clout, like that of big companies, also expanded. Union rolls swelled from 8.7 to 14.7 million thanks in part to supportive War Labor Board policies. Industrialists tried to use the wartime rhetoric of sacrifice to rein in these growing unions. In one advertisement, for example, the Jenkins Valve firm linked work slowdowns (used to pressure a company to agree to labor’s demands) to the unnecessary deaths of American sailors. The ad showed a small child staring at a sailor’s cap that had washed up along the shore; the caption asked “Is a Plant Slow Down Worth It?” Unions did not abandon strikes, but the war ushered in a less militant era of collective bargaining.

 groups and the ire of the White House. When FDR tried to convince Randolph to call off the march, Randolph told him, “We feel as you have wisely said: ‘No people will lose their freedom fighting for it.’” To avoid an embarrassing demonstration that highlighted racial problems at home, FDR agreed to issue an executive order that forbade discrimination in the defense industries and government if Randolph canceled the march. Roosevelt’s order also established the Fair Employment Practices Committee to handle complaints of discrimination. For the first time since Reconstruction, the period following the Civil War, the federal government was intervening directly to protect the civil rights of African Americans. Randolph’s aborted demonstration later inspired the 1963 march on Washington, where black civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech standing before the Lincoln Memorial (see Chapter 27). Interest in direct action grew throughout the war. The Fellowship of Reconciliation’s Committee on Racial Justice initiated a wave of sit-ins, where blacks and whites entered segregated restaurants together and refused to leave when denied service. In Washington, D.C., Howard University students picketed segregated restaurants with signs that read “We Die Together. Let’s Eat Together” and “Are You for Hitler’s Way or the American Way? Make Up Your Mind.” Nearly one million blacks served in the armed forces during the war, including Brigadier General Benjamin O. Davis, the first African American general in the U.S. Army. The War Department finally agreed to train African American pilots, and the Tuskegee Airmen (who received their stateside training at Alabama’s Tuskegee Institute) amassed an admirable war record in Europe. The military remained segregated, however, and most black soldiers served in noncombatant units where they cleared beaches in France of mines, manned supply lines transporting food and ammunition to front-line troops, and built roads and railroads for the advancing army. Within the U.S. black servicemen received daily reminders of their second-class status. When black soldiers entered a whites-only restaurant in Salina, Kansas, the owner stopped them. We “just stood there inside the door, staring at what we had come to see—the German prisoners of war who were having lunch at the counter…. This was really happening. It was no jive talk. The people of Salina would serve these enemy soldiers and turn away black American G.I.’s,” one soldier recalled.

 sarcastically said, would be “here lies a black man killed fighting a yellow man for the protection of a white man.” The double-victory campaign laid the groundwork for the postwar civil rights movement by pioneering new strategies that would later prove extraordinarily successful. The accelerated migration northward also created new bases of political power that would aid the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. Throughout the war hundreds of thousands of African American civilians hit the road in search of job opportunities in midwestern and western cities. In 1943, Los Angeles welcomed 10,000 black migrants a month, most from Texas and Louisiana. Overcrowding and changing demographics created explosive racial situations in many urban areas. The most serious wartime race riot took place in 1943 in Detroit. Home to the nation’s largest automobile manufacturers, Detroit became the leading producer of military goods when these companies began manufacturing jeeps and tanks for the military. Plentiful jobs drew thousands of migrants to the city, including African Americans, who had trouble finding adequate lodging in the strictly (albeit unofficially) segregated city housing market. White workers, resentful of working next to blacks, staged slowdowns in the city’s wartime defense plants. To protest racial discrimination, some black residents initiated a “bumping campaign,” nudging whites off sidewalks. The anticipated confrontation finally came on a warm spring afternoon when black and white teenagers tussled at a crowded amusement park on Belle Isle. As the violence escalated, a mob of 5,000 whites formed to attack blacks as they crossed the bridge back to the mainland. Racial rampaging soon engulfed the city. Hundreds of African Americans were injured and 25 were killed, before state and federal troops restored order. Nine whites also died in the rioting. Horace Pippin, a self-taught African American painter who rocketed to fame in the late 1930s, took note of the racial discord on the home front in his 1943 painting Mr. Prejudice (23.13). Pippin’s composition expressed doubt that the double-V campaign would succeed. In the painting a racist white worker, backed by a Klansman, hammers a chisel down the center of a V, the symbol of victory. A fellow worker to his left holds a noose—a reference to lynching.

 V threatens to crack into two, permanently dividing the friendly white servicemen reaching out to their black comrades in arms—a doctor, sailor, aviator, and soldier, who are all serving loyally during the war. African Americans were not the only targets of racial violence, however. The same summer that racial rioting rocked Detroit, white sailors and soldiers on leave in Los Angeles began a ten-day rampage against Mexican-American zoot-suiters, youths who wore baggy pants, long oversize coats, and broad-brimmed hats. The zoot-suit was a fashion trend established by African American men in the 1930s. By the war years white Americans viewed zoot-suiters at best as juvenile delinquents, who refused to dress and act properly, and at worst as criminal gangs bent on robbery and rape. Some pachucos, as zoot-suiters called themselves, engaged in criminal activity, but most limited their adolescent rebellion to wearing different clothes from adults. The explosive growth in the MexicanAmerican community, coupled with a general intolerance for nonconformity during war, set the stage for the conflict in Los Angeles. Street fights between sailors and Mexican-American men escalated into full-scale rioting, when organized groups of servicemen began attacking boys as young as 12 and Mexican-American businesses. White civilians joined in the rioting, and when a mob came upon a zoot-suiter, they often beat and stripped him and even burned his clothes. The casualties included more than 100 seriously injured Mexican Americans, and at least 100 more who refused hospital care. Newspapers in Los Angeles egged on the white crowds by praising their efforts to rid the city of “hoodlums” and “gangsters.” Federal investigators cited racial prejudice as the cause of the riots, but Los Angeles nonetheless prohibited wearing zoot-suits on city streets. The image of Mexican Americans as disaffected youths belied the reality that 500,000 Latinos served alongside whites in the armed forces during the war, playing a significant role in the doomed defense of the Philippines and winning many Medals of Honor. Perceived as natural warriors, Native Americans encountered less hostility within the armed forces than blacks or Latinos. More than 25,000 Native Americans served, including the famed Navajo code talkers who transmitted secret messages between units in their native language,

 baffling the Japanese, who never deciphered it. Military service offered many young Native Americans their first decent wages and a chance to leave the reservation. Government officials expected military service to hasten assimilation, since Native-American soldiers lived among whites. Yet sending men into combat also gave some tribes a reason to resurrect rituals surrounding battle, such as requiring returning soldiers to spend time in a sweat lodge to cleanse themselves of the evils associated with war. Serving in the military, therefore, both expanded veterans’ knowledge of the wider world and reinforced their own cultural traditions, helping them to see themselves and mainstream society in a different light.

 the Pacific Allied victories at Guadalcanal, the Coral Sea, and Midway halted Japanese expansion, preparing the way for the American islandhopping campaign in 1944–1945.

 No bombs fell on mainland American cities and no occupying armies marched through the streets, but with 16 million men in the armed forces, nearly everyone knew someone who might not make it home. The United States essentially fought two separate wars in World War II: one against Germany and its allies in Europe; the other against Japan in the Pacific. The initial news from the battlefront was not good, as the American armed forces encountered one setback after another. Defeating Japan and Germany required time and patience. Victories finally came, but the closer the Allies got to Japan and Germany, the harder their enemies fought. Initially leery of exposing Americans to blood and gore, over time magazines and newspapers began to publish photographs that registered the rising death toll at the front. The public welcomed photographs of enemy destruction as evidence that the nation was nearing victory, but reacted strongly to any sign of suffering by American soldiers. Nothing prepared the public, however, for the shocking details that emerged from liberated Nazi concentration camps in 1945.

 MacArthur’s Return to the Philippines MacArthur used the press to publicize his return to the Philippines in 1944. Military photographers captured his purposeful stride ashore, and that evening MacArthur proclaimed in a radio address, “People of the Philippines: I have returned … Rally to me.”

WORLD WAR II: FIGHTING THE GOOD WAR, 1939–1945

 public square in Milan, where resistance fighters had been executed. In 1943, the Western Allies launched the first major incendiary attack of the war. The bombing raids on Hamburg, a major industrial German city and port, ignited a firestorm in the hot, dry conditions that killed 45,000 people and wounded nearly 40,000. Germany’s aerial attacks during the Battle of Britain in 1940–1941 had hardened British views about bombing German civilians, while the Americans preferred trying to hit actual military and industrial installations. Dresden, home to key railroad lines, was the site of another devastating incendiary bombing raid in February 1945, which killed approximately 35,000 Germans. Although many American bombs failed to hit their precisely designated industrial or military targets, in fighting Germany, the United States never formally adopted terror bombing, the strategy of dropping high concentrations of bombs on civilian populations to create panic and misery. In November 1943, FDR and Churchill met with Stalin for the first time in Tehran, the capital of Iran, to discuss Allied strategy for the coming year. During the conference FDR privately described Stalin as “altogether quite impressive,” and the president stayed in the Soviet Embassy to build a good rapport with the Soviet leader. Churchill remained leery of Soviet intentions to expand its influence into Eastern Europe after the war. The Soviet victory at Stalingrad (January–February 1943), a pivotal battle that put the Allies on the path to victory, buoyed optimism that the tide had turned in Russia’s favor on the Eastern Front. Within a few months, the Soviets would

 also end a 900-day German siege of Leningrad that lasted from September 1941–January 1944. Churchill wanted to forestall a Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe by launching an Anglo-American invasion of the Balkans through the Adriatic Sea. FDR doubted that Americans would support such a campaign, when the nation’s traditional interest lay in defending Britain and France. He was also reluctant to send American troops into a region that the USSR clearly intended to dominate after the war. The president was wary of antagonizing the Soviet Union, when he still hoped to convince Stalin to declare war against Japan once the European war ended. Instead, the United States persuaded Britain to join it in an invasion of France in 1944. The campaign in the Pacific followed a similar strategy of attacking Japan in the “soft underbelly” of its empire in the South Pacific. The Americans opened this campaign with successful, but difficult attacks on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands and on New Guinea. In early 1943, Japan accepted its defeat in the South Pacific by withdrawing its fleet and aircraft to a new defensive line that extended through Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and the Mariana Islands. To keep up the pressure on Japan, the Americans launched a two-pronged attack on Japanese forces in the Central and South Pacific. From the Central Pacific the Americans hoped to establish a naval blockade that cut Japan off from supplies in the south. The United States quickly took the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. During the subsequent invasion of the island of Saipan in the Marianas, the Americans destroyed so many Japanese naval aircraft in the Battle of the Philippine Sea (June 19–20, 1944) that the battle became known as “the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot.” The final capture of the Marianas in August 1944 put the United States, armed with massive and heavily-loaded B-29s that could travel up to 2,000 miles, within striking distance of Japan. “I shall return,” General Douglas MacArthur had proclaimed when FDR ordered him to head to Australia and leave his troops on the Philippines in 1942. On October 20, 1944, he fulfilled this promise by wading ashore in the Leyte Gulf four hours after the first American force landed in a carefully choreographed act

 that MacArthur insisted on filming several times to get just right. To build morale and enhance his reputation as a fearless leader, MacArthur presented himself as part of the invasion force, a general who was willing to get his boots wet and resolutely press forward, as seen in this photo (23.16). The Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 23–25, 1944), the largest naval battle in history, ended with an American victory. It took until July 1945, however, to completely liberate the Philippines from isolated infantry garrisons. With the war advancing well in the Pacific, Americans began to feel optimistic about achieving a swift victory. These hopes faded, however, when Japan switched from fighting a strategic war to waging a war of attrition. Mounting losses, Japan’s leaders reasoned, would force the United States to the negotiating table. With conventional weapons like ships, guns, and planes in short supply, Japan introduced suicidal battlefield tactics on land and sea in the fall of 1944, intensifying the struggle. In the western Caroline Islands, Japanese soldiers fought to the last man. Forcing the Americans to rout out every enemy soldier from an interlocking system of caves and bunkers prolonged the battle and raised American casualties. During the Battle of Leyte Gulf,

 the first kamikaze pilots plowed their planes into six American ships, setting off a cascade of explosions from the ships’ gasoline and ordnance that damaged five and sank one. A month later seaman James Fahey was on a ship under attack. The sailors battled for hours, shooting down a steady stream of incoming aircraft. “The explosions were terrific as the suicide planes exploded in the water … the water looked like it was on fire,” Fahey wrote in his diary. Parts of the destroyed planes fell onto his ship, and during a lull in the action, the sailors sifted through the debris for souvenirs. “The deck near my mount was covered with blood, guts, brains, tongues, scalps, hearts, arms etc. from the Jap pilots,” Fahey recalled. He watched men select body parts to preserve in alcohol and send home to relatives. Soldiers involved in the Pacific island–hopping campaigns exhibited a similar macabre interest in collecting Japanese soldiers’ body parts. In May 1944, Life magazine published “A Wartime Souvenir,” showing an attractive young woman writing a thank-you note to her fiancé for sending her a souvenir Japanese skull (23.17). “The armed forces disapprove strongly of this sort of thing,” Life noted. Yet the image of this woman calmly contemplating her war trophy elicited no controversy. Instead, many Americans exorcised their own desire for revenge against Japan through such images. The press had to handle photographs of American war dead more carefully (see Images as History: Combat Photography, page 706).

 magazine chose this photo as its picture of the week. The young woman’s fiancé sent her a Japanese skull with an inscription that read: “This is a good Jap—a dead one picked up on the New Guinea beach.” Collecting enemy body parts as war trophies was common among American troops fighting Japan, but not in the European theater.

The Final Push in Europe
 On June 6, 1944, the Allies launched D-Day (for “debarkation day”), their long-anticipated invasion of Normandy, in northern France, under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. “The eyes of the world are upon you,” the popular leader told his troops. Eisenhower, raised in a poor Jehovah Witness family in Kansas, became a national hero for his successful planning and execution of the D-Day invasions and subsequent offensives through France and Germany. His achievements and sunny personality would make him an appealing postwar presidential candidate in 1952 (see Chapter 24). Although stormy weather made traversing the English Channel treacherous, and the Americans

COMBAT PHOTOGRAPHY
War photography brings the realities of combat into the homes of ordinary citizens. How do pictures of combat force viewers to think about the overall meaning and worthiness of the conflict? For the first year and a half of American involvement, when there was little good news to report, the military believed that photographs of dead American soldiers would weaken morale on the home front. In 1943, Allied victories in the South Pacific and North Africa raised spirits at home— perhaps a bit too much for some officials. Aware of the long road ahead and the need for continued civilian sacrifice, the War Department approved the dissemination of bloody battlefield photographs. In September 1943, Life published a photograph of three American soldiers lying partially buried in the sand in New Guinea. In the accompanying editorial Life anticipated the public’s shock at seeing the first photograph of American war dead. “Why print this picture, anyway, of three American boys dead upon an alien shore? Is it to hurt people? To be morbid?” Life editors wrote. “Those are not the answers. The reason is that words are never enough.” Magazine editors chose their images from an ever-increasing supply of casualty pictures. Twothirds of the 291,557 American troops killed in battle during the war died in 1944–1945. Photographer Joe Rosenthal’s “Old Glory Goes Up on Mt. Suribachi, Iwo Jima,” a candid shot of five marines and one navy corpsman raising a flag on the Pacific Island of Iwo Jima on February 23, 1945, remains the most famous image from World War II. Rosenthal’s Pulitzer Prize– winning photograph would inspire a Marine Corps statue, erected in Washington, D.C., in 1954. 
 Military censors forbade publication of photographs containing identifiable war dead or badly mutilated corpses, worried that such pictures might depress morale on the home front.

 faced fierce German resistance on Omaha Beach, one of five landing points, the D-Day invasion was an overwhelming success. The heavy buildup for the attack, involving 175,000 troops, 6,000 aircraft, and 6,000 naval vessels, made complete surprise impossible. But the Allies had increased the invasion’s chances of success by deceiving the Germans into expecting the attack to come elsewhere. Diversionary bombing, false agent reports, and misleading radio communications convinced the Germans to station most of their first-rate infantry divisions farther north. Hitler continued to hold these units and his crack tank formations in reserve even after the D-Day invasion began, certain that the Normandy landings were just a diversion. The German delay in responding gave the Allies the time they needed to establish a beachhead that stretched for 55 miles by the end of the first day. Life photographer Robert Capa hit the beaches with the troops, living up to his famous statement, “If your pictures aren’t good enough, you aren’t close enough.” Anxious to see Capa’s photographs, a rushing darkroom technician used too much heat to dry the film and inadvertently melted nearly all his images. The excessive heat blurred the remaining few, creating a surreal aura to this instantly iconic image (23.18) of an American soldier struggling through the turbulent surf to reach the shore. Capa put down his camera long enough to pull this soldier to safety after a bullet struck him in the right shoulder. It was still a long way from Normandy to Berlin, however. After two more months of hard fighting, the Allies finally began to push forward. On August 15, 1944, the Americans launched a second invasion through the south of France. Within a month these troops had joined with the Normandy invasion forces to establish a continuous Allied front from the English Channel to the German frontier. But Hitler had no intention of going down without a fight. In December 1944, the Germans launched a massive counteroffensive. The Battle of the Bulge, so named for the Germans’ pocket of penetration into Allied lines, was the most massive battle fought by the American Army in Europe. Fighting in the snow and bitter cold, the Allies suffered 77,000 casualties before halting the German counterattack a month later.

 When Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met again in February 1945 at Yalta, a town in the Crimea on Russia’s Black Sea coast, to discuss their next step, Roosevelt was fresh off an unprecedented fourthterm victory in the 1944 presidential election. The Republican candidate Thomas Dewey, a popular New York State governor, had attacked Roosevelt as a “tired old man” no longer up to the challenge of running the war. Roosevelt solidified support within the Democratic Party by replacing the controversial liberal Henry Wallace with Harry S. Truman, a straight-talking moderate senator from Missouri, as his vice-presidential candidate. The selection of an acceptable vice-presidential candidate was important to Democratic Party bosses who feared that the ill Roosevelt might not live to complete a fourth term in office. Suffering from advancing heart disease and the strain of war, Roosevelt nevertheless displayed renewed energy during the campaign, convincing Americans not to “change horses in mid-stream.” He won 432 to 99 votes in the Electoral College, receiving 54 percent of the popular vote.

 CHAPTER 23

WORLD WAR II: FIGHTING THE GOOD WAR, 1939–1945

 At Yalta the larger question of how to defeat Germany was behind the Allies. The issues now on the table included governing postwar Germany, ensuring victory over Japan, and maintaining peace in the postwar world. At the conference FDR secured a Soviet promise to enter the war against Japan three months after Germany capitulated. In return Stalin wanted the United States and Britain to grant the Soviet Union territorial concessions in Japan, China, and eastern Poland. For the moment FDR acceded to Soviet control of Eastern Europe, but secured a pledge from Stalin, never honored, to hold free elections in a liberated Poland. The decision at Yalta to name the United States, Britain, France, China, and the USSR as permanent members of the proposed United Nations Security Council, each with the power to veto any resolution, cleared the way to officially create a United Nations (UN) to replace the defunct League of Nations. Delegates from 50 nations met in San Francisco between April 25 and June 26, 1945, to found the UN, an international organization that offered nations a place to discuss their differences and collectively promote economic development and peace throughout the world. To ensure that the United States joined the UN, its creators made participation in UN-peacekeeping missions voluntary. The Security Council veto also gave the United States (and the other major powers) a way to control UN activities. In contrast to World War I, when it failed to join the League of Nations, the United States was one of the first countries to join the UN, which built its headquarters in New York City. Now unstoppable in Europe, the Allies crossed the Rhine River into Germany in March. On April 30, 1945, Hitler committed suicide in a bunker 55 feet underground in Berlin. After dictating his will and marrying his longtime companion Eva Braun, Hitler bit into a cyanide capsule and shot himself in the head. Two days later Russian soldiers entered the bunker and took Hitler’s burned remains, so an autopsy could confirm he was dead. Germany surrendered unconditionally on May 7, 1945.

 America’s Response to the Holocaust In spring 1945, Allied troops began liberating the concentration camps holding Jews, Poles, prisoners of war, and other groups that the Nazis considered enemies or racially inferior. News of the Final Solution, Hitler’s plan to systematically murder the Jews

 and other “lesser” peoples, first reached the West in August 1942. Along with ten other nations, the United States condemned “in the strongest possible terms this bestial policy of cold-blooded extermination.” During the war mainstream American newspapers, fearful of reporting falsified atrocity stories amid a glut of war news, had published little about the Holocaust, the term used to describe this Naziengineered extermination. The United States did little initially to aid European Jews. In January 1944, however, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, who was Jewish, protested to FDR that antiSemitism within the State Department had thwarted a plan to ransom 70,000 Romanian Jews with private funds, leaving the United States open to charges that it was acquiescing in the “murder of the Jews.” FDR immediately issued an executive order establishing the War Refugee Board (WRB). Over the next year the WRB saved approximately 200,000 lives by convincing Romania and Hungary to stop deporting Jews and by helping Jews and other victims of Nazi persecution escape or survive in hiding. Envisioning Evidence: Deciphering the Holocaust depicts both the response of the United States to the Holocaust and the scope of German atrocities. Pressed by Jewish groups to undertake a dramatic rescue of Europe’s Jews by bombing either the concentration camps or the railroads leading to them, Roosevelt demurred. He argued that any diversion of military resources from the ultimate goal of winning the war would only prolong the Jews’ suffering. In February 1944 the War Department decided not to send armed forces to rescue “victims of enemy oppression unless such rescues are the direct result of military operations conducted with the objective of defeating the armed forces of the enemy.” Bombing Auschwitz, the main Nazi extermination camp in Poland, became a real possibility only in the summer of 1944. In August Allied planes dropped more than 1,000 bombs on synthetic-oil plants less than 5 miles from Auschwitz. Whether the Allies should have also bombed the gas chambers has provoked heated debate since the war. Advocates argue that destroying the railroad lines leading to Auschwitz or its gas chambers would have slowed down the killing as liberating Allied troops approached the camps, perhaps saving as many as 100,000 Jews. These would have included Anne Frank, a 13-year-old German refugee who was sent to Auschwitz after her family’s capture in Amsterdam and whose journal of her experience in hiding, The Diary of Anne Frank, became a postwar literary classic.

DECIPHERING THE HOLOCAUST
Over-simplifications about the Holocaust depict German Jews as the main victims of Hitler’s Final Solution and the United States primarily as liberators. As the graph shows, most of the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust were Poles. The Germans also killed over three million Soviet prisoners of war, two million nonJewish Poles, nearly 200,000 disabled individuals, 10,000 Jehovah Witnesses, and an undetermined number of homosexuals and Roma or Gypsies. The timeline reveals that during the Depression-plagued 1930s the United States reacted cautiously to Hitler’s persecution of the Jews. Nonetheless, of all nations, the United States still accepted the largest number of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. The map marks the major concentration camps that American ground troops liberated in Western Europe, including Buchenwald, Dachau, and Mauthausen, forced labor camps and detention centers where thousands were “worked to death,” starved, executed, and subjected to medical experiments. The Soviet army liberated the extermination camps, including Auschwitz, all located in Eastern Europe.

 determination to use any means possible to slaughter the Jews, including mass executions by firing squads and forced marches, until the very end of the war. As the camps were liberated, reporters tried through words and pictures to convey how six million Jews had met their deaths. Even though Americans had grown accustomed to seeing photos of war dead, nothing prepared them for images from the concentration camps. American commanders invited the press into the camps to head off denials over the scope of the Holocaust and Nazi atrocities. Photographs of concentration camps were, one reporter wrote, “so horrible that no newspaper normally would use them, but they were less horrible than the reality.” Soldiers set themselves up as witnesses (a term used to describe both survivors

 and liberators) who could personally vouch for the extent of the horrors by posing in photographs before piles of corpses and skeletal survivors. “You can photograph results of suffering but never suffering itself,” observed one British politician. By documenting the act of discovering Nazi atrocities, witness photographs helped Americans share the horror that soldiers felt. The American military also posted photographs of concentration camp atrocities in German towns and villages for civilians to see, but many American commanders went further. In the photo shown here (23.19), American soldiers assembled German civilians before a truckload of corpses to listen to a lecture on the barbarity. Forcing German civilians to view the carnage with their own eyes, and in some cases to bury the bodies, was part of a deliberate Allied campaign to make all Germans accept responsibility for their nation’s war crimes. After the war the Allies jointly tried 22 Nazi leaders in the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. In these trials individual Germans were charged with starting the war, authorizing the killing of prisoners of war, and orchestrating the wartime genocide against victims, who mostly came from nations occupied by Germany (see the “Jews in the Holocaust” chart, page 709). The United States independently tried thousands of other German officials as well. These trials were not enough to calm the fears of survivors. Many left Europe to resettle elsewhere.

ENDING THE PACIFIC WAR



Ending the Pacific War
 Germany was now under Allied control, but in the Pacific the war raged on. There the fighting took a desperate turn in 1945, and each victory cost the United States dearly. Despite a mounting death toll, American troops edged closer to Japan, and officials began planning an invasion of the Japanese mainland. News of a successful atomic bomb test in the New Mexico desert dramatically altered political and military calculations on how to achieve victory. Employing this new, terrible weapon eventually generated conflicting views within the United States over the ethics of atomic warfare.

 kamikaze attacks alone killed 5,000 sailors, while ground troops squared off against an entrenched enemy determined to fight to the last man. As on Iwo Jima vast numbers of Japanese soldiers (70,000) perished on Okinawa. In this battle, however, an equal number of Japanese civilians either killed themselves (they had been told of mass rape and torture if taken prisoner) or were killed by Japanese soldiers if they tried to surrender. The Americans suffered 75,000 casualties in capturing Okinawa. With the actual invasion of the Japanese homeland targeted next, the Americans feared facing, in the words of Harry Truman, “an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other.”

Dropping the Atomic Bomb
 Franklin D. Roosevelt died at the age of 65 of a cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945, while at his cottage in Warm Springs, Georgia. Throngs of mourners lined railroad tracks and streets as the casket holding his remains traveled first to Washington, D.C., for funeral services in the White House and then to his final resting spot at his home in Hyde Park, New York. Many Americans could barely remember a time when FDR had not been president. Roosevelt’s firm grip on power had kept Vice President Harry Truman in the dark about the four-year, $20 billion Manhattan Project, the code-named secret government research program to produce the atomic bomb. Thrust into the presidency, Truman faced critical strategic decisions in Europe and the Pacific, none more important than what to do with the new atomic bomb. In mid-July 1945, the United States exploded its first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert. Choices and Consequences: How to Use the Atomic Bomb traces Truman’s options and the consequences of his decision to use the bomb against Japan. On August 6, 1945, a B-29 bomber christened the Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. As pilot Captain Paul Tibbets turned the Enola Gay away from Hiroshima, Sergeant George Caron snapped seven photographs, giving Americans their first look at the telltale mushroom cloud that came to signify nuclear annihilation. Three days later, acting on a standing order to use the atomic bomb “as made ready,” a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki.

 How did the war against Japan finally end?

 Saved from firebomb attacks because of their minimal military value, Hiroshima and Nagasaki presented virgin ground for a clear demonstration of the bomb’s force. The United States wanted to make a profound impression on the Japanese. Secretary of War Stimson believed “the atomic bomb was more than a weapon of terrible destruction; it was a psychological weapon.” The firebombed ruins of cities like Tokyo, therefore, presented a much less appealing target for demonstrating the full power of a nuclear bomb. American soldiers scheduled to take part in the planned invasion gave little thought to civilian victims. “When we learned to our astonishment that we would not be obliged in a few months to rush up the beaches near Tokyo assault-firing while being machine-gunned, mortared, and shelled, for all the practiced phlegm of our tough facades we broke down and cried with relief and joy. We were going to live. We were going to grow to adulthood after all,” recalled literary critic Paul Fussell in a 1988 essay, “Thank God for the Atom Bomb.”

The Final Surrender
 Truman and his advisers recognized that American possession of the atomic bomb would reshape postwar relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. To key presidential advisers, America’s nuclear monopoly increased the chances of limiting Soviet influence over Eastern Europe and ending the Pacific war without Soviet help. Spies in the Manhattan Project had already alerted Moscow of the bomb’s existence, before Truman finally told Stalin in July 1945 at the Potsdam Conference, held near Berlin, that the United States had developed a potent new weapon. When the first bomb destroyed Hiroshima, the Soviets quickly invaded Manchuria on August 8 to seize their planned territorial objectives before the war ended. By August 10, the combination of two atomic bomb blasts and the Soviet entry into the war caused Japanese Emperor Hirohito to take the unprecedented step of imposing his own views on official policy. Traditionally the emperor simply approved decisions taken by his cabinet. With the peace and militarist factions within his government still divided over whether to make a last stand against the Allies, Hirohito decided for peace. After key military leaders accepted the emperor’s wishes, Japan sued for peace with the condition that the Imperial Institution remain

Choices and Consequences
HOW TO USE THE ATOMIC BOMB
President Harry Truman considered the bomb a legitimate weapon to use alongside the more conventional tactics of terror bombing, an economic blockade, and a planned invasion of Japan. He did, however, face four choices over how to exploit this new weapon to meet his goals of securing an unconditional surrender from Japan, saving American lives, and establishing American postwar supremacy over the Soviet Union. 
Choices




Demonstrate the
 bomb’s destructive power in a trial blast on an uninhabited area to convince Japan to surrender.



 Drop one atomic bomb and give Japan time to react.



 Drop the two atomic bombs America had developed.



Inform the Soviet
 Union about the bomb before dropping it.

Decision
 Truman chose to drop both atomic bombs on virgin sites in Japan to magnify the psychological shock of one bomb causing so much destruction. Senior advisers rejected a test demonstration of the bomb as impractical. Truman vaguely informed Stalin of “a new weapon of unusual destructive force,” unaware that spies in the Manhattan Project had already alerted Stalin of the bomb’s existence.

Consequences
 On August 6, 1945, “Little Boy,” the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, destroyed three-fourths of the city and killed 80,000 people instantly. “Fat Man” destroyed two-fifths of Nagasaki and killed 35,000 people on August 9. The Emperor announced Japan’s surrender on August 14. Truman’s attempted secrecy increased Soviet distrust of the United States and unleashed a nuclear arms race between the two nations.

Continuing Controversies
 Should the United States have dropped the bomb? Supporters of Truman’s decision claim that dropping the bomb ended the war. It saved one million American lives by making an invasion of Japan unnecessary and convinced the Japanese government to end the war. Not all supporters, however, agree that the second bomb on Nagasaki was militarily necessary. Critics counter that the bomb was not needed to end the war. Traditional bombing, the blockade, and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria would have ended the war without the planned invasion, they claim. Because the United States accepted a modified surrender that allowed Japan to retain the Emperor, abandoning the demand for unconditional surrender earlier may have convinced Japan to surrender sooner. Finally, some detractors accuse Truman of using the bomb mainly to curtail Soviet territorial ambitions in postwar Europe and Asia. Bomb over Nagasaki, 1945

 intact. Truman agreed, thereby modifying the original goal of unconditional surrender. Could a Japanese surrender have come sooner if the United States had guaranteed the emperor’s office earlier? Before August 6, Truman likened keeping Hirohito to allowing Hitler to remain in power, and he believed that the American people would never accept these terms for peace. In mid-August, however, Truman concluded that letting Hirohito tell the Japanese people to lay down their arms would facilitate the occupation of Japan. Hirohito paved the way for a peaceful surrender, when he addressed the Japanese people on the radio for the first time ever, calling on them to accept his decision. Many of his subjects did not understand Hirohito’s formal Court language, illustrating the social distance

 maintained between the emperor and his subjects. The formal surrender took place on September 2 aboard the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay, attended by delegates from Japan and the Allied nations. The deadliest war in human history, whose death toll is charted in “The Human Cost of Global War” (23.21), had finally ended. When news of the Japanese surrender hit the United States, Americans swarmed into the streets to celebrate the good news. “Every female was grabbed and kissed by men in uniform,” recalled one woman who joined the crowd in Times Square, New York City. The celebrants included a sailor whose impromptu kiss with a passing nurse was captured by Life photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt.

Three nurses and eleven sailors later claimed that they were the individuals in the photograph. Hirohito was not tried as a war criminal, but the Allies intended to punish other Japanese leaders. In the few weeks between the Japanese surrender and the Allied occupation of Japan, more than 1,000 officials and officers committed suicide and others destroyed thousands of documents concerning Japanese mistreatment of prisoners

 of war and massacres of civilians in occupied countries. Nonetheless, the Allies convicted thousands of Japanese in war crimes trials throughout East Asia, including 28 major Japanese leaders in Tokyo. Combat, genocide, and terror bombing took millions of lives during World War II. Americans could rightly see themselves as having both suffered and caused the war’s deadly violence. The United States emerged from World War II as a military superpower, with new moral and strategic reasons to stay engaged in world affairs after its victories against Germany and Japan.

A
Divided World The Early Cold War, 1945–1963
 As World War II ended, Soviet and American troops, converging from different directions, met and shook hands on a bridge spanning the Elbe River in Germany. Each side was pleasantly surprised by this first encounter with their wartime ally. “They looked like ordinary people. We had imagined something different,” recalled one Soviet soldier of American troops. “I guess we didn’t know what to expect from the Russians,” an American soldier said after the meeting. “If you put an American uniform on them, they could have been American!” Within two years the lost promise of this friendly encounter was obvious to all. A 1947 U.S. propaganda film replayed footage of this historic meeting and struck a lightning bolt across the frozen image of Soviet and American soldiers shaking hands. “Here two worlds actually met,” the narrator thundered, “but this coalition was to be torn asunder” by Soviet postwar incursions in Eastern Europe that the United States viewed as part of a Soviet plan for global conquest. In the decade after the Allies’ victory against Hitler, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union soured dramatically. As the contours of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union took shape, two competing ideological visions, an escalating nuclear arms race, and confrontations in Europe and Asia, including a war in Korea, heightened fears that another world war was in the making. From 1946 to 1965, most Americans viewed the world as sharply divided into free and totalitarian societies. American leaders proclaimed that the United States was engaged in an epic struggle with the Soviet Union over the future of humankind. Protecting the world from the menace of Sovietled communism became a key American foreign policy goal. Americans also fought the Cold War at home, where citizens expressed differing views on whether government tactics in rooting out Soviet spies undermined American democracy or saved it. On the other side of the ideological divide, Soviet leaders developed an abiding distrust of Western motives as they sought to counter the American nuclear advantage with territorial and technological gains. As each nation struggled to extend its world influence, Americans again confronted the crucial question of defining their nation’s role in the world.

 “Communism is on the march on a worldwide scale, which only America can stop.” Senator ARTHUR VANDENBERG, April 26, 1946





 CHAPTER 24

A DIVIDED WORLD: THE EARLY COLD WAR, 1945–1963

Origins of the Cold War
 The United States and the Soviet Union worked effectively together in World War II to defeat Adolf Hitler, but each nation had dramatically different visions of the postwar world. The United States remained dedicated to free markets and democracy, while the Soviet Union embraced a Marxist vision that eschewed private property and celebrated concentrated state authority. Each nation also drew different lessons from the war. For the Soviet leader Josef Stalin, Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union underscored the need to secure its borders by controlling vast territories in Eastern Europe. The United States feared that Stalin was a Hitler-like dictator, intent on controlling all of Europe. American political leaders believed that peace in Europe hinged on spreading capitalism and democracy. These differing, often conflicting, visions triggered an immediate postwar clash between the former allies.

Differing Goals in
 the Postwar World The origins of the Cold War hark back to World War II. The victory against Hitler came at a huge cost for the Soviet Union. An estimated 25 million Soviet soldiers and civilians died, almost 90 times the 291,551 Americans who perished in combat.

 Germany had attacked Russia twice in the 30 years, a fact that contributed to Stalin’s obsession with protecting his nation from future attack. Stalin also suspected that the Americans and British had delayed opening up a second front in Europe (see Chapter 23) to further weaken the Soviet Union, causing him to distrust the United States. This photo (24.1) of a soldier waving the Soviet flag from the

 How does this photograph symbolize the Soviet victory over Germany?

ORIGINS OF THE COLD WAR



 “I have never been talked to like that in my life,” Soviet foreign minister VYACHESLAV MOLOTOV to Truman

 roof of the Reichstag, the German parliament building, above the ruins of Berlin, illustrated Germany’s complete defeat at the end of World War II. It also represented a past that the Soviet Union had no intention of repeating. To protect his borders, Stalin installed puppet Communist governments throughout Eastern Europe to create a buffer zone between Germany and the Soviet Union. He also tried to keep Germany as weak as possible by carting off German heavy machinery to the Soviet Union, disarming the Germany military, and requiring large reparation payments. In the postwar era Stalin fully expected to retain his firm grip on power within the Soviet Union. Standing only five feet four inches tall with a bushy mustache, yellowed teeth from smoking, and a pockmarked face, Stalin was not physically imposing. In this case, however, images were deceiving. “An unforewarned visitor would never have guessed what depths of calculation, ambition, love of power, jealously, cruelty and sly vindictiveness lurked behind this unpretentious façade,” an American diplomat noted. Stalin had been responsible for the deaths of nearly ten million Soviet citizens before World War II, a result of failed agricultural policies that created widespread famine and relentless executions of all suspected opponents. The Soviet dictator was willing to sacrifice countless more lives to achieve his new territorial objectives. The postwar goals on the American side reflected lingering dismay over the nation’s failure to prevent the rise of expansionist regimes in Japan and Germany during the 1930s. Before his death in April 1945, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had argued that American leadership in the new United Nations (UN) could promote a peaceful future by deterring and punishing aggression before it spun out of control. Roosevelt also stressed the importance of preventing another global depression like the one that had helped bring Hitler to power and had fueled non-interventionist sentiment in the United States.

 By themselves these differing ideas on how to maintain peace in Europe did not necessarily guarantee a future clash between the United States and the Soviet Union. During the war the United States and Britain had accepted that the Soviet Union would exert considerable postwar political influence over Eastern Europe. FDR and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, however, had exacted a promise from Stalin to hold free elections in the region. Stalin had offered some backing for Western postwar schemes, agreeing to support the UN and a joint occupation of a defeated Germany. When Harry Truman became president after Roosevelt’s death, even the first signs of Soviet intransigence on fulfilling its wartime agreements failed to produce a permanent rift. To put pressure on Stalin to hold free elections in Soviet-occupied Poland, Truman abruptly canceled Lend-Lease payments, thereby denying much needed aid to the war-torn Soviet Union. When the Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov called on the new president in the White House, Truman went even further, berating Molotov for Stalin’s failure to schedule the promised elections. The long-term impact of this heated exchange was minimal, however. Truman quickly sent an emissary to Moscow to patch things up with Stalin. As a gesture of goodwill, he also reversed his decision to suspend Lend-Lease shipments to the Soviet Union.

The American Vision
 Takes Shape: Kennan’s Long Telegram Over time, however, these initial skirmishes developed into the Cold War. This intense ideological conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union and their allies led to hot wars around the globe, although the Americans and Soviets never fought each other directly. In the opening phases of the Cold War, each side focused on defining

 the exact threat that the other posed. At the heart of this clash lay both conflicting visions of the future and a mutual distrust that only deepened whenever the balance of power threatened to shift dramatically in favor of one nation or the other. To Stalin the American monopoly on nuclear weapons placed the Soviet Union at a strategic disadvantage that he intended to remedy as quickly as possible. For the United States Stalin’s attempt in 1946 to use military force to extend his reach into the Middle East and Mediterranean raised concerns that the Soviet leader sought world domination. Tensions mounted in 1946 when Stalin gave a belligerent speech predicting the inevitable triumph of communism over capitalism. Concerned State Department officials asked the American embassy in Moscow for more information about Stalin’s intentions. The response was the “long telegram,” an influential 5,000-word missive in which diplomat George F. Kennan outlined why America needed to develop an aggressive foreign policy aimed at containing Soviet expansionist impulses. Kennan concluded that Stalin needed an outside enemy to keep himself in power, because an external threat kept the Soviet public from focusing on his ruthless dictatorship. Stalin, Kennan also explained, believed that conflicts between capitalist societies would lead to their demise, allowing communism to triumph when capitalist societies collapsed. Given this Soviet mind-set, negotiations to resolve differences between the two nations would be fruitless, Kennan advised. He suggested strengthening Western-style capitalist and democratic structures to foil communist efforts to woo impoverished peoples. He predicted that Stalin would moderate his ambitions only if he encountered strong and steady resistance from the West each time he tried to expand beyond the Western-accepted Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. “It is clear that the main element of any U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies,” Kennan wrote in a version of the telegram that he published in 1947 under the pseudonym Mr. X in Foreign Affairs magazine. With this one statement Kennan articulated the philosophical foundation for containment, the label affixed to multiple American foreign policy initiatives meant to prevent the Soviet Union from increasing its influence around the globe. Kennan had

 What analysis did Kennan’s Long Telegram offer of Stalin’s beliefs and behavior?

 economic and political policies in mind when he penned these words, but hard-liners in the Truman administration seized on his analysis to craft a new vision of U.S. military engagement in the world. A month after Kennan sent his long telegram, the former British prime minister Winston Churchill visited Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, where he used Kennan’s words to underscore that a military, not just ideological, standoff lay ahead. In his speech Churchill declared that there was nothing the Soviets “admire so much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than for military weakness.” Stalin accused Churchill of trying to provoke a war with his comment that an “iron curtain,” Churchill’s characterization of the military and ideological barrier erected by the Soviet Union, separated Western and Eastern Europe into free and dominated halves. Many American newspapers agreed, denouncing Churchill’s speech as too belligerent.

The Truman Doctrine
 and the Marshall Plan Turning the principles of containment into concrete action that had public approval took another year. By the end of 1947, the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan established containment as the new course of American foreign policy, a direction strengthened even further in 1949 with the creation of a post-World War II military alliance between the U.S. and Western European powers through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These initiatives evolved in response to a series of crises in Europe, portrayed in 24.2.

 CHAPTER 24

A DIVIDED WORLD: THE EARLY COLD WAR, 1945–1963

 In 1947, Truman briefly returned to FDR’s notion of working through the UN to resolve international disputes. That year the UN successfully pressured Stalin into removing Soviet troops from northern Iran. Truman also stationed the American Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean to prevent the Soviets from seizing Turkish-controlled shipping lanes through the Dardanelles. Stalin accepted the setback in oilrich Iran without fanfare, but he continued to demand unrestricted naval access through the Dardanelles passage, the only way for Soviet military and commercial vessels to travel from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. In 1947, Stalin sent troops to the Turkish-Soviet border to force Turkey to keep the passage open. The sense of crisis in the eastern Mediterranean soon deepened, encompassing both Turkey and Greece. Throughout 1946, the British had supported the Greek monarchy in its efforts to subdue Greek Communist rebels and had sent aid to Turkey to help it stand firm against the Soviet Union. In 1947, as part of a general decision to renounce its worldwide imperial role, a financially strapped Britain informed the United States that it could no longer give economic or military aid to Greece and Turkey. Fearing that the British withdrawal meant certain Communist success in Greece and Turkey, Truman asked Congress to grant American assistance to these countries. Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson outlined the threat to America in a meeting with congressional leaders. “Like apples in a barrel infected by one rotten one,” Acheson explained, “the corruption of Greece” would “carry the infection” of communism to Western Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In preparing his speech before Congress in 1947, Truman pondered how to convince the public that events in far-off Greece and Turkey necessitated an unprecedented peacetime interference in European affairs. “Scare [the] hell out of the American people,” Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg suggested. Truman followed this advice. Dividing the world into “us” and “them,” he told Americans that “at the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one.” The Western side of the divide championed democracy and freedom. On the other were Communist states where “terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedom” were parts of daily life. Drawing a line in the sand to stop the spread of communism was the nation’s responsibility to the

 world and the only way to protect the American way of life at home. While asking specifically to help Greece and Turkey, in this speech Truman set forth a more expansive view of America’s global responsibilities, asking the country to abandon its traditional non-interventionist stance. Instead the president proposed the Truman Doctrine, a foreign policy initiative that gave the United States an active role in stopping the global spread of communism by supporting “free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” The administration almost immediately used these principles to justify helping Western Europe as well. In the eastern Mediterranean the United States wanted to prevent Communist armies from taking over. In war-torn Western Europe, the American government feared that hungry, exhausted citizens might voluntarily turn to communism, which promised bread for all. Free elections in Western Europe offered the grim possibility that Communists might be voted into power. Embracing Kennan’s vision, Secretary of State George C. Marshall, the former army chief of staff who had designed the victorious American strategy in World War II, suggested offering massive financial aid to help European capitalistic economies recover. The Marshall Plan (1948–1952) aimed to restore Europeans’ faith in capitalism by sending $13 billion ($119 billion in today’s dollars) overseas to rebuild Europe’s ruined roads, bridges, factories, and farms. “Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos,” Marshall claimed, avoiding the dualistic “us” against “them” rhetoric of the Truman Doctrine. Based on the certainty that widespread economic suffering in the 1930s had caused desperate people to embrace fascism, which then led to World War II, the Marshall Plan explicitly linked peace with prosperity. All European nations (including the Soviet Union) were invited to submit proposals for aid. Stalin briefly entertained the idea of applying for American funds to rebuild his devastated nation, but as Marshall and Truman expected, he quickly abandoned this idea. Instead the Soviets publicly denounced the plan as an American plot to colonize Europe and refused to allow Eastern European nations to participate. Besides cash, the Marshall Plan offered European nations technical and management advice that helped spread American farming techniques, labor policies, and manufacturing practices. The economic recovery of Western Europe under the Marshall Plan furthered the ideological

 divide between the United States and the Soviet Union. These political cartoons (24.3 and 24.4) show the conflicting views of the United States and the Soviet Union. The American cartoonist Daniel R. Fitzpatrick (24.3) portrays the Marshall Plan as a lifeline to Western Europe pulling people out of war-inflicted misery and away from the looming Soviet menace (represented by the distant towers of the Kemlin in Moscow, a recognizable symbol of the Soviet Union to Americans). Americans took pride in the wave of Western European prosperity that resulted from the Marshall Plan, making it one of the great economic success stories of the Cold War. The contrasting Soviet view critiques capitalism as an exploitive, class-based system that enriched a few at the expense of many. Published in the Soviet magazine Krokodil, the Soviet cartoon (24.4) shows European leaders groveling at the feet of their American lord, depicted as a paunchy Uncle Sam relaxing with his feet on their backs. This cartoon implied that the Marshall Plan, rather than fostering recovery, enslaved Western Europe to the United States, which grew richer by the day. There was some truth to the Soviet claim that the Marshall Plan, which ran from 1948 to 1952, strengthened the American economy. Western European nations spent most of their funds in the United States on



 raw materials, food, machines, and fuel, creating a taste for American goods that continued even after the Plan ended.

 The Berlin Airlift and NATO Containment quickly evolved into more than a vision of American financial assistance for struggling governments and economies overseas. By 1949, it also meant a firm military commitment to defend Western European nations that allied themselves with America. Almost overnight the United States shed its traditional reluctance to intervene militarily in European affairs, as Americans became convinced that only they could stop Stalin from controlling Europe. In 1948, Stalin supported a coup by Czech Communists that overthrew the only democratic government in Eastern Europe. The quick demise of democracy in Czechoslovakia caused the West to fear that Germany, with its wrecked economy and nonexistent military, might be the next target for a Soviet-inspired communist revolution. With the country still divided into four occupied zones (American, British, French, and Soviet), the German economy was in shambles. Keeping Germany weak to punish it for World War II, initially a shared American and Soviet objective, made little strategic sense as the Soviet menace grew. By 1948, the United States saw strengthening Germany as a way to halt the Soviet expansionist drive across Europe. With this goal

 military confrontation of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States faced difficult choices. One option was to try to breach the blockade by sending an armed convoy down the autobahn (the German name for freeway) with permission to fire back if attacked by Soviet forces. In the midst of a difficult election campaign, Truman doubted Americans’ willingness to fight the Soviet Union to help a recent enemy. The other option was to try to circumvent the blockade by supplying the Westernoccupied sectors of Berlin from the air. The chances of an airlift working appeared slim, since each plane could carry only three tons of supplies, and the West normally sent an average of 12,000 tons of supplies a day to sustain a combined population of 2.3 million in their three zones. Faced with two unappealing choices, Truman gambled on the airlift and won.

 in mind, the United States, Britain, and France began discussing consolidating their separate occupation zones of Germany to form a new democratic German government and offering it Marshall Plan funds to bolster its economy. The Soviet Union firmly opposed any plan for rebuilding Germany and protested that its former allies were violating the 1945 Yalta agreement, which had stated that all four nations had to agree before any restructuring of Germany could occur. As the West and the Soviet Union argued, the stakes rose precipitously. To pressure the United States, Britain, and France to abandon either their plan to reunify Germany or their stake in Berlin, Stalin ordered his army to stop all overland traffic between the Western and Soviet zones of Germany. Berlin lay in the heart of the Sovietoccupied sector, but at the end of World War II, the Allies had agreed to divide the German capital into four zones of occupation, as portrayed on the map (24.5). To supply and reach their respective zones in Berlin, the Americans, British, and French needed to travel on roads, rail lines, and waterways that ran through the Soviet sector of Germany. Stalin now barred them from using these facilities, setting in motion the first direct

 In the Berlin airlift (1948–1949), American and British planes resupplied West Berlin for nearly a year to stymie the Soviet blockade of the city. It was a brilliant success, both a spectacular logistical feat and a propaganda coup for the United States worldwide. In sharp contrast to dour Soviet soldiers turning away convoys carrying needed food and medicine, the world saw photographs of German children cheering the arrival of American and British planes. This photo (24.6) underscored how much the world had changed in just three years. The children stood on the rubble of a building destroyed by Allied bombers during the war. Instead of fleeing for their lives as American planes approached, they now welcomed the Americans as saviors for a city where strict rationing meant most children received only gruel (hot milk and flour) for their noontime meal. Lieutenant Gail Halvorsen was so touched by the sight of children scanning the skies for food planes that he attached candy bars and gum to

 miniature parachutes (with a return address) and dropped them as he flew by. Hundreds of German children sent the original parachutes (and some homemade ones) back to Halverson, along with directions to their homes. “I live in the bombed out house on the corner. I’ll be in the backyard every day at 2 pm, drop it there,” Peter Zimmerman wrote in a letter than included a hand-drawn map. Halverson tried without success to find Peter’s home, resulting in a flurry of increasingly frantic letters. The pilot eventually just mailed him a package of candy after landing in West Berlin. The two later met and became lifelong friends. Images and stories like these convinced Americans of the stark contrast between Western humanitarian impulses and Soviet oppression. They also boosted Truman in the 1948 presidential campaign, as he squared off against the Republican challenger, Thomas Dewey, who led in the polls, and two other third party candidates. Faced with public dissatisfaction over rampant inflation at home and a badly divided Democratic Party, the Berlin airlift bolstered Truman’s image as a resolute leader. Truman could not correct all his political problems with photographs, however. The 1948 presidential campaign presented voters with sharply competing visions of what direction the country should take. Angry over Truman’s



 proposal that the federal government investigate racial discrimination in voting and employment, many conservative southern Democrats supported Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina in his presidential bid as a segregationist candidate for the States’ Rights Party. Meanwhile liberal Democrats, upset with Truman’s tepid reform agenda (see Chapter 25), formed the Progressive Party and nominated Henry A. Wallace, who championed national health insurance. The former vice president’s downplaying of the Soviet threat brought charges that Wallace had communist sympathies. Dewey, who had run against FDR in 1944, was a moderate Republican and, like Truman, supported civil rights and containing communism. Many believed that the president’s unpopularity and the three-way split within the Democratic Party assured Dewey’s election. Determined to “give them hell,” Truman traveled nearly 22,000 miles during the campaign, appealing to the New Deal coalition of farmers, northern blacks, Catholics, unions, and liberals, who had secured FDR’s victory in 1936. Dewey’s unwillingness to attack the president’s foreign policies during this time of international crisis also helped Truman. In summer 1948, Truman issued an executive order desegregating the military to prevent the defection of black voters to

 Wallace, who called for an immediate end to Jim Crow. Thanks to votes from African Americans and labor, Truman won a second term, with 303 electoral votes and 49.5 percent of the popular vote, defeating Dewey who received 189 electoral votes and 45.1 percent of the popular vote,

 Thurmond (39 electoral votes; 2.4 percent of the popular vote), and Wallace (no electoral votes; 2.4 percent of the popular vote). This victory surprised many, including the Chicago Daily Tribune, which tried to get a jump on the competition by declaring Dewey the victor on election night before all the votes were counted. In a photo (24.7) that became an instant classic, a jubilant Truman held the paper and its erroneous headline “Dewey Defeats Truman” above his head the next morning when his victory was confirmed. Besides helping Truman win the election, the sight of wave after wave of planes arriving 24 hours a day in Berlin also demonstrated America’s strength and resolve to the Soviet Union.

 blockade on May 12, 1949. The capitalist enclave in the heart of the Soviet sector of Germany had survived. By that time the Americans, British, and French had created the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, out of their three occupied zones. In response the Soviets organized a Communist-led German government in their sector, the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. Germany was now formally divided into two separate states. After the Soviet-backed coup in Czechoslovakia and the blockade of Berlin, the United States refined its policy of containment. These events had shattered any chance of creating consensus within the Truman administration around Kennan’s vision that economic aid through the Marshall Plan could safeguard democracy and prosperity in Western Europe. If peace were to prevail, it would be an armed peace. Western European nations took the first step by allying themselves in the Brussels Pact in 1948. This alliance blossomed into the American-led NATO alliance in April 1949. The Soviet Union responded with their own alliance, the Warsaw Pact, among Eastern European nations. The map of the Cold War in Europe portrays the two alliance systems that divided Europe into capitalist and communist camps (see 24.2). By joining NATO the United States created its first formal military alliance since the Revolutionary War. There would be no repeat of World War I or World War II, when the United States had waited over two years each time before declaring war. As a member of NATO, it was obligated to come immediately to Western Europe’s defense in the event of a Soviet attack. Besides putting American bases and soldiers permanently in Europe, NATO extended the protection of America’s atomic shield to its NATO partners. Like the Marshall Plan NATO was designed to do many things at once. Besides creating a permanent role for the United States overseas and containing communism, NATO also helped keep peace among European nations that had clashed repeatedly in the last hundred years. A popular saying claimed that NATO kept “the Soviets out, the Americans in, and the Germans down” by ensuring that West Germany remained friends with western democracies even after the nation regained its economic vigor.

FIGHTING COMMUNISM: COLD AND HOT WAR



Fighting Communism:
Cold and Hot War
 As the Cold War took shape, the United States did not gain any noticeable advantage from its atomic monopoly in dealing with Stalin. Losing it, nonetheless, caused angst in the United States. In 1949, the Soviet Union successfully tested its own atomic bomb, challenging Americans’ view of their own nation as the world’s dominant military power. Suddenly the chances of an international crisis escalating into nuclear war appeared greater. As Americans digested this news, the epicenter of the Cold War shifted to Asia. By 1950, a Communist government controlled China, and the Korean War had begun. In the Korean War (1950–1953), the United States and its allies fought Communist North Koreans and Chinese to a stalemate, frustrating Americans.

Communism Rising: 1949
 The United States did not have long to celebrate its achievements during the Berlin airlift. Three months after Stalin admitted defeat in Berlin, an American spy plane detected radioactive fallout in the desert of Kazakhstan, a Soviet republic. This could mean only one thing: the Soviet Union had successfully tested its own atomic bomb. The news shattered the American certainty that it would retain a nuclear monopoly for at least ten years. Waiting impatiently for a formal announcement from the Kremlin, Truman finally broke the news to the world in September 1949. The Soviet Union confirmed the American report, but gave no other information about Stalin’s plans for his nuclear program. Fearful that Stalin might use nuclear weapons to expand beyond the iron curtain, the Truman administration broadened the scope of America’s containment strategy beyond NATO and the Marshall Plan. Truman decided to station American troops in Western Europe permanently to both deter and, if necessary, respond to a nuclear attack. The United States also began stockpiling atomic bombs to gain a numerical advantage over the Soviet Union. Finally Truman authorized the development of a “superbomb,” a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb that was 1,000 times more powerful than the uranium-enriched atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and the plutonium bomb that destroyed Nagasaki. Americans were still recovering from the shock of the Soviet bomb, when they received more bad news. The 25-year-old Chinese Civil War had finally ended with the Communist Mao Zedong victorious over the Nationalist leader Jiang Jieshi (Chiang

 Kaishek), who fled with his government to Taiwan, an island off the southeast coast of mainland China. Mao was an avid swimmer who refused even as an old man to be deterred by the human waste floating in China’s polluted rivers. A master of staying afloat in water and politics, Mao adopted Stalin and Soviet-style policies as his model, inflicting similarly painful waves of famine and political oppression on the Chinese people that killed more than 20 million. Fearful that the United States intended to attack China and restore Jiang to power, Mao immediately reached out to Stalin. “There should be some division of labor between us,” Stalin suggested, with the

Accepting Stalin’s offer Mao spent two months in Moscow devising a joint strategy that resulted in the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty, which pledged mutual assistance in the event of an enemy attack. This alliance created a second front in the Cold War that forced the United States to divide its attention between Europe and Asia. In light of these new threats, Truman ordered a full review of American foreign policy. The State Department responded with a document known as

 CHAPTER 24

A DIVIDED WORLD: THE EARLY COLD WAR, 1945–1963

 National Security Council Report 68, or NSC-68. Not mincing words NSC-68 declared that “the issues that face us are momentous, involving the fulfillment or destruction not only of this Republic but of civilization itself.” Secretary of State Acheson later admitted that NSC-68’s cataclysmic vision of a Soviet enemy “animated by a new fanatic faith” and bent on worldwide domination was meant to convince the president to use all means “short of war” to halt the apparent Soviet drive for world conquest. NSC-68 crystallized the piecemeal developments of the last four years into one clear vision: The United States must build up “the political, economic, and military strength of the free world to frustrate the Kremlin design of a world dominated by its will.” This message was transmitted to the public through political speeches, films, and novels. Perhaps no writer better encapsulated the public’s fears of worldwide communist domination than George Orwell in his classic novel 1984, which hit bookstores in 1949. Orwell envisioned a future where totalitarianism has triumphed and the people’s loyalty to a Stalin-like dictator “Big Brother,” who watches over everyone and censors their behavior, is ensured by a cycle of endless wars and torture. As the main character Winston Smith undergoes another round of torture, his tormentor tells him, “Imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever.” This image neatly expressed the American public’s view of communism in the Cold War.

The Korean War
At the end of World War II, the United States
 and the Soviet Union had agreed to divide the former Japanese colony of Korea, a peninsula along the north Asian Pacific Coast, into two zones of occupation. The country was split along the 38th parallel, with the USSR occupying the north and the United States the south. In 1945, partitioning the country seemed like a good way to deprive Japan of Korean resources and prevent the Soviet Union from completely taking over the peninsula. When the Soviet Union organized a Communist government under Kim Il-sung in North Korea and the United States selected Syngman Rhee to head a capitalist government in the south, the previously unified nation appeared permanently divided. By 1949, however, the United States had begun to reevaluate its military commitment in South Korea. The occupation was expensive, and

 Why did the United States decide to fight in Korea?

 Pentagon officials doubted the strategic importance of the peninsula. The State Department agreed, believing that economic aid and political reforms could strengthen South Korea enough to discourage a North Korean attack. In January 1950, Secretary of State Acheson openly questioned the importance of South Korea to the overall defense of American interests in East Asia. In a speech before the National Press Club, Acheson outlined a defensive perimeter in the Pacific that the United States would defend against communist incursions. It included Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, and the Philippines, but not South Korea. Accordingly Truman began withdrawing American soldiers from South Korea. To deter North Korea from attacking, the United States left a stockpile of conventional weapons and promised continued financial aid. Yet when North Korea launched a surprise invasion of South Korea in June 1950, Truman immediately reversed course. The speed and success of the North Korean attack alarmed him. Within two days North Korean troops had entered Seoul, the capital of South Korea (24.8), and by the end of one week North Korea had pushed the bulk of the South Korean army and its American advisors into the toe of the Korean peninsula around Pusan. Viewing this overpowering offensive as confirmation of NSC-68, Truman believed the USSR was behind the attack. He was partly right. Kim Il-sung had secured reluctant support from Stalin and Mao Zedong for the invasion by promising an easy victory. If the United States intervened in Korea, Stalin saw advantages to diverting American attention away from Europe. By June 1950, many Americans felt that the West was losing the Cold War. China had fallen to communism, and the Soviets had exploded an atomic bomb. At home sensational spy trials fueled continued doubts about Truman’s leadership. In this political climate doing nothing was hardly an option for him. Truman’s intimate understanding of World War I (he had served as an artillery captain in France) and World War II encouraged him to break with the precedent set by these recent conflicts. In each of these wars, Americans had debated the merits of fighting for more than two years before declaring war. “I remembered how each time the democracies failed to act it had encouraged the aggressors to keep going ahead,” Truman noted. Determined to respond quickly this time, he committed American troops to combat within days. Although Truman

 consulted Congress, he never asked for a declaration of war against North Korea. Instead he decided to work through the UN, which authorized the use of force to restore the original 38th-parallel boundary between North and South Korea. Sixteen nations sent troops to Korea to serve in the UN police force, but the United States provided the bulk of troops and commanded military operations. When polled, three-quarters of Americans approved of Truman’s decision to send military aid to South Korea. Americans, for the time being anyway, subscribed to his vision that “the future of civilization depends on what we do.” The situation on the battlefield, however, was grim, with South Korean soldiers holding on precariously around Pusan. To reverse the situation, General Douglas MacArthur, commander-in-chief of the United Nations forces, devised a dramatic and risky strategy. Rather than simply confronting the

War, 1950–1953


 North Koreans head-on, he staged an amphibious landing at Inchon, a port near Seoul. This attack on the North Koreans’ rear would cut their supply lines and force them to fight on two fronts. The tides at Inchon, however, were the second highest in the world, varying 29 feet between high and low tides. Within minutes, the receding tide could mire a boat in mud. Inchon, MacArthur reasoned, was the right place to attack precisely because it was so uninviting and would take the enemy by surprise. As he predicted, the North Koreans had stationed only 6,500 troops there, and the UN force of 40,000 encountered little resistance in taking the city. This operation turned MacArthur, already famous for his feats in World War II, into a national hero. Following the Inchon invasion UN forces quickly drove North Korean troops out of South Korea. After this victory, Truman pondered giving the war a new purpose. Instead of simply restoring the

 status quo of a divided Korea, he decided to try to reunify Korea under an anti-Communist government. Rolling back communism, rather than containing it, became the new goal sanctioned by the UN in October 1950. At that same moment, however, China was preparing to aid North Korea. When American troops crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea, they did not know that Mao was massing Chinese troops and guns along the North Korean-Chinese border. Still unaware of Mao’s intentions, American troops moved swiftly up the peninsula to celebrate Thanksgiving by the Yalu River. Victory seemed assured: MacArthur promised Truman that the troops would be home by Christmas. Then in late November waves of Chinese troops began pouring across the border, shrieking and blowing bugles. Terrified UN forces suffered heavy casualties as they withdrew in the harsh winter.

 How did the entry of the Chinese into the Korean War affect political and military debates within the United States?

 Douglas Duncan, warming his camera in his coat pocket to keep the film from breaking, chronicled the bitter retreat of 10,000 Marines who fought their way to safety. Nearly every soldier suffered frostbite; half the men were wounded or killed. “If I were God and could give you anything you wanted, what would you ask for?” Duncan asked one Marine. After several minutes the Marine replied, “Give me tomorrow.” Military leaders disagreed over how to respond as the Chinese continued their advance, which UN forces eventually contained around the 38th parallel. The Joint Chiefs of Staff urged Truman to seek a negotiated peace, advice he followed. MacArthur, however, publicly endorsed all-out war utilizing nuclear weapons. The president and theater commander now began to pursue two competing visions. As Truman made diplomatic overtures to the Chinese for a ceasefire along the 38th parallel, MacArthur warned the Chinese to surrender or face destruction. “There is no substitute for victory,” MacArthur wrote to Republican Congressman Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, echoing the feelings of countless Americans. This was not, however, Truman’s vision of how to end the war; when Martin read these words on the House floor, he sealed MacArthur’s fate. Truman fired MacArthur the next week, triggering, as Secretary of State Acheson had predicted, “the biggest fight of your administration.” MacArthur came home, not in disgrace, but to great acclaim. Many Americans shared his frustrations with the stalemate on the battlefield. Six years after defeating two great military powers in World War II, the United States found itself unable to reunify Korea under an anti-Communist government. Responding to MacArthur’s vision of total victory, huge crowds greeted the general when his ship docked in San Francisco, and he reveled in a ticker-tape parade held in his honor in New York City. Congress debated impeaching Truman but then opted instead to hold hearings into MacArthur’s removal. During the hearings MacArthur’s critics interrogated the

FIGHTING COMMUNISM: COLD AND HOT WAR

 general about the possibility that using nuclear weapons in Korea might lead to a global nuclear war. MacArthur’s response, “that doesn’t happen to be my responsibility,” caused the general’s popularity to plummet. The cooling enthusiasm for MacArthur’s vision of all-out war did little to bolster public confidence in Truman. In public opinion polls only 24 percent of Americans approved of how he was handling the presidency, reflecting public disappointment over Korea, anger at “losing China,” and well-publicized Soviet spy scandals that together revived the image of Truman as an ineffectual leader. His aggressive support for civil rights and his domestic reform agenda (see Chapter 25), too much for conservatives and too little for liberals, also contributed to his poor rating. Korea was the last American war that the public viewed primarily through photographs. Only 34 percent of American homes had television sets in 1952, rising to 86 percent by 1960. In 1950, Newsweek published the photograph “The Price of Victory: A Soldier Grieves for His Lost Buddy” (24.9). One reader’s suggestion that this image should serve as the iconic photo of the Korean War, just as “Old Glory Goes Up on Mt. Suribachi, Iwo Jima” had served to represent World War II, revealed a significant shift in the public’s attitudes over the last five years (see Images as History: Combat Photography, Chapter 23, page 706). The World War II image of five marines and one navy corpsman raising the flag suggested teamwork, victory, and the triumph of democracy. In sharp contrast “The Price of Victory” looked at the personal cost of war—the sorrow and compassion that drew men together on the battlefield—even as the photograph reaffirmed the willingness of soldiers to die for their country. Photographers and the public were beginning to probe the impact of fighting on soldiers, stoking the ambivalence that the country increasingly felt about the war. With MacArthur gone, General Matthew Ridgway took over command of UN operations in 1951, and armistice negotiations began. Talks were still underway two years later when a new president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, took office. His sunny demeanor offered a sharp contrast to Truman’s more combative and coarse personality. Whereas Truman cussed, told off-color jokes, and picked fights with reporters, Eisenhower was gregarious and friendly to

 all. Some Democrats had tried to draft Eisenhower as a presidential candidate in 1948. Four years later the Republican “We Like Ike” campaign finally convinced Eisenhower to seek office. The young women adorned here (24.10), with “Ike” dresses and umbrellas, illustrate Republicans’ gusto for Eisenhower on the eve of the nominating convention where delegates enthusiastically selected him as their candidate. Admired by Americans for his command of the D-Day invasion in World War II, Eisenhower’s military experience convinced Americans that he would be a capable leader in wartime. The negotiations remained deadlocked, however, until Eisenhower threatened to reconsider employing nuclear weapons. Finally the two sides agreed to a permanent ceasefire in July 1953. The war was costly on all sides. More than 400,000 Chinese soldiers and nearly two million North and South Koreans (soldiers and civilians) perished. For the first time since the War of 1812, the United States could not claim outright victory over its opponent despite nearly 33,000 men killed in combat and 103,000 men wounded. “What the hell is there to celebrate?” remarked one soldier when news of the armistice reached the front. The silence at home offered a marked contrast to the jubilant demonstrations that had filled the streets eight years earlier, when Japan surrendered. China embraced a competing vision of the stalemate,

 reveling in the ability to hold its own against the United States. The Korean War had major geopolitical consequences by turning the Cold War into a global conflict. The war tied South Korea and Japan, economically resurgent thanks to American aid, even more closely to the United States, and both became staunch allies in creating a defensive perimeter against communism in East Asia. Holding the line against communism in Korea increased America’s interest in other regional civil wars, including one underway in Vietnam. The war poisoned relations with China, and the two nations did not reestablish diplomatic relations until 1979. Pledged to defend

 South Korea, the United States still maintains a large military presence along what continues to be the world’s most heavily armed border.

Nuclear Fallout and Fear
 While soldiers fought and died on the battlefield, Americans at home waged their own defensive war against nuclear weapons. The government sponsored atmospheric and underwater tests of nuclear bombs in the 1940s and 1950s both in the United States and on the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. Even when the United States had a secure monopoly on nuclear weapons, many Americans expressed concern about nuclear fallout, the deadly pollution that descends through the air after a nuclear explosion. In the 1950s, popular science fiction writers and filmmakers tapped into this preoccupation. In the Japanese film classic Godzilla, for example, a nuclear explosion awakens a fire-breathing monster who, as the film’s promotional poster (24.11) illustrated, terrorizes Tokyo. Like the atomic bombs that ravaged Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Godzilla is an unstoppable nuclear force that obliterates everything in his path. Americans, however, saw only an edited version of the film, with all critical commentary on America’s ongoing nuclear testing program in the Pacific excised. Two popular Marvel comic book characters, the Incredible Hulk and Spider-Man, were also spawned by contact with radioactive material. In the Incredible Hulk, a scientist exposed to gamma rays is transformed into a green, 300-pound giant, while a bite from an irradiated spider turns nerdish lab assistant Peter Parker into Spider-Man. Teaching Americans how to live with the constant threat of nuclear war meant convincing citizens to remain vigilant and calm. To combat both indifference and panic, governmental propaganda underscored the seriousness of the threat, while also reassuring the public that they could survive an atomic blast, if they took precautionary measures such as building fortified fallout shelters or remembering to “duck and cover.” Images as History: Surviving an Atomic Bomb Blast explores how government-generated images presented competing visions that both reassured and frightened Americans about the likely effect of a nuclear attack. 24.11 Godzilla A 1954 Japanese horror film used the ravages of a nuclearspawned dinosaur named Godzilla to criticize American use and testing of its nuclear arsenal.

How people will react to advice or propaganda can be difficult to predict. Why did the government disseminate images of a possible nuclear attack? What unintended effects could these images have on the Americans viewing them? By 1950, schoolchildren throughout the nation had learned to jump out of their seats and under their desks with their hands clasped firmly over their heads when their teachers shouted “Drop!” during civil defense drills. In government-produced civil defense films and comic books distributed to schools, Bert the 
 The stick of dynamite dangling from a string symbolized a nuclear attack, exactly the kind of danger children needed to learn to recognize.

 A catchy jingle accompanied this lesson in civil defense: “There was a turtle by the name of Bert, and Bert the Turtle was very alert / When danger threatened him he never got hurt / He knew just what to do / He’d Duck and Cover / Duck and Cover.”

 Turtle instructed children to “duck and cover” during a nuclear attack. Advocates of this approach argued that flying debris and shattered windows had killed many victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki; therefore, teaching children to “duck and cover” was practical advice. To ensure that Americans remained vigilant in preparing for a nuclear attack, the government also released “before” and “after” photographs from a test explosion in the Nevada desert on March 17, 1953. Time magazine estimated that nearly three-quarters of the nation saw these pictures.

Fallout Shelters
 With the successful test explosion of the hydrogen bomb in 1954, the Eisenhower administration embraced mass evacuation from city centers as the best civil defense against nuclear attack. The president’s decision to construct an interstate highway system changed official policy “from ‘Duck and Cover’ to ‘Run Like Hell,’” the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists concluded. Multilane highways served peacetime needs by linking cities to suburbs and military needs by making the evacuation of civilians and the mobilization of the military easier if the United States was attacked. Practice evacuation runs were not encouraging, however. “Operation Kids,” for example, an effort to move 37,300 schoolchildren in Mobile, Alabama, out of the city without warning, resulted in heavy traffic jams. Eisenhower also urged Americans to build family shelters at their own expense. The government distributed pamphlets with suggested floor plans and advised women to store enough food and medical supplies to sustain their families if a nuclear attack contaminated water supplies or destroyed grocery stores. “Grandma’s pantry was ready” whenever guests unexpectedly arrived; “is your ‘pantry’ ready in event of emergency?” one government pamphlet asked. Given their high cost (even a barebones shelter cost $1,000, about one-fifth an average family’s

 annual income), few Americans could afford to construct their own fallout shelters. During another moment of crisis in 1961 when the United States and the Soviet Union clashed again over the fate of Berlin, Eisenhower’s successor, John F. Kennedy, dedicated public funds to preparing mass underground shelters in schools and public buildings. Signs with three yellow triangles superimposed on a black circle (24.12) that pointed toward underground public fallout shelters became ubiquitous in schools and government buildings. In 1956, the government began constructing secret centers throughout the nation to house officials in the event of a nuclear attack. The government did not make these preparations public, avoiding uncomfortable questions about what would happen to the rest of the country. These secret plans sought to ensure the continued functioning of Congress by transporting legislators and some staff members (without their families) to an underground shelter in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. As part of its preparations, the Treasury Department put an eight-month supply of $1 bills and a two-year supply of $5, $10, and $20 bills in bombproof shelters. The military scattered mini-Pentagons throughout the country, including underground facilities for the president and his cabinet near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Plans to whisk the government to safety during a nuclear attack remained in place until 1995.

 In the early 1960s, fallout shelter signs posted in neighborhoods, schools, and public buildings were daily reminders of the nuclear threat that hung over the nation.

SPIES IN OUR MIDST



Spies in Our Midst
 Recently released documents from the former Soviet Union suggest that as many as 300 Americans spied for the USSR during the 1930s and 1940s. Does this justify the attack on civil liberties that occurred during the anticommunist crusade that swept across the country during the 1940s and 1950s? During the Cold War many Americans believed that this anticommunist campaign made the country safer and freer; a minority voiced the competing vision that the government was using spy investigations to limit legitimate political discourse by eliminating the radical left. The government’s crusade against communism in the First Red Scare (1919) after World War I lasted only a few months. The effort to root out Communist spies after World War II lasted for nearly a decade.

The Second Red Scare
 To a country reeling from the loss of China to communism and the detonation of a Soviet bomb, the suggestion that the government was rife with communist spies offered a simple explanation for these complex events. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), which had investigated fascist activities in the United States during World War II, now probed the communist threat. Other measures from World War II also took on new life during the Second Red Scare, including the Smith Act (1940), which outlawed advocating the forceful destruction of the government. Acting on a precedent set by Franklin D. Roosevelt in World War II, Truman created a federal employee loyalty program in 1947 that gave the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the police arm of the Justice Department, the right to investigate the backgrounds of federal workers. Congress tightened restrictions on radical political activity even further with the McCarran Acts in 1950 and 1952, which stopped communists from entering the country and required communist or communist-front organizations to register with the attorney general. Most of the people investigated by HUAC and the FBI had once belonged to the Communist Party, which had attracted many new members during the labor unrest of the 1930s (see Chapter 22). Whether past or even present membership in the Communist Party made one a traitor was another question. When David Wellman was a young boy, his family was under constant police surveillance. Two unmarked cars sat outside their Detroit home and followed him and his sister to school, ball games, and the store. “Trying to turn fear into fun, we made shaking them a game,” he later recalled. Wellman

 maintained that his father, a wounded World War II veteran and leader in the Michigan Communist Party, and his mother, a communist active in trade unions, were not traitors but people who believed that revolution was an American ideal. The constant surveillance took a toll on the family. “It felt as if the government penetrated the deepest recesses of our lives every minute of the day,” Wellman recalled. Paranoia caused the family to censor speech within the home and on the telephone, certain that the police were always listening. As an adult Wellman got access to his family’s police file and was stunned to learn that the reports contained almost no information about his parents’ political activism. The police had discovered little through this constant surveillance, succeeding mostly in terrorizing the family, which, Wellman suspected, was their true intent.

 “They were trying to put the fear of police power in the minds of the people they spied on. To a large degree, it worked.” DAVID WELLMAN, whose family was under police surveillance during the Second Red Scare The two biggest spy cases of the era involved Alger Hiss and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. In 1948, Whittaker Chambers, a Time magazine editor and former member of the Communist Party, accused Alger Hiss, a high-ranking official during the

 Roosevelt administration, of being a communist. Hiss denied the charge before HUAC, announcing under oath that “I am not and never have been a member of any Communist front organization.” Chambers responded by charging that Hiss spied for the Soviet Union in the 1930s and as proof produced rolls of microfilm that Chambers had hidden in a hollow pumpkin in his garden. The microfilm contained copies of secret State Department papers from 1938 regarding the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and the Spanish Civil War that had been typed on Hiss’s typewriter. The “pumpkin patch” papers corroborated Chambers’s account and recently declassified intelligence documents have confirmed that Hiss worked as a Soviet spy through at least 1945. Because the statute of limitations on espionage had expired, a federal court convicted Hiss of perjury for lying to HUAC about his communist ties. Hiss served four years in jail. Congressman Richard Nixon, a member of HUAC, believed that the “Hiss case, for the first time, forcibly demonstrated to the American people that domestic communism was a real and present danger to the security of the nation.” Nixon’s leading role in the Hiss investigation catapulted him into the national spotlight. His prominence increased when he was elected vice president on the Republican ticket with Eisenhower in 1952.

24.13 The Rosenbergs Spy Case, 1953
 Protesters urge the government to execute convicted spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, reflecting the fury many Americans felt toward anyone believed to have betrayed the United States.

 In 1953, another spy case involving Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, the Jewish parents of two young boys, captivated the nation. The federal government charged Julius with passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union during World War II, information he had supposedly gathered from his brother-in-law, a Soviet spy working for the Manhattan Project, who later testified against the couple. Although Julius’s wife Ethel was never personally implicated in the spy ring, the government charged her with knowing of her husband’s involvement. Arrested to spur her husband into confessing, Ethel went on trial for espionage along with her husband. They each maintained their innocence even when convicted and sentenced to death by electric chair. As the execution date neared, demonstrators from the right and the left took to the streets, offering the public two competing visions of the Rosenbergs and the government’s anti-communist investigations. Men carrying signs that read “Burn All Reds” and “No Mercy for Spies” picketed before the White House (24.13). Supporters who believed that the Rosenbergs were being persecuted for their radical beliefs organized marches for clemency. Radio and television reporters witnessing the execution shared intimate details with a nation riveted on the couple’s final moments, including Ethel’s botched electrocution on June 19, 1953, when it took three tries to kill her. Their two young sons, aged ten and six, also endured intense media scrutiny. Relatives put them in an orphanage, and New Jersey revoked their right to attend public school. Rosenberg supporters Abe Meeropol (the author of the anti-lynching ballad “Strange Fruit,” see Chapter 21) and his wife eventually adopted the boys and changed their names. As adults they were active in leftist causes and until recently steadfastly maintained their parents’ innocence. For decades the right and the left embraced two competing visions of the Rosenbergs case. The right viewed the couple as traitors whose cooperation with the Soviet Union demonstrated the internal threat that the nation faced from Soviet spies. The left, believing the Rosenbergs innocent, felt that mainstream politicians exaggerated the communist menace to gain public support for eradicating all leftleaning political groups from American society. In some respects both portraits were accurate. Newly released Soviet documents reveal that Julius did indeed pass valuable atomic data to the Soviet Union, but it appears that Ethel knew nothing of her husband’s espionage activities, making her, along with countless others in the 1950s, a victim of overzealous investigators, who equated leftist politics with treason.

 What competing visions arose over the Hiss and Rosenbergs spy cases?

SPIES IN OUR MIDST

 HUAC against Hollywood The effort to expose the evildoings of communists went far beyond punishing government officials who spied for the Soviet Union. In 1947, HUAC began an investigation into alleged communist activities in Hollywood. Hundreds of screenwriters, producers, directors, and actors were called to testify. Initial hearings focused on the supposedly subversive plotlines and imagery of selected motion pictures, such as Mission to Moscow, a World War II–era film that presented the Soviet Union as paradise on earth. Jack Warner, the head of Warner Studies, had produced Mission to Moscow after the Roosevelt administration requested a film that would improve the public’s impression of the nation’s wartime ally. This episode in producing leftwing political propaganda was the exception rather than the rule in Hollywood. Most studio heads subscribed to Sam Goldwyn’s view that “if you want to send a message, use Western Union.” The iron grip of the Hollywood studio system allowed directors little independence to include political content in their films that was not approved by the studio bosses. As a result HUAC could find little evidence of “subversive” content in Hollywood films. Rather than abandoning its investigation of Hollywood, however, HUAC shifted focus to the political affiliations and beliefs of the people involved in making movies. After ten screenwriters, dubbed the “Hollywood Ten,” were convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with HUAC investigations and sentenced to a year in prison, studio executives created a Hollywood blacklist of individuals with suspected past or present communist ties, whom film studios refused to hire. The FBI had already infiltrated the Communist Party and provided HUAC with the names of all those in Hollywood with present or past communist affiliations. HUAC nonetheless pressured subpoenaed witnesses to publicly name names, not to gain information, but to test witnesses’ loyalty. Many cooperated with HUAC to salvage their careers. Most of those who refused to testify or to name names never worked in films again. Others, like future president Ronald Reagan, then the president of the Screen Actors Guild, joined the anti-communist crusade by privately providing the FBI with the names of individuals in Hollywood with potential communist connections. Reagan testified before HUAC as a liberal Democrat (his shift to the right came later), where he denied that communists “have ever at any time been able to use the

 motion-picture screen as a sounding board for their philosophy.” Director Elia Kazan and playwright Arthur Miller used their artistic work to explain the different choices they made when asked to testify by HUAC. Kazan’s film On the Waterfront (1954) starred Marlon Brando as an ex-prizefighter turned longshoreman, who overcomes his aversion to “ratting on your friends” and testifies against his corrupt union bosses. Kazan, who had been a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s, made the film to justify his own decision in 1952 to provide HUAC with the names of eight former Communist Party colleagues (see Competing Visions: Naming Names in Hollywood, page 740). On the Waterfront won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor. Conversely Miller refused to testify when called before HUAC in 1956 and criticized the hysteria created by the Second Red Scare in his play The Crucible, which likened the HUAC investigations to the Salem witch trials in colonial Massachusetts.

 “We will not knowingly employ a Communist nor a member of any party or groups which advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or by illegal or unconstitutional methods.” Studio executives’ statement announcing the creation of a Hollywood blacklist, 1947

 McCarthyism The government’s anti-communist crusade during the Second Red Scare also became known as McCarthyism, named for the media-savvy Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy from Wisconsin, who, along with HUAC, spearheaded numerous investigations into communist activities, many of them spurious. Anti-communist spy investigations predated McCarthy, but his flair for the dramatic made the senator an instant media sensation. McCarthy burst onto the scene after waving around a piece of paper during a speech before the Women’s Republican Club in Wheeling, West Virginia, on February 9, 1950, thundering that he

NAMING NAMES IN HOLLYWOOD
The following opinions, one from former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt who wrote a syndicated magazine column, “My Day,” and the other from film director Elia Kazan, offer opposing views on aiding the HUAC investigations. Consider how Roosevelt and Kazan defined the threat to American democracy in this period. What risks were involved in following the different suggestions each made? Could their two views be reconciled? In a 1947 “My Day” column, Eleanor Roosevelt expressed concerns that HUAC was creating a police state atmosphere that would squash artistic creativity and freedom of expression. I have waited a while before saying anything about the UnAmerican Activities Committee’s current investigation of the Hollywood film industry. I would not be very much surprised if some writers or actors or stagehands, or what not, were found to have Communist leanings, but I was surprised to find that, at the start of the inquiry, some of the big producers were so chicken-hearted about speaking up for the freedom of their industry. One thing is sure—none of the arts flourishes on censorship and repression. And by this time it should be evident that the American public is capable of doing its own censoring…. The film industry is a great industry with infinite possibilities for good and bad. Its primary purpose is to entertain people. On the side, it can do many other things. It can popularize certain ideals, it can make education palatable. However, in the long run, the judge who decides whether what it does is good or bad is the man or woman who attends the movies. In a democratic country I do not think the public will tolerate a removal of its right to decide what it thinks of the ideas and performances of those who make the movie industry work…. What is going on in the Un-American Activities Committee worries me primarily because little people have become frightened and we find ourselves living in the atmosphere of a police state, where people close doors before they state what they think or look over their shoulders apprehensively before they express an opinion…. If you curtail what the other fellow says and does, you curtail what you yourself may say and do. In our country we must trust the people to hear and see both the good and the bad and to choose the good. The UnAmerican Activities Committee seems to me to be better for a police state than for the USA. 
 Many people in Hollywood never forgave Elia Kazan for cooperating with HUAC. In his 1988 autobiography Kazan refused to apologize. Instead he asserted his right to protect his career and the need to defend the country. I believed it was the duty of the government to investigate the Communist movement in our country. I couldn’t behave as if my old “comrades” didn’t exist and didn’t have an active political program. There was no way I could go along with their crap that the CP [Communist Party] was nothing but another political party, like the Republicans and the Democrats. I knew very well what it was, a thoroughly organized, worldwide conspiracy. This conviction separated me from many of my old friends … Did I really want to change the social system I was living under? Apparently that was what I’d stood for at one time. But what s**t. Everything I had of value I’d gained under that system … Why had I taken so long to even consider telling the country—that’s what it amounted to—everything I knew? Was it because of the moral injunction against “informing,” which was respected only depending on which side you were on? … If the situation were reversed, wouldn’t the “comrades” protect themselves without hesitation and by any means? Including naming me…. I began to measure the weight and the worth of what I was giving up, my career in films, which I was surrendering for a cause I didn’t believe in. It seemed insane. What was I if not a filmmaker? … If you expect an apology now because I would later name names to the House Committee, you’ve misjudged my character…. The people who owe you an explanation (no apology expected) are those who, year after year, held the Soviets blameless for all their crimes.

 had a list of 205 known communists who worked in the State Department. (The paper turned out to be just a prop.) When pressed for the names of the people on his list, McCarthy stalled and announced that he would only show their names to Truman, which he never did. In each subsequent speech the number cited by McCarthy dropped until he finally settled on 57.

 “When a great democracy is destroyed, it will not be from enemies from without, but rather because of enemies from within.” Senator JOSEPH R. McCARTHY, Wheeling, West Virginia, 1950.

 As a Republican attacking a Democratic administration, McCarthy’s accusations had a partisan ring. Taking advantage of the media spotlight, he issued new charges against State Department officials, ruining the careers of many who could not mount an effective defense against his bullying. Reveling in the press attention that every new allegation brought, McCarthy sought bigger targets, even attacking Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall, who had authored the Marshall Plan while secretary of state, for having joined “a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man.” In 1954, a year after the Rosenbergs were executed, the career of Joseph McCarthy as an anti-communist crusader ended, when the senator began investigating the army for subversion. National television broadcast the hearings, and Americans watched aghast for 36 days as McCarthy intimidated witnesses, ignored facts, and made ludicrous charges. The climactic moment in the hearing came when the army’s attorney Joseph Welch rebuked McCarthy, telling him, “You have done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?” Approval ratings for McCarthy plummeted from 50 percent to 35 percent in Gallup polls. The public unraveling of support for McCarthy mirrored growing concerns among his fellow

 Republicans in Congress. Eisenhower and former HUAC member Richard Nixon were now in the White House. Attacking a Republican-controlled administration yielded fewer political benefits, and fellow Republicans privately urged Eisenhower to rein in McCarthy. Leery of having his own anticommunist credentials challenged, Eisenhower refused to confront McCarthy directly. Instead the president tried to take the high road. “I will not get down in the gutter with that guy,” Eisenhower vowed, reasoning that if he gave McCarthy enough rope, he would eventually hang himself. This hands-off approach allowed McCarthy to run wild until 1954, when, as Eisenhower predicted, he went too far. Eventually it was the mainstream press, not the president, who denounced McCarthy. After the Army-McCarthy hearings, the esteemed journalist Edward R. Murrow exposed McCarthy’s slander and lies in a television documentary. McCarthy, Murrow pointedly told his audience, “didn’t create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it.” However, when the Senate censured McCarthy on December 2, 1954, for violating Senate rules, the legislators chose to depict McCarthy as solely responsible for the excesses of anti-communism. A disgraced McCarthy died from liver failure caused by alcoholism three years later at age 49.

 “No one man can terrorize a whole nation unless we are all his accomplices.” Journalist EDWARD R. MURROW during a 1954 television exposé on McCarthy

 As Murrow suggested, the end of McCarthy’s career as a red-baiter did not stop the government’s anti-communist crusade. Republicans and Democrats alike took their cue from McCarthy and freely attacked any suspected radical working in local or state governments, public schools, or universities. The Smith Act remained in place, as did loyalty oaths, Hollywood blacklists, and police surveillance of suspected radicals. By the 1950s, using the charge of communism to discredit political opponents or liberal activists (such as Martin Luther King Jr.) was commonplace in American politics.

 Is the term McCarthyism a useful or misleading way to characterize the Second Red Scare?



 CHAPTER 24

A DIVIDED WORLD: THE EARLY COLD WAR, 1945–1963

Averting Nuclear War
 The worldwide ideological, political, and military struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union fueled Americans’ fear of communism, both at home and throughout the world. The vision of fighting a nuclear war continued to haunt Americans even after the ceasefire in Korea. Technological advances in long-range ballistic missiles and satellites provoked a new threat in the Cold War standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union. A missile fitted with a nuclear warhead could now reach the United States within half an hour from the Soviet Union. Armed uprisings in Eastern Europe, renewed Soviet demands that the West abandon Berlin, and the Cuban Missile Crisis created a climactic moment when the world teetered on the edge of all-out nuclear war.

Sputnik


24.14 Sputnik,
For Americans
 this small satellite symbolized Soviet technological superiority over the United States, fueling the arms race between the two nations.

On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union
 sent the world’s first satellite, nicknamed Sputnik (“fellow traveler”), into outer space. The size of a basketball and weighing just 183 pounds, Sputnik (24.14) nonetheless became a symbol of Soviet technological superiority, a satellite that could orbit the earth in 98 minutes. Today satellites serve a host of peaceful functions, transmitting television images and telephone calls around the globe. In 1957, however, Americans focused primarily on the new strategic advantage that satellite technology gave the Soviets. The Soviets could easily fit a missile that sent Sputnik into orbit with a nuclear warhead and launch it at the United States. To help Americans picture another danger, Life magazine traced the hypothetical path of Sputnik over a 24-hour period (24.15), warning “The Orbit Weaves a Web as Whole World Watches.” Several orbits each day (marked in red as a reminder of the communist control of Sputnik) passed directly over the United States, bringing the Soviets ever closer to America’s doorstep as they gradually ensnared the world. Fearing that the United States was losing the “space race,” the government created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to launch America’s own investigation of space, and the Defense Department scrambled to develop American satellite technology. Predicting how the Soviet Union’s volatile new leader might use this

 technological breakthrough kept Americans on edge. In the power struggle that followed Stalin’s death from a brain hemorrhage in March 1953, Nikita Khrushchev emerged as the new Soviet premier. A poorly educated peasant, who rose through the ranks to become a Stalin protégé, Khrushchev reveled in rhetorical excess. He proclaimed that the USSR was producing missiles “like sausages,” and enjoyed keeping his American visitors offbalance. During a visit by Minnesota Senator Hubert 24.15 Life magazine illustrated the Sputnik threat by showing how its orbits gave the Soviets control of space, including areas over the United States.

AVERTING NUCLEAR WAR

 Humphrey to Moscow, Khrushchev stopped his threatening tirade long enough to ask Humphrey where he was from. “That’s so I don’t forget to order them to spare the city when the rockets fly,” he said good naturedly. Eager to catch up with the Soviet Union in missile technology and cut the defense budget (conventional military forces cost more than building nuclear weapons), Eisenhower oversaw a tremendous increase in American nuclear weaponry, which grew from 800 to nearly 8,000 warheads between 1953 and 1960. This build-up was part of a strategic vision called the “New Look.” In 1954, Eisenhower’s tough-talking secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, announced that the United States would focus on developing “massive retaliatory power” to deter Soviet aggression. The National Security Council agreed with Dulles that the country would go bankrupt trying to develop adequate defenses against Soviet nuclear weapons and policing the world with ground troops. Dulles maintained that a strong arsenal of intercontinental missiles (ICBMs) armed with nuclear warheads would allow the United States to “retaliate, instantly, by means and at places of our choosing” when the Soviets stepped out of line. Eisenhower liked the New Look because it offered a way to counter the Soviet manpower advantage while maintaining a small peacetime army. The appeal of “massive retaliation” was simple—it provided “more bang for the buck,” some commentators noted. Getting accurate data on the Soviet arsenal became critical once the United States embraced the doctrine of massive retaliation. The year before the Soviets launched Sputnik, the Americans began using a new U-2 spy plane to photograph Soviet military installations. Soviet radar could detect the U-2, but the plane flew at altitudes out of range for Soviet fighter pilots or antiaircraft missiles. For four years the United States used U-2 missions to collect intelligence about Soviet long-range missiles before turning to spy satellites. The photographs were reassuring. At the end of 1959, the United States learned, the Soviet Union had only six ICBM sites able to launch a missile carrying a nuclear warhead. Because it took 20 hours to fuel each missile, which could travel through space to reach targets 5,000 to 6,000 miles away in half an hour, the United States would have ample time to respond if the Soviet Union launched a first strike with six missiles. Despite Khrushchev’s claims that the Soviets possessed a huge nuclear arsenal, American had far more nuclear warheads and ICBMs.

24.16 Nuclear
 Arms Race, 1950s The United States and Soviet Union tried to best each other by developing increasingly sophisticated nuclear weapons.

 Having made much of the claim that the Soviet Union possessed more ICBMs than the United States in his successful 1960 presidential campaign against Richard Nixon, President John F. Kennedy waited a few months before revealing the truth in 1961. Calling Khrushchev’s bluff Kennedy announced that the United States had a “second strike capability which is at least as extensive as what the Soviets can deliver by striking first. Therefore, we are confident that the Soviets will not provoke a major nuclear conflict.” The gap only kept growing in America’s favor. Continuing the policy of massive retaliation, Kennedy oversaw an increase in the American ICBM stockpile from 63 to 424 from 1961 to 1963. The attention given to the missile gap during the 1960 presidential campaign revealed the constant pressure that Americans felt to retain the upper hand in the ever-evolving nuclear arms race. The chart (24.16) lists the key developments in early Cold War nuclear weaponry, illustrating the intense competition between the United States and Soviet Union to develop nuclear weapons, including nuclear-powered submarines that could stay submerged for two months and fire nuclear-fitted missiles.

 at a Communist Party Congress. His speech, taken as a cue that the new Soviet regime would be more open and tolerant, set off rebellions in Poland and Hungary. The Polish communists reasserted control themselves, but Soviet troops crushed the rebellion in Hungary, revealing that Khrushchev intended to retain Soviet control over Eastern Europe. Khrushchev also moved to consolidate Soviet power over Berlin, twice issuing ultimatums to the West to vacate the divided city. The stark differences between life in East and West Berlin had become a public embarrassment to the Soviet Union. Lavishly rebuilt by West Germany and the Marshall Plan, West Berlin teemed with new housing, industry, and commerce. Moving freely between the more prosperous western half and the areas under Communist control, hundreds of thousands of East Germans voted with their feet. After defecting they traveled easily from West Berlin into West Germany to start new lives. Khrushchev viewed the 44-year-old Kennedy as an inept, inexperienced leader, whom he could intimidate. A botched U.S.-sponsored invasion of Cuba in 1961 (discussed more fully below) only reaffirmed Khrushchev’s low opinion of Kennedy. Believing that Kennedy would crumble under pressure, Khrushchev demanded that the West leave Berlin when the two met in Vienna. To Khrushchev’s surprise the president stood firm. Kennedy left the summit “shaken and angry,” one reporter claimed. He never met with Khrushchev again. Instead he returned home and requested funds for additional nuclear and conventional forces. The public fully supported their president. More than 82 percent favored maintaining American, French, and British forces in Berlin, even if it meant war with the Soviet Union. With Kennedy unwilling to abandon the city, Khrushchev resisted the temptation to erect another blockade. Instead of revoking permission for the West to use roads through East Germany to supply the city, as Stalin had in 1948, he decided to build a wall between West Berlin and East Germany (see 24.5 on page 726). In the twilight hours of August 13, 1961, construction of a barbed wire fence began. East German tanks and troops rolled up to the monumental Brandenburg Gate, the original entry point to Berlin which lay in the Soviet sector of the city, to prevent a popular protest from breaking out in front of this symbol of German nationhood. East German workers quickly laid a thin line of barbed wire in front of the Brandenburg Gate, turning the popular square into a desolate no-man’s land.

 What did the Berlin Wall mean to Americans?

 “Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect, but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us.” President JOHN F. KENNEDY, in a speech before the Berlin Wall, 1963

 West Germans flocked to the construction site in shock. Some East Germans made desperate lastminute escapes, jumping from the windows of buildings that straddled the boundary into nets held by West German firefighters. Twelve-foot-high concrete barriers with rounded piping on top (to make scaling the wall more difficult) soon replaced the barbed wire. Envisioning Evidence: The Berlin Wall depicts the complex defensive system that stood until 1989. The wall stopped the flow of people from East to West Berlin without provoking a major confrontation with the United States. As the wall went up in 1961, Kennedy remarked to his aides that “a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.” When he finally visited the wall in June 1963, he expressed solidarity with the people on both sides of the divided city by announcing, “Ich bin ein Berliner” (which Kennedy thought meant “I am a Berliner,” not realizing that ein Berliner was the name for a popular doughnut).

Bay of Pigs and the Cuban
Missile Crisis
 Americans viewed communist activities in Germany with dismay, but the prospect of a communist Cuba alarmed the government more: Cuba lay just 90 miles south of Florida. In 1959, Fidel Castro had overthrown the dictator Fulgencio Bastista y Zaldívar. Castro quickly consolidated his power. He declared himself a communist, confiscated a billion dollars in American property, and accepted aid from the Soviet Union. In response an alarmed Eisenhower broke off diplomatic relations and imposed economic sanctions, including an embargo that banned the export of American goods to the island. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) urged more forceful action and began planning the covert

THE BERLIN WALL
During the Cold War, the 96-mile long Berlin Wall around West Berlin became an iconic symbol of Soviet oppression to the western world. Initially nothing more than a barbed wire fence, the Berlin Wall quickly evolved into a complex network of 12-foot-high concrete walls, electrified fences, bunkers, land mines, observation towers, spotlights, guard dogs, and sirens. Fugitives’ footprints in the soft sand spread on the eastern side of the wall (raked each day) alerted guards to breaches in the wall’s defenses. Guards had strict orders to shoot anyone they saw attempting to escape. Nearly 5,000 people succeeded in circumventing the wall (some by digging tunnels under it) but over 175 people died trying.

 CHAPTER 24

A DIVIDED WORLD: THE EARLY COLD WAR, 1945–1963

 “We’re eyeball to eyeball, and I think the other fellow just blinked.” Secretary of State DEAN RUSK, upon receiving word that Soviet ships had turned back during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962

 Bay of Pigs operation, a failed amphibious invasion by Cuban exiles in 1961 to overthrow Castro. Eisenhower left office before the scheduled invasion, but Kennedy endorsed the plan. Problems arose immediately, however. Two days before the ground attack, American planes (painted to look like stolen Cuban aircraft) bombed Cuban air defenses. On April 17, 1961, 1,400 exiles landed and were immediately killed or captured. Kennedy’s unconvincing public statement that the United States was not involved in this “struggle of Cuban patriots against a Cuban dictator” hurt his credibility at home and overseas. The Bay of Pigs fiasco hardened the resolve of Kennedy, Khrushchev, and Castro to gain the upper hand in this new Cold War hotspot. The CIA devised schemes for overthrowing Castro that involved sabotage and terrorism. In November 1961, CIA agents and Cuban exiles covertly traveled in speedboats from Florida to Cuba, where they burned sugar plantations and blew up factories and oil depots. The CIA also plotted to assassinate Castro by trying to poison his ice cream and cigars and enlisting Mafia crime bosses to kill him. Castro complained to Khrushchev about America’s murderous intentions, and in return received Soviet economic and military aid. Protecting communism in Cuba now became a major goal for the Soviet Union. On October 22, 1962, President Kennedy appeared on national television to deliver the stunning news that the Soviet Union was building missile launching pads in Cuba for short- and intermediate-range nuclear missiles. U.S. bases in Italy, Britain, and Turkey housed nuclear missiles aimed at the Soviet Union. Putting Soviet missiles in Cuba, a mere 90 miles from the American coast, would teach Americans “just what it feels like to have enemy missiles pointing at you,” Khrushchev told his advisors. The Cuban Missile Crisis, a showdown in 1962 between the United States and the Soviet Union over Khrushchev’s decision to place Soviet missiles in Communist Cuba aimed at America, was underway.

 What was the ultimate significance of the Cuban Missile crisis?

 Instead of accepting the Soviet view that missiles in Cuba simply leveled the playing field, Kennedy responded with a competing vision that the Soviet actions represented “a provocative change in the delicate status quo both countries have maintained.” Short- and intermediate-range Soviet missiles in Cuba threatened to reduce the strategic advantage that America held with its larger long-range nuclear arsenal. This was unacceptable to Kennedy. Intelligence officials estimated that the missile sites would become operational in two weeks, giving Kennedy only a small window of time before the Soviets would double their ability to launch a devastating nuclear strike against the United States. Kennedy ultimately decided to use a naval blockade to prevent Soviet ships from arming the launching sites with nuclear missiles. (Only later would Kennedy discover that missiles were already in Cuba. The president never learned that the estimate of 10,000 Soviet troops in Cuba was wrong—there were actually 42,000). Choices and Consequences: The Cuban Missile Crisis, outlines the options facing Kennedy during this tense fortnight, the closest that the world ever came to fighting an all-out nuclear war. The world waited for 13 days as Soviet ships steamed toward the American fleet guarding Cuban ports. American pilots sat in planes loaded with nuclear weapons, waiting to take off for Cuba at a moment’s notice. Finally Khrushchev called the ships back and offered to negotiate. The public breathed a collective sigh of relief that nuclear war had been averted, but the crisis lingered on behind closed doors for another month. As Soviet engineers continued to work on the missile sites, Kennedy and Khrushchev debated the exact terms of an agreement. In the end the American navy won the right to inspect ships carrying dismantled missiles out of Cuba. In return the United States agreed to dismantle its missiles in Turkey and pledged to respect Cuban independence by not launching another Bay of Pigs–type invasion. Over the next few years, landbased missile sites lost significance as more American and Soviet submarines equipped with nuclear missiles began patrolling the oceans. Having teetered on the brink of nuclear war, both the United States and the Soviet Union opted to deescalate tensions. Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to establish a hotline connection between Washington and Moscow, so they could speak directly in the event of another crisis. In June 1963, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States also signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which banned atmospheric and underwater testing of nuclear weapons.

AVERTING NUCLEAR WAR



Choices and Consequences
THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS
Long-range missiles (4,000–5,000 miles) launched from the USSR could already reach America, but short-range (1,100 miles) and intermediate-range (2,200 miles) nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba would help close the missile gap by giving the Soviets more weapons to use against the United States. Determined to get Soviet missiles out of Cuba, Kennedy and his advisors debated how to respond on October 16, 1962. 
Choices




 Use air and ground forces to attack Cuba and destroy the missile sites.



 Follow up an attack on Cuba with a fullscale invasion to depose Castro.



 Negotiate with the Soviet Union and Cuba.



 Use a naval quarantine to prevent Soviet-supplied missiles from reaching Cuba.

Decision
 Kennedy opted for the quarantine. He sent the American navy 500 miles from Cuban shores to intercept Soviet vessels carrying missiles, and threatened a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union if missiles were launched from Cuba.

Consequences
 For two tense days Soviet ships steamed toward American naval vessels. At the last minute Khrushchev called the ships back and offered to negotiate by removing the missiles if Kennedy pledged not to attack Cuba and the United States dismantled its missiles in Turkey. Kennedy privately agreed to these terms. By

 deciding against an air strike, Kennedy may have averted a nuclear war. Unbeknownst to the president, nuclear warheads were already in Cuba. Soviet commanders on the ground had permission to use them if the United States attacked and considered using them against the blockade.

Continuing Controversies
 Did Kennedy react correctly during the Cuban Missile Crisis? Supporters argue that Kennedy effectively used the threat of an American nuclear attack, traditional naval tactics, and old-fashioned diplomacy to end the crisis without resorting to war. By doing so he maintained America’s strategic advantage against the Soviet Union and improved the nation’s image worldwide after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Detractors claim that Kennedy provoked a crisis where there was none. Short- and mediumrange missiles in Cuba did not alter the Soviets’ ability to

 attack with long-range missiles or of the United States to launch a devastating second-strike. Supporters counter that the improved accuracy of shorter-range missiles fired from Cuba posed a real threat. Critics also point out that because Kennedy made concessions privately to Khrushchev, the crisis gave rise to the myth that “brinkmanship,” or threatening nuclear war, rather than diplomatic negotiations, caused the Soviets to back down. Overconfidence after the Cuban Missile Crisis would lead to missteps in America’s growing military involvement in the Vietnam War and elsewhere.

In a Land of Plenty
Contentment and Discord, 1945 –1960
 On September 3, 1957, a young black teenager, Elizabeth Eckford, walked past an angry mob after state troopers refused to let her enter the all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. This photo captures her harrowing ordeal as a young white woman, Hazel Bryan, her face contorted with rage, screamed at Eckford. In the days that followed, a sympathetic white man put an ad in the local newspaper featuring this photograph. “Study this picture and know shame,” he told his neighbors. Instead, for years Bryan received congratulatory letters from diehard segregationists for her verbal assault on Eckford that day. Five years later Bryan tracked down Eckford in Little Rock to apologize. Eckford went on to graduate from college, served in the army, and then became a probation officer. This photograph challenges the traditional image of the 1950s as a tranquil period of material contentment and ideological consensus. Americans enjoyed unprecedented prosperity during the decade but also experienced domestic discord along racial, generational, and political lines. New energy surged into the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s. Acts of extraordinary bravery by Elizabeth Eckford and others like her took on new significance in an era when Supreme Court rulings pushed the federal government to take an active role in protecting the civil rights of African Americans. Leadership from black churches and black students infused the movement with an ethos of nonviolent direct action that forced white America to see the injustice of Jim Crow, the Southern legal structure that relegated African Americans to second-class citizenship. A different type of discord permeated American home-life throughout the 1950s. In many respects families were the focus of American society from 1945 to1960. Enjoying a rising standard of living in generally prosperous times, American families grew at an unprecedented rate. Lured to fast-growing suburbs by lowcost loans and affordable housing, an exploding middle class filled their homes with possessions previously out of reach for most Americans. The baby boom generation, those 76.4 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964, who were now coming into adolescence, embraced new standards in dress, music, and movies that distinguished the “teen” generation from their parents. Some teenagers rebelled against authority in more overtly political ways. High school and college students, for instance, were the ground troops in many civil rights demonstrations. Others joined the counterculture Beat movement to express their rebellion against social norms through poetry, novels, and art. From 1945 to 1960, Americans debated the divergent political paths that the country could take domestically during the Cold War era. They pondered the effects of New Deal programs, unions, suburbs, civil rights, and consumption on American society. The changing American way of life created a sense of both contentment and crisis for the nation.

 CHAPTER 25

IN A LAND OF PLENTY: CONTENTMENT AND DISCORD, 1945–1960

Securing the New Deal Legacy
 Once prosperity returned after World War II, Republicans tried to undo the New Deal, arguing that these Depression-era programs hampered the free market and deprived industrialists of the freedom to run their companies as they saw fit. Moderate Democrats, like President Harry Truman, focused on preserving past reforms. When labor unions launched unpopular postwar strikes, Republicans joined with conservative southern Democrats to roll back New Deal legislation that had benefited the labor movement. The victory over labor, however, did not provide enough momentum for conservatives to achieve their ultimate goal: dismantling the entire New Deal. 25.1 Striking Steel Workers, 1946 Picketing steel workers carried signs with slogans meant to win sympathy from ordinary Americans, but widespread strikes caused a public backlash against labor unions.

The Labor Movement

 In 1945, the labor movement enjoyed unparalleled strength. Government support for union organizing during the New Deal and World War II, combined with a wave of successful sit-down

 strikes in the 1930s, had made labor a powerful force in American society. This was the high point of the labor movement in American history. Over 14 million workers belonged to unions, nearly 35 percent of the industrial workforce. Labor flexed its muscle in 1946, when the lifting of wartime price controls sent prices skyrocketing.

SECURING THE NEW DEAL LEGACY

 Nearly 4.6 million workers participated in 5,000 strikes nationwide in 1945–1946, demanding not just higher wages and benefits but also the right to participate in management decisions regarding investments, product lines, production methods, and plant locations. The signs held by striking steelworkers in this photo (25.1) outside a Bethlehem Steel Plant were intended to mobilize public support. The slogans demanded fairness to returning veterans, gave assurances that higher wages would not lead to higher prices, and proposed a living wage for workers who made such a valuable commodity. Black and white steelworkers manned this picket line together, reflecting the success of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in mending racial divisions that had previously weakened the labor movement (see Chapter 22). As the labor unrest widened, popular support for strikes diminished. The public had little sympathy for threats to shut down the steel and car industries, which formed the core of the national economy. Strikes in the coal and meatpacking industries also made it more expensive for Americans to heat their homes and eat meat. When railroad workers went on strike, Truman intervened. The railroad strike “threatens to paralyze all our industrial, agricultural, commercial, and social life,” leading to potential starvation at home and abroad, the president proclaimed. Although supportive of New Deal labor legislation, Truman announced he would use the army to run the railroads and draft striking workers into the military if they did not return to work. Moments before he was scheduled to ask Congress to authorize this legislation, the strikers returned to work. Workers in other industries fared a bit better. Negotiated settlements in the steel and auto industries set the benchmark for wages, benefits, and shop floor practices that other companies, even nonunionized ones like the general merchandiser Sears Roebuck, adopted to maintain peaceful labor relations. Industrialists also gained in these agreements. Longer contracts ensured an extended period of tranquility with no strikes, and in all settlements company owners maintained control over management decisions. The Republicans’ successful mid-term campaign slogan, “Had Enough? Vote Republican,” capitalized on voters’ dismay over labor conflicts and higher prices. In 1946, for the first time since 1933, the Republican Party won majorities in both the House and the Senate. Republicans hoped to use this victory as a springboard for



 unseating Truman in 1948. The Eightieth Congress immediately passed strong anti-labor legislation over Truman’s veto. Although dismayed with the strikes of 1946, Truman knew that he would need labor’s vote in the upcoming presidential contest. The Taft-Hartley Act (1947) abolished the closed shop, a practice that required all workers who benefited from a union-negotiated contract to join the union. The law also banned so-called sympathy boycotts, strikes by workers who wanted to support another union’s protest. Finally the requirement that all union officers sign affidavits certifying that they were not members of the Communist Party encouraged unions to purge their most radical members, often those who had pioneered new tactics, like the sit-down strike in the 1930s. The Taft-Hartley Act was a serious blow to the labor movement. The merger in 1955 between the CIO and the more conservative American Federation of Labor (AFL) ushered in a more cautious era of labor organizing that mostly ignored unskilled and Southern workers.

Presidential Agendas:
Truman and Eisenhower
 Conservative Republicans hoped that the TaftHartley Act would spearhead a drive to dismantle the New Deal. Instead the curtailment of labor removed the most visible symbol of what was supposedly “wrong” with the New Deal just as the 1948 presidential campaign got underway. To win, Truman decided that the votes of labor and Northern African Americans were more important than retaining the solid South. The Democratic Party adopted the slogan “Don’t let them take it away,” referring to the minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and Social Security that the New Deal had granted to industrial workers. Liberal Democrats successfully pushed Truman to take a stronger stand on civil rights. In July 1948, for both principled and pragmatic reasons, Truman ordered the desegregation of the armed forces, an important civil rights milestone. Truman’s embrace of civil rights caused Southern conservatives to bolt from the Democratic Party; his earlier confrontations with labor also convinced social progressives to leave the party. Vowing to preserve segregation, conservative Southern Democrats formed the States Rights Party and nominated South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond to run against Truman and the Republican candidate,

 Thomas Dewey. On the political left former Vice President Henry Wallace ran on the Progressive Citizens of America ticket, representing a coalition of liberals and radicals upset about the assault on civil liberties at home and the nation’s aggressive foreign policy as the Cold War took shape. Truman’s campaign assault on big business as “gluttons of privilege,” strong support from labor and blacks, and the success of the Berlin airlift propelled him to a clear victory in the Electoral College (303 to 189), but he led Dewey by just two million in the popular vote (see Chapter 24).

 “The time has come to walk out of the shadow of states’ rights and into the sunlight of human rights.” Minneapolis Mayor HUBERT HUMPHREY, urging Democrats to adopt a strong civil rights stance in the 1948 presidential election

 For much of his second term, Truman focused on managing foreign affairs and fending off assaults on his administration from Senator Joseph McCarthy (see Chapter 24). Abandoning his earlier stance of merely sustaining the New Deal, Truman put forth the Fair Deal, proposals for national health care, public housing, education, and public works projects. The Democratic majority that controlled the Eighty-First Congress funded state school systems and urban public housing, increased the minimum wage, and continued bringing electricity and telephones into rural areas. Proposals for national health insurance stalled, but Congress did vote to build more hospitals and expanded public health facilities for the poor. In June, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea and political debate shifted to the Korean War (see Chapter 24). Truman, wary of undermining bipartisan support for his Cold War policies and the Korean War, did not push hard for controversial Fair Deal initiatives such as repealing the Taft-Hartley Act, price and wage controls, or universal health care. Only a fraction of Truman’s

 How did foreign affairs influence domestic politics in the postwar era?

 Fair Deal proposals became law, but his program foreshadowed the more successful and extensive liberal agendas of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, both Democrats. By the end of the Truman administration, most Americans could not imagine a society without Social Security or a minimum wage, expectations that shaped the political vision of the nation’s next president. In 1952 and again in 1956, the Republican candidate Dwight Eisenhower won in landslide elections, both times defeating Democrat Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois. The virtually unknown Stevenson faced the daunting challenge of overcoming Southern anger at Truman’s civil rights reforms (which Stevenson supported) and America’s affection for Eisenhower, a World War II hero. A gifted orator, Stevenson stuck to traditional stump speeches, while Eisenhower became the first presidential candidate to use televised political ads. He honed his folksy image in short ads that aired during the commercial breaks of popular nighttime TV programs. America voted overwhelmingly for the man they knew and liked, with Eisenhower defeating Stevenson by 422 to 89 electoral votes. In 1956, running on a slogan of “peace and prosperity” that noted his success in ending the Korean War, Eisenhower polled even higher numbers, receiving 457 electoral votes to Stevenson’s 73. Republican critics like Senator Robert Taft of Ohio attacked the Fair Deal as “creeping socialism” because these expensive programs required high taxes and, in Republicans’ view, gave the government too much power. The 1953 editorial cartoon Who Said ‘Creeping Socialism’ (25.2) reflected the conservatives’ fear that Eisenhower would have trouble taming New Deal and Fair Deal programs. The congressman in the cartoon, a symbol of runaway big government, holds a briefcase labeled “Govt. in Business, Housing, Power, Transport,” and his running head start makes it impossible for Eisenhower to catch up. The cartoon actually misrepresented Eisenhower’s intentions. The president liked to say that he was “conservative when it comes to money and liberal when it comes to human beings.” To appeal to the moderates in each party, Eisenhower announced that he had no intention of dismantling popular New Deal programs. “Should any political party attempt to abolish social security and eliminate labor laws and farm programs,

 you would not hear of that party again in our political history,” Eisenhower concluded, to the dismay of Republican conservatives. His “victory of the moderates,” as commentators termed it,



 underscored that New Deal reforms were here to stay. Eisenhower did curb the Fair Deal by vetoing new public housing and public works projects and never offered any new social welfare measures. Fiscally conservative, Eisenhower believed that balancing the budget and limiting government expenditures created a favorable business environment that promoted jobs and prosperity. He also fostered strong ties between government and the defense industry as the Pentagon amassed a huge nuclear arsenal. In the president’s view, a nuclear shield protected the nation more cheaply and effectively than conventional arms or troops. But Eisenhower expressed misgivings about the domestic costs of a large defense budget as early as 1953: “Every gun made, every warship that is launched, every rocket fired, signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.” Nine years later, as he prepared to vacate the White House, Eisenhower suggested that he had gone too far in promoting the convergence of military and industrial interests. In a well-remembered speech, he urged Americans to keep an eye on the “military-industrial complex,” his term for the close ties between the defense industry and the Pentagon that might unduly influence government policy. “We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes,” Eisenhower warned.

A
Middle-Class America  By any measure the 1950s were a prosperous decade. From 1945 to 1960, per capita consumption rose 50 percent, wages grew by one-third, and unemployment averaged 4.6 percent. American productivity also boomed. With only six percent of the world population, the United States produced half of the world’s manufactured goods in the 1950s. The 1950s gave the generation raised in the austerity of the Great Depression something they had never known: affluence. For the first time many Americans enjoyed the trappings of middle-class life—a suburban home filled with modern appliances and a car in the garage—previously available only to a small segment of the population. By 1960, the nation crossed a significant historic threshold, when 60 percent of Americans were classified as middle class. The United States was no longer a primarily working-class society.

Postwar Prosperity
 In 1948, Vernon Presley brought his family to Memphis, Tennessee, to escape the grinding poverty of Mississippi. Gladys Presley later recalled that her son, Elvis, “would hear us worrying about our debts, being out of work and sickness and he’d say, ‘Don’t you worry none, Baby. When I grow up, I’m going to buy you a fine house . . . and get two Cadillacs— one for you and Daddy, and one for me.” Elvis Presley fulfilled this promise to his parents when he

 became the most famous rock-and-roll star of the era. For the rest of his life, Elvis, an extreme example of the era’s conspicuous consumption, gave away cars to friends and family. Few Americans enjoyed this level of financial success, but the kind of deprivation that Elvis experienced as a child became a relic of the past for millions in the 1950s. The typical American “has access to amenities—foods, entertainment, personal transportation, and plumbing—in which not even the rich rejoiced a century ago,” economist John

 Kenneth Galbraith noted. Having discretionary income for a television, vacations, or sending a child to college transformed the lives of American workers. “If what we lived through in the 1950s was not liberation,” Jack Metzgar, the son of Pennsylvania steelworkers, noted, “then liberation never happens in real human lives.” An aggressive union movement seeking higher wages and benefits and the New Deal safety net of guaranteed pensions and unemployment insurance helped fuel this leap into the middle class for many industrial workers. Other government initiatives also helped transform the way Americans lived. In 1944, just 44 percent of Americans owned their homes. By 1960, this figure had risen to 60 percent thanks to the 1944 GI Bill of Rights that offered returning veterans low-interest loans and to a tax code that provided incentives for homeowners. In addition state and federal governments constructed the roads, schools, bridges, and sewers that new suburban developments required. During World War II production of consumer goods was scant, and many Americans had accumulated savings that they were now eager to spend. In 1950 alone, Americans snatched up 6.2 million refrigerators, 14.6 million radios, and 6.2 million automobiles. This represented three-quarters of the appliances purchased worldwide. Installment



 plans helped millions of Americans purchase these key consumer items. Consumer debt rose from $8.3 billion in 1946 to $56.1 billion in 1960, a trend that caught Life’s attention in 1955. To illustrate the newly affluent lifestyle of middle-class Americans, Life photographer Loomis Dean put a couple with their two children in front of their Los Angeles suburban home alongside all their furnishings and car. The first picture (25.3) showed “what they have”: an oven, refrigerator, two television sets, car, and furniture. The second photograph (25.4), “what they own,” put the family in front of the foundations of a house and automobile tires to reflect how far along they were in their mortgage and car payments. The refrigerator, couch, stove, and one television set—all bought on credit—were missing. By purchasing so heavily with credit, this family risked losing nearly everything if a recession hit, and the father lost his job. American leaders felt that their nation’s material abundance demonstrated the superiority of capitalist societies over communist ones, where basic consumer items were often in short supply. Others condemned American materialism. In his biting social commentary The Status Seekers, Vance Packard criticized Americans for jettisoning the frugality of the past in favor of status-seeking conspicuous consumption. Manufacturers helped create this

 new consumerist orientation. One executive conceded that it was the advertisers’ job to “see to it that Americans are never satisfied.” A middle-class family now considered their car or refrigerator “obsolete after two or three years even though it works well,” financial columnist Sylvia Porter noted.

The Move to the Suburbs
 Suburbs built in the 1920s ringed major cities and remained connected to the metropolitan core by streetcars or rail lines. In the 1950s, suburbs moved farther away from cities, becoming insular communities that depended increasingly on cars to transport people. The roads Eisenhower built to help evacuate urban areas if the nation came under nuclear attack (see Chapter 24) were now filled with suburbanites running errands and commuting to work. Of the 13 million new houses constructed between 1948 and 1958, 85 percent were built in suburban neighborhoods. By 1960, 37 million Americans lived in suburbs out of a total population of 189 million. When developer William Levitt erected thousands of mass-produced houses on the former potato fields of Long Island, in New York State, he pioneered building techniques that transformed the housing market. Applying Henry Ford’s automobile assembly line–style innovations to the housing industry, Levitt built “Levittowns,”—planned suburban communities where developers standardized every part of the construction process. Levitt claimed that his crews could assemble a house in 15 minutes, while it took only three minutes to complete the paperwork to purchase one. Levitt passed these savings onto home-buyers, dropping the prices of new houses from $14,000 to $8,000. When other developers copied his techniques nationwide, the low price of suburban houses, coupled with readily available government-backed financing, brought home ownership within reach of millions of Americans. These new suburban houses typically contained living-room picture windows that developers installed to make their 1,000-square-feet houses feel more spacious. When the curtains were open, these large windows also displayed a family’s possessions and prosperity to the neighborhood. Suburban houses had “living kitchens” where families both prepared and ate their meals and “family rooms” to accommodate the television, toys, and games that brought the family together at the end of the day. A garage sheltered the automobile that every suburban family needed.

 Why did suburbs boom in the 1950s?

 Americans offered competing visions on whether suburban living improved daily life or encouraged mindless conformity. Conflicting interpretations greeted images of idealized suburban life. “For literally nothing down” Americans could purchase a “box” in a suburban development “inhabited by people whose age, income, number of children, problems, habits, conversation, dress, possessions and perhaps even blood type are also precisely like [theirs],” wrote John Keats in The Crack in the Picture Window (1957). Abraham Levitt, the son of developer William Levitt, fought back against these charges: “Houses are for people, not critics . . . — and the people for whom we do it think it’s pretty good.” This debate is explored in Competing Visions: Suburbs—American Dream or Nightmare? The move to the suburbs converged with an explosion of childbearing among couples who had put off having children during the Depression and World War II and younger couples encouraged by boom times to start their families immediately. Between 1935 and 1955, the birth rate jumped nearly 40 percent. Levittown’s nickname, “Fertility Valley,” underscored this link between the suburbs and the baby boom generation. The baby boom generation shaped American society for decades. As babies and children they helped stimulate a huge industry devoted to diapers, baby formulas, and toys. Teenagers, a new term to describe adolescents, formed the backbone of 1950s popular culture and the antiwar movement and cultural upheavals of the 1960s. In the twenty-first century, as the baby boomers begin to retire, the imperative to care for a large aging population poses significant challenges for American society. The 1950s ushered in other key lifestyle changes besides suburban living and an emphasis on family life. As more Americans entered the middle class, they increasingly worked at white-collar jobs ranging from clerks to professionals to corporate executives. The effect of corporate culture on American society was as hotly debated as the impact of suburban life. In an era when McCarthyism eliminated radical discourse as a legitimate form of political expression, social critics worried that suburbs and corporations were bleaching individuality and innovation out of the national character. “When white-collar people get jobs, they sell not only their time and energy but their personalities as well,” sociologist C. Wright Mills contended. Others, including Fortune magazine, regularly defended corporations for extending job security and prosperity to millions.

Competing Visions
SUBURBS—AMERICAN DREAM OR NIGHTMARE?
As the suburbs grew social critics debated whether suburban life represented the epitome of the American dream or a nightmarish existence that isolated Americans from one another. To challenge historian Lewis Mumford’s assertion that the suburbs were cultural wastelands, sociologist Herbert J. Gans moved his family into a Levittown to study its residents. As you read the following excerpts from Mumford and Gans, consider how each links the suburbs to changing lifestyles. What positive and negative changes do these writers attribute to suburban life? What different futures do they envision for a suburban-based American culture? Lewis Mumford in The City in History (1961) contended that suburban life bred conformity, loneliness, and alienation. 
 Herbert J. Gans defended suburbanites in The Levittowners: Ways of Life and Politics in a New Suburban Community (1967).

 In the mass movement into suburban areas a new kind of community was produced … a multitude of uniform, unidentifiable houses, lined up inflexibly, at uniform distances, on uniform roads, in a treeless communal waste, inhabited by people of the same class, the same income, the same age group, witnessing the same television performances, eating the same tasteless pre-fabricated foods, from the same freezers, conforming in every outward and inward respect to a common mold … The town housewife, who half a century ago knew her butcher, her grocer, her dairyman, her various other local tradesmen, as individual persons, with histories and biographies that impinged on her own, in a daily exchange, now has the benefit of a single weekly expedition to an impersonal supermarket, where only by accident is she likely to encounter a neighbor.… The cost of this detachment in space from other men is out of all proportion to its supposed benefits. The end product is an encapsulated life, spent more and more either in a motor car or within the cabin of darkness before a television set.

 [Levittowners] are not apathetic conformists ripe for takeover by a totalitarian elite or corporate merchandiser; they are not conspicuous consumers and slaves to sudden whims of cultural and political fashion.… even though Levittowners and other lower middle class Americans continue to be home-centered, they are much more “in the world” than their parents and grandparents were. Those coming out of ethnic working class backgrounds have rejected the ... ethnocentrism which made other cultures and even other neighborhoods bitter enemies. This generation trusts its neighbors, participates with them in social and civic activities, and no longer sees government as inevitably corrupt. Even working class Levittowners have begun to give up the suspicion that isolated their ancestors from all but family and childhood friends. Similarly, the descendants of rural Protestant America have given up the xenophobia that turned previous generations against the Catholic and Jewish immigrant, they have almost forgotten the intolerant Puritanism which triggered attacks against pleasure and enjoyment, and they no longer fully accept the doctrine of laissez-faire that justifies the defense of all individual rights and privileges against others’ needs. These and other changes have come about not because people are now better or more tolerant human beings, but because they are affluent. For the Levittowners, life is not a fight for survival any more; they have been able to move into a community in which income and status are equitably enough distributed so that neighbors are no longer treated as enemies, even if they are still criticized for social and cultural defiance. By any yardstick one chooses, Levittowners treat their fellow residents more ethically and more democratically than did their parents and grandparents. They also live a “fuller” and “richer” life.… superior to what prevailed among the working and lower middle classes of past generations.”

Popular Culture in the Fifties
 Television transformed the home life of millions of Americans. So did the emergence of an autonomous youth culture, with its own slang, rock-and-roll music, and dress. Were these harmless expressions of adolescent rebellion or signs of the disintegration of American culture? These stirrings of generational conflict in the 1950s exploded a decade later into full-fledged revolt.

The Television Age Arrives
 The first commercial television transmission in the United States occurred in 1939 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the New York World’s Fair. The war slowed the introduction of televisions into the consumer market, but by the 1950s, the television age had arrived. In 1948, just 178,000 homes had televisions. Seven years later three-quarters of American households owned one. Eisenhower set the tone for the decade with the widely publicized image of the president and his wife, Mamie, eating dinner each night off traytables in front of a television in their private White House parlor. Whereas in the forties Americans had flocked to movie theaters for entertainment, now they stayed home. “Don’t be a Living Room Captive—Step Out and See a Great Movie,” film studios urged. Many Americans, however, appeared to agree with Eisenhower, who wrote in his diary, “If a citizen has to be bored to death it is cheaper and more comfortable to sit at home and look at television than it is to go outside and pay a dollar for a ticket.” Many movie theaters closed, and the studios made fewer films. Only drive-in theaters in suburban towns, where customers sat in their cars next to individual speakers to watch a movie on a giant outdoor screen, thrived. Drive-in theaters appealed to young parents who could pile their children into the car for a night out and teenagers who could escape the watchful eyes of adults for a few hours. What were Americans watching at home? Many early television shows dealt with the social conditions and cultural values of the day, paying particular attention to family and consumerism. In The Honeymooners, the working-class Kramdens lived in a sparsely furnished apartment and often clashed, particularly when one of the getrich-quick schemes devised by bus driver Ralph (played by comedian Jackie Gleason) started to unravel. His wife Alice always stood her ground, even when Ralph threatened her with one of

 the show’s trademark lines: “One of these days, Alice … one of these days … POW, right in the kisser.” By the end of each episode, the couple had reconciled, with Ralph often telling his wife, “Baby, you’re the greatest.” I Love Lucy began in a small Manhattan apartment, but eventually Lucy Ricardo (played by Lucille Ball) and her Cuban husband Ricky (Ball’s real-life husband Desi Arnaz) relocated to suburban Connecticut to raise their son. Lucy’s farcical adventures trying to enter show business or best her husband always ended with her realizing that being a caring wife and mother was fulfilling enough. Situation comedies like Father Knows Best and Leave It to Beaver focused on the roles that each member of an ideal white suburban family played: Father worked hard and came home in time to resolve the minor crises of the day; mother kept a spotless home, volunteered, and supported her husband’s career; and children learned to tell the truth, work hard, and obey their parents. Sitcoms in the 1950s provided plenty of escapist fare. Nightly news broadcasts, however, brought glimpses of the wider world into American homes and played an increasing role in politics. Politicians quickly learned to use the new medium to their advantage. Republican vice presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon was the first politician to give a televised speech to defuse a political scandal. During the 1952 presidential election, the press revealed that Nixon had a secret fund financed by California businessmen. Hoping to stem the damage, Nixon appeared on television to refute charges that the money was for his personal use or that these businessmen were buying “secret favors” from him with their donations. Laying out the details of his personal finances, Nixon defiantly told viewers that without campaign donations only the rich could run for office. In the speech’s most famous passage, Nixon mentioned one personal gift that he would not return: “A man down in Texas heard Pat [his wife] on the radio mention the fact

 that our two youngsters would like to have a dog” and surprised the family with the gift of a blackand-white cocker spaniel. “And our little girl Tricia, the six year old, named it ‘Checkers.’ And you know, the kids, like all kids, love the dog, and I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we’re gonna keep it.” After the speech, Nixon posed with his family and Checkers (25.5). The Checkers speech saved Nixon’s place on the Republican ticket alongside Eisenhower. Like Nixon, John F. Kennedy also astutely used posed photographs, like this one with his attractive young family (25.6). By creating such images Kennedy hoped to distract attention from his inherited wealth and Catholicism, long considered an undesirable religious affiliation for a national politician. On September 26, 1960, Kennedy and Nixon faced off in the first televised presidential election debate. Nearly 77 million Americans, or 60 percent of the adult population, watched this historic event. Nixon, still pale and underweight from a two-week stint in the hospital, squared off against a tan and fit Kennedy, who impressed viewers with his comfortable presence before the cameras. By contrast Nixon refused to wear make-up, looked as if he needed a shave, wore a poorly fitted shirt, and was visibly sweating throughout the exchange. Most Americans

 who watched the debate felt that Kennedy had won, while the majority who listened on the radio gave the edge to Nixon. Kennedy went on to narrowly win the election, revealing the power of images to sway political judgments.

Teen Culture and
 Rock-and-Roll Teenagers came into their own in the 1950s. Their parents remained haunted by memories of Depression-era deprivation and the life-and-death struggle of World War II. By contrast in the 1950s, many middle-class teenagers grew up with an abundance of material possessions. Most teenagers agreed with their parents when it came to politics, sharing their concern about communist expansion and the growing Soviet nuclear threat. Many, however, adopted an ethos of pleasure-seeking that often put them at odds with their parents who emphasized thrift and self-discipline. Unlike their parents’ generation teenagers were no longer expected to earn money to help support their families. Millions of young people experienced unprecedented leisure time and longer schooling, and were free to spend money earned from after-school jobs as they liked.

 Two candidates, one family portrait Throughout their political careers, Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy used portraits of their family life to connect with voters.

 How did politicians use television and photographs to shape their public image?



 CHAPTER 25

 Teenagers flocked to buy record players and radios to play music marketed specifically to them. In 1958, the Coasters scored a number-one record with their song, “Yakety Yak,” which depicts a teenager rebelling against household chores. In one refrain, the parent orders the teenager to “Take out the papers and the trash / Or you don’t get no spendin’ cash,” to which the teenager replies “yakety yak,” with the parent then retorting: “don’t talk back.”

 “Teenagers are my life and triumph. I’d be nowhere without them.” ELVIS PRESLEY, whose stardom demonstrated the strength of teen culture in the 1950s Teens’ freedom to create their own social world filled with slang and fads that adults did not understand disturbed critics. By the end of the decade, sociologist Edgar Friedenberg noted that “the ‘teenager’ seems to have replaced the Communist as the appropriate target for public controversy and foreboding.” In this cultural clash traditionalists lambasted horror comic books and teen films for encouraging teenagers to revolt against their parents and social norms. But rock-and-roll music and musicians provoked the most outrage. Rock-and-roll burst onto the national scene when Bill Haley and his Comets recorded “Rock Around the Clock” in 1955, the first rock-and-roll tune. The following year Chuck Berry thundered “Roll over, Beethoven, and tell Tchaikovsky the news!” proclaiming rock-and-roll the music of choice for this teenage generation. It took Elvis Presley, however, to make rock-and-roll (which got its name from a rhythm and blues slang term for sexual intercourse) a phenomenon. Exposed to the raw sexuality and powerful rhythms of African American rhythm and blues music as a boy in Mississippi, Presley also sang gospel and country music in church. Melding the sounds and explosive delivery of these musical traditions with catchy pop lyrics, he developed his own eroticized dancing style. “If I could find a white man who had the black sound and the black feel, I could make a billion dollars,” predicted record producer Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Records, a small recording company in Memphis, Tennessee. Philips found his man when Presley walked into Sun Records to record a song as a gift for his mother.

 How did larger economic and technological changes make a mass teen culture possible?

 Americans embraced competing visions over whether the growing popularity of rock-and-roll meant the triumph of consumer tastes or the downfall of American civilization. Nicknamed “Elvis the Pelvis” for his suggestive hip thrusts while dancing, partially captured in this photograph (25.7), Presley became a lightening rod for critics who denounced rock-and-roll from the pulpit, in the press, and even in congressional hearings. When teenager Ron Kovic’s family watched Presley on TV’s Ed Sullivan Show, his sister went “crazy in the living room jumping up and down,” his mother sat “on the couch with her hands folded in her lap like she was praying” and his dad shouted from the other room that “watching Elvis Presley could lead to sin.” In introducing Presley the affable Sullivan assured parents that the 22-year-old Presley was “a real decent, fine boy.” To avoid controversy, however, Sullivan ordered camera crews to frame out Presley’s legendary pelvic thrusts and gyrations, showing only his head and chest. It took the draft to tame Elvis. “Presley wiggled off to military service,” one newspaper columnist wrote, “but comes marching home … shorn of his sideburns and behaving the way a sedate, seriousminded youngster should.” The new “clean-cut” Presley kept his original fan base but had limited appeal to the teenage generation coming of age in 1960. Ed Sullivan showcased a range of music, skits, and comedy acts to keep the whole family watching together during the hour-long show. Dick Clark, however, helped pioneer television programming exclusively for teenagers with his daily afternoon show American Bandstand, which featured Philadelphia high-school students dancing to the latest hits. The advent of pocketsize transistor radios meant that teenagers could listen to radio stations broadcasting the top 40 best-selling records or independent rhythm and blues stations in the privacy of their bedrooms, away from critical adult ears. Hollywood also catered to teenage tastes with films like The Wild One (1953), which featured Marlon Brando as part of a rebellious motorcycle gang, and Rebel Without a Cause (1955). In the latter film James Dean and Natalie Wood played teenagers from uppermiddle-class suburban homes; unsure how to handle their racing hormones, the two become defiant. Dean’s character tries to prove his masculinity by drag racing, while Wood’s character uses promiscuity to rebel against an overprotective father. This view of the suburbs as hotbeds of intergenerational conflict and alienated youth frightened adults but thrilled teenagers. Embracing the persona of an angry youth discontented with mainstream society, Dean (who died at age 24 in a car accident) became an icon of teenage rebellion in the 1950s.

POPULAR CULTURE IN THE FIFTIES

 Parental norms often prevailed. Teenagers in the 1950s grew up quickly. Students who dated a lot in high school tended to marry soon after graduation. Once married, they quickly started families, conforming to the standards set by their parents.

The Beats
 Teens in the 1950s used their purchases—of music, clothes, fan magazines—to define their generational

 identity, while their parents announced their new middle-class status by buying cars and suburban houses. Beats or beatniks, members of the bohemian communities of poets, novelists, and artists that flourished in New York’s Greenwich Village and San Francisco’s North Beach, offered an alternative vision. The Beats rejected home ownership, career, and marriage in favor of individual freedom and immediate pleasure (including drugs and casual sex). The national spotlight briefly shined on City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco when it published the controversial poem Howl (1955) by thenstruggling Beat poet Allen Ginsberg. “I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,” began the opening stanza. The poem sent readers on a journey into the underground lives of the drug addicts, musicians, artists, radicals, and homosexuals, who lived on the margins of mainstream society. In the 1950s, most states had so-called antisodomy laws that criminalized samesex intercourse. Ginsberg’s open celebration of gay sex in Howl offended anti-obscenity crusaders in San Francisco. The police arrested the owner of the City Lights Bookstore for selling the poem, but a judge dismissed the charge, arguing that it was a socially significant artistic work. In his novel On the Road (1955), the Beat writer Jack Kerouac celebrated the spiritual quest for a meaningful life away from the suffocating materialism and conformity of middle-class society. Guilty at times of over-romanticizing working-class life for its “authenticity” without appreciating the deadening effects of poverty, the Beats nonetheless laid the foundation for the youth protests of the sixties (see Chapter 27).

25.8 Autumn Rhythm 1950.
 Hans Namuth photographed Jackson Pollock in action as he dripped and swirled paint to evoke the sensations of a fall day: light and dark, heavy and buoyant, graceful and chaotic. Pollock painted spontaneously, but also deliberately. “I can control the flow of paint: there is no accident,” he stated.

 Most Americans never read Howl or On the Road. They instead formed their impressions of the Beats from watching The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, a TV series that showcased a beatnik best friend, who urged Dobie to reject his father’s single-minded drive to make money and instead enjoy life to the fullest. This televised depiction of Beat culture helped interject new expressions, such as “dig it,” “cool,” and “man” that the Beats took from African American culture, into the vocabulary of white teenagers. Beat poets and novelists were not the only artists rebelling against received traditions in the 1950s. American modern artists formulated a new mode of visual art called Abstract Expressionism that broke with the predominant painting styles of the previous generation. Before World War II leading artists included the Cubist painter Pablo Picasso, who reordered the physical world in his paintings, and American social realist painters, who captured the lives of ordinary people during the Depression. Politics informed much artistic work in the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1950s a restless generation of new artists chose instead to emphasize personal expression over How does Pollock’s painting compare to social realist paintings in the 1930s (see Chapter 22)?

 politics. “The big moment came when it was decided to paint…. Just TO PAINT. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation, from Value—political, aesthetic, moral,” wrote art critic Harold Rosenberg in 1952. Jackson Pollock dripped paint on the canvas to create paintings bursting with energy (25.8). German photographer Hans Namuth captured Pollock’s rhythmic dance as he obscured painted figures with splats of paint. Mark Rothko painted fields of color to reflect feelings rather than objects, and refused to title or explain his paintings, so that viewers could interpret his work freely. Each created signature styles that epitomized the rebellious nature of Abstract Expression. Young artists idolized these painters for refusing to represent reality or use their art to send a message. More tradition-bound artists denounced their work as trivial. Like James Dean in films and Elvis Presley in music, the painters Pollock and Rothko embodied the rebellious streak of fifties youth culture.

FREEDOM NOW: THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT



Freedom Now:
The Civil Rights Movement
 The Civil Rights Movement entered a pivotal phase in the 1950s. Key Supreme Court rulings, new leadership, and innovative strategies emboldened thousands of black and white people to demand the end of racial segregation in the South. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) successfully challenged the constitutionality of segregated public schools. Martin Luther King Jr. emerged as a major leader, alongside a generation of activist black and white college students who employed new nonviolent strategies to compel white Americans to confront the harsh realities of Jim Crow. Supreme Court decisions pressured the federal government to intervene on behalf of African Americans. Meanwhile television and news magazines transmitted shocking images of racial violence that made it impossible for the nation to ignore the demands of civil rights activists.

Separate and Unequal:
Challenging Segregated
Schools
 Black and white southern children, as this photo of a street scene in a small Southern town suggests (25.9), grew up in separate worlds. They lived in different parts of town, went to segregated schools, drank from separate water fountains, ate in different restaurants, waited for buses in different waiting rooms, sat in separate sections of movie theatres, and often shopped in different stores. For many black children segregation meant daily humiliation and unanswered questions. “I guess if you are from a small Georgia town, as I am,” one black college student recalled, “you can say that your first encounter with prejudice was the day you were born…. My parents never got to see their infant twins alive because the only incubator in the hospital was on the ‘white’ side.” After World War II ethnic and racial minorities successfully challenged the legality of segregated schools. In 1947, the Supreme Court ruled that educating children of Mexican ancestry in separate California schools was illegal, because state law only authorized segregated schools for children of Asian decent. After this ruling, California repealed this discriminatory law. Ending legalized racial segregation nationwide came next. In 1954, the Supreme Court overturned the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson “separate but equal” ruling that had allowed the South to maintain

 inferior accommodations and schools for black citizens. The Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregated schools indeed violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Brown case concerned sevenyear-old Linda Brown, whose parents wanted to send her to an all-white school closer to their home. In mounting the case NAACP lawyer Thurgood Marshall (who later became the first African American appointed to the Supreme Court), and his team based their argument on more than the law. To convince the public and the Court that segregation was wrong, they needed to dramatize its effects. “To show damage and a violation of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, you had to show that being segregated actually damaged children,” psychologist Kenneth Clark asserted. To demonstrate the irreversible effects of segregation on African American children, the NAACP cited Clark’s controversial research. In a series of studies, Clark asked white and black children whether they liked a white or black doll best. Most children picked a white doll because it was “nice” and rejected the black doll as “bad.” Clark next asked the children to identify the doll that was the most like them. The black children now had to pick the doll that many of them had just rejected as “bad.” In the North black children often burst into tears rather than respond. In the South, however, reactions like the one from a young boy in Arkansas, who laughed, “pointed to the brown doll, and said, ‘That’s a nigger. I’m a nigger,’” convinced Clark that segregation taught African American children to accept their inferiority to whites. Not everyone agreed with Clark’s methodology, so the NAACP relied heavily on his findings in preliminary court challenges and then mentioned them only briefly in their Supreme Court filing. The wording of the Brown decision, however, revealed that the NAACP had guessed right in emphasizing the impact of segregation on the self-esteem of black children. In reaching its unanimous decision, the Court noted that “to separate [black children] from others of

 Till was just another 14-year-old posing for the camera with his mother. Their portrait reveals a boy with a beaming smile and a mother’s pride in her growing son (25.10). That summer Mamie Till-Bradley sent Emmett from his home in Chicago to visit relatives in Mississippi. To prepare her Northern-raised son for the racial customs of Southern society, she warned him to think of his safety when encountering Southern whites. One morning at a country store in Money, Mississippi, Emmett forgot his mother’s warning. While playing with black teens on the porch of the store, Till bragged that he had a white girlfriend in Chicago. “Hey, there’s a [white] girl in that store there,” one of the boys retorted, “I bet you won’t go in there and talk to her.” Responding to the dare, Till walked into the store, bought candy, then grabbed the arm of Carol Byrant, who ran the store with her husband, and allegedly asked, “How about a date, baby?” Till’s aghast cousin ran in and pulled him out of the store. Three days later a car pulled up to his granduncle’s house in the middle of the night. Two white men burst into the house and dragged Till out of bed. The husband of the young woman in the store, Roy Bryant, and her brother, J. W. Milam, threw a terrified Till into their truck and drove away. This was the last time his relatives saw him alive. The white men drove to an abandoned shed on a nearby plantation where they beat Till, then drove to the Tallahatchie River and forced him to strip before they shot him in the head and tossed his body into the river. With his mother’s permission, Jet magazine and the Chicago Defender, stalwarts of the black press, published the grisly photos of the corpse.

 CHAPTER 25

IN A LAND OF PLENTY: CONTENTMENT AND DISCORD, 1945–1960

 What made Emmett Till’s murder different from previous racist killings of African Americans in the South was the courageous decision of his family to fight back. Ignoring the kidnappers’ warnings to keep quiet (so Till would become yet another black boy who went mysteriously “missing”), Till’s cousin called the sheriff and Till’s mother the next day. The sheriff found Till’s body and three days later arrested Roy Bryant and J. W. Milam. When Mamie Till-Bradley saw her son’s tortured body, a sight that would have caused many mothers to fall apart, she instead vowed that “here’s a job that I got to do now.” Till’s granduncle, Moses Wright, had begged the white men to just whip him, while his wife offered them money to leave the boy alone. Now Moses Wright decided to testify against the pair when they went on trial for murder. The 64-year-old Wright later recalled that as he entered the courtroom, he could “feel the blood boil in hundreds of white people as they sat glaring.” When the prosecutor asked him to identify Milam as one of the men who took Emmett, Wright stood up, pointed his finger, and said, “Thar he.” His testimony emboldened other black sharecroppers to step forward and testify about hearing Till crying for his mother as he was beaten. Fearing for their lives, all of these sharecroppers left town after appearing in court. At first it seemed they had risked everything for naught. The all-white male jury took less than an hour to find the men not guilty. They would have returned the verdict sooner, the jury foreman bragged, “If we hadn’t stopped to drink pop.” A second jury acquitted the men on the charge of kidnapping. Two months after their murder trial, Bryant and Milam sold their story to an Alabama journalist for $4,000 and admitted killing Till. Double jeopardy, a legal concept that prevents authorities from retrying someone for the same crime, protected the pair from prosecution after their confession. Nonetheless, the sight of ordinary black citizens standing up in court to accuse their white oppressors electrified a generation ready to strike back. Four months later, partly because of the Emmett Till case, the Montgomery Bus Boycott began.

 justice through the courts. Many resolved to use economic boycotts, picketing, and mass demonstrations to force white America to take note of the injustice and violence experienced daily by African Americans. Courageous men and women, ordinary people who took extraordinary risks, set this new direction in civil rights protest. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a 43-yearold black seamstress, boarded a bus in downtown Montgomery, Alabama, and selected a seat. She was one of 40,000 blacks who paid a dime twice a day to the white driver, then stepped down and entered the bus through the rear door. When a white man demanded her seat, Parks had to decide whether to comply. Choices and Consequences: Rosa Parks Makes History explores her decision to stay seated. As soon as English professor Jo Anne Robinson heard of the arrest, she mimeographed 35,000 handbills urging black citizens to stage a one-day bus boycott on the day of Parks’ trial. Robinson was president of the Montgomery Women’s Political Council, which had been planning a one-day bus boycott for months. Parks’s arrest offered a perfect moment to act. Two of her students helped Robinson distribute the handbills to black schools, businesses, and churches. “Negroes have rights, too, for if Negroes did not ride the buses, they could not operate,” the handbill read. When the day-long boycott succeeded, community leaders decided to continue it indefinitely. The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955–1956) was a year-long boycott that brought a new leader, Martin Luther King Jr., and a new strategy of nonviolent protest to the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement. The boycotters’ initial demands were moderate: courteous treatment from bus drivers, first-come-first-served seating so no one would have to give up a seat, and hiring black bus drivers. The city administrators and bus company executives refused. The Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) now prepared for a lengthy boycott. Mass meetings twice a week kept boycotters’ spirits high and helped disseminate accurate information within a black community that had no radio station or newspaper. The MIA also set up an elaborate carpool system to transport black workers to their jobs and back home. Volunteers picked up passengers from one of 42 collection points throughout the city, which became the target of terrorist bombings. Images of black workers waiting peacefully for carpools contrasted with the burnt remains of bombed cars and provided good

Choices and Consequences
ROSA PARKS MAKES HISTORY
Unlike the signs above water fountains or posted in waiting rooms, there was no clear section marked “colored” on Montgomery city buses. Instead as more white passengers boarded a bus, black passengers had to vacate their seats for them. When three other black passengers heeded the white driver’s request to move on the afternoon of December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks faced a set of choices over how to respond. 
Choices




 Move to the back of the bus.



 Refuse to give up her seat.



 Vacate her seat but express her outrage by participating in a planned one-day bus boycott.

Decision
 Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. When the driver threatened to call the police, Parks quietly replied, “You may do that.” She was arrested.

Consequences
 On the day of Parks’s trial (she was found guilty and fined), the Montgomery Women’s Political Council organized a one-day boycott that it had been planning for months and nearly all Montgomery’s black citizens stayed off the buses. That evening the city’s black male clergy met and formed the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), which voted to continue the boycott. The group chose 26-year old Martin Luther King Jr., the minister who headed the Baptist church that Rosa Parks attended, as their president. When the Supreme Court ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional in 1956, the year-long boycott ended.

Continuing Controversies
 Who was the real Rosa Parks? The folklore is that Parks was simply a tired seamstress who impulsively decided to stay seated. This narrative leaves out key details. Parks was also secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP and had attended the left-leaning Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, where civil rights and labor leaders trained. She knew that the NAACP wanted to test the bus segregation law in the courts and had recently participated in a mass meeting

 protesting Emmett Till’s murder. Boycott leaders played down Parks’s activist past, worried that it would diminish her “everywoman” appeal and that moderates might view her as a radical agitator. Some activists later suggested that this simplified tale sent the wrong message about how to initiate social change. Rosa Parks’s bravery mattered, they agreed, but so did careful preparation, organization-building, and ideological dedication.

 What is the enduring legacy of Rosa Parks’s decision?

 footage for the national television networks that covered the boycott extensively. Television interviews with King, a 26-year-old Baptist minister who headed the MIA, turned him into a celebrity overnight and allowed him to appeal directly to moderates throughout the nation. To raise money and garner publicity for the boycott, King also toured the country giving speeches.

“If Martin Luther King had
 never been born this movement would have taken place. I just happened to be there.” MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., commenting on his role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott.

 Instead of discouraging the protesters, white resistance convinced the MIA to broaden its demands to include the complete desegregation of the buses. The violence now threatened to spiral out of control. When King’s house was bombed, a crowd of supporters arrived carrying knives and guns. “If you have weapons, take them home,” King told them as news cameras rolled. Publicizing the new civil rights ethos of nonviolence, King declared, “‘He who lives by the sword will perish by the sword.’ … We must meet hate with love.” Over time white opposition fractured. Some whites had been openly sympathetic to the boycott from the beginning, even though their businesses and social life suffered as a result. Others had more pragmatic reasons for helping black workers reach their jobs. When the mayor chastised white women for chauffeuring their black maids to and from work, one defiant white woman wrote to the newspaper: “If the mayor wants to do my wash and wants to cook for me and clean up after my children let him come and do it.” After nearly a year the boycott was victorious. In November 1956, the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. On December 21, 1956, Martin Luther King Jr. boarded the first integrated bus in Montgomery with the African American minister Ralph Abernathy and the white Reverend Glenn Smiley, both key leaders in the boycott. In their carefully choreographed ride, pictured here (25.11), all three followed the guidelines that the MIA had established for integrating

 buses. An MIA pamphlet advised: “For the first few days try to get on the bus with a friend in whose non-violence you have confidence. You can uphold one another by a glance or a prayer.” The MIA cautioned black riders not to respond to curses or shoves. When King entered the bus, the presence of newspaper reporters and cameramen protected him from violence. “We are glad to have you here this morning,” the bus driver cordially greeted King as he climbed aboard. The ride was not so smooth for other Montgomery citizens. Over the next few weeks snipers fired into buses, and Abernathy’s house was bombed. Two months later King met with ministers from 11 other Southern states to form the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Black churches, they decided, could help the Civil Rights Movement devise a new nonviolent strategy of direct action that challenged segregation and discrimination throughout the South. At first King saw nonviolence mainly as a way to gain sympathy and prevent authorities from using violence against demonstrators. He employed a bodyguard throughout the boycott and had applied for a permit to carry a gun (which the police refused). “King sees the inconsistency, but not enough. He believes and yet he does not believe … if he can really be won over to a faith in non-violence there is no end to what he can do,” Smiley noted privately. Over the next few years, King would develop that faith. His social justice fundamentalism evolved from his reading of Jesus’s biblical “Sermon on the Mount” that urged Christians to create “a beloved community” by winning over enemies with love and humility rather than seeking to punish or defeat them. King was also influenced by activists like Reverend James Lawson who had traveled to India to study the Hinduism version of nonviolence pioneered by the Indian activist Mahatma Gandhi in the 1930s to win independence from Britain. Lawson was in India during the Montgomery Bus Boycott but returned to instruct members of the SCLC and university students as they broadened their attack on Jim Crow in the early 1960s.

 habits. Throughout the South diehard segregationists dug in. “The Negro race, as a race, plainly is not equal to the white race, as a race,” asserted James Jackson Kilpatrick, the editor of a Richmond newspaper. Segregationists also advanced a states’ right argument, arguing that the federal government had no right to dictate racial policies to the South. Sympathetic to claims that it would be difficult to change ingrained habits overnight, the Supreme Court issued only a vague directive for school systems to desegregate “with all deliberate speed” in 1955. This ruling encouraged entrenched segregationists to try to delay integration indefinitely. In a few Southern cities, moderate whites accepted the piecemeal dismantlement of Jim Crow. Little Rock, Arkansas, for instance, had desegregated its parks, buses, and libraries with little controversy. After the Brown decision, the school board made plans to integrate slowly by inviting nine black

 teenagers to attend high school alongside 2,000 white students. Nicknamed the Little Rock Nine, the nine teenagers who integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957 became the focus of a national crisis that required the intervention of federal troops to resolve. Segregationists quickly organized statewide opposition to the planned integration of Central High School. Concern about states’ rights and segregationists’ claims that integration would lead to white and black students dancing together at school social functions won over some moderates. Two weeks before the school year started, the threats began. One night a rock shattered the living room window of Daisy Bates, secretary of the local NAACP chapter. The note tied around the rock read “Stone this time. Dynamite next.” Influenced by polls showing 85 percent of white Arkansans opposed school integration, Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus, who faced a difficult

 reelection campaign, declared he would not “force acceptance of change to which the people are so overwhelmingly opposed.” In September 1957, he decided to ring Central High with state troops on the first day of school to stop the black students from entering the high school. Using state troops to defy a federal mandate fit well with the desire of moderate whites and die-hard segregationists to protect the sanctity of states’ rights. To protect the black teenagers, Daisy Bates asked parents to drop the students off at her house so they could go to school together. Elizabeth Eckford, whose family did not have a telephone, never received the message. Instead she took a bus to the school by herself and confronted the angry mob alone. At first she felt reassured when she saw the troops, whom she assumed were there to protect her. She quickly realized her error. When she tried to squeeze past a guard, “He raised his bayonet, and then the other guards moved in.” As she stood there confused, the crowd started to chant “Lynch her! Lynch her!” Television cameras, tempering the crowd’s enthusiasm for a lynching, likely saved Elizabeth’s life. Also a godsend, Grace Lorch, a white woman, came out of the crowd to help Elizabeth flag down a city bus and escape. Over the next few days, as the crowds in front of the high school grew, attacks against news photographers and cameramen became more common. The television footage coming out of Little Rock, reporter David Halberstam noted, “made it hard for people watching at home not to take sides” as they saw “orderly black children behaving with great dignity” being assaulted by a “vicious mob of poor whites.” Outrage outside of the South over such images put pressure on President Eisenhower to act, as did the negative worldwide attention that the Little Rock incident garnered. “Our [Communist] enemies are gloating over this incident and using it everywhere to misrepresent our whole nation,” Eisenhower warned the country. Resistance to Supreme Court–mandated integration created more than a racial crisis. It also led to a showdown between the federal government and the state of Arkansas. Under pressure from the White House, Faubus withdrew state troops. It was the president’s responsibility to enforce federal law, Eisenhower told the American people, announcing his decision to send federal troops to Little Rock to ensure that Arkansas obeyed the Supreme Court’s ruling. With paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division ringing the school, the Little Rock Nine walked up the front steps surrounded by armed guards.

 Why did Eisenhower send troops to integrate Central High School in Little Rock?

 This was the first time that the federal government had used troops to protect the civil rights of African Americans since Reconstruction. The troops, Melba Pattillo Beals recalled, meant a “declaration of war” in the hallways of Central High where white teenagers insulted, kicked, shoved, and ostracized the Little Rock Nine, who were each sent to different classrooms. Eight of the nine finished the year. (Minnijean Brown was expelled for dumping chili on a white student’s head after he insulted her in the cafeteria.) The following year Faubus defied the order to integrate by keeping the schools closed all year. In 1959, Central High reopened with one black student in attendance; in 1960, there were five; then eight in 1961. The small numbers of black students in Central High signified the long, slow road to complete the process of school integration.

The Sit-Ins
 A 1950 survey of segregation statutes across the nation (see Envisioning Evidence: A National Snapshot of Racial Discrimination) revealed a staggering array of state laws that prevented races from mixing in their daily lives. By the end of the 1950s, with the nonviolent Civil Rights Movement in full bloom, the movement’s attention shifted from schools to segregated lunch counters. In 1958, James Lawson began conducting SCLC workshops to prepare college students in Nashville for a sit-in campaign to desegregate the city’s lunch counters. At these meetings students studied Christian pacifist principles, Gandhi’s theories of nonviolence, and the nineteenth-century American philosopher Henry David Thoreau’s ideas on civil disobedience. During sit-ins protesters occupied seats at whites-only lunch counters and remained there even after they were refused service, sometimes for hours. The sit-ins employed the tactic of civil disobedience, breaking the law in a peaceful way to call attention to an unjust law, and replicated a tactic used successfully by the CIO in the 1930s when workers had occupied factories during strikes (see Chapter 22). Sit-ins, like sit-down strikes, disrupted business, making it impossible for white businessmen to ignore the protesters’ demands. Highly visible sit-ins in downtown Nashville department stores were also guaranteed to attract press attention. Lawson warned the students that their anger over Jim Crow was not enough to sustain them through the challenges ahead. Instead they needed to embrace nonviolence as the governing principle of their lives. They were fighting back, he assured them, but in a way that broke the cycle of violence.

A NATIONAL SNAPSHOT OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
Calling civil rights a “national problem,” the 1947 Presidential Commission on Civil Rights urged the federal government to act immediately to stop racial violence and eliminate discriminatory laws. This 1950 survey of state laws (which did not include local ordinances or regional customs) provided a broad overview of how segregation functioned in 33 states. Prohibition against mixed marriage was the most common law; more unusual ones included Oklahoma’s requirement for separate phone booths and North Carolina’s prohibition against white and black students sharing textbooks. Examples of other segregation laws are listed below. 
 White and black prisoners could not be shackled together on chain gangs in Alabama.

 Delaware mandated segregated schools for white, black, and Indian children.

 Florida mandated separate waiting rooms and railroad cars, except for sheriffs transporting prisoners or servants accompanying children or invalids.

 Mississippi segregated hospitals, and required black nurses for black patients.

 CHAPTER 25

IN A LAND OF PLENTY: CONTENTMENT AND DISCORD, 1945–1960

 “Do show yourself friendly on the counter at all times. Do sit straight and always face the counter. Don’t strike back, or curse if attacked. Don’t laugh out. Don’t hold conversations. Don’t block entrances.… Remember the teachings of Jesus, Gandhi, Thoreau, and Martin Luther King, Jr.” Instructions to sit-in demonstrators in Nashville, Tennessee, 1960

 Armed resistance was not only morally wrong, Lawson argued, it was also futile to believe that blacks could take on the police and army with guns. Students learned how to ignore the taunts and blows that whites would heap on them during a sit-in, to go limp when pulled from the seats, and to curl into a protective fetal position if attacked with blows. Lawson’s Nashville workshops identified and trained students who would become major leaders in the Civil Rights Movement, including John Lewis, Diane Nash, and Jim Bevel. Black civil rights protesters had intermittently organized sit-ins since 1942, but it was the spontaneous decision in 1960 of four freshmen from the all-black North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College to request service at a Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, that ignited the national sit-in movement. By acting on impulse these four teenagers ignored SCLC rules, which emphasized careful planning before any civil rights protest. The evening television news broadcast images of their defiance throughout the nation, demonstrating that ordinary people could make a difference. Over the following weeks churches and students worked together to unleash waves of sit-ins throughout the South. In Nashville Lawson’s group unfurled the longest and most sustained series of sit-ins. After a month of letting roving gangs of thugs punch and kick the students, the Nashville police tried to end the sit-ins by arresting the demonstrators for “disorderly conduct.” The students responded with a “jailno bail” strategy. “Only so many can fit into a cell; if you remain here, there can be no more arrests! Imprisonment is an expense to the state; it must feed and take care of you. Bails and fines are an expense to the movement, which it can ill afford,” SCLC organizer Bayard Rustin told the students. With the jails full and the sit-ins continuing, the SCLC increased the pressure with a successful boycott of the downtown stores.

 What principles lay at the heart of nonviolent direct action?

 The standoff came to a head when the home of a prominent black lawyer (who had represented the students in court) was bombed. Marching to city hall the students demonstrated the power of nonviolence to change minds. Diane Nash asked: “Mayor West, do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color?” Answering as “a man had to answer, not a politician,” Mayor Ben West, a moderate on racial issues, agreed it was wrong. Three weeks later the lunch counters in Nashville were desegregated. Energized by their success the Nashville, group staged “stand-ins” in the city’s segregated movie theaters and “sleep-ins” in the lobbies of whites-only hotels. Throughout the upper South photographs of the sit-ins provoked a similar awakening among moderate whites. The contrast between “the colored students, in coats, white shirts, ties” quietly requesting service at a lunch counter and the ragtag gangs of “white boys come to heckle” was hard to ignore, noted the Richmond News Leader when sit-ins hit the capital of Virginia. Resistance to sit-ins in the Deep South proved more formidable and vicious. In 1963, Tougaloo College student Anne Moody sat at a Woolworth’s lunch counter with two white activists in Jackson, Mississippi. As this photo shows (25.12), a lunchtime crowd of high school students assaulted the three and poured condiments on their heads. The older man in the picture urged the mob to get the demonstrators off the stools and pour salt on their wounds. The crowd’s heated anger convinced Moody that “many more will die before it is over with.” By spring 1960, Jim Lawson and SCLC organizer Ella Baker saw that students had emerged as a powerful force within the Civil Rights Movement. The two leaders urged university students to form their own civil rights organization. Students, they realized, were willing to take more risks than were many adult activists. Employing the lyrics of a

FREEDOM NOW: THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

 movement song that urged protesters to “keep your eyes on the prize,” Baker told the students that their goal needed to be “bigger than a hamburger.” The students responded by forming their own civil rights organization, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC (pronounced Snick) in 1960. SNCC founder Diane Nash noted that “the media and history seem to record it as Martin Luther King’s movement, but young people should realize that it was people just like them, their age, that formulated goals and strategies, and actually developed the movement.” In the struggles ahead SNCC and SCLC often forged a crucial partnership between black churches and university students. Idealistic and enthusiastic college students, white and black, eagerly put themselves in the frontlines during civil rights demonstrations. Black churches provided the experienced organizers, meeting spaces, and funds to organize successful protests.

 Read the Document SNCC Statement of Purpose (1960)

 The Civil Rights Movement brought together many critical features of the 1950s. While print media remained important, film footage shown on evening television news broadcasts of confrontations between racist whites and nonviolent protesters forced the rest of the nation to confront the realities of Jim Crow and racial violence in the South. Thanks to television what happened in the South no longer remained news only in the South. The rise of a distinctly teenage culture within the baby boom generation also helped to create a strong generational bond among those young adults who joined the movement. Finally the ideological overtones of the Cold War that pitted democratic capitalism against communism helped civil rights protesters focus attention on the inherent contradictions between America’s self-proclaimed goal of spreading democracy throughout the world and visible racial discrimination at home.

A
Nation Divided The Vietnam War, 1945–1975
 Vietnam was America’s longest war to date, a conflict that divided the nation to an extent not seen since the Civil War. For 30 years the United States invested money and then eventually soldiers in the struggle to prevent the establishment of communism in the small Southeast Asian country of Vietnam. From 1945 to 1964, the United States fought a proxy war by funneling supplies and aid to others willing to fight the Vietnamese Communists. In 1965, the conflict became an American war when President Lyndon Johnson sent U.S. ground forces to fight in Southeast Asia. By 1967, the antiwar movement had taken to the streets to protest America’s involvement in Vietnam. On October 21,1967, antiwar protesters held a peace rally before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., after which thirty thousand demonstrators linked arms and marched to the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Department of Defense. When they arrived, soldiers advanced toward the crowd with their guns drawn. An 18-year-old actor from New York with a flair for the dramatic stepped forward holding a bouquet of pink carnations and carefully placed one into each soldier’s rifle. Washington Star news photographer Bernie Boston captured this poetic gesture in “Flower Power,” an iconic photo of the civil strife that the war triggered. Competing interpretations of this image revealed key divisions of the era. For peace advocates the photograph illustrated the stark contrast between government-sponsored violence in Vietnam and American citizens’ demand for peace. Critics of the peace movement, who accused activists of destroying respect for law and order, viewed the gesture as a ploy to distract the soldiers moments before demonstrators stormed the steps of the Pentagon and armed guards beat them back. The Vietnam War originated as an anticolonial struggle to win independence from France, and then evolved into a civil war between North and South Vietnam. At first the crucial debates about Vietnam took place behind closed doors in the White House. Over the course of the country’s 30-year engagement in Vietnam, despite being presented continuously with other viewpoints, five American presidents from Truman to Nixon chose escalation when faced with the option of pulling back or pressing forward. Viewing the Vietnamese conflict through the prism of the global Cold War, each president feared that losing all of Vietnam to communism would set off a chain reaction of communist revolutions throughout Southeast Asia. World War II had united the nation. Vietnam fractured it. The guerilla war under way in South Vietnam, in which Communist soldiers intermingled with the civilian population to avoid detection, made it particularly difficult for Americans to separate enemy combatants from civilians. When the American military tried using overwhelming force to flush Communist guerillas out of South Vietnamese villages, the civilian death toll turned many Americans against the war. The conflict ultimately tore apart both Vietnam and America before the United States finally withdrew in 1973. The war ended with a Communist victory in 1975.

 CHAPTER 26

A NATION DIVIDED: THE VIETNAM WAR, 1945–1975

The Long Road to War
 From 1945 to 1965, America gradually shifted its Cold War focus from Europe to Asia. The United States first supported French efforts to recover Vietnam as a colony, and then sustained an independent anti-communist South Vietnam with financial aid. At home some American policymakers envisioned the war as part of the worldwide struggle between democracy and communism. In Vietnam, however, Americans confronted a country torn apart by a civil war that reflected its long-standing religious and political divisions. No American president sought a war in Vietnam, and key advisors offered competing assessments of America’s chances for victory. Yet at critical moments when the intractable political and military situation called for a response, each president chose to bolster the American commitment rather than turn back.

The Escalating Importance
 of Vietnam America first became involved in Vietnam during World War II, when Japan took over the French colony of Indochina (present-day Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam). In 1945, U.S. intelligence operatives worked with Ho Chi Minh, the leader of an underground Vietnamese communist resistance movement that launched guerilla attacks against the Japanese occupiers. When the war ended Ho Chi Minh and his rebel force formed a provisional government in Hanoi and declared independence from France. Eager to reestablish its position as a world power after the humiliating occupation by Germany in World War II, France sent in troops to crush the Vietnamese independence movement. In search of international support for Vietnamese independence, the Western-educated Ho Chi Minh turned to the United States. Ho Chi Minh had previously tried to interest the United States in Vietnamese independence by submitting a petition to the American delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 after World War I that called for democratic reforms in French Indochina. The American delegation ignored his request, mindful that his proposal would anger the French, whose support President Woodrow Wilson needed to create the League of Nations (see Chapter 20). After the rebuff in Paris, Ho Chi Minh became a communist, attracted by communism’s revolutionary promise to free colonized peoples. “It was patriotism, not communism, that inspired me,” he later claimed. In 1941, after nearly three decades abroad working as a Soviet spy, Ho

 Who was Ho Chi Minh to his supporters and foes?

 Chi Minh returned to Vietnam to help organize communist resistance to the Japanese occupation. Despite this revolutionary background he hoped that the United States would support Vietnamese independence when Japan withdrew in 1945. His communist credentials, however, tainted him in the eyes of President Harry S. Truman, who remained unmoved by Ho Chi Minh’s truthful assurances that the Soviet Union did not control or finance him. In the 1940s, the Americans saw Ho Chi Minh as a communist puppet doing Moscow’s bidding. His Vietnamese followers, however, viewed him as a charismatic leader ignited with a patriotic desire to free his nation from French colonial control. As one disciple recalled, the 55-year-old “Uncle Ho” spoke with an “ardent and idealistic nationalism” that encouraged many Vietnamese to join the Vietminh, the term used initially to describe all Vietnamese communists, and after 1954 solely for North Vietnamese communists. This photograph (26.1) of Ho Chi Minh sitting with children reinforced his reputation in Vietnam as a beloved, wise elder. The image tapped into prevailing Confucian ideals, including filial piety (respect toward living and dead relatives), loyalty, and humane treatment of others. Ho Chi Minh broadened his appeal by eschewing personal luxuries and living simply in a small cottage. By the time American troops arrived in the late 1960s, an ailing Ho Chi Minh played almost no official role in the conflict. He nonetheless remained the face of Vietnamese communism for supporters and opponents throughout the war. Cold War geopolitics consistently influenced how Americans reacted to the Vietnamese Communist revolt. As the emerging Cold War with the

THE LONG ROAD TO WAR

 Soviet Union in the 1940s made containing communism in Europe a national obsession, Vietnam took on new political significance. The United States needed help from a vigorous and cooperative France to defend Western Europe from Soviet incursion. To rebuild the French economy and establish goodwill, the United States gave France arms and funds beginning in 1947 (see Chapter 24). The French government used some of this aid to finance the war in Vietnam. The United States also agreed to support French efforts to regain control of its Vietnamese colony. In 1950, the strategic importance of Vietnam for the United States changed dramatically. The fall of China to communism in 1949 and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 when Communist-led North Korea invaded the anti-communist South Korea created fears that all of Asia might fall to communism. The “who lost China” debate hurt Truman politically, and no subsequent president wanted to be the one



 blamed for Vietnam falling to communism. Containing communism in both Europe and Asia became cornerstones of American foreign policy from this point on, requiring the United States to maintain military bases throughout Western Europe and along a string of Pacific islands from Japan to the Philippines. As the Cold War spread to Asia, key presidential advisors saw the hand of the Soviet Union behind every communist victory. By the early 1950s, National Security Council Report 68, or NSC-68, a document that described a global communist monolith, set the tone for U.S. foreign policy (see Chapter 24). Any more territory “under the domination of the Kremlin,” the National Security Council warned, would make the Soviet Union invincible in a future military conflict. The threat would deepen if the Soviets gained control of resource-rich Southeast Asia, whose rubber, rice, tin, and oil were important economically to the United States. These resources were even more vital for Japan, now a key American ally in the struggle against communism, and the United States wanted to ensure Japanese access to these materials by preventing them from falling into unfriendly communist hands. Hardliners in the Truman and Eisenhower administrations embraced the domino theory, the fear that a communist Vietnam would open the door to a complete communist takeover of Southeast Asia, with communists repeating Japan’s conquest of the region in World War II. Announcing the domino theory President Dwight D. Eisenhower explained in a 1954 press conference: “You have a row of dominos set up, you knock over the first one, and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly. So you could have a beginning of a disintegration that would have the most profound influences.” Events in the 1950s gave credence to these fears. Josef Stalin’s success in pressuring China and North Korea to accept an armistice to end the Korean War strengthened the American conviction that the Soviet Union could start or stop 26.1 Ho Chi Minh Poses with Children, 1954 Ho Chi Minh’s followers revered him as a wise elder who loved his nation.

 communist insurgencies around the globe. This political cartoon (26.2) by Marcus Edwin showed Stalin pressing the stop button for Korea, and suggested that he could also stop the conflict in Indochina (Vietnam) if he wished. Indeed, Stalin had encouraged the Chinese leader Mao Zedong to take charge of promoting communist revolution throughout Asia. The immediate influx of Communist Chinese advisors to train Vietminh officers, plus mountains of Chinese-manufactured vehicles, arms, and ammunition, seemingly confirmed that the Vietminh were part of an international communist conspiracy masterminded in Moscow. American policymakers failed to appreciate, however, that a shared belief in communism did not override the nationalistic ambitions of the Soviet Union, China, or Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh accepted help from the Chinese, but remembering China’s ancient colonization of Vietnam; he remained suspicious of their ulterior motives and had no intention of turning Vietnam over to them. “It is better to sniff French dung for a while than eat China’s all our life,” warned Ho Chi Minh. In an American worldview that saw every communist revolution as part of the Soviet Union’s master plan, the specific grievances or goals of the Vietminh became irrelevant.

 What key choices did Eisenhower make in 1954 that increased U.S. involvement in Vietnam?

 To hold the line in Vietnam, the American government was willing to foot the bill but wanted the French to do the actual fighting. The United States upheld its end of the bargain. By 1954, the United States was paying for 80 percent of the war’s costs, money used to both purchase arms and fund humanitarian projects including free health clinics, food for refugees, and seeds for farmers. Increasingly, however, the United States doubted, in the words of Truman’s outgoing secretary of state Dean Acheson, the “French will to carry on.” As Acheson anticipated, the incoming Eisenhower administration soon faced a crisis in Vietnam. In 1954, the Vietminh defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu, in the northwest corner of the country, prompting the French to seek an international agreement with the Vietminh. The resulting Geneva Accords (1954) called for a temporary partition of Vietnam along the seventeenth parallel, with the Vietminh in the north and the French in the south, and a general election in two years to reunify the country under one government. Refusing to sign the Geneva Accords, the Eisenhower administration instead resolved to use the two-year period to ease the French out of South Vietnam and create a new government capable of raising and training a strong military to resist communist aggression. To head the new South Vietnamese government, the United States selected Ngo Dinh Diem, a wealthy Catholic who had served as minister of the interior in the French colonial administration before resigning, when the French refused to enact reforms he proposed. A staunch nationalist, Diem moved to the United States, where he became well known to American policymakers. Neither Diem nor the United States intended to let the scheduled election take place, certain that Ho Chi Minh’s authoritarian government would use force and fraud to ensure victory in the North and perhaps in the South as well. Instead the United States tried to destabilize Ho Chi Minh’s fledgling Communist government by creating political turmoil in North Vietnam. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operatives destroyed government printing presses, contaminated the oil used in bus engines, sabotaged railway tracks, and planted rumors of Chinese troops raping North Vietnamese women. Eisenhower supported the creation of an anticommunist South Vietnam to stem the tide of communism in Southeast Asia. As an additional defense

THE LONG ROAD TO WAR

 against communism, the United States formed the Southeast Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO) in 1954. Through SEATO the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Pakistan and the Philippines (granted independence by the United States in 1946) pledged to “meet common danger” in Southeast Asia together. A separate agreement identified Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia as areas that would endanger the “peace and security” of SEATO members, if any of these three nations came under attack. Unlike the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which guaranteed the mutual defense of member nations in Europe, the SEATO treaty left each nation’s exact commitment vague. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles wanted it that way, reluctant to overextend American military responsibilities around the world by guaranteeing the borders of SEATO members. Even if this loosely worded pact failed to deter communist aggression, Dulles reasoned, it would provide a justification for direct American involvement in Vietnam to protect SEATO members, if the United States decided to escalate its involvement in the future. An important development in America’s ever-increasing involvement in Vietnam, SEATO illustrated how completely the United States linked the civil war in Vietnam to the global crusade against communism. With the United States poised to embark on a major campaign to create an independent South Vietnam, dissenting voices within the government urged the president to pull back. Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson warned that he could “see nothing but grief in store for us if we remained.” The Joint Chiefs of Staff complained it would be impossible to build a capable South Vietnamese army without a “reasonably strong, stable civil government in control.” This “chicken and egg” argument over which needed to come first, a strong South Vietnamese government or a strong military, divided American policymakers for the next 15 years. With Diem the United States got neither. A short, stocky man who always dressed in white, Diem’s stiff and privileged appearance contrasted poorly with the plain dress and manners of Ho Chi Minh. The Eisenhower administration recognized Diem’s shortcomings, but Secretary of State Dulles accepted the American ambassador’s conclusion “that there is no one to take his place who would serve U.S. interests better.” The United States quickly realized that Diem intended to build a dictatorial regime in South Vietnam.



 Diem modeled his rule on nineteenth-century Vietnamese emperors, issuing decrees and refusing to abide criticism. “I know what is best for my people,” he declared in one interview. The secret police, headed by Diem’s brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, arrested, tortured, and executed thousands of South Vietnamese accused of opposing his rule. Most Vietminh had relocated to North Vietnam when the country split into two, but remnants of the communist guerilla force still existed in the south. They found ample discontent with Diem among peasants, students, Buddhists, and even South Vietnamese soldiers. To destabilize the Diem regime, the Communists unleashed a wave of assassinations targeting wealthy landlords and rural officials who worked for the regime. Diem tried to cut off guerilla fighters from their supply base. He moved peasants off their ancestral lands and into “strategic hamlets” protected by moats and walls and imprisoned thousands of civilians suspected of aiding the rebels. Enraged over the forced removals, the peasants were like a “mound of straw ready to be ignited,” claimed one Vietnamese Communist. The U.S. government and press revealed none of Diem’s internal difficulties to the American people. When Diem visited the United States in 1957, the American press praised him as the “tough little miracle man” who had brought stability to South Vietnam. “We can take pride in our support,” Newsweek trumpeted. In the mid-1950s, Ho Chi Minh offered southern Communists little support. He was instead preoccupied with subduing the widespread protests that greeted his forced land redistribution in North Vietnam, a campaign that sent armed posses into the countryside to confiscate land. These “land reforms” left thousands of property owners dead, destroyed communities, and created famine. By 1960, however, the North Vietnamese government was sending soldiers and supplies to southern Communists, unleashing a terror campaign to pave the way for a Communist takeover of South Vietnam. In 1960, the southern Communists formed the National Liberation Front (NLF) to unite the factions in South Vietnamese society opposed to the Diem regime into a fighting coalition. Diem derogatorily called South Vietnamese Communists Vietcong, slang meaning “Vietnamese Commies.” The name stuck. From this point on Americans called all Communists from South Vietnam “Vietcong” and Communists from North Vietnam “Vietminh.”

 Why did the civil war in Vietnam reignite in the late 1950s and early 1960s?



 CHAPTER 26

A NATION DIVIDED: THE VIETNAM WAR, 1945–1975

 Debates within the Kennedy Administration John F. Kennedy became president in 1961 having proclaimed Vietnam the “cornerstone of the free world in Southeast Asia.” Kennedy understood the negative political consequences of “losing” a nation to communism. As a congressman he had joined the chorus criticizing Truman when China succumbed to communism. In 1961, Kennedy suffered two setbacks of his own in the global war against communism with the botched Cuban Bay of Pigs invasion and his inability to stop the Soviets from constructing the Berlin Wall (see Chapter 24). His leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, however, redeemed his reputation as a Cold War warrior. Kennedy did not intend to let the conflict in Vietnam bring his administration down. Faced with a worsening political and military situation in Vietnam, Kennedy received conflicting recommendations from his advisors. One group envisioned escalating the American commitment by sending in combat troops. Another wanted to seek a diplomatic resolution to the conflict. Faced with these divided opinions, Kennedy chose a middle path. Instead of infantry troops he sent more financial aid and increased the number of American military “advisors” in South Vietnam from one thousand to sixteen thousand. Officially these advisors helped train the South Vietnamese Army. In actuality many “advisors” were Green Berets, the army’s special-force troops who organized South Vietnamese attacks on Vietcong supply lines, flew planes when South Vietnamese pilots were unavailable, and picked up casualties in helicopters after skirmishes. When word of these activities leaked out, Kennedy publicly denied that Americans were participating in active combat operations in Vietnam. “Supporting the Diem regime while applying pressure for reform appears to be the only practicable alternative at this time,” the Joint Chiefs convinced Kennedy, cautioning that “any reversal of U.S. policy could have disastrous effects” throughout Southeast Asia. As South Vietnamese anger against his rule intensified, Diem privately voiced his own mounting frustration with the growing American presence in South Vietnam. “All these soldiers,” he fumed, referring to the Green Berets and military advisors. “I never asked them to come here.” To rid South Vietnam of Americans, Diem and his police chief brother Nhu decided to seek a negotiated settlement with North Vietnam in 1963. Upset with Diem’s overture to North Vietnam,

 What conflicting recommendations did Kennedy receive from his advisors about Vietnam?

 the turning point for the Kennedy administration came in June, when a Buddhist monk set himself on fire in a busy street in Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam. The Catholic Diem had long discriminated against Buddhists. Thousands of North Vietnamese Catholics fled to the south when the Communists took over in 1954, and Diem rewarded them with land and governmental positions. In May 1963, Nhu refused to let the Buddhists fly a multicolored flag honoring Buddha on his birthday. Widespread street protests ensued, which Nhu suppressed with soldiers who used water hoses, tear gas, and on one occasion bullets, killing a woman and eight children. On June 10, 1963, a Buddhist monk invited Associated Press photographer Malcolm Browne to witness “something important” the next morning. Browne arrived at the designated street crossing and watched monks take a canister of gasoline out of the white car shown in this picture (26.3) and place a brown mat in the middle of the street. Moments later a Buddhist monk, Thich Quang Duc, sat down on the mat in the lotus position. After another monk poured gasoline over him, Duc struck a match. Flames instantaneously engulfed his body. “His eyes were closed, but his features were twisted in apparent pain,” Browne recalled. As Browne snapped this memorable photo, a monk shouted into a microphone in Vietnamese and English: “A Buddhist priest burns himself to death. A Buddhist priest becomes a martyr.” Monks (seen in the background) lined the streets to prevent anyone from trying to save Duc. Immediately proclaimed a Buddhist saint, Duc’s ashes were distributed to pagodas, towering Buddhist temples, throughout South Vietnam. Duc carefully staged his suicide to gain maximum exposure for the Buddhists’ political protest, using the Western press to help rally opposition to Diem within South Vietnam and the United States. The burning monk image shocked but also bewildered Americans. The American government and press had continually praised Diem as a valiant Cold War ally, but this photo suggested strong opposition to his rule at home. Students, Buddhist priests, and soldiers in South Vietnam responded to the suicide as a call to action. Street protests erupted, the military began planning a coup, and six other monks set themselves on fire in front of Western journalists. With a framed copy of Browne’s burning monk image on his desk, Kennedy secretly agreed to support a military coup to overthrow the Diem regime.

 only one direction. Counterclaims that the assassination was the result of a wider conspiracy involving other gunmen, the mafia, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, and the CIA continue to this day. Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) was riding two cars behind Kennedy in the Dallas motorcade. When Kennedy died within hours of the shooting, Johnson, who was next in line to assume the presidency, insisted on taking the oath of office before Judge Sarah Hughes with Jackie Kennedy on one side and his wife on the other before the presidential airplane Air Force One left Dallas. The presence of the slain president’s widow would, Johnson felt, immediately legitimatize the transfer of power in the eyes of the American people. Already on board the plane, which was carrying her husband’s body back to Washington, D.C., Jackie Kennedy complied with Johnson’s request, but had no chance to change her clothes. In this portrait (26.4) of Johnson’s swearing in, photographer Cecil Stoughton carefully framed out Jackie Kennedy’s skirt, which was stained with her husband’s blood. Her pale and drawn expression nonetheless reflected the day’s ordeal.

Johnson relied heavily on his superior political instincts and outgoing personality to rise to prominence. In the Senate, he became the most powerful majority leader in history. A larger-thanlife figure, his brashness contrasted sharply with the slain president’s debonair manner. Johnson’s most legendary gaff came in 1965, when he lifted his shirt during a press conference to show reporters his 12-inch scar from recent gallbladder surgery. Johnson wanted to reassure the nation about his recovery, but critics lampooned the act as crude and undignified.

The Gulf of Tonkin
 Lyndon Baines Johnson inherited a rapidly deteriorating situation in Vietnam after the Diem assassination. Like his predecessors he faced the choice of pulling back or escalating the American commitment, which at this point consisted of sixteen thousand military advisors and Green Berets and substantial financial aid to South Vietnam. After the Diem assassination, South Vietnam slipped into perpetual political instability as a succession of rulers failed to gain the support of the people. The shifting geopolitical situation also prompted a reappraisal of the American assumption that the Soviet Union was controlling the movements of communists throughout the world. The previous American conception of a global communist conspiracy became harder to maintain in the face of the open split between the Soviet Union and China in 1964. The Sino-Soviet alliance fell apart, when the Soviets suggested that the two countries scale back their support of worldwide Communist insurgencies to improve relations with the United States. Mao refused. Once again elected officials and policymakers differed behind closed doors on the best course of action. National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy told Johnson that “the right course is to continue to strengthen our struggle against the Communist terror (which is exactly what this is).” Senator Richard Russell, a close confidant of the president, disagreed with those who claimed that “we’ll lose everything in Southeast Asia if we lose Vietnam.” Johnson himself feared that

 CHAPTER 26

A NATION DIVIDED: THE VIETNAM WAR, 1945–1975

Choices and Consequences
MAKING VIETNAM AMERICA’S WAR
In early 1965, Johnson initiated a regular bombing campaign against North Vietnam and sent 82,000 ground troops to South Vietnam. The theater commander General William Westmoreland soon requested 150,000 more. In deciding how to respond to Westmoreland’s request, the president’s advisors gave Johnson the following choices in the summer of 1965. 
Choices




 Avoid a protracted war with little chance for a military or political victory over the Communists and seek a negotiated settlement in Vietnam.



 Continue at the present level of military aid to South Vietnam and push for political reforms there to create a more democratic antiCommunist government.



 Send the requested troops, expand the bombing campaign, and work for political reforms in South Vietnam.

Decision
 Johnson considered a negotiated settlement as tantamount to losing Vietnam to communism, an outcome he viewed as a threat to both Southeast Asia and his presidency. Certain that South Vietnam would lose the war without additional U.S. aid, he publicly agreed to send fifty thousand troops immediately. He privately guaranteed Westmoreland an additional fifty

 thousand and promised to send more as needed. He also approved heavy bombing of Vietcong strongholds in South Vietnam and tried to institute political reforms in South Vietnam to erode support for the Vietcong.

Consequences
 The United States was no longer simply aiding South Vietnam in its struggle against communism, but now took the lead in fighting the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese. By 1967, there were nearly 500,000 American troops in Vietnam. During the war the United States dropped more bombs there than it had in World War II. Johnson’s Dilemma. He is shown here with Defense Secretary, Robert McNamara.

Continuing Controversies
 Should the United States have fought a major war in Vietnam? Detractors claim that Johnson committed the United States to an unwinnable war by trying to use the military to solve a political problem in South Vietnam. He underestimated the will of the Vietcong and exaggerated the importance of South Vietnam to containing communism in the rest of Southeast Asia. He failed to build strong domestic support for a long war, leading to unrest at home over the draft

 and rising casualties. Johnson’s supporters argue that he honored a commitment to South Vietnam made by his predecessors. This reassured American allies worldwide that they could count on the United States. Retreat would only have invited further Communist aggression in Southeast Asia and Europe. Losing Vietnam would have weakened Johnson politically, putting his controversial domestic reform and civil rights legislative agenda in jeopardy.

FIGHTING IN VIETNAM



Fighting in Vietnam
 David Halberstam, reporting for The New York Times in 1962, summed up the military dilemma in Vietnam perfectly: “It is often impossible to separate the cruel and dedicated foe you want to kill from the simple and illiterate peasant you want to woo.” America and North Vietnam embraced competing strategic visions in fighting the war. While the American military preferred fighting against uniformed soldiers on a clearly defined battlefield, the Communists embraced guerilla warfare, where troops blended into the civilian population or stayed hidden in underground tunnels. The American military tried to defeat Vietnamese guerillas by bombing enemy bases and destroying their village refuges. These tactics created another set of competing visions about the war: the soldiers’ view of an unending conflict versus the image of imminent victory that the government championed at home.

The Bombing Campaign
 The American military relied heavily on bombing to defeat the Vietcong and North Vietnamese. The American bombing campaign was the largest air war in world history, with American planes dropping nearly five million tons of bombs in eight years. The Americans hoped to pressure North Vietnam into ending the war. The North Vietnamese instead learned to live with bombs. The sighting of American planes over the North Vietnamese capital city of Hanoi sent inhabitants scurrying into bombproof underground shelters. The government built thirty thousand miles of tunnels, which moved the nation’s transportation and communication infrastructure underground. The sustained bombing campaign bred anti-American feelings among the civilian population that made it easier for the North Vietnamese government to mobilize the country to “foil the war of aggression of the U.S. imperialists.” Navy Captain James Stockdale led the first American air strike against North Vietnamese oil tanks in the wake of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. A year later during another air raid, he was shot down over a small coastal village in North Vietnam where angry villagers beat him and broke his knee. Stockdale spent the next seven and a half years in a prisoner of war (POW) camp. His jailers brutally tortured him when he taught fellow POWs a walltapping code so they could communicate with one another during their years in solitary confinement. American planes also targeted the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a 600-mile North Vietnamese supply route that ran along the western border of Vietnam through the mountainous rain forest of neighboring Laos and Cambodia. Nearly five thousand Communist soldiers and workers completed the

 arduous three-month journey each month, bringing troops, munitions, and food to the Vietcong. North Vietnamese propaganda glorified the difficult journey with images that emphasized the toughness and determination of its people. This photo (26.6) shows a North Vietnamese camera crew filming teenage volunteers from the north as they push bicycles, which the North Vietnamese called “steel horses,” through the woods to carry rice and guns to Communist troops in the south. Improvements turned the dirt paths into an open road by the 1970s. Surface-to-air missiles and antiaircraft guns helped protect trucks from bombing.

 26.6 Hardships along the Ho Chi Minh Trail North Vietnamese propaganda relentlessly publicized the arduous journey along the Ho Chi Minh Trail to highlight how Communist ingenuity had stymied the world’s greatest military power. Here, a Communist movie crew films teenage volunteers transporting bags of rice and guns strapped to their bicycle handlebars in 1970.

 Americans also extensively bombed South Vietnamese “free fire zones,” villages that supposedly contained only enemy combatants. The American air campaign included spraying defoliants, usually Agent Orange, that stripped trees of their leaves to expose Vietcong hideouts and killed the crops that might feed enemy troops. “Only you can prevent forests,” American pilots quipped, a satirical

 reworking of a popular environmental slogan “only you can prevent forest fires.” Defoliants ultimately destroyed half of Vietnam’s forests and caused lasting health problems for both American pilots and the Vietnamese that included cancers and birth defects. Responding to negative publicity, the military stopped using defoliants in 1971. American pilots also dropped napalm, a jellylike gasoline that ignited on impact, to destroy South Vietnamese villages hiding enemy troops. Napalm severely burns the body, contributing to the misery of civilians subject to bombing attacks. Reports of mounting civilian suffering energized the U.S. peace movement, a loose coalition of antiwar activists that included pacifists, students, professors, clergy, hippies (young people who rejected middle-class values and adopted a bohemian lifestyle), civil rights activists, and middleclass liberals. In making his decision to go to war, Johnson had focused on placating his hawkish critics without considering the political fallout of antagonizing the left. By 1967, however, belatedly realizing the price he was paying for waging the war, the president noted, “The major threat we have [politically] is from the doves.”

 War II, Phil Caputo viewed joining the Marines as a way to escape suburbia and serve his country. “I saw myself charging up some distant beachhead, like John Wayne in Sands of Iwo Jima,” noted Caputo, recalling a popular 1949 film that romanticized the battle responsible for the iconic World War II photo of six men raising the flag over Mount Suribachi (see Images as History, Chapter 23). Combat, however, quickly shattered the idealism of men like Caputo. In 1965, Life photojournalist Larry Burrows spent a month with helicopter crews, documenting their heroism and the harrowing combat. In this photo (26.7) gunner James Farley fires on enemy troops below as the pilot lands to rescue a downed American helicopter crew. Subsequent photos captured the anguish on Farley’s face when he realized that the rescued pilot had died. The drafted men sent to Vietnam in later years had fewer illusions than the initial volunteers. Conscripts were often working-class men who did not qualify for draft deferments, which only collegebound and married men enjoyed. Volunteers and conscripts served one-year tours in Vietnam, and as the time to return home neared, they often became more averse to taking risks in combat. Some soldiers even used their helmets as calendars, openly marking off the days left until their tour of duty ended. In World War II American soldiers had fought against a clearly distinguishable enemy in the Pacific island jungles. Vietcong forces, however, infiltrated

 unintentionally created incentives for soldiers to lie. “You guys want a day off, we got to be getting more kills,” one commander told his men. In compiling their body counts, troops made little effort to separate friend from foe. The credo, “If it’s dead and it’s Vietnamese, it’s Vietcong,” lumped enemy soldiers with innocent civilians. Eventually the inaccuracy of body counts became common knowledge. Gary Trudeau mocked the preoccupation with body counts in this Doonesbury comic strip (26.9). His rendition of an American captain using the day’s

 had killed more enemy soldiers than the Communists could replace in the field. To boost morale at home, Westmoreland publicly assured the nation that “we have reached an important point where the end begins to come into view.” Johnson was also upbeat. “The enemy is not beaten,” he told the nation before Christmas, “but he knows that he has met his master in the field.” A Vietnamese offensive in 1968 exposed the hollowness of these claims. On January 30, 1968, during the Vietnamese New Year holiday known as Tet,

 North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces launched the Tet Offensive, a massive, coordinated assault against more than 100 cities and towns in South Vietnam. The map of Vietnam (26.10) depicts the wideranging attacks. “Uncle Ho was already quite old,” and the entire army and population were exerted to do “their best to liberate the South before his passing” a North Vietnamese officer recalled. By demonstrating their determination to fight forever, the North Vietnamese wanted to convince Johnson that the cost of an American victory was too high. The Communists also expected their attack on previously calm cities to spark a revolution within South Vietnam. Before the Tet Offensive the Communists had lured nearly fifty thousand American troops away from the cities by laying siege to a remote Marine garrison in Khe Sanh and attacking a few isolated towns. The weakened American presence left the urban centers vulnerable to enemy attack. A shocked American public watched on television as 19 Vietcong commandos entered the courtyard of the American Embassy complex in Saigon and battled guards there for six hours. It took heavy fighting and more than a month before American troops regained control of South

The Tet Offensive
 In 1967, Americans’ support for the war began to flounder. Nearly nineteen thousand American soldiers had died so far, and each month draft boards inducted another thirty thousand into the military. Johnson’s call for new taxes to meet rising war expenses further dismayed Americans. Some leading policymakers also changed their minds. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara underwent the greatest shift in views. He went from strenuously advocating war (some critics called it “McNamara’s war”) to conceding that “Ho Chi Minh is a tough old S.O.B. And he won’t quit no matter how much bombing we do.” Rather than making his breach with the president over Vietnam public, however, McNamara quietly left the administration. In the same year General Westmoreland assured Johnson that the war of attrition had reached a crossover point, meaning that American soldiers

Images as History
THE POWER OF THE PRESS IN VIETNAM
Photographers typically convey a point of view through their photos. However, the differing interpretations surrounding some of the most famous photographs from the Vietnam War suggest that each photo took on a life of its own as Americans disregarded the photographer’s original reason for taking the photo and imposed a different meaning on the image that reflected their own political views. Rather than creating new ideas or values, these images became iconic visual statements 
 about the war because they reinforced strongly held beliefs within the population. In examining the text and photos in this box, consider what kind of power the press had to mold public opinion about the war. In the midst of the 1968 Tet Offensive, Associated Press photographer Eddie Adams saw South Vietnamese police apprehend a Vietcong suspect in the streets of Saigon. Adams snapped his prize-winning photo just as South Vietnamese General Nguyen Ngoc Loan aimed his pistol at the man’s head and pulled the trigger.

 Instead of justifiable retribution many Americans saw an execution. Prisoners of war have the right to a trial under international law, critics argued.

 “He killed many of my men and many of your people,” Loan told Adams. The New York Times caption echoed Loan’s justification for his act. “GUERILLA DIES: Brig. Gen. Nguyen Ngoc Loan, national police chief, executes man identified as a Vietcong terrorist in Saigon. Man wore civilian dress and had a pistol.”

 This striking image of one man’s death became a symbol of the failed U.S. effort to establish the rule of law in South Vietnam, prompting fears that American soldiers were also killing prisoners of war.

 Adams regretted taking a photo that forever tarnished Loan’s reputation, whom he felt had simply acted impetuously in the heat of combat. “Pictures do not always tell the full story, and this is one case where that is true,” Adams contended.

 In 1966, Life photographer Larry Burrows went into the field with a group of marines trying to stop North Vietnamese infiltration through the demilitarized zone along the seventeenth parallel, a supposedly combat-free strip of land that separated North and South Vietnam.



 He snapped this image of a wounded black soldier reaching out to a white buddy sprawled on the ground. Life published the photo twice, once right after Burrows took it and again in 1971 to eulogize Burrows after he died a helicopter crash in Laos.

 In their letters to Life, many readers said that Burrows’s portrait illustrated how the shared burden of combat inspired men to transcend the “great racial problems” of American society. Burrows’s photo gave some viewers hope that whether “purple, polka-dotted or streaked,” Americans could also learn to live together as brothers at home.

 In his captioning Burrows emphasized soldiers’ suffering in the midst of combat, simply noting, “At a first-aid center, during Operation Prairie, a wounded GI reaches out towards a stricken comrade.”

 The interracial compassion captured by Burrows’s photo told only one side of the story. Racial conflict permeated the armed forces in the rear and on ships, suggesting that fighting together did not magically heal the racial divide.

 The wounded soldier lies in a crucifix position, establishing a symbolic link between Christ who suffered on the cross to redeem humankind and a soldier sacrificing his life to save his nation.

 How does this image compare to combat photographs from World War II and the Korean War (see Chapters 23 and 24)?



 CHAPTER 26

A NATION DIVIDED: THE VIETNAM WAR, 1945–1975

Controversy on the Home Front
 Advocates for peace have opposed every American war, but their dissent rarely influenced the mainstream political debate. During the Vietnam War these rebellious voices offering an alternative vision of peace moved from the fringes to the center of American political life. Growing in strength as more Americans began to oppose the war, the peace movement made itself visible through mass demonstrations, propaganda posters, and press coverage of celebrities who joined it. The very existence of a vocal peace movement in the midst of a war, however, also invited controversy because Americans held differing views on the legitimacy of wartime dissent. Many peace activists believed they were preserving the American tradition of freedom of speech. Public opinion polls from 1965 to 1973, however, consistently showed that most Americans disliked both the war and the peace movement.

The Antiwar Movement
 In announcing his decision not to run for reelection in 1968, Johnson noted that “there is division in the American house right now.” In the 1960s the rise of a youth-based counterculture and a powerful civil rights movement roiled the country (see Chapter 27). The night of his announcement, however, Johnson was referring to the domestic debate over the war in Vietnam. Although many working- and middle-class people opposed the war, overcoming existing cultural and class divisions in American society to create a unified antiwar movement proved difficult. The organized antiwar movement tended to attract mostly white, middle-class, college-educated Americans or individuals already engaged in crusades of social justice. Many working-class women and African Americans with grade-school educations and lowpaying jobs, opposed the war, but had little interest in marching alongside middle-class college students in street demonstrations.

 “Hey, hey LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?” A popular chant during antiwar demonstrations Uniting around one universal vision also posed difficulties for the antiwar movement. All peace activists wanted to end the war in Vietnam, but they offered different arguments for doing so. Some made a primarily moral argument. They claimed that a war involving napalm, search-and-destroy What differing visions did peace activists offer on the war?

 missions, and forced relocation into strategic hamlets hurt the Vietnamese more than living under Communist rule did. Others focused on the futility of fighting an unwinnable civil war. Another group accepted that the nation needed to stop Communist China from expanding its influence. They argued that working with Ho Chi Minh could accomplish this goal more effectively than fighting a war in Vietnam. These critics noted that while Ho accepted Chinese aid to fight the United States, he was leery of Chinese ambitions to control Vietnam. America had worked successfully in Europe with the independently minded communist leader Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia to contain Soviet ambitions in the Balkans. Why could it not do the same in Vietnam? Other activists saw a chance to open the nation’s eyes to injustice at home, as well as overseas. Student leaders from the nation’s top universities founded the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) at Port Huron, Michigan, in 1962. A leader in the New Left movement, SDS combined staunch opposition to the war with a scathing critique of the inequities of capitalism (see Chapter 27). Although their reasons for opposing the war differed, peace advocates agreed that the war was destroying American democracy. They noted violations of American democratic values: going to war without a formal declaration of war from Congress, presidential secrets and lies, FBI surveillance of peace protesters, and unjust draft deferments for middle- and upper-class men who could afford to go to college. When civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. spoke out against the war in 1967, he denounced both the destruction of Vietnamese culture and the war’s negative impact on African Americans. The war’s high cost diverted funds from antipoverty programs at home, King rightly View the Image “Vietnam—I want out”

CONTROVERSY ON THE HOME FRONT

 contended. The disproportionately high numbers of African American men fighting and dying in Vietnam further illustrated ongoing racial injustice within the United States, he continued. (King’s criticism was valid in 1967, but over the entire war, black soldiers did not incur higher casualty rates than the rest of the population.) One antiwar poster (26.11) captured this link between racial inequality and the war by picturing two African American soldiers as they advanced into the jungle under the headline, “The only time we’re in the front is when it’s time to die.” The rebuke against King for these statements was swift and severe, including criticism from civil rights activists who worried that his antiwar views would discredit their cause. King died a year later from an assassin’s bullet, cutting short his career as a civil rights leader and antiwar activist. The peace movement brought the debate over the war out of the halls of government and into the streets. In 1965, University of Michigan faculty and students organized the first teach-in, a series of public lectures and debates protesting the war. Over the next eight years, scholars and students on hundreds of other college campuses held teach-ins. Some teach-ins invited counterprotests. At the conclusion of a teach-in at the University of Wisconsin, for example, six thousand students signed a petition supporting President Johnson. Like other Americans, college students held differing views about the war. The draft made the war more than an abstract humanitarian or foreign policy question for millions of American men. Male college students would lose their draft deferments once they graduated, giving many personal, as well as political and moral, reasons to oppose the war. Peace activists organized ceremonies where men burned the notices from their draft boards ordering them to report for induction. When 1,500 peace activists gathered in New York City in 1965 to watch five men burn their draft cards, an onlooker bolted from the crowd with a fire extinguisher and doused the protesters before the cards caught fire. The activists nonetheless managed to ignite their soggy draft cards while hundreds of New Yorkers stood on the other side of police barricades and chanted “Burn yourselves, not your cards!” a macabre reminder, perhaps unintentional, of the Buddhist suicides in Vietnam in 1963. Johnson tried to discredit the peace movement by claiming it was communist-run and gave solace to the enemy. Other defenders of the war charged the peace movement with treason. However, some war supporters believed that the general unpopularity of the peace movement helped bolster the resolve

 of Americans in the political center to stay the course. The presumption that Senator Robert Kennedy, brother of the slain president, would seek the Democratic nomination as a peace candidate had encouraged Johnson to abandon a quest for a second term. On June 4, 1968, Sirhan Sirhan, a Jordanian immigrant upset with Kennedy’s pro-Israel stance, shot and killed the senator as he walked through the kitchen of a California hotel moments after finishing his victory speech for winning the state primary. At the Chicago nominating convention, the Democratic Party selected Vice President Hubert Humphrey as its presidential candidate, a man much like Johnson who supported liberal causes at home and the war in Vietnam. Instead of uniting liberal and conservative Democrats, Humphrey’s candidacy fractured the party. Outside the convention hall radical antiwar protesters denounced his nomination and clashed violently with police. “The war is destroying our

 country as we are destroying Vietnam,” the writer I. F. Stone lamented. The outcome of the 1968 presidential election suggested that the peace movement had helped the conservative cause. Believing that the protesters, rather than the police, had gone too far in Chicago, many working- and middle-class Americans responded positively to Republican candidate Richard Nixon’s call for a return to “law and order.” During the campaign Nixon suggested that he had a “secret plan” to bring about a “peace with honor” that he could not reveal to the enemy. The election became a three-man race when Alabama Governor George Wallace ran as an independent candidate, attracting conservative Southern whites and white Northern blue-collar workers with his attacks on

 integration, elites in Washington, D.C., and antiwar protesters. “If any demonstrator ever lays down in front of my car,” Wallace proclaimed, “it’ll be the last car he’ll ever lay down in front of.” As Election Day neared Humphrey picked up liberal support by pledging to end bombing over North Vietnam immediately. Despite losing conservatives’ votes to Wallace, Nixon won the Electoral College vote handily but only received 44 percent of the popular vote (26.12). Opposition to the war never resulted in widespread support for the peace movement. Most Americans remained staunchly anti-communist, even as their dissatisfaction with the war in Vietnam grew. Gallup Polls in 1969 revealed that by a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent, Americans labeled themselves as doves not hawks and most described the war as indefen4 sible. Three-fifths, however, also believed that the peace movement 8 4 helped the enemy and made it more difficult for the president to end the 10 3 war.

 Why did the peace movement have trouble winning support from mainstream America?

 Johnson had calmed the American public in March 1968 by announcing he would open negotiations with the North Vietnamese. Keeping his promise, he began fruitless negotiations with Hanoi. Johnson continued trying, however, to win the war before he left office. Believing that a final push against a weakened enemy could finish the job, American soldiers renewed their attacks on the Vietcong. The largest search-and-destroy missions of the war occurred in March

 and April, involving more than 100,000 troops. During one of these in the village of My Lai, American soldiers massacred hundreds of civilians, an atrocity that fueled the strident domestic debate over the American mission in Vietnam. On March 16, 1968, 75 American soldiers in two platoons under the command of Lieutenant William Calley entered My Lai. Before the mission, these troops had spent long days wading through the rice paddies and even longer nights battling snipers and insects, looking for Vietcong who had killed a popular sergeant the week before. By the time the men approached My Lai, they were in an ugly mood. By attacking during the morning hours, the company’s officers anticipated that their troops would confront 250 enemy troops and few civilians, whom the Americans expected would follow the usual daily ritual of leaving the village to visit a local market. None of these predictions came to pass. In the village the men found only unarmed women, children, and the elderly. The Vietcong had retreated into the western mountains before the Americans arrived. Rather than leaving, however, the Americans engaged in an orgy of rape, torture, and slaughter that took four hours to complete and left more than 500 villagers dead. Army photographer Ron Haeberle snapped this image (26.13) of terrified women and children huddled together moments before American soldiers killed them. “Guys were about to shoot these people, I yelled, ‘Hold it’ and I shot my pictures. As I walked away, I heard M-16s open up, and from the corner of my eye I saw bodies falling but I did not turn to look,” Haeberle recalled. Seeing the carnage from the air, pilot Hugh Thompson landed his helicopter between the soldiers and 11 survivors, whom he flew to safety. Thompson reported the atrocity to his superiors to no avail. Only the perseverance of Ron Ridenhour, a sergeant who was not even at My Lai, finally brought the massacre to light. After hearing stories from men who took part, an outraged Ridenhour wrote to President Nixon, the Pentagon, and members of Congress. When the story broke in 1969, Haeberle sold his photos to Life. A military investigation headed by Lieutenant General William Peers resulted in Calley’s court martial for premeditated murder. Calley’s conviction in 1971 exposed Americans’ conflicting views over the meaning of My Lai. Was the atrocity a unique episode or representative of American conduct in Vietnam? Competing Visions: Who Was Responsible for the My Lai Massacre? (page 800) explores this question in more detail.

 Responding to the public outcry over Calley’s conviction, Secretary of the Army Howard “Bo” Callaway reduced Calley’s life sentence to ten years, and President Nixon pardoned Calley after he had served only five months in prison. By this time Calley had been transformed from villain to hero in the American imagination. People on both the left and the right of the political spectrum defended Calley. The left saw him as a scapegoat for failed American policies, while the right argued that civilians were fair targets in a guerilla war.

 They were bringing people out [of their huts], and then we pushed them out into the rice paddy, onto the dike there … Lieutenant Calley came back, and said: “Take care of them.” So we said: “Okay.” And we sat there and watched them like we usually do. And he came back again, and he said: “I thought I told you to take care of them.” I said: “We’re taking care of them,” and he said: “I mean kill them.” So I looked at Meadlo and he looked at me, and I didn’t want to do it, and he didn’t want to do it … then [Calley] said: “Come on, we’ll line them up here, we’ll kill them.” So I told him: “I’ll watch the tree line” … Then they opened up, and started firing. Meadlo fired a while. I don’t know how much he fired, a clip, I think. It might have been more. He started to cry, and he gave me his weapon.

 “That America and Americans must stand in the larger dock of guilt and human conscience for what happened at My Lai seems inescapable.” So observed Time [magazine], adding: “Men in American uniforms slaughtered the civilians of My Lai, and in so doing humiliated the U.S. and called in question the U.S. mission in Vietnam in a way that all the antiwar protesters could never have done.” One’s mind staggers: Are “America and Americans” generally guilty, the same America and Americans now preparing to bring the accused to trial? And even if it turns out that atrocities were committed, how does this call in question the U.S. mission in Vietnam? Do the innumerable atrocities committed by both sides in World War II add up to the proposition that resistance to the Nazis ought to have been abandoned? … Irrational and irresponsible comment on [My Lai] has become collective madness.

 This New York Times editorial suggested that higherranking officials than Calley bore some responsibility for ordering and observing the My Lai massacre. Who gave the orders? Who knew what was going on? Was any attempt made to stop it? Who is responsible? … [Paul Meadlo] was one of 18 witnesses to describe a briefing the night before the assault at which Captain [Ernest L.] Medina told the men they were going into battle with a hardened Vietcong battalion; that their mission was “search and destroy” and they were to destroy everything in the hamlet—houses, crops and people … Helicopter pilots, radio men and artillery observers said the higher officers had flown over the scene for several hours and had seen bodies on the ground, had conference with the other officers and, as one pilot said, “knew what was going on” all through the day … the Geneva conventions, the Nuremburg doctrines and the Army’s own rules of land warfare make plain that obedience to orders is not a blanket defense, that orders that to a “prudent” or “reasonable” man seem patently illegal need not be obeyed. The question here, then, is whether the order, if that is what it was, to kill everything was one that a prudent man should obey when he found that everything included women, children, and infants.

THE LONG ROAD TO PEACE



The Long Road to Peace
 When Richard Nixon entered the White House in 1969, he told his advisors, “I’m going to stop that war. Fast.” Nixon was also intent, however, on preserving America’s international reputation. He had a different vision from his predecessor, he assured the public, pledging to seek “peace with honor.” Nixon’s promises proved empty, however. The war did not end quickly, but continued for four more years. At home Nixon benefited politically by portraying the peace movement as out of step with the values of law-abiding citizens. When he extended the war into Laos and Cambodia and became embroiled in political scandal, his actions fueled the political debate over whether Americans could trust their government.

 Seeking Peace with Honor For Nixon a peace with honor meant winning the war. He and his national security advisor, Henry Kissinger, pursued four different tactics to achieve this goal. First Nixon implemented Vietnamization, which turned the bulk of the ground fighting over to the South Vietnamese Army. By 1971, the American presence in Vietnam had diminished dramatically. In many respects this was a return to the pre-1965 approach, when America propped up an independent South Vietnam with financial and military aid. Announcing Vietnamization in November 1969, Nixon asked for support from “the great silent majority of Americans,” referring to the many Americans who supported the war quietly in the privacy of their homes. He also rebuked the peace movement. “Let us be united for peace. Let us also be united against defeat. Because let us understand: North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States. Only Americans can do that.” Polls indicated that the “silent majority” overwhelmingly supported his plan. Vietnamization promised to give America exactly what it wanted: victory with minimal loss of American lives. The United States quickly transformed the South Vietnamese Army into one of the largest and best-equipped military forces in the world. At the ongoing peace talks, a North Vietnamese negotiator wondered aloud how the United States, when it could not win with its own troops, thought it could “succeed when you let your puppet troops do the fighting.” That dilemma, Kissinger admitted, “also torments me.” In implementing Vietnamization Nixon hoped to disarm the peace movement by replacing images of civilian suffering on the evening news with pictures of troops withdrawing and returning home.

 In March 1970, he announced the incremental withdrawal of another 150,000 soldiers to “drop a bombshell on the gathering spring storm of antiwar protest.” He simultaneously reformed the draft, replacing the controversial deferment system with a lottery that randomly drafted men by date of birth. Nixon hoped these changes would buy his administration enough time to win the war. The controversial actions of peace activists inadvertently helped Nixon solidify the support of Middle America. In 1972, the actress Jane Fonda accepted an invitation from the North Vietnamese government to visit Hanoi. While in the enemy capital, she made radio broadcasts urging American pilots to mutiny. A photo of Fonda joking with North Vietnamese soldiers as she sat on an antiaircraft gun used to shoot down American planes created a backlash against the peace movement that Nixon exploited. Vietnamization was more than a reaction to declining popular support for fighting in Vietnam. It was also part of Nixon’s attempt to reshape the role that the United States played in global geopolitics. Nixon and Kissinger viewed the longstanding vision of a bipolar world that pitted the United States against the Soviet Union as obsolete. They embraced a competing strategic vision of multipolarity that focused on negotiating with Europe, China, Japan, and the Soviet Union to construct a new balance of power system to keep the peace. In this foreign policy reformulation, the United States would refrain from direct involvement in regional conflicts, such as Vietnam. The Nixon Doctrine, formulated in 1969 and 1970, announced that the United States expected its friends to take the lead in defending themselves. Nixon’s second tactic linked Vietnamization to the resumption of massive bombing in North

 Vietnam, which Johnson had halted when he initiated peace talks in 1968. As American troops left Vietnam between 1969 and 1972, the number of bombs dropped increased spectacularly (see this shift in Envisioning Evidence: Vietnam: The War by the Numbers). America had not used enough military force to achieve victory, the president and Kissinger concluded. They intended to correct this problem. For a while the news of troop withdrawals diverted attention from the intensified bombing of North Vietnam. Alongside Vietnamization and renewed bombing of North Vietnam, Nixon and Kissinger’s third tactic used diplomacy to decrease Soviet and Chinese support for North Vietnam. Exploiting the discord between China and the Soviet Union, Nixon pursued independent negotiations with each nation to strengthen their ties to the United States and deepen their distrust of each other. He reshaped the Cold War by pursuing his vision of multi-polarity through détente, using diplomatic, economic, and cultural contacts to improve U.S. relations with China and the Soviet Union. Fearing that the United States might form an alliance with the other, the Soviet Union and China each eagerly accepted these overtures. In return for a more congenial relationship with the United States, Nixon expected China and the Soviet Union to end their support of North Vietnam. Although both countries continued to send aid to North Vietnam, once they decided to normalize trade relations and enter into arms limitations agreements with the United States, the Soviet Union and China began pressuring Hanoi to seek a negotiated peace.

Cambodia: Invasion
 and Outrage The fourth tactical component of Nixon’s Vietnam policy involved the neutral country of Cambodia, which bordered Vietnam to the west. In 1969, Nixon initiated a secret bombing campaign of Cambodia. He hoped to cut off supplies filtering through the Ho Chi Minh Trail and thus pressure North Vietnam into accepting the American terms for peace that included an independent South Vietnam. In April 1970, Nixon shattered the public consensus he had carefully created for Vietnamization by ordering an American ground force invasion of Cambodia. Before the invasion Nixon sought inspiration from repeated showings of the movie

 How did Nixon try to win the war?

 Patton in the White House, a film that portrayed the hard-nosed and belligerent World War II tank commander General George S. Patton leading American forces to victory. Nixon announced in a televised speech that American troops needed to destroy Communist bases in Cambodia to help the South Vietnamese army defeat the Vietcong. But the two-month-long incursion only pushed the North Vietnamese further into the interior of Cambodia, where they began supporting the Khmer Rouge, Communist rebels who seized power in Cambodia in 1975 and unleashed a wave of mass murder so brutal that the country became known as “the killing fields.” Nixon’s claim that he was expanding the war to end it sooner persuaded few. Protest erupted on college campuses nationwide and in Congress where the Senate symbolically terminated the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. Many university demonstrations turned violent as protesters clashed with police and set fire to college buildings. A defiant Nixon stood his ground, assuming that the “silent majority” agreed with his assessment that the protesters were just “bums blowing up the campuses.” In Kent, Ohio, student-organized demonstrations protesting the invasion of Cambodia took a nasty turn, recalled Phil Caputo, who had left the Marines after two tours in Vietnam and was now a reporter for the Chicago Tribune. In a May weekend rampage, “store windows had been smashed in town, [and] radicals had burned down the ROTC building,” according to Caputo. Calling the protesters “the worst sort of people we harbor in America,” Governor James Allen Rhodes promised to “use every weapon possible to eradicate the problem,” as he sent National Guardsmen to restore order. On Monday morning a few hundred students gathered on the campus of Kent State University for a rally, defying a ban on protests. National Guardsmen fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, who responded by throwing rocks and shouting obscenities at the troops. Suddenly, as bystanders and students on their way to class watched the mini-battle unfurl, the troops sprayed bullets into the crowd, killing four and wounding nine. The National Guardsmen claimed that they had fired in self-defense when protesters began throwing concrete slabs. Two of the victims were passers-by, however, and all four were too far away from the troops to have hit them with anything more than pebbles.

VIETNAM: THE WAR BY THE NUMBERS
Americans’ opinions about the Vietnam War varied over the course of the war, eventually influencing the strategy pursued there. Even as the war became more unpopular, however, at least 40 percent of the nation continued to believe that the nation had done the right thing by sending troops to fight in Vietnam. The United States also tried to use its air superiority to win the war, dropping more bombs in the Vietnam War than in World War II. 
 In 1968 the U.S. troop commitment reached its highest level and bombing of North Vietnam remained intense, but after the Tet Offensive for the first time the majority of Americans (54%) felt that it had been a mistake to send troops to Vietnam.

 CHAPTER 26

A NATION DIVIDED: THE VIETNAM WAR, 1945–1975

 Responding to Nixon’s earlier characterization of the protesters, the father of one of the dead told reporters, “My child was not a bum.” The cover of Life (26.14) showed terrified students trying to save the life of one victim, underscoring that the war’s killing had come home to America. This photo, along with the others inside the magazine, inspired musician Neil Young to write the song “Ohio” to protest the shootings, the war, and the Nixon administration.

 “Tin soldiers and Nixon coming, We’re finally on our own. This summer I hear the drumming, Four dead in Ohio.” Lyrics from Neil Young’s song “Ohio,” written in response to the Kent State shootings

 “A nation driven to use the weapons of war upon its youth is a nation on the edge of chaos,” concluded the presidential commission that investigated the Kent State incident. The Kent State shootings unmasked the growing “town and gown” divide over the war and latent anger at the peace movement. “They should have shot more of them,” suggested one Kent resident, still angry over the weekend riot. Radio stations refused to play Young’s “anti-Nixon” song. While protests over the shooting engulfed more than half the nation’s college campuses, workingclass unions staged counter-protests to support the war. In New York City hundreds of longshoremen wearing hard hats attacked students who were protesting the Cambodian invasion. During a subsequent meeting at the White House, sympathetic labor leaders presented the president with a “commander-in-chief” hard hat. The wave of protests after the Kent State shootings nonetheless bothered Nixon. At the end of a sleepless night on May 9, 1970, he made an impulsive decision to have his valet drive him, without his Secret Service detail, to the Lincoln Memorial at five o’clock in the morning so he could talk to the antiwar demonstrators camped out there. According to the protesters Nixon talked disjointedly about college sports and surfing and assured them that he shared their wish for peace in Vietnam. Despite his clumsy attempt to talk directly with peace activists, Nixon remained determined to see the war through to victory. Clinging to the belief that success would vindicate his methods, Nixon expanded the theater of war again in February 1971 by ordering an invasion of Laos. This time South Vietnamese troops fought on the ground with American air support. Once again, however, the hopes of permanently disrupting the Ho Chi Minh Trail bore meager results. Administration officials claimed that the Laos invasion illustrated the success of Vietnamization. Skeptics pointed to the sight of South Vietnamese soldiers clinging in panic to the skids of departing helicopters during their chaotic retreat back into South Vietnam. In 1971, antiwar demonstrators staged 62 demonstrations in Washington, D.C., bringing

 over 100,000 demonstrators to the nation’s capital (26.15). That summer The New York Times published the Pentagon Papers, a secret Department of Defense study that criticized the way Kennedy and Johnson had handled the war, stoking the flames of antiwar sentiment in the wake of the Calley conviction, the failed Cambodian and Laos invasions, and the Kent State killings. The Pentagon Papers, leaked by Pentagon official Daniel Ellsberg, confirmed that presidents Kennedy and Johnson had intentionally lied to the public about the extent of previous American involvement in the war. Many Americans assumed that Nixon was also misleading the country. By now only 34 percent of Americans approved of his handling of the war. Controversy over the war also seeped into the military. Morale plummeted as soldiers became unwilling to risk their lives for a cause that the nation seemed poised to abandon. In 1970, the military reported nearly 200 incidents of “fragging,” which were deadly fraternal attacks by enlisted men on officers, named for the hand grenade fragments that did most of the damage. Escalating use of marijuana, opium, and heroin, all readily available in Vietnam, among servicemen was another sign of disintegrating discipline.

Withdrawal
 Nixon envisioned détente creating a new world order in which the United States used trade agreements and arms limitation treaties to curtail the expansionist ambitions of its enemies. His administration made significant headway with this approach in 1972, beginning with a highly publicized trip to China in February and culminating with a May summit meeting in Moscow. The carefully orchestrated pictures of the staunch anti-communist Nixon toasting China’s communist leader Mao during an official banquet and lauding the achievements of Chinese civilization during a trek to the Great Wall signaled an important turning point in

 Sino-American relations. Improved relations with China also demolished one of the main arguments used to justify the war in Vietnam. American leaders had always linked the war to the larger American goal of containing communism in Southeast Asia. They considered the region, rather than Vietnam itself, vital to American strategic interests overseas. Nixon now demonstrated that diplomacy could perhaps contain communism in Southeast Asia more effectively than war. Why then, many Americans wondered, was the nation still fighting in Vietnam? The improving relations between its communist benefactors and the United States alarmed North Vietnam. When the North Vietnamese grumbled about Mao shaking hands with Nixon, Mao advised them to sign a peace treaty, regroup while the Americans withdrew, and then resume the war. North Vietnam eventually followed Mao’s advice. They first tried, however, to replicate the political success of the Tet Offensive by launching a major invasion of the South. The North Vietnamese timed the so-called Easter Offensive of March 1972 to coincide with the start of the American presidential campaign. In response Nixon ordered a massive retaliation against North Vietnam that included bombing, a blockade, and mining a key harbor. Unlike Tet the Easter Offensive did not greatly alter the political equation in the United States or worldwide. At home Nixon’s approval ratings rose for defending South Vietnam from attack. Moving from his successful meeting in China to Moscow, the U.S.-Soviet summit proceeded as planned. When Nixon returned with the first disarmament agreement ever signed by the Soviet Union, he bolstered his image as a tough negotiator who got results. The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I) limited the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles

 and submarine-launched missiles each side could stockpile and the number of antimissile launching pads. Once again, however, Nixon’s diplomatic success undercut his argument that the United States needed an anti-Communist South Vietnam to win the Cold War. By summer 1972, both the United States and North Vietnam concluded that the costs of continued fighting had become too great. Recognizing that Democratic presidential candidate Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, a peace advocate who promised to withdraw U.S. troops from Vietnam, was trailing in the polls, the North Vietnamese decided to seek the best terms possible from Nixon. Although Nixon had discredited McGovern by suggesting that he would abandon American POWs in Vietnam, the president was also eager to negotiate. With his reelection assured Nixon wanted to fulfill his campaign promise to end the war, so he could pursue his larger goal of refashioning Cold War relations among the world’s superpowers. Despite this renewed willingness on both sides to negotiate, it still took months to seal the deal. The final 1973 peace treaty called for American withdrawal, allowed North Vietnamese troops to remain in South Vietnam, and left the existing South Vietnamese government in place.

 How did the Vietnam War finally end for the United States and the Vietnamese?

 All left the Paris negotiating table knowing that the cease-fire existed only on paper. The war would go on, only now without American advisors, soldiers, or pilots. Despite the spiral downward in Vietnam, Nixon retained a durable base of domestic support due to the success of détente with China and the Soviet Union and his effective portrayal of the antiwar movement as out of step with mainstream America. This political base, however, eroded quickly when he became embroiled in a major political scandal. The Watergate scandal (1972), a botched Republican-engineered break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., forced Nixon to resign in 1974. On June 17, 1972, members of Nixon’s campaign staff had broken into the Watergate building office to fix broken wiretaps (listening devices on telephones) that they had installed during a previous burglary in May. Congressional challenges to his Vietnam policies and investigations into potential criminal activity by Nixon and members of his administration (see Chapter 28), weakened Nixon politically as he began his second term.

THE LONG ROAD TO PEACE

 In the midst of the Watergate crisis, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution to curtail presidential war-making powers. The 1973 law required congressional approval for any deployment of American troops overseas that lasted for more than 60 days. Critics pressed for even greater restrictions, arguing that the constitutional authority to declare war lay solely with Congress whether a war lasted 60 days or 60 years. Nixon countered that the law interfered with the president’s constitutional role as commander in chief of the armed forces. Ignoring Congress’s desire to end American involvement in Vietnam, he tried to continue funneling money and arms to South Vietnam. In response Congress sharply reduced funding for South Vietnam in 1974. When Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974 to avoid impeachment, VicePresident Gerald Ford assumed office. (Nixon had appointed Ford as his vice president in 1973 when Spiro Agnew resigned following an unrelated corruption scandal.) The political controversy at home and Americans’ widespread distrust of executive power in the wake of the failed war in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal weakened President Ford’s ability to respond to the imminent collapse of South Vietnam. In March 1975, North Vietnam renewed its offensive. With no American help in the offing, South Vietnam collapsed. Within eight weeks North Vietnamese troops neared Saigon. They walked along highways littered with boots and uniforms discarded by deserting South Vietnamese soldiers who hoped

 to blend into the civilian population and avoid execution. Ho Chi Minh did not live to see the end of the war (he died in 1969), but the Communists renamed Saigon “Ho Chi Minh City” in his honor. Victory in the 30-year conflict did not end civilian suffering in Vietnam, however. Famine and prison camps caused thousands to flee in overcrowded boats to refugee camps in Thailand and Malaysia, where they faced an uncertain future waiting for permanent asylum in the United States or Europe. For America the war concluded with the image of South Vietnamese citizens climbing a ladder on the roof of the American Embassy in Saigon to board one of the American helicopters that flew American citizens and 150,000 South Vietnamese to safety in the final days of the war (26.16). The frantic evacuation was a disheartening end to America’s longest war to date, one that claimed the lives of 47,415 combatants and cost the nation $173 billion (26.17). How to remember such a divisive and controversial war continued to provoke debate within the United States. The 1982 Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., listed all the names of American war dead on two black marble slabs that descended into the ground. “Hidden in a hole, as if in shame,” complained one veteran. “It is exactly the right memorial for that war,” countered another. Festering rumors that Vietnam was still holding American soldiers hostage deepened public bitterness against the nation’s former foe. The United States finally normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1995, 20 years after the fall of Saigon. It was time, one veteran wrote, “to recognize the truth. The war is over.”

A
Decade of Discord  The Challenge of the 1960s In April 1968, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, to support a black garbage men’s strike. Around 6:00 p.m. on April 4, 1968, as King leaned over a balcony railing outside his second-story room at the Lorraine Motel to chat with two friends in the courtyard below, shots rang out. A wounded King collapsed on the floor of the balcony, and colleagues frantically tried to stem the bleeding with towels while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Within an hour hospital doctors pronounced the 38-year-old minister dead. As news of King’s assassination spread, rioting erupted in black communities throughout the nation, and images of violence saturated the television airwaves. In this photo King’s 13-year-old daughter Yolanda sits inside a car peering at mourners, reflected in the car window, while her mother Coretta Scott King sits solemnly behind her as they leave King’s funeral in Atlanta, Georgia. This somber photograph, as much as the images of rioters, captured the crushing disappointment of dashed dreams. It was a sentiment shared by many Americans in the 1960s, white and black, who failed to fully realize their goals of either reforming America or ending the cultural turmoil. America was rife with discord during the 1960s. Much debate centered on liberalism and its willingness to use the government to protect civil rights and expand economic opportunity. Throughout the decade social reformers working within the liberal tradition advanced competing visions of social justice and shared prosperity. Some visions were bold; some, truly radical. King dreamed of using nonviolence to achieve racial equality; more militant activists advocated armed self-defense. Building on the reform legacies of the Progressive Era and the New Deal, Democratic Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson launched their own wars against poverty. Their legislative agendas were too timid for young radical activists, who wanted to revolutionize American capitalism. Feminists, Chicano activists, and Native American protesters also mobilized to demand equal rights. These visions of reform, especially the more radical revolutionary ones, appeared like nightmares to conservative segments of the population that abhorred liberalism. Southern segregationists organized to prevent government-mandated dismantling of Jim Crow, and white Northerners increasingly resented taxpayer-supported programs for unruly minorities. The rise of a hippie counterculture that emphasized love and pleasure convinced many working- and middle-class whites that liberalism meant the end of law and order and traditional values. If there was one point of agreement throughout the 1960s, it was that the political and cultural battles that defined the decade, for good or ill, transformed the nation. By 1970, frustration over unfulfilled dreams left Americans divided over whether the nation had changed too much or not enough.

 “We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.” MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., 1963





 CHAPTER 27

A DECADE OF DISCORD: THE CHALLENGE OF THE 1960S

The Liberal Moment
 The 1960s was the heyday of American liberalism, thanks in part to presidential reform agendas and to pivotal Supreme Court rulings. Presidents Kennedy and Johnson viewed themselves as heirs to the New Deal legacy, and they intended to follow in Harry Truman’s footsteps, who as president had desegregated the American military and secured federal funds for urban public housing, education, and public works projects. Kennedy and Johnson each believed in the power of the federal government to reform American society, but each faced intense resistance from conservatives who were certain that the less the government interfered in the economy or society, the better.

Kennedy and the
New Frontier
 Nearly 20 percent of Americans, 70 percent of them white, lived in dire poverty during the most prosperous moment in American history. Many middle- and upper-class Americans learned this startling statistic by reading Michael Harrington’s The Other America: Poverty in the United States (1962). Harrington documented the deteriorating schools, substandard hospitals, and dead-end jobs that created a cycle of poverty that continued unabated for generations. Just like Jacob Riis’s nineteenthcentury exposé, How the Other Half Lives (see Chapter 17), Harrington made the lives of the nation’s poor “visible” to the rest of the nation. Harrington claimed that a “culture of poverty” filled with extramarital sex, illegitimate children, and broken families created “a different kind of people” who did not share the values or outlook of middle-class America. Like Riis 70 years earlier, Harrington succeeded in awakening the social consciousness of affluent liberals, including John F. Kennedy. While campaigning in West Virginia during his 1960 presidential bid, Kennedy came face to face with appalling poverty as he sat and talked with coal miners, pictured here (27.1), about their lives. This moment of intimate conversation, one of his speechwriters noted, was “Kennedy at his best” as he gathered details about children who never drank 27.1 Presidential Candidate John F.

Kennedy told the nation in his 1961 inaugural address, setting a tone

 “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” Kennedy’s Inaugural Address, 1961 of hope that inspired young people and liberals throughout the nation. After eight years with the moderate Republican Dwight Eisenhower in the White House, Kennedy wanted to reinvigorate the liberal agenda through a legislative program called the New Frontier. Kennedy’s proposed reforms included raising the minimum wage, reducing overcrowding in schools, and providing health care for the elderly. Kennedy advocated cutting taxes and increasing government spending to stimulate the economy, reasoning that as incomes rose more tax revenue would flow into federal coffers to pay for these programs. Kennedy also needed large sums for the ongoing space race with the Soviet Union, begun when the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 (see Chapter 24). The Soviets sent the first astronauts into space in 1961, prompting Kennedy to announce that the United States intended to recover its reputation as the world’s technological leader by putting a man on the moon. The youngest elected president in American history, Kennedy’s charisma and idealism inspired many baby boomers, who were just reaching adolescence or entering college. Thousands rushed to join the Peace Corps, an agency established by Kennedy that sent recent college graduates to work on humanitarian projects in developing nations. “I really believed that I was going to change the world,” recalled one teenager. By 1970, over 10,000 Peace Corps volunteers had traveled abroad to teach, build hospitals, set up water treatment plants, and establish irrigation systems. Kennedy raised unemployment and Social Security benefits and the minimum wage, but he had trouble implementing other parts of his

 liberal legislative program. Unskilled in lobbying legislators, just over one-third of his proposals became law. Conservative congressmen balked at using deficit spending to fund the tax cuts and programs Kennedy proposed. Southerners objected to Northerners’ insistence that federal education funds go only to racially integrated schools, while Protestants resisted offering public monies to private Catholic parochial schools. It was one of the “great ironies of American politics,” a New York Times reporter noted, that “JFK, the immensely popular president, could not reach his legislative goals.”

A
Liberal Court  Under the leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren from 1953–1969, the Supreme Court became an aggressive champion of individual rights, fostering the liberal agenda more successfully than Kennedy and Democrats in Congress. Warren believed that the Constitution gave the government the power, and the responsibility, to protect the relatively powerless against oppression by the majority. By rendering opinions on a wide range of social justice issues, the Warren Court brought about a legal revolution in the United States that permanently altered American schools, politics, the criminal justice system, and cultural norms. Northern liberals cheered these decisions, but conservatives in both parties viewed the Warren Court as an activist court, rewriting rather than upholding the Constitution. In 1954, the Brown v. Board of Education decision (see Chapter 25) paved the way for school desegregation. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the court dismantled Jim Crow piece by piece, striking down segregated interstate and city buses, upholding the rights of civil rights protesters to hold sit-ins, and embracing mid-1960s federal laws that desegregated public places and guaranteed the right to vote as constitutional. Another innovative judicial premise, the right to privacy, accompanied the Supreme Court’s new support for civil rights. The court struck down state laws that outlawed possession of obscene publications, prohibited the use of contraception, and prevented interracial marriages. Individual Americans, the court ruled, had the right to decide what to read, to use birth control, and to marry whom they wanted. Other decisions redefined how the police arrested and interrogated suspected criminals. The police now had to inform individuals of their constitutional rights to have a state-funded

Choices and Consequences
IS SCHOOL PRAYER CONSTITUTIONAL?
In 1962, parents in New York State challenged the constitutionality of the short nondenominational prayer that the state Board of Regents had adopted in 1951 for use in the public schools. The question was whether government-directed prayer violated the First Amendment clause that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” The Fourteenth Amendment made this clause applicable to state law. 
Choices




 The prayer was constitutional because students were not required to recite it.





 An official prayer, regardless of its content, violated the First Amendment.

 School prayer simply recognized the importance of religion in American society without establishing an official religion.

Decision
 In Engel v. Vitale (1962) the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 1 that state-directed school prayer was unconstitutional. Justice Hugo Black wrote the majority opinion, stating that the First Amendment prohibited “official prayers for any group of American people to recite as part of a religious program carried on by government.”

Consequences
 The Warren Court received more mail opposing this case than any other. In 1963, the court also banned reciting the Lord’s Prayer and Bible-reading in public school, ruling that to remain neutral the government could not support “the tenets of one or all religions.” Outrage over school prayer rulings helped forge a new political coalition between Southern fundamentalist Protestants and Northern Catholics, whose grassroots activism against liberalism contributed to the conservative right’s resurgence in the late 1960s. Subsequent court decisions in the 1980s and 1990s prohibited moments of silence for private prayer, minister-led prayers at high school graduations, and student-led prayers at high school football games.

 First-graders praying

Continuing Controversies
 Does school prayer violate the First Amendment? Those who answer “yes” believe that the Founding Fathers included the establishment clause in the Constitution because the union of government and religion often leads to persecution of those not adhering to mainstream religious views. Freedom of

 religion requires a completely secular government that neither advances nor inhibits religious beliefs. Many conservatives argue that the court’s decisions violated their First Amendment right to exercise free speech and destroyed the spiritual heritage of the nation that stretched back to the Pilgrims.

 Why did so many Americans object to the Supreme Court’s ruling against school prayer?

A DECADE OF DISCORD: THE CHALLENGE OF THE 1960S

 In deciding which delegation to seat, the convention’s Credentials Committee heard gripping testimony from MFDP delegate Fannie Lou Hamer. Thanks to the live television feed covering the proceedings, Americans throughout the nation heard her describe being beaten, losing her job, and receiving a $9,000 water bill even though her house had no running water—all retribution for trying to register to vote. “Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, where we are threatened daily because we want to live as decent human beings?” she asked before the cameras. Suddenly the networks broke away for an impromptu presidential news conference that Johnson had called to interrupt coverage of Hamer’s moving personal story. Johnson did not want the convention and his subsequent campaign to center on civil rights. To end the matter, he tried to broker a deal off-camera. When the MFDP rejected the offer of two delegate seats, the all-white Mississippi delegation took the floor. In the election of 1964, the Democrat and Republican parties fielded candidates who offered starkly different visions of the role that government should play in American society. Johnson spoke of creating a Great Society with social welfare reforms that would make the amenities of modern life—a decent standard of living, education, health care, clean water—available to all Americans. Like turn-of-the-century Populists and Progressives, and 1930s New Dealers, he wanted to use the power of the federal government to rein in the wealthy and help economically disadvantaged Americans. Having begun his congressional career as an avid New Dealer in the 1930s, Johnson shared Franklin D. Roosevelt’s desire to provide the deserving poor with a decent standard of living. Johnson, however, believed even more strongly than previous generations of liberal reformers in the ability of the government to improve the quality of life in America. Under Johnson the federal government began com-

 bating pollution, supporting the arts, and planting trees and flowers along the nation’s highways—a beautification project strongly endorsed by his wife, Lady Bird Johnson. Johnson aspired to do more than put food in people’s bellies; he also wanted to nurture their spirits. Barry Goldwater, a conservative Republican senator from Arizona, offered a radically different view of what responsibilities the government should assume. Instead of more government Goldwater proposed dismantling most of the New Deal, including Social Security, and opposed federal civil rights laws, because he saw them as the first step toward creating “a police state.” “My aim is not to pass laws but to repeal them,” he declared. Goldwater spoke for the radical right, staunch conservatives who felt that the government’s interference in the economy and society did more harm than good. His extreme conservative views, however, alarmed prominent moderate Republicans who openly supported Johnson. In the campaign the Democrats astutely used Goldwater’s most extreme pronouncements against him, making the liberal Johnson look almost moderate in comparison. Amplifying a remark by Goldwater that NATO commanders should have the authority to use nuclear weapons, a Democratic television campaign ad pictured a little girl counting as she picked the petals off a daisy (27.3). When she reached nine the camera froze on the image of her uplifted face before dissolving into a countdown to a nuclear bomb explosion. As the mushroom cloud dissipated, the screen turned dark and these words appeared: “Vote for President Johnson on November 3. The stakes are too high for you to stay home.” The ad provoked its own firestorm of controversy and only aired once. It succeeded, however, in planting the image of Goldwater as a dangerous extremist who might lead the nation into nuclear war.

 Johnson won the election with over 61 percent of the popular vote, the largest percentage in American history. The Democrats also widened their control of Congress, strengthening Johnson’s hand.

Eighteen months from now Landslide Lyndon will be Lame-Duck Lyndon.”

The Great Society
 Admiring the trees and landscaping along a national highway, reading a food label listing nutritional content in the supermarket, buying unleaded gas at a service station, and watching a documentary on the Public Broadcasting System (PBS): these are all experiences of modern life made possible by Johnson’s Great Society. Reflecting liberal faith in the power of the government to do good, the adherents of the Great Society hoped to remove the causes of debilitating poverty by improving the nation’s educational system, providing health care to the aged, disabled, and indigent, and creating a new cabinet-level position in housing and urban affairs

 to oversee housing and economic relief to struggling cities. Johnson’s Great Society also included a new Department of Transportation to manage the federal funds pouring into highway construction and landscaping. Johnson worked hard to create consensus for his liberal ideals. He offered conservative industrialists tax breaks in return for supporting his social welfare programs, arguing that his programs would create highly skilled workers who consumed more. “Doing something about poverty is economical in the long run,” he told them. From his long years in Congress, Johnson knew how to lobby legislators. To secure a needed vote, Johnson brought legislators to the White House and subjected them to “The Treatment,” a mixture of cajoling, horse-trading, and intimidation. One congressman recalled the 6’3” Johnson grabbing him by the lapels of his coat, pulling him close and holding his face inches away while he “talked and talked.

 insurance for the elderly, reimbursed doctors and hospitals whatever they charged senior citizens instead of establishing government rates. Johnson also agreed to let the states, not the federal government, run Medicaid, which provided health services to the poor. In creating the Great Society, Johnson wanted to restore America’s identity as the land of opportunity for immigrants. The Immigration Act of 1965 eliminated the quota system established in the 1920s that set stringent caps on immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe and barred all Asian immigration (see Chapter 21). In the first great wave of immigration since the 1910s, unprecedented numbers of Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, and Vietnamese migrated to the United States over the next 30 years. Whether immigration benefited or hurt the nation again became a topic on which Americans offered competing visions (see Chapter 29). By detailing the destructive impact of pesticides, Rachel Carson’s best-selling book Silent Spring (1962) helped create a politically favorable climate for the environmental regulation that Johnson proposed. Silent Spring vividly detailed the destructive impact of pesticides on native birds, provoking alarm over the possibility of a future silent spring when no bird songs would be heard. Johnson noted that Americans had always been proud of “America the beautiful,” but polluted air, disappearing forests, and filthy rivers had tarnished this image. The air in some cities was so bad that motorists had to use their headlights after noon. The pronouncement that Lake Erie was “dead” and the sight of oil slicks on the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland burning for eight days after a man tossed a lit cigar into the water underscored the environmental deterioration. These ecological catastrophes helped spawn an exploding grassroots environmental movement that included Greenpeace, a radical direct-action group, and a resurgent Sierra Club, a long-standing conservation society. Responding to environmental activism and growing middle-class concerns, Congress enacted bipartisan environmental measures that required pollution controls on cars and established national standards for acceptable air and water pollution. Johnson also created federally protected wilderness areas to safeguard endangered domestic species at risk of extinction, such as the whooping crane. The Great Society chart (27.4) contains a list of Johnson’s most significant legislation.

 if they were killed. After a smooth ride through the upper South, in Atlanta the Freedom Riders decided to take two separate buses into the heart of the rigidly segregated Deep South. As the first bus carrying Freedom Riders entered the depot in Anniston, Alabama, a mob pelted the bus with stones and slashed its tires. The driver drove away without stopping, pursued by 50 cars carrying vigilantes. When a flat tire obliged him to stop along a deserted country road, a firebomb forced the Freedom Riders off the bus and into the waiting gauntlet of sticks and crowbars. State troopers arrived in time to save the lives of the traumatized Freedom Riders, two of whom sit stunned on the ground in this photo (27.6) of the bus burning. Meanwhile the second bus arrived in Birmingham, where Ku Klux Klansmen beat white Freedom Rider James Peck, a 47-year-old labor and peace activist, when he entered a white-only waiting room with a black colleague. “When you go somewhere looking for trouble, you usually find it,” the governor of Alabama remarked unsympathetically. A photo of Klan members beating Peck accompanied the front-page story in the New York Times that informed President Kennedy about the organized attacks on the Freedom Riders. Still dealing with the fallout from the Bay of Pigs invasion that had ended in disaster four weeks earlier and preparing for a summit with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev (see Chapter 25), Kennedy urged the Freedom Riders to call off the rest of their scheduled journey. Instead members of the Student

 Who made key choices that affected the course and outcome of the Freedom Rides?

 Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the student-run civil rights group founded in 1960 during the sit-ins (see Chapter 25), rushed to Birmingham to ride alongside John Lewis, a founding member of SNCC, taking the place of riders unable or unwilling to continue.

 “We can’t let them stop us with violence. If we do, the movement is dead,” SNCC leader DIANE NASH upon resuming the Freedom Rides, 1961 Avoiding a violent confrontation became the administration’s priority. Attorney General Robert Kennedy (the president’s brother) secured a promise from the governor of Alabama that state troops would protect the riders. When the state reneged on this promise and another savage attack occurred at the Montgomery, Alabama bus depot, Robert Kennedy sent 600 federal marshals to protect the riders as they traveled to the Mississippi border. Rather than allowing vigilantes to attack the riders, Mississippi authorities took a different tack. As the riders filed off the bus in Jackson, police escorted them into waiting patrol cars. Most of the riders spent four months in jail for violating segregation laws. The Freedom Rides continued through the summer of 1961, and eventually 300 white and black protesters took part. In the fall the Interstate Commerce Commission required the integration of all interstate travel facilities. The Freedom Rides, however, did not achieve the organizers’ broader goals of securing President Kennedy’s enthusiastic support for the Civil Rights Movement. Despite his own integrationist views, President Kennedy remained preoccupied with protecting his white Democratic Southern base and feared that open discussion of America’s racial problems provided fodder for Soviet propaganda. It would take a shocking visual demonstration of racial violence in Birmingham, Alabama, to make him a champion of civil rights.

NONVIOLENCE TRIUMPHANT: THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, 1960–1965

Birmingham, 1963
In 1963, the Southern Christian Leadership
 Conference (SCLC), Martin Luther King Jr.’s church-based civil rights organization, unfurled a carefully coordinated campaign to desegregate Birmingham, Alabama, perhaps the most segregated city in the nation. “We were trying to launch a systematic, wholehearted battle against segregation that would set the pace for the nation,” explained the Birmingham SCLC leader Fred Shuttlesworth. Volatile Police Chief Bull Connor made the city an especially dangerous place to launch such a protest. SCLC accurately predicted that they would gain the attention of the president once the world saw Connor’s police attacking nonviolent demonstrators with highpower water hoses and dogs. Television was vital to this campaign: The images of violence pouring into living rooms would make it impossible for moderate white Americans to ignore the nation’s racial problems. In April 1963, King and the SCLC initiated their Birmingham campaign with economic boycotts and sit-ins. Press coverage increased when King and Shuttlesworth led a march in defiance of a state injunction that prohibited public demonstrations. Police immediately arrested and jailed the pair. King timed his arrest to occur on Good Friday, the day that Jesus died on the cross, using religious symbolism to underscore the immorality of racial persecution. As King sat in solitary confinement, the Birmingham News published an open letter to him from white liberal Southern clergymen who criticized the demonstrations as “unwise and untimely” for trying to provoke hardcore segregationists. The opinion of liberal and moderate Southern whites mattered to King. The nonviolent strategy depended on swaying those who may have traditionally supported segregation but were not die-hard racists. Visitors to King smuggled out his response, written on the margins of newspapers and scraps of toilet paper during his eight-day jail stay. King’s “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” did not influence events in Birmingham (by the time it was published, the protests had ended), but the text was one of his most eloquent statements on the dehumanizing aspects of racial discrimination. “For years now I have heard the word ‘Wait!’ It rings in the ear of every Negro

 with piercing familiarity. This ‘Wait’ has almost always meant ‘Never,’ ” King wrote. How would whites feel about sleeping in their cars when traveling because “no motel will accept you,” telling their children that they could not go to the segregated amusement parks advertised on television, and “living constantly on tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next”? These were the reasons, King explained, “why we find it difficult to wait.” Hoping to stop downtown demonstrations that were keeping shoppers away and worried that the federal government might intervene, moderate white business owners initiated secret talks with SCLC leaders without Chief Connor’s knowledge. To increase pressure on the businessmen, SCLC went ahead with marches despite lukewarm support from Birmingham churches and adults. To fill the ranks Jim Bevel, another veteran of the Nashville sit-ins, proposed turning Birmingham into a “children’s crusade” by recruiting from the city’s high schools and, if necessary, middle and elementary schools. “A boy from high school has the same effect in terms of being in jail, in terms of putting pressure on the city, as his father, and yet there’s no economic threat to the family, because the father is still on the job,” Bevel argued. On May 3, 1963, the second day of the protests, Carolyn McKinstry, like many others, left her high school without telling her parents that she was joining the demonstrations. When the teenagers arrived downtown, Connor was waiting with water hoses and police dogs. A shocked nation viewed television and newspaper images of firefighters directing torrents of water at McKinstry and her friends and police dogs biting protesters. (See Images as History: Birmingham, 1963, page 822.) As the SCLC had hoped, Northerners reacted with outrage to this blatant display of police brutality, while Southern moderates worried that Connor’s heavy-handed tactics would invite more federal scrutiny of Southern politics and racial customs. The Civil Rights Movement scored a major victory in Birmingham. Besides winning a commitment to desegregate lunch counters and schools and the promise of jobs, the protests renewed President Kennedy’s interest in civil rights. Concerned about losing momentum in the Cold War, he asked the nation: “Are we to say to the world—and much more importantly to each other—that this is the land of the free, except for the Negroes … ?”

A DECADE OF DISCORD: THE CHALLENGE OF THE 1960S

Images as History
 BIRMINGHAM, 1963 In Birmingham civil rights activists developed a strategy that included using television and news photos to their advantage. The Civil Rights Movement got exactly the images the activists wanted in 1963 when the Birmingham Police Chief Bull Connor unleashed extreme violence against protesters in the downtown area. How important

 was the press to the success of the Birmingham campaign? Why did the public react so strongly to these photos? As a white child in rural Alabama, Life photojournalist Charles Moore had accepted segregation “as the way things were.” Birmingham was a turning point in his own evolving social consciousness:

 Three teenage protesters clung to a doorway as water whipped their bodies, an ordeal that Moore immortalized in this iconic photograph of the Birmingham protests.

 McKinstry remained “proud of what I had done,” but afterwards questioned “the tactics that they [SCLC] were using because I think I felt that you could actually be hurt.”

 Does knowing more about McKinstry and Moore alter this photograph’s meaning?

 Moore avoided taking photos that might send a mixed message to the public. He took no pictures of students, only partly schooled in nonviolent techniques, who threw pieces of concrete at the police—even after a slab hit and injured him.

 “My emotional involvement in the story grew as I saw what was happening.” On the afternoon of May 3, 1963, Moore arrived in downtown Birmingham just as firefighters turned their high-pressure hoses and police dogs on teenage demonstrators. When Moore’s photos appeared in Life, a magazine read by half of American adults in the 1960s, his images, Movement leaders wanted liberal and moderate Americans to blame the police for escalating the violence in Birmingham, and Moore’s pictures left little room for an alternative explanation.



 along with television coverage of the mayhem, helped transform Birmingham from a local crisis into an event that prompted national soulsearching about democracy in America. Inspired by these images, civil rights activists initiated 1,000 demonstrations in nearly 100 cities throughout the South. The police arrested Moore when he refused to stop taking pictures. “It was scary to be a victim” of abusive police, Moore recalled, an experience that strengthened his solidarity with the protesters.

 “The sight of snarling dogs, and the possibility of dogs ripping flesh, was revolting to me,” Moore recollected.

 Moore sided with the protesters, but the story that accompanied his photos blamed extremists on both sides for the melee. “[The pictures] are frightening because of the brutal methods being used by white policemen in Birmingham, Ala. against Negro demonstrators. They are frightening because the Negro strategy of ‘nonviolent direct action’ invites that very brutality—and welcomes it as a way to promote the Negroes’ cause, which, under the law, is right,” Life told readers.

 CHAPTER 27

A DECADE OF DISCORD: THE CHALLENGE OF THE 1960S

 In his televised address to the nation Kennedy proposed a civil rights act that would outlaw racially segregated public facilities nationwide. The white supremacist response came immediately. The next day a Klansman shot and killed Medgar Evers, the head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Mississippi, as Evers stood in the driveway of his Jackson home. Evers’s killing was the first, but not the last, assassination of a major political figure of the 1960s.

 King Jr. speaks to a reporter while standing inside the Lincoln Memorial to underscore that 100 years after Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation blacks were still secondclass citizens in the segregated South.

 Birmingham had given the civil rights cause national and international visibility, and Evers’s shocking assassination reinforced Kennedy’s determination to enact a sweeping civil rights bill. Southern Democratic senators were equally prepared to filibuster to prevent its passage. Intent on winning this legislative battle, King and other civil rights leaders decided to organize the March on Washington, a massive demonstration in the nation’s capital that would demand passage of a federal civil rights act. Adopting the slogan, “Jobs and Freedom,” organizers underscored the link between greater economic opportunity and civic equality. The organizing committee included African American labor leader A. Philip Randolph, founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Randolph had cancelled his own March on Washington in 1941 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt agreed to guarantee fair protection at the workplace during World War II (see Chapter 23). On August 28, 1963, in the nation’s largest political protest to date, more

 than 200,000 marchers walked from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial to listen to three hours of music and speeches. This photo (27.7) of Martin Luther King Jr. talking to a reporter reveals why organizers put their speakers’ platform before the Lincoln Memorial. On the hundredth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, the larger-than-life statue of President Abraham Lincoln in the background offered a potent reminder of how long African Americans had waited for equal rights. “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character,” declared King in the day’s most memorable speech. The march received the national media’s full attention. It was also among the first events that television viewers throughout the world could watch live, thanks to a new communications satellite. From Cairo to Amsterdam people participated in sympathy marches before American embassies and sent petitions to Kennedy. By August nearly 78 percent of white Americans believed that images of racial discrimination in the United States made it harder for the nation to achieve its Cold War foreign policy goals. Two weeks after the March on Washington, a bomb tossed into Birmingham’s Sixteenth Street Baptist Church killed four girls attending Sunday school. Carolyn McKinstry, the young woman that Charles Moore had photographed during the Birmingham protests, was in the church at the time, a friend to the girls. The attack convinced her that she too would one day die at the hands of white supremacists. “I guess this bombing is Birmingham’s answer to the march,” exclaimed an enraged Anne Moody, who was working on a voter registration campaign in Mississippi. President

 Kennedy’s assassination two months later only underscored her growing conviction that “nonviolence is through.”

Freedom Summer
 With SCLC’s Birmingham campaign to desegregate public facilities successfully concluded, the spotlight turned to Mississippi. Freedom Summer, a multipronged attack on white supremacy in Mississippi during the summer of 1964, was a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement. It forced the federal government to deepen its commitment to equal rights, laid bare the rising tensions within the Civil Rights Movement, and trained a generation of student activists who would soon spearhead new leftist and feminist movements. In the summer of 1964, the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) coordinated the efforts of civil rights groups to launch Freedom Summer, including SNCC and CORE. With ambivalence SNCC recruited many Northern whites to work on the voter registration projects. SNCC had reluctantly concluded that the national media, which had started to ignore blacks-only protests, would pay attention to Freedom Summer only if white students

 were involved. SNCC, CORE, and COFO hoped that the media spotlight would protect Freedom Summer workers from racial violence, protection that the federal government was unwilling to give. This calculation proved incorrect. On the first day of Freedom Summer, three CORE workers went missing in Mississippi. Twenty-four-year-old Michael Schwerner was a white Jewish social worker from Manhattan who, one coworker recalled, “had been deeply affected by the photographs of Negroes sprawling under the dogs and fire hoses” in Birmingham. On June 21, 1964, Schwerner went with James Chaney, a 21-year-old Mississippi black activist,

 and 20-year-old Andrew Goodman, another white Jewish volunteer from New York, to inspect a church that the Ku Klux Klan had burned to stop CORE from opening a school there. On the return home they passed near Philadelphia, Mississippi, where local sheriff (and Klansman) Cecile Price recognized Schwerner’s car and license plate from a circular the governor’s office had issued concerning “outside agitators.” Price arrested them for speeding and then alerted fellow Klansmen to join him for an ambush after he released the three men from jail in the middle of the night. The trio’s disappearance created national headlines, forcing the FBI to launch a manhunt across five states to find them. The FBI posted this circular (27.8) seeking information about the men’s whereabouts, haunting images that conveyed more than the dangers of vigilante violence.

 CHAPTER 27

A DECADE OF DISCORD: THE CHALLENGE OF THE 1960S

 Putting her own grief aside, Schwerner’s wife Rita, herself a CORE field worker, publicly voiced her suspicion that “if Mr. Chaney, who is a native Mississippian, had been alone at the time of the disappearance, . . . this case, like so many others that have come before it, . . . would have gone completely unnoticed.” As if to prove her point, sailors sent to comb through Mississippi swamps for the bodies of the three men (now assumed to be dead) discovered the corpses of three lynched black men whose disappearances authorities had ignored. As the FBI investigation unfolded, Freedom Summer continued. Nearly 1,000 black and white activists fanned out throughout Mississippi to register blacks in rural areas. Hoping to recruit and train a new generation of student leaders, SNCC and COFO founded summer Freedom Schools. In these schools Freedom Summer volunteers taught high school students African American history to build pride in the long legacy of black accomplishment and gave remedial instruction in basic subjects to remedy their deficient public education. In a state with no mandatory school laws, black children often spent more time in the cotton fields than in the classroom. In the midst of Freedom Summer, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned segregation in businesses and places open to the public (such as restaurants and public schools) and prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race, religion, ethnicity, or sex. This landmark legislation, the most sweeping civil rights law since Reconstruction, came about because thousands of individuals risked arrest, murder, or unemployment to participate in boycotts, sit-ins, and street demonstrations in towns and cities throughout the South. Their activism went unnoticed in the national press, which focused mostly on a few dramatic moments such as the disappearance of Schwerner, Chaney, and Goodman. A month after the Civil Rights Act’s passage, after six weeks of searching, the FBI paid $30,000 to an informant who helped officers locate the three men’s bodies buried in an earthen dam. All three had been shot in the head, and Chaney’s shattered bones attested to the savage beating he had received. No one was ever convicted of the murders, although Price and nine others were found guilty on federal conspiracy charges in 1967 and served a few years in jail. Like Kennedy, Johnson knew that the world was watching events unfold in Mississippi. Passage of the

 Civil Rights Act was front-page news overseas, and world leaders rushed to congratulate Johnson. Winning the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, King was now an international figure who inspired social justice activists worldwide. Passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was a great victory for the Civil Rights Movement, but the combat-like conditions during Freedom Summer took their toll. Fearful SNCC volunteers began to arm themselves for self-defense. Many blacks resented the media attention given to white activists. Meanwhile female civil rights workers, black and white, objected to males’ expectations that they would clean and cook for them. The stage was set for a fracturing within the activist community.

Selma and the Voting
Rights Act of 1965
 The nonviolent Civil Rights Movement registered one more significant victory before that fracturing occurred, using a stand-off in Selma, Alabama, to secure President Johnson’s open support for federal legislation guaranteeing blacks the right to vote. On Sunday March 7, 1965, a day soon known as “Bloody Sunday,” about 600 marchers left the small town of Selma, Alabama, and began walking across the Edmund Pettis Bridge that spanned the Alabama River. They intended to march 50 miles to Montgomery, the state capitol, to demand voting rights. At the other end of the bridge, county troopers armed with clubs and tear gas waited for them. When the marchers knelt in prayer at the end of the bridge, Sheriff Jim Clark ordered the troopers to attack as white spectators cheered. Photographers and television crews witnessed the violent attack. That evening ABC interrupted the film Judgment at Nuremburg, a dramatized account of trials that convicted Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity, to show news footage of the Bloody Sunday assault. The juxtaposition between the film’s portrayal of the Holocaust and events in Selma haunted viewers. Late that evening the door opened to the chapel in Selma that served as the marchers’ headquarters. “We have seen on the television screen the violence that took place today, and we’re here to share it with you,” announced a group of blacks and whites from New Jersey who had chartered a plane to arrive that night.

 On Monday, March 15, 1965, President Johnson, who had spoken privately with King before Selma about how to win public support for voting rights legislation, announced in a televised address that he was sending a federal voting rights act to Congress. “It’s not just Negroes, but really it’s all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice,” Johnson told the nation. “And we shall overcome,” he concluded, quoting the anthem of the Civil Rights Movement. A triumphant march from Selma began the following Sunday, March 21, 1965. Along the way a group of men, women, whites, blacks, and veterans stopped to pray in front of a billboard claiming that King was a communist (27.9). Erected by the John Birch Society, the sign showed a photo of King attending a workshop at the Highlander Folk School for social activists, labeling it a “Communist Training School.” Like the

The marchers took advantage of every opportunity to enlist the sympathies of mainstream journalists like Haynes Johnson, the white reporter standing and taking notes who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Selma march. When the marchers arrived in Montgomery five days later, King addressed the crowd on the steps of the state capitol, looking down at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church where he had helped initiate the Montgomery Bus Boycott ten years earlier (see Chapter 25): “I know you are asking today, ‘How long will it take?’ ... How long? Not long, because no lie can live forever.” Five months later Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibited literacy tests and poll taxes and authorized the use of federal registrars to register voters if states failed to respect the Fifteenth Amendment. Within a year over 9,000 blacks had registered in Dallas County, Alabama, enough to block Jim Clark’s reelection as sheriff. 27.9 Prayer Vigil During the March from Selma to Montgomery, March 21, 1965 This image of peaceful protesters praying was meant to counter charges from ultraconservative groups that the civil rights movement was intentionally provoking violence to pave the way for a communist revolution.

 CHAPTER 27

A DECADE OF DISCORD: THE CHALLENGE OF THE 1960S

The Fractured Left
 Conservative Republicans and Democrats never liked the antipoverty initiatives of Kennedy and Johnson, while die-hard segregationists adamantly opposed the integrationist goals of nonviolent civil rights leaders like King. The most potent attacks on these progressive visions, however, came from the left where competing visions proliferated. By the mid-1960s, disaffected student activists increasingly dismissed the Great Society as too cautious and protested against “Johnson’s War” in Vietnam, while others renounced all ties to mainstream culture. Within the Civil Rights Movement, militancy replaced nonviolence as the dominant ethos. Meanwhile many white women left the Civil Rights Movement to pursue women’s liberation.

The New Left and the
Counterculture
 The baby boom generation came of age in the 1960s. By 1968, over half of the American population was under the age of 25. By then a core of white middleclass college students had created the New Left, a small, but highly visible, coalition of student-based organizations that attacked racial discrimination, poverty, and the war in Vietnam. Al Haber formed Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1960 at the University of Michigan, believing “that if any really radical liberal force is going to develop in America, it is going to come from the colleges and the young.” In 1962, Tom Hayden, a white activist in the Civil Rights Movement, penned the group’s manifesto, “The Port Huron Statement.” Hayden urged his peers to act, noting “we are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.” Although most college-age Americans did not attend university, their ranks were increasing. By 1965 nearly 6.5 million students attended colleges or universities, compared with 2.2 million in 1950. Strict rules governed student behavior. Students lived in single-sex dormitories, had to obey curfews each evening, and abide by dress codes that prohibited female students from wearing pants. The University of California, Berkeley, even forbade political debate or discussion on campus, a rule in place since the 1930s to prevent communist student groups from recruiting. For years students had used a small strip just outside the Berkeley campus main gate to hand out political pamphlets or give speeches. In the fall of 1964, the university administration shut this down as well, provoking the Free Speech Movement, a mass student protest that accused the University of California

 of denying students the right to freedom of speech. Protest leader Mario Savio, who had just returned from Freedom Summer, pointed out that “the two battlefields [in Mississippi and Berkeley] may seem quite different to some observers, but this is not the case. The same rights are at stake in both places—the right to participate as citizens in a democratic society.” Aided by sympathetic television coverage, the Free Speech Movement succeeded after four months of demonstrations and inspired left-leaning students on other university campuses. Most college students never joined any organized protests, but in response to those who did, universities eliminated codes of conduct, introduced more elective courses into curriculums, and established black and women’s studies. After 1964, SDS chapters organized antiwar demonstrations on university campuses that included teach-ins and draft-card burnings (see Chapter 26). SDS at first embraced the liberal vision of using representative government to implement incremental reforms, but in the course of its antiwar protests the group became more radical. By 1968, New Left leaders expressed open admiration for Marxist-inspired communist revolutionaries like the Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh and Ernesto “Che” Guevara, a colleague of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro trying to foster revolution in Bolivia and the Congo. When student-led protests roiled Europe and South America in 1968, the American New Left assumed they were part of a global youth rebellion that would reshape the world. Once the novelty of student demonstrations wore off, getting television reporters to cover their protests required more outlandish theatrics, images that increasingly radicalized student leaders eagerly provided. Press scrutiny sometimes backfired, however. Nightly news reports of demonstrators hurling bricks and expletives frightened

 moderates, who viewed the New Left as unpatriotic and dangerous. The challenge to the liberal vision went beyond the New Left. An emerging counterculture, the heir to the Beat cultural ethos of the 1950s (see Chapter 25), emphasized rejecting middle-class lifestyles more than agitating for political change. Hippies, youthful social rebels who renounced material acquisition and used drugs to explore their inner spiritual selves, refused to dedicate their lives to acquiring the same suburban home, car, and corporate job as their parents. The hippie utopian vision embraced peace, pleasure, sexual liberation, and sharing of material resources, an ethos captured in this 1968 photograph (27.10) of a hippie gathering by Robert Altman (who became a renowned filmmaker). Drugs, especially marijuana and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), formed an essential part of the counterculture’s challenge to the values of middleclass society. Rock music exposed many young people to these counterculture ideals. Bob Dylan, a folk troubadour whose songs had inspired civil rights protesters, transformed himself into a rock musician with poetic lyrics steeped in drug references. The Beatles underwent a similar transformation after taking America by storm. Nearly 60 percent of the nation watched the four mop-headed British musicians sing their masterful pop concoctions during the band’s first televised performance on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. In just three years the group

 underwent a complete makeover with the release of an album, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, that broadcasted the counterculture message, “I’d love to turn you on”—a reference to taking drugs and having sex. The heyday of the marriage between rock music and the counterculture was Woodstock, a free three-day drug-infused music festival held on a farm in upstate New York, in August 1969. New Left and young civil rights activists adopted a hippie-style of dress and experimented with drugs, but unlike hippies they remained dedicated to political activism. Most black civil rights activists, rather than rejecting white middle-class materialism, were fighting for their fair share of the nation’s wealth and prosperity. New Left radicals shared the hippie belief that acquisitive capitalism bred inequality and injustice, but they were committed to social action, not “tuning out.” Out of the spotlight conservative college students were also active, laying the foundation for the coming conservative resurgence within a Republican Party dominated by moderates. College students formed the Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) in 1960 under the guidance of National Review founder William F. Buckley. Throughout the 1960s the Radical Right YAF attracted more members than the New Left SDS. Goldwater supporters in 1964, these conservative students championed limited economic regulation, states’ rights, respect for law and order, and staunch anticommunism. For the time being, however, the New Left had center stage.

Malcolm X: An Alternative
 to Nonviolence

27.11 Malcolm
X
Snaps a Photo  of Muhammad Ali, 1964. This meeting between two mid1960s icons of black manhood came just after Ali won the heavyweight boxing title. Both Black Muslims, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali enjoyed keeping whites on edge with militant rhetoric that emphasized black pride and physical prowess.

 The New Left and counterculture did not speak with one voice, and by the mid-1960s fractures within the Civil Rights Movement were also apparent. The Nation of Islam, an African American religious sect founded in the 1930s, rejected integration as the path to salvation for the black community and instead wanted to establish a separate black nation within the United States. Followers of Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad prayed to Mecca five times a day, dressed modestly, and avoided pork and alcohol. The Nation of Islam departed from mainstream Islamic practices, however, by viewing whites as “blue-eyed devils” whom Allah would condemn to eternal damnation on a forthcoming Day of Judgment. The celebrated African American writer James Baldwin understood the appeal of Elijah Muhammad’s prophecies, even though he rejected them. “The white God has not delivered them, perhaps the black God will,” wrote Baldwin in The Fire Next Time (1963) to explain the Nation of Islam’s growing popularity within Northern urban neighborhoods. Malcolm X moved armed self-defense and black separatism from the fringes to the center of the civil rights debate. A magnetic speaker, he had converted to Islam while serving a six-year stint in prison. After his release he changed his name from Malcolm Little to Malcolm X, the X signifying the lost name of his African ancestors.

 Why did Northern blacks find Malcolm X’s vision appealing?

 “I don’t see any American dream; I see an American nightmare.” MALCOLM X, ridiculing King’s “I Have a Dream Speech” during the 1963 March on Washington Even during the heyday of nonviolence in the 1950s and early 1960s, more militant voices within the black community championed a competing vision of self-defense and racial pride that extended back to Marcus Garvey (see Chapter 21). Malcolm X ridiculed the nonviolent strategy of the Christianled SCLC. “If someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery,” he proclaimed in 1963. He received an increasingly sympathetic hearing among Northern blacks who could already vote and sit alongside whites at lunch counters but encountered racial prejudice that relegated them to segregated ghettos, limited their employment opportunities, and subjected them to police harassment. Malcolm X linked the domestic black struggle for civil rights to the anti-colonial movements underway in Africa and Asia, underscoring that the American Civil Rights Movement was one of many liberation movements being waged worldwide, including a campaign to end apartheid (rigid racial segregation) in South Africa. Malcolm X’s rhetorical links with Africa resonated among northern blacks, who adopted African clothing, hairstyles, and music. Many jettisoned the old label “Negro” in favor of “black” to reflect their growing color consciousness and racial pride. This photo (27.11) of Malcolm X smiling as he photographs boxer Muhammad Ali in a Miami restaurant after Ali won the heavyweight championship in 1964 conveys the charisma that each man radiated, and the Watch the Video Malcolm X

 strong bonds they maintained to the black urban community. Ali, who called himself “the greatest,” gained fame not just for his athletic feats but, like Malcolm X, also for his defiance of authority. The day after this photo was taken, he announced his conversion to the Nation of Islam, changing his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali. His mentor Malcolm X applauded Ali’s announcement, knowing that the magnetic boxer would help attract other converts. By the time Malcolm X’s ideas began to gain widespread currency among disaffected blacks, however, his own philosophies were starting to shift. Viewing the increasingly powerful Malcolm X as a potential rival, Elijah Muhammad had silenced Malcolm X a few months before this photo was taken. Malcolm X’s transgression was calling the assassination of President Kennedy “a case of ‘the chickens coming home to roost’” because whites were finally experiencing the vigilante violence that had terrorized blacks for decades. Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam soon afterward, and Ali severed all ties with him. In 1964 Malcolm X made a pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam’s holiest city, in Saudi Arabia, where he saw pilgrims “of all colors” coming together to worship. This trip gave him new faith in the possibility of interracial cooperation. His more moderate stance did little to mollify his Nation of Islam critics. On February 21, 1965, as he stood to address a gathering in Harlem, three Nation of Islam members shot him dead.

Watts and Chicago
 Malcolm X did not live to help heal the fractures that divided the Civil Rights Movement. In the mid-1960s, tensions among activists led to an overt split between those who continued to advocate non-violence and integration and those who assumed a more militant, nationalistic approach. Stalwart civil rights veterans like John Lewis and Martin Luther King Jr. never stopped advocating their vision of nonviolent collective action. But after 1965, the vision of armed self-defense won many adherents. When riots and demonstrations in Northern cities moved the civil rights struggle to their own backyards, the limits of Northern whites’ support for the goal of racial equality became evident. August 6, 1965, the day that President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, represented the high-water mark of the nonviolent Civil Rights Movement. Five days later, with activists

 still basking in the afterglow of this achievement, riots erupted in Watts, a Los Angeles black ghetto rife with high unemployment, poor schools, and drug use. The routine arrest of a black man for drunk driving, which residents viewed as yet another example of the police harassment that plagued them daily, sparked the uprising. Watts burned for six days before 16,000 national guardsmen managed to stop the violence. The Watts riot left 34 dead and destroyed $35 million in property, including many businesses and homes owned by blacks. Watts changed the image of African American protest in the white imagination from a portrait of nonviolent demonstrators kneeling in prayer before their attackers to one of lawless mobs shouting “Burn, baby, burn.” The same cameras that helped awaken the liberal and moderate white consciousness now stoked white fears about unchecked black violence. The press ignored residents’ complaints about police harassment and instead portrayed Los Angeles police and firemen (27.12) as heroes who struggled to prevent black rioters from destroying their own community. Watts was the prelude to four long, hot summers of racial rioting that rocked cities throughout the nation from 1965–1968.

A DECADE OF DISCORD: THE CHALLENGE OF THE 1960S

 King rushed to Watts intent on teaching residents to employ nonviolent means to express their grievances. Instead, it was King who came away with a valuable lesson. When he toured the smoldering ruins, a crowd of black youths shouted “We won!” “How can you say you won when 34 Negroes are dead, your community is destroyed and whites are using the riot as an excuse for inaction?” King asked. Their reply taught him the extent of despair among Northern blacks: “We won because we made them pay attention to us.” The Watts riots convinced King to move aggressively to end economic inequality nationwide now that battles against legalized segregation and disenfranchisement were won. But the SCLC’s 1966 Chicago campaign dramatically demonstrated the limits of moderate Northern whites’ support for racial equality. When protesters marched through all-white neighborhoods to protest racial discrimination in renting and selling houses, white crowds pelted them with bottles and rocks, which some marchers threw back. “I have never seen—even in Mississippi and Alabama—mobs as hostile and hate-filled as I’ve seen in Chicago,” King noted with dismay. After King’s death in 1968, President Johnson successfully lobbied Congress to pass the Fair Housing Act that prohibited discrimination in selling, renting, or financing housing as a memorial to the slain leader.

Black Power
 and the Black Panthers The “black power” slogan emerged during James Meredith’s 1966 “March against Fear” in Mississippi. Meredith had faced down hostile crowds in 1962 when he became the first black student to graduate from the University of Mississippi. Four years later he decided to march 220 miles by himself from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi, hoping that his courage would inspire blacks to register to vote. On the second day of his march, a

 sniper waiting in the bushes wounded Meredith. When activists flocked to continue his march, SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael told participants “we been saying freedom for six years, and we ain’t got nothing. What we gonna start saying now is black power.” Black Power, however, soon became a slippery term that people employed in different ways. Competing Visions: Defining “Black Power” explores how black leaders with different ideologies embraced competing definitions of Black Power. In 1966, Black Power militants came to the forefront of traditionally nonviolent civil rights organizations like SNCC, which expelled whites to foster black community leadership. That same year Bobby Seale and Huey Newton founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense in Oakland, California. The Black Panthers were a militant civil rights group dedicated to armed self-defense, racial pride, and inner-city renewal. To project an image of strength that would appeal to inner-city youth, the Black Panthers wore commando-style attire including black leather jackets, black pants, black berets, and dark sunglasses, items already fashionable among young black men. The 1967 photo (27.13) that became the emblem of the Black Panther Movement depicted Newton sitting in a throne-like wicker chair surrounded by a zebra rug and warrior shields, symbols of a racial identity rooted in African culture. Wearing Western military-style clothing and holding a rifle in his right hand and a spear in his left, Newton stared into the camera with the steely resolve of a revolutionary. The paramilitary group initiated community projects including free breakfasts for school children and health clinics, but the

Competing Visions
DEFINING “BLACK POWER”
The image of a raised, clenched black fist became the most enduring symbol of “Black Power,” but it only represented one view of the slogan’s meaning. In the following excerpts civil rights leaders debate the meaning and implications of Black Power. Malcolm X never used the term directly, but his separatist message laid the groundwork for Black Power nationalism later in the decade. In contrast Martin Luther King Jr. advocated using nonviolent methods to empower the black community. Political scientist Charles Hamilton notes the various interpretations given to the “Black Power” slogan and embraces one that emphasizes pride in being black. Is there any agreement among these competing definitions? How does this debate compare to the one between Marcus Garvey and W. E. B. DuBois in the 1920s (see Competing Visions, Chapter 21)? The revolutionary, nationalist rhetoric in Malcolm X’s fiery 1963 “Message to the Grassroots” greatly influenced later advocates of Black Power. There’s no such thing as a nonviolent revolution. The only kind of revolution that is nonviolent is the Negro revolution. The only revolution in which the goal is loving your enemy is the Negro revolution. It’s the only revolution in which the goal is a desegregated lunch counter, a desegregated theater, a desegregated park, and a desegregated public toilet; you can sit down next to white folks—on the toilet. That’s no revolution. Revolution is based on land. Land is the basis of all independence. Land is the basis of freedom, justice, and equality … Whoever heard of a revolution where they lock arms … singing “We Shall Overcome”? You don’t do that in a revolution. You don’t do any singing, you’re too busy swinging. 
 In a “Conversation with Martin Luther King,” March 25, 1968, King offered a definition of Black Power that supported his strategy of nonviolence. We have always stood up against injustices. We have done it militantly. Now, so often the word ‘militant’ is misunderstood because most people think of militancy in military terms. But, to be militant merely means to be demanding and to be persistent, and in this sense I think the non-violent movement has demonstrated great militancy. It is possible to be militantly nonviolent. … I haven’t advocated violence, because I do not see it as the answer to the problem. I do not see it as the answer from a moral point of view and I do not see it as the answer from a practical point of view.… Let me briefly outline the positives [of Black Power]. First, Black Power in the positive sense is a psychological call to manhood. This is desperately needed in the black community, because for all too many years black people

Black Power


 have been ashamed of themselves.… Secondly, Black Power is pooling black political resources in order to achieve our legitimate goals.… Thirdly, Black Power in its positive sense is a pooling of black economic resources in order to achieve legitimate power.… Withdrawing economic support from those who will not be just and fair in their dealings is a very potent weapon.

 Writing to white America in The New York Times Magazine in 1968, Charles Hamilton outlined competing views of Black Power and stressed the importance of maintaining black racial identity. Black Power has many definitions and connotations in the rhetoric of race relations today. To some people, it is synonymous with premeditated acts of violence to destroy the political and economic institutions of this country. Others equate Black Power with plans to rid the civil rights movements of whites who have been in it for years. The concept is understood by many to mean hatred of and separation from whites; it is associated with calling whites ‘honkies’ and with shouts of ‘Burn, baby, burn!’ Some understand it to be the use of pressure-group tactics in the accepted tradition of the American political process. And still others say that Black Power must be seen first of all as an attempt to instill a sense of identity and pride in black people.… Black Power rejects the lessons of slavery and segregation that caused black people to look upon themselves with hatred and disdain. To be ‘integrated’ it was necessary to deny one’s heritage, one’s own culture, to be ashamed of one’s black skin, thick lips and kinky hair. … The black man must change his demeaning conception of himself; he must develop a sense of pride and self-respect. Then, if integration comes, it will deal with people who are psychologically and mentally healthy, with people who have a sense of their history and of themselves as whole human beings …

 Why do all three writers emphasize racial pride and manhood?

 press only saw their rifles. The Black Panthers organized paramilitary patrols that openly carried weapons (then legal under California law) and, Newton explained, “stopped whenever we saw the police questioning a brother or a sister” to ensure that no beatings or abuse occurred. In May, 1967, 30 armed Black Panthers filed onto the floor of the California State Assembly in Sacramento to protest the imminent passage of a law banning the open display of weapons, a bill meant to shut down the Black Panther street patrols. As security forces disarmed them, Bobby Seale called on “black communities of America to rise up as one man.” By October, 1967, Newton was under arrest, wounded by police during a shoot-out and accused of killing a white policeman who died in the melee. FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover viewed the Panthers as “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country” and used spies to plan raids on Panther offices and create rifts within the group to weaken the Panthers internally. When the courts overturned Newton’s conviction in 1970, he emerged from jail to find the Black Panthers in shambles.

 The Women’s Liberation Movement Another fracture within the Civil Rights Movement, this one between men and women, energized the modern women’s movement. When young white female activists began leaving the Civil Rights Movement to join the women’s movement, they joined a crusade already well underway. Feminists did not speak with one voice, but instead offered competing visions of how to empower women. Helen Gurley Brown and Betty Friedan each wrote bestsellers that helped re-ignite the women’s movement, which had faltered since the 1920s. Marriage was overrated, Brown asserted in Sex and the Single Girl, a 1962 advice book counseling young, single women to explore their sexuality while they

 had the chance. By using their sex appeal intelligently, young women could thrive despite earning less than men and having fewer career opportunities. Brown’s prescription was: find a job you liked, flirt to get special treatment, have your dates pay for everything, and wait to get married until your looks start to deteriorate. Friedan also challenged the accepted notion that women should focus solely on homemaking and child-rearing. Men were free to make careers, enjoy hobbies, and engage in politics, Friedan noted in her 1963 treatise The Feminine Mystique. By contrast, women “never had a chance to be anything else” than a “housewife-mother.” As they shopped for groceries, made beds, and drove their children to afterschool activities, many wondered, “Is this all?” Unlike Brown, Friedan did not believe that sex could fill the void, nor did she urge women to avoid marriage or having children. Instead she believed that women should be able to engage in the full range of meaningful activities available to men. Her analysis resonated strongly among white middleclass women who felt imprisoned within their suburban lives. Brown continued to promote her philosophy of “empowerment through sexuality” in Cosmopolitan, a provocative women’s magazine that she launched in 1965. Friedan took a different path, joining the political activists frustrated with the government’s failure to fully enforce the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred discrimination in employment on the basis of race, religion, ethnicity, or sex. The new Equal Employment Opportunity Commission took complaints of racial discrimination seriously, but ignored charges of sexual discrimination. “Men are entitled to female secretaries,” the Commission chairman glibly remarked. In 1966, Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women (NOW) to secure equal rights for women in employment, education, and politics—traditionally, male domains. NOW also wanted to give women control over their own bodies through unfettered access to contraception and legal abortions. A relatively small organization with only 5,000 members in the late 1960s, NOW nonetheless convinced President Johnson to issue an executive order that required government agencies and federal contractors to create affirmative action programs to hire and promote women and minority men. NOW also persuaded airlines to stop employing only attractive single women under age 32 as flight attendants.

THE FRACTURED LEFT

 The women’s movement grew as younger female activists, unhappy with gender discrimination within the Civil Rights Movement and New Left, took up the cause of female liberation. Collegeage women had participated enthusiastically in Freedom Summer by teaching in the Freedom Schools and registering blacks to vote. Women, however, also performed virtually all the clerical chores and housework for SNCC, and this gendered allocation of work provoked complaints. At the height of Freedom Summer, black female SNCC workers staged a sit-in at a SNCC office in Atlanta to protest gender discrimination within the Civil Rights Movement. The “assumptions of male superiority are as … crippling to the woman as the assumptions of white supremacy are to the Negro,” asserted white activists Mary King and Casey Hayden. Few males took these complaints seriously. “What is the position of women in SNCC?” joked Stokely Carmichael while relaxing with staffers one evening. “The position of women in SNCC is prone!” The punch line won Carmichael appreciative laughter from his male colleagues, but this oft-repeated story hastened the departure of white female activists. Women in the New Left experiencing similar problems with gender discrimination within SDS also redirected their energies to the women’s movement. Black women were more reluctant to abandon the Civil Rights Movement. In their view racial oppression affected them more severely than sexual discrimination. The feminists who founded NOW lobbied for legislative solutions to women’s problems. In contrast, more radicalized feminists, steeped in New Left ideology and nonviolent tactics, adopted a grassroots approach that used consciousness-raising—heightening awareness of social and political issues—to help women “understand the universality of our oppression.” They emphasized changing attitudes rather than lobbying for legislative changes. To combat the ways that sexism pervaded normal social

 interactions, feminists introduced the word “Ms.” into the American lexicon to replace “Miss” or “Mrs.,” titles that linked a woman’s identity to her marital status. When Robin Morgan brought busloads of women to Atlantic City to protest the annual Miss America pageant in 1968, she sought maximum media coverage. Demonstrators carried the photograph (27.14) of an attractive, naked young woman with lines dividing her body like cuts of beef to protest how beauty pageants dehumanized women. “Welcome to the Miss America Cattle Auction,” they chanted while filling a trash can with bras, high heeled shoes, fashion magazines, and copies of Playboy, items they believed reinforced “the Mindless Sex Object Image” of women. In deference to a local ordinance, the protesters never set the trash can on fire, but from this point onward detractors dismissed feminists as “bra-burners.” Despite their different styles and messages, both moderate and radical feminists had trouble expanding their support beyond the white middle class. “If your husband is a factory worker or a tugboat operator, you don’t want his job,” noted Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Mikulski to explain why NOW’s emphasis on equality in employment failed to resonate among working-class women.

 CHAPTER 27

A DECADE OF DISCORD: THE CHALLENGE OF THE 1960S

The End of an Era
 As the Civil Rights Movement unraveled, the Great Society also floundered. Republicans widened their appeal by promising to end the cultural strife that was tearing the nation apart. Although most liberal and radical causes lost energy after 1968, Chicano and Native American activists helped keep the protest tradition alive as the decade ended.

The Faltering Civil
Rights Movement
 Embittered by years of violent attacks in the South, young activists either left the movement altogether or migrated to more militant organizations. By 1967, King’s weakening leadership reflected a movement adrift. When King attacked the Vietnam War, he strained his relationship with President Johnson, losing a valuable ally in the White House. King’s call for a complete restructuring of American capitalism to eliminate poverty also cost him the support of moderate blacks and whites. In fall 1967, after a summer of deadly race riots in Detroit and Newark, King proposed setting up a poor people’s encampment in front of the White House. When the Poor People’s Campaign stalled, King made a quick trip to Memphis to support a garbage men’s strike.

 On April 4, 1968, a sniper’s bullet tore through the knot in King’s necktie and fatally wounded him as he leaned over the balcony of his Memphis motel. Within hours Life photographer Steve Schapiro entered King’s motel room and snapped a haunting photograph of King’s open suitcase containing a copy of his book Strength to Love, a wrinkled shirt, and the remnants of a meal (27.15). “The half-drunk cup of coffee gave me a moment of pause,” Schapiro noted. “He had left his room planning to return.” King’s portrait appeared on the motel television during a newscast reporting his death to complete this eerie scene. The three-week urban rampage in 100 cities across the nation that followed King’s murder further alienated the white community, which increasingly supported using troops to restore “law and order.” Two months later a white man, James Earl Ray, admitted to killing King, a confession he later retracted.

The Great Society Unravels
 Diminishing sympathy for the Civil Rights Movement also meant less support for Great Society programs directed at the urban poor. Congress had written much of the legislation quickly, but the public had no patience to wait for the Great Society to work through its growing pains. Critics from the left and right continued their attacks. The New Left advocated redistributing corporate profits more equitably throughout society. The Radical Right denounced the Great Society as a “hodgepodge” of programs that humiliated the poor and encouraged dependency on government welfare. Ethnic working-class 27.15 King’s Room in the Lorraine Motel, April 4, 1968 King stepped out of this motel room to chat briefly with friends over the balcony and never returned. The television above King’s suitcase announces his death to an empty room. The former motel is now a civil rights museum, where this room is preserved in its original state.

 Why was King’s death a serious blow to the Civil Rights Movement?

THE END OF AN ERA

 whites and left-leaning suburbanites, groups that had traditionally supported the Democratic liberal agenda, began to resent federal programs that they felt helped primarily blacks and other minorities. The shift among the white working class had political significance. In 1964, nearly 60 percent had voted for the Democratic ticket; four years later only 35 percent did. The Great Society’s troubles reflected more than persistent racism, however. Johnson’s unwillingness to raise taxes to pay for an exploding array of domestic programs and the war in Vietnam also contributed to its undoing. As the economy overheated interest rates doubled, the national debt exploded, and inflation caused prices to rise faster than wages. This sudden decline in the standard of living after decades of prosperity dismayed Americans. This 1967 Herblock political cartoon ( 27.16) illustrated Johnson’s dilemma in trying to fund both the Vietnam War and the Great Society. In the drawing Johnson prepares for an evening out with his mistress, a robust and expensively attired woman wearing a mink stole emblazoned with the words “Vietnam War.” As they leave he tries to assure the other woman in his life, a thin homemaker wearing a tattered apron labeled “U.S. Urban Needs,” that “There’s Money Enough to Support Both of You—Now, Doesn’t That Make You Feel Better?” As this cartoon suggested, the administration was neglecting its domestic programs and giving the war the bulk of its attention and funds. In 1968, Johnson agreed to raise taxes to finance the expanded war in Vietnam, but Southern conservative congressmen refused to vote for the measure until the president cut funding for his domestic programs. The Democratic Convention in 1968 pulled together these strands of disenchantment with liberal politics. With Vice President Hubert Humphrey on track to secure the nomination, ten thousand antiwar activists led by New Left leader Tom Hayden protested outside the Chicago Convention Center to support the antiwar candidate Eugene McCarthy. Yippies, a New Left splinter group that stood for blending “pot and politics,” joined the protest. As Democratic delegates debated the administration’s Vietnam policy inside the convention hall, the police attacked the demonstrators outside. Televised images of longhaired, pot-smoking protesters who waved North Vietnamese flags and threw excrement swayed

 public opinion more than news reports of police brutality. Over 70 percent of adults supported the police crackdown. Critics of liberalism found the public suddenly much more receptive to their competing political vision. Richard Nixon won the presidency in 1968 promising to restore “law and order,” a Republican catch-phrase that fueled the political shift underway in many traditionally Democratic blue-collar and suburban neighborhoods. With grassroots conservatism on the rise, the liberal vision appealed to fewer Americans by 1970. A rare moment of national celebration occurred on July 20, 1969 when astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. Watching the event on their television sets, Americans heard Armstrong declare “that’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind” as he began to stride across the moon’s surface. Announcing the U.S. space race victory over the Soviet Union to the world, astronaut Buzz Aldrin

 derarm deodorant. Worried that the counterculture had made addictive drugs such as heroin popular among the young, states passed stringent anti-drug laws. At the federal level, in 1972, President Nixon announced a “war on drugs” to disrupt the illicit drug trade. The quick commercialization of the counterculture also hastened its demise as a potent alternative social vision. Modes of hippie dress, slang, and values (albeit in diluted form) swept into the mainstream. Granola appeared on supermarket shelves, and middle-aged men grew their hair long. Affluent and educated adults increasingly smoked marijuana and listened to rock music. More sexually explicit movies and highly profitable rock record sales fueled rather than undermined acquisitive capitalism.

 planted an American flag (27.17) near manmade footprints that would permanently mark the moon’s surface. This iconic photo of the United States conquering the moon bolstered many citizens’ faith in the superiority of the American way of life, giving them another reason to reject the New Left and counterculture critique of American culture.

The Demise of the
Counterculture
 As with the Civil Rights Movement and the Great Society, the hippie counterculture also unraveled. Media coverage drew large crowds to the 1967 “Summer of Love” in San Francisco’s HaightAshbury neighborhood, a hippie gathering dedicated to free food, drugs, sex, and music. In the fall hippie stalwarts organized a mock “Death of Hippie: Son of Media” funeral procession, blaming the over-hyped media image of the free-loving hippie for the drug-related violence and epidemic of rapes that now beset Haight-Ashbury. They then departed en masse, moving the foci of hippie culture to rural communes away from the media glare, where some kept the hippie utopian ideal alive. Ronald Reagan, the Republican Governor of California, echoed the views of mainstream America in 1969 when he characterized a hippie as someone who “dresses like Tarzan, has hair like Jane, and smells like Cheetah,” a reference to the counterculture’s embrace of public nudity, long hair, and disdain for un-

 How did media exposure affect the counterculture?

Keeping Protest Alive:
Mexican Americans and
Native Americans
 The declining fortunes of the Civil Rights Movement and the counterculture did not mean the end of all campaigns for social justice in the late 1960s. Mexican American and Native American activists drew inspiration from the African American struggle and launched their own highly visible, if short-lived, crusades to end ethnic discrimination. Ultimately, however, factionalism and police harassment also hurt these crusades. In the 1960s, the life expectancy for Mexican American migrant workers hovered around age 50, while their infant mortality rate was double the national average. The short-handed hoe represented the nearly complete exploitation of California migrant workers. “The short one” forced workers to bend all day (27.18) as they worked in the fields, often causing crippling back pain that sidelined workers who could not afford health care. California regulators finally banned the tool in 1975. Rallying Mexican Americans around the slogan Si Se Puede (“Yes, it can be done”), César Chávez, head of the United Farm Workers union, used strikes and marches to secure better working and living conditions. Chávez also appealed directly to consumers, convincing 17 million Americans to stop buying nonunionpicked grapes. These tactics provoked a backlash in some quarters. One Safeway grocery store manager reported antiunion customers loading up “their car with grapes and nothing else.” By

THE END OF AN ERA

 1970, however, the economic toll of the boycott forced growers to recognize the United Farm Workers and raise wages. Latino urban radicals in Texas, California, and Colorado embraced a competing vision called La Raza (The Race) that emphasized racial identity over union organizing. The Brown Berets modeled themselves after the Black Panthers and proudly called themselves “Chicanos,” embracing their Mexican American heritage while demanding an end to Anglo-American discrimination. In March 1968, 10,000 high school students in East Los Angeles staged a “blow-out” by walking out of their classrooms to protest the poor education they received in their mostly Hispanic schools. By this point most white Americans had little tolerance for radical political protest and overwhelmingly supported the police for shutting the demonstrations down. Internal divisions within the Mexican American community over the wisdom of mass demonstrations and steady harassment from the police hastened the demise of the Chicano student movement. Native American activists also drew inspiration from the integrationist vision that championed equality and the competing militant one that emphasized racial identity. After encouraging Indians to move off their reservations in the 1950s, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) began terminating the rights of some Indian tribes to federal protection. Ending their dependence on the BIA to run schools, manage their lands, and provide health care, the agency argued, would encourage Indians to assimilate into mainstream culture more quickly. Indian activists wanted the federal government to continue its financial assistance, while also allowing more self-government on reservations. On November 20, 1969, a group calling themselves “Indians of All Tribes” took over the abandoned federal prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. The Indian activists issued the sardonic Alcatraz Proclamation

 that offered to purchase the island for $24 in glass beads and red cloth, the same amount that the Dutch had paid indigenous people for Manhattan Island in 1626. The proclamation described Alcatraz as the perfect site for an Indian reservation because it lacked running water, sanitation, schools, mineral resources, and productive soil, plus “the population has always been held as prisoner and kept dependent upon others.” Eventually the cold and isolation took its toll, and the protest ended in June 1971. Native Americans staged nearly 70 other occupations throughout the nation, including the American Indian Movement’s armed takeover of the village of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973, the site of the army’s massacre of 300 Sioux in 1890. These highly visible protests prompted Nixon to increase funds for social services on Indian reservations and establish the Office of Indian Water Rights. In the early 1970s, the federal government ended the policy of termination, and Congress increased Indian selfrule on the reservations. Indian tribes also began successfully suing the government for past treaty violations. But government harassment, part of a general crackdown on revolutionary political movements in the early seventies, eviscerated radical Indian groups.

 The vision of the United States as a great and powerful nation suddenly seemed less assured in the 1970s. In 1973, a dispute between the U.S. and Arab nations led to an embargo that severely restricted oil imports. Gas stations across the nation posted signs like this one as they ran out of gas, dotting the American landscape with humiliating reminders that foreign nations could wreak havoc on the U.S. economy. Gas shortages also threatened the vision of America as a prosperous car culture, where it was the birthright of every citizen to work, live, and shop wherever they liked thanks to the freedom of movement that automobiles provided. To many Americans closed gas stations (which reappeared in 1979) were just one sign of a nation adrift. Domestic political scandals, a troubled economy, and lost international prestige made the future look dim. Americans lost confidence in the federal government in the 1970s as the Watergate scandal and cover-up brought down President Richard Nixon, and the post-World War II boom times finally ended, leaving high inflation and unemployment. Economic woes and troubles abroad hampered the efforts of presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter to restore respect for the presidency. Americans did not agree over how to move the nation back onto the path of glory. Feminists and gays fought to extend the social justice campaigns of the 1960s, while the environmental movement focused America’s attention on conserving its natural heritage. A new and powerful conservative coalition, however, formed around a competing vision that focused on protecting traditional values, limiting the role of the government in the economy, and flexing the nation’s power overseas. In the 1980s, after two decades of grassroots activism, the conservative ascendancy was complete. When Ronald Reagan, a committed conservative, became president in 1981, he refused to accept that America had entered an age of limits. Reagan rejected the liberal vision and diagnosed government as part of the problem, not the solution to the nation’s economic woes. He also moved aggressively to restore America’s image as a world power. An immensely popular president, Reagan restored the nation’s confidence in the economy and the presidency, despite suffering political scandals of his own.

Downturn and Scandal
 Americans enjoyed unprecedented prosperity in the 1950s and 1960s, and few expected the bubble to burst. By the 1970s, however, periodic recessions returned, a shocking development for a nation that had grown accustomed to a steadily improving standard of living. The political repercussions were significant. Still reeling from the cultural and civil rights upheavals of the 1960s, the nation’s new economic problems exacerbated the feeling that the country was adrift. The economic downturn, partly caused by turmoil overseas, coincided with a decade-long crisis of presidential leadership that began when political scandal enveloped the Nixon White House.

An Ailing Economy
 An ailing economy created the sense of a nation adrift by the 1970s. In the 1960s Lyndon Johnson had tried to pay for both the Vietnam War (see Chapter 26) and the Great Society programs (see Chapter 27) without raising taxes. Heavy governmental spending created both a ballooning federal deficit and, by pumping so much cash into the economy, inflation. The end of the Vietnam War added rising unemployment to the list of economic woes. Returning veterans entered a job market hit hard by the cancellation of government defense contracts that triggered massive layoffs in the industrial sector. Energy costs were also rising. Americans were six percent of the world’s population, but consumed nearly 40 percent of global energy resources. Due to increased U.S. reliance on Middle Eastern oil, the unending strife in the region affected the daily lives of Americans. The United States had offered Israel strong financial and moral support ever since the United Nations created a homeland for the Jewish people in 1947 by partitioning Palestine into Jewish and Palestinian areas. Israel claimed territory in Palestine as its ancestral land, a view supported by the United States, which also believed that the world owed the Jewish people reparation for the horrors of the Holocaust. To Arab nations, however, the arrival of Jewish immigrants perpetuated the history of hated Western colonization in the Middle East. Wars between neighboring Arab nations and Israel ensued (detailed on 28.1), and disputes over the fate of Palestinian refugees and Israeli land seizures continue to roil the region to this day.

 How did domestic energy needs affect U.S. foreign policy?

 Richard Nixon and subsequent presidents faced a thorny foreign policy dilemma in the Middle East. The U.S. government steadfastly supported Israel’s right to exist, but given America’s growing dependence on Middle Eastern oil, it could not afford to alienate oil-producing Arab nations. The Soviet push to form strong alliances in the Middle East also threatened to turn the oil-rich region into the new Cold War battlefield. In 1973, Egypt and Syria (both armed with Soviet-provided weapons) attacked Israel on Yom Kippur (Judaism’s holiest day) to regain territory lost to Israel in 1967. Nixon’s decision to send military aid to Israel enraged the Arab world. In retaliation the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), an international consortium of oil-producing nations that regulates the price and quantity of oil sold on the world market, announced an oil embargo of the United States. By this point the United States depended on the Middle East for 12 percent of the oil it consumed. The embargo lasted five months, enough time to ravage the American economy. OPEC finally lifted the embargo after Nixon persuaded Israel to withdraw from parts of Egyptian and Syrian territory seized during the Yom Kippur War. In 1974, the nation entered its worst recession since the Great Depression. In typical periods of recession and depression, high unemployment went hand in hand with declining prices and wages. In the 1930s, pumping more federal money into the economy through the New Deal did not end the Depression, but it eased unemployment and stabilized prices, so farmers and businessmen could make a profit.

28.2 Inflation and
Unemployment,
1960–1990
 The combination of high unemployment and inflation created a phenomenon dubbed “stagflation” in the 1970s.

 (see Chapter 21). In 1976, Steven Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, 21 and 26 years old respectively, followed in Ford’s footsteps by constructing their first personal computer in a family garage. The pair founded Apple Computers a year later, envisioning a machine that would transform daily life. The first Apple logo showed the seventeenthcentury mathematician Sir Isaac Newton sitting under the apple that supposedly fell off a tree and hit him on the head, inspiring him to develop his theory of universal gravitational pull that revolutionized modern scientific thought. The subsequent, permanent logo just retained the apple. In 1976, the claim that computers could transform the world as much as Newton’s theories seemed ludicrous. Yet within a year the computer age got underway when Apple released the first home computer designed for the general public. The computer revolution received another boost in 1980 when 29-year-old Bill Gates, the cofounder of an obscure start-up company called Microsoft, signed an agreement with International Business Machines (IBM) to provide operating software for its home computers. The deal made Gates a billionaire within two years.

Frustration at Home
 Nixon initially embraced the same moderate course as Eisenhower, with whom he had served as vice president from 1953 to 1961. Like Eisenhower, Nixon billed himself as a fiscal conservative who was willing to accept popular social welfare programs like Social Security and Medicare. As the economic outlook worsened, however, Nixon instituted wage and price controls in 1971 to curb inflation, the most drastic government intervention in the economy since World War II. Conservative outrage over his fiscal policies had little effect on Nixon, who intended to stay in the political center. He hoped to bolster the moderate wing of the Republican party by turning disgruntled Southerners, Northern blue-collar workers, and white suburbanites (Democrats who had voted for him in 1968; see Chapter 27), into lifelong Republicans. Called “the silent majority” these voters rejected some, but not all, of the liberal vision. The silent majority disliked Great Society programs that primarily aided minorities, but they still subscribed to the New Deal orthodoxy that made the government responsible for ensuring prosperity. Nixon’s budget-cutting, therefore,

 targeted social-welfare programs for minorities and the poor, measures that partially appeased fiscal conservatives without touching New Deal programs like Social Security that former Democrats and many moderate Republicans viewed as sacrosanct. Nixon also tried unsuccessfully to reduce the jumble of laws and programs that made welfare assistance to the poor expensive to administer. The poor viewed his proposal to guarantee all Americans a minimum income of $1,600 ($8,500 in today’s dollars) as too low, while conservatives opposed it for redistributing income. Nixon gained the loyalty of the silent majority by trying to tame the Supreme Court, which under the leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren (see Chapter 27) had issued controversial rulings on school prayer and desegregation. When Warren retired in 1969, Nixon appointed Warren Burger to replace him, believing that Burger would influence his colleagues to offer a more restrained interpretation of the Constitution than Warren. Burger, however, had no intention of reducing the Court’s commitment to school integration. The Court insisted that the North develop school busing programs to catch up with the South where, by 1971, 77 percent of black children attended school with white children. The 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision outlawing segregated schools had set off massive resistance throughout the South (see Chapter 25). In the 1970s, opposition to court-mandated integration moved northward as the silent majority found its collective voice and took to the streets. Busing sent black and white children to schools outside their neighborhoods, generating opposition in Northern, ethnic white enclaves where angry white parents objected to “big government” turning their children into “guinea pigs.” Boston became a hotbed of anti-busing fervor. On April 5, 1976, 200 white working-class Irish American teenagers began an adult-supervised anti-busing march in downtown Boston. Joseph Rakes, one of the teenage protesters, who brought along his family’s American flag, later recalled feeling “blind anger” at busing policies that were destroying his close-knit South Boston community. “They took half the guys and girls I grew up with and said, ‘You’re going to school on the other side of town.’ Nobody understood it at 15,” Rakes explained. When Ted Landsmark, an African American lawyer on his way to a meeting, crossed the protesters’ path, the students pounced on him.

 How did the “silent majority” shape politics in the 1970s?

28.3 “The Soiling of Old Glory,” 1976
 The image of an anti-busing protester in Boston preparing to ram an African American lawyer with a flagpole underscored that deeply ingrained racial prejudices were more than just a Southern problem.

 Boston Herald photographer Stanley Forman’s Pulitzer-Prize winning photo “The Soiling of Old Glory” (28.3) showed Rakes poised to attack Landsmark with his flagstaff. In the photo Landsmark apparently struggles to free himself from the grip of another white man grabbing him from the rear. Contrary to the impression given by the photo, however, the man holding Landsmark was actually helping him to his feet after white youths had thrown him to the ground and beaten him. Rakes never hit Landsmark with the flagstaff. Yet when Landsmark, a seasoned civil rights activist, who had marched from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 (see Chapter 27), went to the hospital, he had doctors put a large bandage on his broken nose. Landsmark knew that the appearance of severe injuries would draw more press attention. The portrait of raw racial hatred captured in the photograph, and Landsmark’s heavily bandaged face at How does this photograph compare to the images of racial violence in the South seen in earlier chapters?

 a press conference the following day, shocked white Boston and encouraged the city’s leaders to initiate a sustained campaign to deescalate racial tensions. When the new school year began in September, Time magazine trumpeted the “Truce in Boston.” By this time, however, the Supreme Court’s stance had shifted, thanks to Nixon’s more conservative appointments. After the Court ruled that independent suburban school districts did not have to participate in inner-city busing programs, accelerated “white flight” to the suburbs created a core of all-black urban schools ringed by suburban white schools in Boston and in other cities.

 than ushering in an era of unchallenged Republican control, Nixon became embroiled in the Watergate scandal, an episode of presidential criminality that created a constitutional crisis, ended Nixon’s political career, and helped the Democrats retake the White House in 1976. On June 17, 1972, a night watchman caught five burglars breaking into the offices of the Democratic National Committee in a Washington, D.C., building complex called Watergate. The plan, financed by Nixon’s reelection campaign and approved by White House staffers, called for the burglars to fix a broken telephone wiretap installed during a previous break-in so the Nixon campaign could listen to Democratic phone calls. After Nixon disavowed any previous knowledge of the plot, the story slid off the front pages, and he easily won re-election. When the burglars went on trial in early 1973, however, one confessed to accepting a bribe to keep quiet about the White House’s involvement in planning the break-in. In response the Justice Department and Senate launched two separate investigations. Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward detailed the growing scandal in articles based on information from a secret informant whom they identified only by the nickname, Deep Throat (revealed in 2005 as William Mark Felt, the FBI’s deputy director). During one Senate committee hearing, Senator Howard Baker asked the key question: “What did the President know, and when did he know it?” Secret tapes that Nixon had made of all White House conversations promised to provide the answer. The showdown over gaining access to these tapes and what they revealed transformed the Watergate burglary into a constitutional crisis over whether the president was above the law. Two competing visions of presidential power emerged. Nixon refused to turn over the tapes to the Justice Department or Congress, claiming that the constitutionally protected right of executive privilege



 meant he could keep advice from counselors private. Investigators argued that the president had no constitutional right to withhold evidence of corruption or abuse of power. Nixon next tried to use his authority to control the investigation. When Archibald Cox, who headed the Justice Department investigation, secured a court order for the tapes on Saturday, October 20, 1973, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Cox. Richardson and the deputy attorney general refused and resigned. The third-ranking official in the Justice Department finally fired Cox. Outrage greeted news of the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and Nixon endured a cacophony of car horns sounding outside the White House day and night, where protesters urged passing motorists to “Honk for Impeachment.” After much delay and controversy, Nixon finally turned over highly edited versions of his taped White House conversations, enraging his critics even further. Liberal political cartoonists lampooned Nixon as a tyrant and a crook (see Images as History: Watergate through Political Cartoons, page 850). In July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee issued articles of impeachment against Nixon, charging him with obstruction of justice, abusing his presidential powers by ordering the CIA, FBI, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to harass his political enemies, and violating the Constitution by refusing to honor congressional subpoenas. The Supreme Court also unanimously ruled that Nixon could not withhold information pertaining to his own potential criminal wrongdoing. On August 5, 1974, Nixon finally released the remaining tapes, and the nation heard the president authorize a cover-up plan. On June 23, 1972, Nixon had instructed the CIA to tell the FBI to end its Watergate investigation to protect “national security.” Two days later, on August 8, 1974, to avoid impeachment proceedings almost certain to remove him from office, Nixon became the first president in U.S. history to resign, and Vice President Gerald Ford became president. “Our long national nightmare is over,” the new president assured the nation.

WATERGATE THROUGH POLITICAL CARTOONS
Political cartoons have been a mainstay of political debate in America since the colonial era. “If the prime role of a free press is to serve as critic of government, cartooning is often the cutting edge of that criticism,” stated Herb Block, who drew under the pseudonym Herblock. Political cartoonists like Herblock and Paul Conrad followed the long career of Richard Nixon from his early days as a communist-hunting congressman through his resignation as president. Their illustrations caricatured his face and shoulders, depicting a long beak-like nose, dark circles under his eyes, five o’clock shadow, and slumping shoulders. Some conservative cartoonists defended Nixon, even as the Watergate scandal deepened. One caricature depicted the media as piranhas nipping at Nixon’s heels as he tried to reach calmer waters, suggesting that he was the victim of a media feeding frenzy. When Nixon resigned, a Bert Whitman cartoon in the Phoenix Gazette showed the president exiting center stage, leaving behind spotlights that illuminated his foreign policy successes such as ending the Vietnam War and improving relations with China and the Soviet Union. To these conservative commentators Nixon’s record as a strong leader in the world mattered more than his transgressions at home. 
 The cartoon, Herblock later noted, “comments not only on his situation at the time, but on his veracity and honesty—without using any words other than his own.”

 Conrad satirized the president’s paranoia by depicting Nixon as a despot sitting in the dark, creating “enemies lists” (which eventually included 30,000 people).

 By 1973, the public knew that Nixon had instructed the FBI and IRS to harass people he considered political “enemies.” The list included Paul Conrad, who drew political cartoons for the Los Angeles Times.

 To prevent future presidents from using the FBI to spy on their domestic critics, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (1978) required secret judicial approval for any internal surveillance of U.S. citizens. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Congress loosened these restrictions on monitoring Americans at home.

 The cartoon title suggested that Nixon, rather than his opponents, destroyed his presidency.

A CRISIS OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP



A
Crisis of Presidential Leadership  The Watergate scandal and the scars from the Vietnam War tested Americans’ faith in the federal government. Congress moved to limit the powers of the president, and Americans disagreed over the direction to take in foreign policy post-Vietnam. The challenges were significant: dealing with renewed Soviet aggression, ensuring that support for Israel did not alienate oil-producing Arab nations, and improving relations with Central America.

A
Weakened Presidency  When Gerald R. Ford became president, for the first time a man unelected as either president or vice president led the nation. Nixon had appointed Ford, then Republican House Minority leader, as his vice president in 1973, invoking the TwentyFifth Amendment to fill the office after disgraced Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned for having accepted bribes while governor of Maryland. During his 24 years in Congress, Ford built a reputation as an honest, fiscally conservative Republican and won the respect of legislators in both parties. “I’m a Ford, not a Lincoln,” he said when he became vice president, distancing himself from both the elite who bought luxurious Lincoln cars and the political genius of the nation’s sixteenth president. Ford’s modesty compared favorably with Nixon’s obsessive quest for power. Believing that the nation wanted to turn the page quickly on the Watergate scandal, Ford announced that he was giving Nixon a “full, free, and absolute pardon” for any illegal acts that he might have committed as president. A long trial and possibly imprisoning the former president would only prolong the nation’s agony, he believed. Ford, however, had misread the public’s mood. His approval rating sank to 42 percent amid accusations that he was fulfilling the terms of a backroom deal made while Nixon was still president—a pardon in return for the presidency. Nixon went free, but over 70 others were eventually convicted of Watergaterelated crimes. Ford never recovered from this loss of confidence in his leadership. An emboldened Congress reined in presidential power. Nixon had accepted large donations from businessmen in return for favors and influence. In response Congress created a Federal Election Commission (FEC) in 1974 to monitor federal elections. Congress also limited campaign contributions by individuals and official political organizations and

 established a system of public funding for presidential elections. Opponents immediately challenged the constitutionality of these restrictions. In 1976, the Supreme Court struck down a provision that limited how much an individual could spend of his or her own money to win elected office, claiming that such restrictions (except for candidates who accepted matching federal funds) violated the First Amendment right to free speech. These efforts to curb influence-peddling through campaign donations had unintended consequences. Political action committees (PACs), which represented private interest groups, such as labor, business, and retirees, were allowed to donate more money than individuals, increasing their sway over the politicians they supported. To repair public faith in the presidency, President Ford tried to shape a post-Vietnam foreign policy that restored America’s image as an invincible superpower without reigniting fears that the nation was overextending its reach or behaving unethically. Exposés about how the United States was conducting the Cold War acquainted Americans with their government’s willingness to support dictators around the world who pledged friendship to the United States over the Soviet Union. In 1974, The New York Times exposed the CIA’s covert involvement in the overthrow of Salvador Allende, the democratically elected Marxist president of Chile. With aid from CIA operatives, anti-Soviet and pro-American General Augusto Pinochet seized power and established a brutal 16-year dictatorship that tortured, imprisoned, and killed dissenters. Congressional investigations also exposed CIA plots to assassinate leftist leaders in the Congo, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. To regain public confidence in how the government was waging the Cold War, Ford prohibited any government employee from engaging or conspiring in assassination plots. Complaints over

 coalition of white Southerners, urban blacks, and union members to carry the election by 297 to 240 electoral votes. Less than 55 percent of the electorate even bothered to vote, however, a historic low and disappointing follow-up to the 1960s, when countless civil rights activists had put their lives on the line to secure this right. On his inauguration day Carter chose to walk from his swearing in on the Capitol steps to the White House with his wife and family rather than ride in a limousine, the type of populist gesture that he frequently made as president. Ford had pardoned Nixon in an attempt to heal wounds quickly. Carter tried to remove another source of festering discord by pardoning 10,000 Vietnam War draft resisters, many of whom had fled to Canada, a move that enraged conservatives but earned him the gratitude of liberal Democrats. Seeking to solidify liberal Democratic support, Carter moved quickly to build on the liberal vision of Democrats John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson by creating the Department of Education and working with Congress to establish a “Superfund” to clean up the nation’s most polluted areas. He also appointed the most women and minorities to federal office of any previous president. Carter’s outsider status and his tendency toward self-righteousness, however, hampered his presidency. A hard worker, who rose early and went to bed late, he pored over every memorandum, even personally handling requests to use the White House tennis court during his first six months in office. The fiscally conservative Carter had strong philosophical differences with liberal Democrats who emphasized the advantages of deficit-spending over balancing the federal budget. Carter believed that too much government regulation was hampering the business recovery, while liberal Democrats felt that regulation was necessary to protect the public. The president eventually prevailed, convincing Congress to deregulate the trucking, communication, and airline industries.

 Identifying rising oil costs as the main cause of the nation’s economic woes, Carter urged Americans to consume less oil in a 1977 television address that recalled Franklin D. Roosevelt’s famous fireside chats. As a fire crackled behind him, Carter, dressed in a cardigan sweater, called the energy crisis “the moral equivalent of war,” which was the title of a famous essay by nineteenth-century philosopher William James. To discourage consumption, Carter proposed ending the price controls that kept oil and gas prices low and imposing higher federal taxes on gasoline. To prevent price-gouging, he also wanted oil and gas companies to pay higher taxes on their profits. Carter tried to craft a vision that would appeal to both laissez-faire adherents who liked the idea of lifting price controls so the market determined the price of oil, and liberals who believed in government regulation to rein in corporate profits and protect the environment. The resulting energy law in 1978 compromised between these conflicting visions. It lifted price controls, raised the sales taxes on gas-guzzling cars, and offered tax incentives for using alternative energy sources such as coal and solar heating. The law did not, however, include a windfall profits tax on oil and gas company profits. The country soon felt the effects of lifting price controls without also raising taxes on oil

 and gas company profits. In 1979, OPEC raised prices four times in five months, and revolution in Iran curtailed its oil exports. Images of motorists waiting for hours in line to buy gas, last seen during the 1973 oil embargo again dominated the news. The crisis reached its zenith on June 13, 1979, when over half of the nation’s service stations ran out of gas. Meanwhile Exxon, an American company that imported oil from overseas, announced first quarter earnings of $1.9 billion in 1980, a record profit by an American corporation. Carter renewed his call for a windfall-profit tax on oil and gas companies, hoping to use this revenue to fund public transportation, develop alternative energy sources, and help the poor pay for heating. To stimulate interest in energy conservation, Carter took to the airwaves to deliver an address soon dubbed the “malaise speech.” America, he lamented, was enmeshed in a moral and spiritual crisis. The nation had gone from one that celebrated “hard work, strong families, close-knit communities, and our faith in God” to one that worshiped “self-indulgence and consumption.” Carter’s call for Americans to “seize control again of our national destiny” aroused only resentment over his sermonizing.

 28.5 Hey, man … like I don’t CARE what it’s costing me This political caricature blamed Americans’ oil addiction for the nation’s energy problems.

 What different opinions surfaced about the root of America’s energy problems?

 These two political cartoons, both drawn in 1980, encapsulated competing notions of where blame for the energy crisis lay. Bob Taylor, drawing for the Dallas Times Herald, focused on the nation’s insatiable appetite for oil (28.5). He portrayed Uncle Sam as a drug addict willing to pay any price for his next fix of oil. “Hey, man . . . like I don’t CARE what it’s costing . . . I need it,” a disheveled and stony-eyed Uncle Sam says as he prepares to inject a barrel of oil into his vein. By contrast John Milt Morris’s “Profitsharing plan!” indicted OPEC and American oil companies for price-gouging, viewing the consumer as a victim of their conspiracy to empty his pockets (28.6). A sign posted outside one gas station presented a third view by proclaiming “Higher prices, More Sass, Bad President, Out of Gas,” putting the blame squarely on Carter’s shoulders.

 of neighboring nations, he noted, had earned the United States the reputation as an imperial exploiter throughout Latin America. Liberal Democrats rejoiced when Carter resolved to make human rights and the spreading of democracy the centerpieces of his foreign policy. The president’s first major achievement was consistent with his desire to forge a new path in American diplomatic relations. Making amends for past American wrongdoing (see Chapter 19), Carter negotiated a treaty that returned the Panama Canal to Panama in 2000. The United States had controlled the Canal Zone since 1903, but by the 1970s, America’s bigger submarines and ships did not fit through the canal, reducing its importance to national security and the economy. Three previous presidents had recognized these facts and opened negotiations, but Carter sealed the deal and won Senate ratification for the agreement in 1978. Giving up control of the Panama Canal failed to dramatically improve relations between the United States and Latin America. Overtures to normalize relations with the Communist Cuban dictator Fidel Castro went nowhere. Carter also faced a severe test in Nicaragua, where civil war pitted the anti-communist dictator Anastasio Somoza against the Cuban-supported Sandinista rebels. When the Sandinistas prevailed, Carter offered them economic aid in the vain hope that he could dissuade them from creating a Cubanlike authoritarian communist state. Turning to Asia, Carter continued along the path forged by Nixon and established diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China in 1979. This decision angered conservatives who viewed Taiwan, where the Nationalist government had fled after the Communist takeover of the mainland in 1949, as the rightful government of China. “To the Communists and those others who are hostile to our country,” Reagan fumed, “President Carter and his supporters in the Congress seem like Santa Claus. They have given the Panama Canal away, abandoned Taiwan to the Red Chinese, and they’re negotiating a SALT II treaty (with the Soviets) that could very well make this nation NUMBER TWO.” Ignoring these criticisms Carter signed the SALT II pact in June 1979, which capped missiles and bombers on each side. But as Reagan’s comments revealed, American disaffection with détente ran deep. In the 1970s, Soviet-backed regimes took control of Angola, Somalia, Ethiopia,

 and Afghanistan, confirming skeptics’ fears that détente had strengthened the enemy. Additional signs of Moscow’s aggressive intentions came in 1977 when the Soviets began aiming new, highly accurate intermediate-range missiles (SS-20s) at Western Europe. Carter responded by securing NATO’s authorization to install Pershing II missiles in Western Europe, which could reach Moscow in ten minutes. Strained Soviet-American relations took another hit when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 to prop up its faltering Marxist government. The Soviets were eager to keep a friendly regime in power along their border, but the United States feared their ambitions might stretch into the oil-rich Middle East. Calling the invasion “the most serious threat to peace since the Second World War,” Carter announced the Carter Doctrine, a declaration that the United States would use armed forces to stop any outside power from making inroads into the Persian Gulf region. He withdrew the SALT II treaty from the Senate, increased defense spending, cut off shipments of grain and technology to the Soviet Union, and announced that the United States would boycott the summer Olympics in Moscow. The Carter administration also sent aid to Muslim fundamentalist rebels battling the Soviets in Afghanistan, whose ranks included the Saudi-born Islamic militant Osama bin Laden. A wealthy recent college graduate dedicated to establishing an Islamic state in Afghanistan, bin Laden would later found al-Qaeda, an Islamic fundamentalist terrorist organization. The Cold War had long held the attention of American presidents. The United States was just learning, however, to take conflicts in the Middle East as seriously. Carter hoped to lessen tension by negotiating an end to hostilities between Israel and Egypt. In 1978, he invited Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to Camp David, a presidential mountain retreat in Maryland. Thirteen days of tense Did Carter’s dealings with the Soviet Union continue or undo initiatives undertaken by Nixon and Ford?

 negotiations ended with the Camp David Accords. Israel agreed to give the Sinai Peninsula back to Egypt in 1982 (see 28.1). In return Egypt became the first Arab state to recognize Israel’s right to exist. The United States rewarded each side with pledges of substantial military aid, support that continues to this day. Befriending Egypt neutralized the only credible military threat to Israeli security and brought a previous Soviet ally into the American fold, strengthening the American position in the Middle East. If the Middle East gave Carter his greatest diplomatic victory, it also provided the low point of his presidency. In 1953, the United States had helped overthrow the left-leaning Iranian government and reinstated the reliably anti-communist Shah of Iran to ensure American access to Iranian oil. In 1979, radical Islamists overthrew the Shah, who fled the country. An Islamic cleric and revolutionary, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, became the head of the world’s first radical Islamist government. Khomeini’s intense dark eyes, long snowy beard, and flowing robes made him appear dark and dangerous to Americans, who recoiled at his ferocious denunciations of the United States as “the Great Satan.” In October 1979, Carter made a fateful decision when he reluctantly agreed to let the ailing Shah of Iran, who was living in Mexico, into the United States for medical treatment. If the United States “turned our backs on the fallen Shah, it would be a signal to the world that the U.S. is a fair-weather friend,” National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski told Carter. At 3:00 a.m. on November 4, 1979, the State Department received a telephone call from panicked officials in the American embassy in Teheran, the capital of Iran, reporting that a mob of Iranian university students had broken into the compound. The students proceeded to take embassy employees hostage. Khomeini had not ordered the hostage-taking, but he supported the students’ demands that the United States return the Shah and his fortune to Iran to secure the hostages’ release. His government, worried that the United States might try to return the Shah to power, wanted him in hand. The Iranian hostage crisis became the defining event in Carter’s presidency as Iranian revolutionaries held 52 Americans captive for 444 days. The media coverage was unprecedented, and most reporters viewed the crisis as a humiliating blow to America’s honor. ABC News

 created a late-night show, “Nightline,” that gave constant updates on “America Held Hostage” and repeatedly showed film footage of Iranian crowds chanting “Death to America” and the blindfolded captives. Frustration with Carter’s inability to resolve the crisis caused his approval ratings to sink to 28 percent. How to proceed was not clear, however, and Carter’s key advisors offered him conflicting recommendations. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance focused on saving the hostages’ lives and argued that the United States needed to negotiate patiently, no matter how long it took. National Security Advisor Brzezinski worried more about protecting America’s image as a global superpower. He felt that the longer the crisis lasted, the weaker America appeared to the rest of the world, emboldening America’s enemies. The Soviet

 invasion of Afghanistan a month into the hostage crisis seemingly corroborated Brzezinski’s vision. Choices and Consequences: Ending the Iranian Hostage Crisis explores Carter’s options and the repercussions of his decision to try to rescue the hostages. Five months later Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein launched an invasion of Iran to acquire its oil fields, and Khomeini finally decided to negotiate in earnest. Iran could no longer afford its diplomatic isolation, needing to reestablish its global trading networks to fend off the attack. After months of negotiations the United States agreed to give Iran $7.9 billion (the estimated value of the Shah’s holdings in the United States) and pledged not to interfere in Iranian domestic affairs. Carter hoped to deliver the good news to the American people that the hostages were coming home before he left office on January 20, 1981. Instead, Khomeini waited until a few minutes after the new president Ronald Reagan was sworn into office to release the hostages, denying Carter a final triumph.

Choices and Consequences
ENDING THE IRANIAN HOSTAGE CRISIS
When Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy and took Americans hostage in 1979, President Carter faced a choice over whether to follow the advice of Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who recommended patient negotiations, or National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, who favored using force to end the crisis. For five months Carter brokered a compromise between these two positions by freezing Iranian financial assets in the United States, engaging in secret negotiations, and beefing up the American naval presence in the Arabian Sea. As Carter began his 1980 reelection bid, mounting public frustration along with concern that American inaction had encouraged the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan, increased the pressure on Carter for decisive action. 
Choices




 Wait for Iran to tire of its diplomatic isolation, and then negotiate the hostages’ release without alienating the rest of the Muslim world.



 Make a show of strength by bombing Iranian oil refineries and military bases and mining harbors.



 Use Special Forces to rescue the hostages.

Decision
 When an Iranian negotiator told the administration that a diplomatic resolution was months away, Carter decided to act. In April, 1980, while Vance was out of town, Carter authorized a rescue mission by Special Forces.

Consequences
 Swirling desert sands and a collision between American aircraft doomed the rescue mission in its first stages, further humiliating the United States. Vance immediately resigned, and in July the Shah died in Egypt, ending the question of returning him to Iran. When Iraq invaded Iran in September, seeking oil-rich territory, Khomeini decided to end Iran’s diplomatic isolation. Winning concessions from the United States, Iran released the hostages on January 20, 1981, the day that Ronald Reagan was inaugurated president.

 The ex-hostages arrive at Frankfurt, Germany on January 21, 1981, the day after their release.

Continuing Controversies
 How important was the hostage crisis for the United States in the long-term? Some say it was very important. The hostages’ prolonged captivity branded Carter as inept and contributed to his reelection loss. To contain Iran, the United States supported Saddam Hussein during his eight-year war with Iran, again using a repressive Middle Eastern dictator to advance American interests. The hostage crisis also created a

 negative image of Islam in the United States that future Islamic terrorist attacks reinforced. The crisis was not so important, others counter, rejecting it as a major reason for Reagan’s victory. In the 1980s, the failed Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Camp David Accords, and using a secular Iraq to contain Iranian influence protected U.S. economic interests in the region, diminishing the long-term significance of the hostage crisis.

 What larger significance did Carter’s advisors attach to the Iranian hostage crisis?

The Rights Revolution
 Social turbulence did not cease with the end of the Vietnam War. Feminists and gay activists carried the 1960s’ rights revolution into the 1970s and 1980s, striking at the heart of gender identity in American society. Meanwhile the environmental movement sought to reverse the toll of industrial pollution on the nation’s natural habitats.

28.7 Women and
Work, 1900–2000
 As more women entered the workforce, combating discrimination in the workplace became a major issue for the women’s movement.

 Feminist political demands received unprecedented attention in the 1970s. To eradicate gender discrimination and sexual inequality at the workplace, feminist organizations lobbied for equal pay for equal work, an end to sexual harassment, and paid maternity leave. These bread-and-butter issues became even more pressing as the economic downturn of the 1970s forced more women into the workplace. The chart Women and Work, 1900–2000 (28.7) shows the steady increase in the percentage of single and married women who worked outside the home over the second half of the twentieth century. Changing attitudes toward married women working and declining birthrates

 contributed to the increased female presence in the job market. Thanks to vacuum cleaners, gas and electric stoves, washing machines and dryers, women in the 1970s spent less time doing housework than their counterparts earlier in the century. Supermarkets, fast food, and prepackaged foods also simplified the tasks of shopping and cooking for a family. Nonetheless, working women faced challenges including the lack of affordable day care and the difficulty of convincing men to pitch in at home. On average women worked 15 hours (outside and inside the home) more a week than men. “You’re on duty at work. You come home, and you’re on duty,” complained one wife. With one in two marriages ending in divorce, single-parenting often put more strains on working women with children. The most common reason couples gave for divorcing in the 1970s and 1980s: arguments over domestic responsibilities. The feminist movement, however, faced challenges convincing working women that feminism provided the answer to the problems they faced balancing work and home life or advancing in the workplace. The press, one activist noted, portrayed the feminist as “a total weirdo—bra-burner, man-hater, lesbian, sickie!”—exaggerated stereotypes that threatened the movement’s growth. Many women proved reluctant to publicly identify themselves as feminists, even if they privately supported the women’s movement goals, fearing social stigmatization as unfeminine. Divisions within the women’s movement created another major obstacle. Poor minority women often saw racial and ethnic prejudice as bigger obstacles to their economic advancement than gender discrimination, and regarded white, upper-middle-class feminists with suspicion. Feminism, in the words of one black woman, was “basically a family quarrel between White women and White men.” Divisions between radicals and

 moderate feminists (see Chapter 27) also prevented women from speaking with one voice. The feminist movement occasionally benefited from positive media coverage, as during made-fortelevision moments like the heavily hyped “battle of the sexes” in 1973 between tennis stars Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. Millions of Americans tuned in to watch King defeat Riggs, a self-proclaimed “male chauvinist pig” who argued that even a 55-year-old former tennis champion like himself could defeat the best female player in the world. Riggs announced his conversion to the feminist cause by shouting “equality for women” as he hit the final volley into the net. King’s triumph advanced opportunities for women’s professional sports. Feminist campaigning also led to the passage of Title IX of the 1972 Education Act, prohibiting gender discrimination in education. This law revolutionized high school and college sports by forcing administrators to create more teams and scholarships for female students. Despite negative media portrayals and problems attracting working-class women, the feminist movement enjoyed other successes in the early 1970s. Cities established shelters for battered women and rape-crisis centers. Congress also passed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) in 1972, a proposal that congressional supporters had introduced regularly since 1923 that stated, “equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” Within three years, 34 of the 38 states needed for ratification of the ERA had approved the measure. This avalanche of change outraged cultural conservatives who charged that the ERA would destroy the American family. Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative Illinois lawyer with six children, led the anti-ERA crusade. Catapulting into the national spotlight, Schlafly helped forge the coalition among Catholics, Southerners, antifeminists, religious fundamentalists, and fiscal conservatives that pushed the Republican Party to the right throughout the 1970s. Feminists branded Schlafly a hypocrite, pointing out that she was a well-educated woman who had enjoyed a satisfying career in Republican politics before spearheading the anti-ERA campaign. “She’s an extremely liberated woman,” asserted Karen DeCrow, the president of the feminist National Organization for Women. Competing Visions: Defining the Ideal Woman (page 860) explores the debate over female gender identity in the 1970s. Schlafly’s anti-feminist message resonated in the Southern and Mountain states, areas without strong local feminist organizations to offer a competing view of how gender discrimination adversely affected women in



 the workplace. In the end the anti-ERA forces prevailed. The ERA remained three states short when the deadline for approving the measure came in 1982, the first of many conservative political victories to come in the 1980s. The rancor over legalized abortion, however, far surpassed the barbs exchanged over the ERA. Between 700,000 and 800,000 women a year sought illegal abortions, and botched procedures by incompetent practitioners working in unsanitary conditions killed 2,000–3,000 patients annually. The signs (28.8) in this 1970 St. Louis, Missouri protest march, held on the anniversary of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, listed the right of legalized abortion as a key feminist demand. It remained the right of individual states sttattess to to determine dete de term te rmin rm inee the in t legality th l

Competing Visions
DEFINING THE IDEAL WOMAN
What did it mean to be a woman? Cultural conservatives answered “wife and mother;” feminists disagreed. In 1972, Gloria Steinem, founder of Ms., a popular feminist magazine, argued that both women and men would be happier once freed from the straitjacket of culturally constructed gender roles. Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly countered that gender identity was rooted in biology. Gloria Steinem argued that women’s liberation would benefit men as well as women. 
 Phyllis Schlafly claimed that the “Positive Woman” embraced her distinctly female role.

 I don’t think most women want to pick up briefcases and march off to meaningless, depersonalized jobs…. We want to liberate men from those inhuman roles as well. We want to share the work and responsibility, and to have men share equal responsibility for the children. Probably the ultimate myth is that children must have fulltime mothers, and that liberated women make bad ones. The truth is that most American children seem to be suffering from too much mother and too little father. Women now spend more time with their homes and families than in any other past or present society we know about. To get back to the sanity of the agrarian or joint family system, we need free universal day care. With that aid, as in Scandinavian countries, and with laws that permit women equal work and equal pay, man will be relieved of his role as sole breadwinner and stranger to his own children. No more alimony. Fewer boring wives. Fewer childlike wives…. No more wives who fall apart with the first wrinkle because they’ve been taught that their total identity depends on their outsides. No more responsibility for another adult human being who has never been told she is responsible for her own life, and who sooner or later says some version of, “If I hadn’t married you, I could have been a star.” Women’s Liberation really is Men’s Liberation, too.… Colleague marriages, such as young people have now, with both partners going to law-school or the Peace Corps together, …. Communes; marriages that are valid for the child-rearing years only, there are many possibilities. The point is that Women’s Liberation is not destroying the American family. It is trying to build a human compassionate alternative out of its ruins.

 The first requirement for the acquisition of power by the Positive Woman is to understand the differences between men and women…. She rejoices in the creative capability within her body and the power potential of her mind and spirit. She understands that men and women are different, and that those very differences provide the key to her success as a person and fulfillment as a woman. The women’s liberationist, on the other hand, is imprisoned by her own negative view of herself and of her place in the world around her…. Women must be made equal to men in their ability not to become pregnant and not to be expected to care for babies they may bring into the world. This is why women’s liberationists are compulsively involved in the drive to make abortion and childcare centers for all women, regardless of religion or income, both socially acceptable, and government-financed…. The Positive Woman looks upon her femaleness and her fertility as part of her purpose, her potential, and her power. She rejoices that she has a capability for creativity that men can never have … A Positive Woman cannot defeat a man in a wrestling match or boxing match, but she can motivate him, inspire him, encourage him, teach him, restrain him, reward him, and have power over him that he can never achieve over her with all his muscle…. The overriding psychological need of a woman is to love something alive. A baby fulfills this need in the lives of most women. If a baby is not available to fill that need, women search for a baby-substitute. This is the reason why women have traditionally gone into teaching and nursing careers. They are doing what comes naturally to the female psyche.

 of abortion throughout the sixties and early seventies. California took the lead in changing what the Los Angeles Times called “Our Archaic Abortion Law” that only allowed a woman to end a pregnancy if her life was in danger. Bending to the popular will, then-California Governor Ronald Reagan reluctantly signed a bipartisan bill in 1967 that let women terminate pregnancies in cases of rape and incest and fetuses with severe physical and mental defects, a decision he later called a mistake. Texas, however, still only allowed abortions if a pregnancy jeopardized a woman’s life. Feminists felt that women, not male doctors, should have the right to make medical decisions about their own bodies. In 1970, Norma McCorvey, an unmarried, poor, pregnant 25-year-old, sued Texas under the pseudonym Jane Roe claiming that she had the right to a legal and safe abortion based on her constitutional “right to privacy.” The Supreme Court dealt the feminist movement a stunning victory when it legalized abortion in its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The ruling came too late for McCorvey, who gave birth to a baby girl and gave her up for adoption as the case moved through the courts. In rendering the Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the “right to privacy . . . is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.” The Court decision prohibited states from criminalizing abortion in the first trimester, but allowed them to regulate abortion in the second trimester and prohibit it during the third trimester when a fetus became viable. The Court, however, sidestepped a key question that would provoke much future controversy. “We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins,” the Court asserted. Critics argued that the Court had invented a right to privacy that did not exist in the Constitution. Supporters countered that court decisions over the last century had established this right. The debate soon seeped into national politics, when the Democrats assumed the mantle of the party dedicated to maintaining a woman’s right to choose an abortion and the Republicans became predominantly against the right to abortion, a position that came to be known as “pro-life.”

Read the Document Roe v. Wade (1973)


 The vocabulary embraced by each side in the abortion debate revealed competing visions of what abortion meant. Supporters of legalized abortion called themselves “pro-choice,” a label encapsulating their view that abortion was a question of personal liberty. In contrast “pro-life” forces believed that human life began at conception (not when a fetus was viable outside the womb); they therefore viewed abortion as tantamount to murder. Both sides employed the language of rights, the “rights of women” (pro-choice usage) squaring off against those of “unborn children” (pro-life term). The activist women facing off in this debate had different life experiences and conceptions of motherhood. Pro-life activists had often built their lives around children and the home and were outraged by their suspicion that pro-choice women had abortions “as a matter of convenience.” Prochoice activists tended to marry later, had more education, and were less religious. They usually wanted careers as well as children and refused to allow biology to dictate their life choices. Twenty years after Roe v. Wade McCorvey changed her mind about abortion and became a born-again Christian, who joined the anti-abortion crusade. Her reversal illustrated the growing momentum of the pro-life movement, which used images of children, like the one affixed to the sign of this 1979 pro-life demonstrator protesting in Washington, D.C. (28.9), to emphasize the rights of children.



 28.9 Pro-life Protest, 1979 Pro-life demonstrators who opposed legalized abortion put the focus on the right of unborn children to have a life rather than the right of women to control their own bodies.

 What different visions separated the pro-life and pro-choice camps?



 CHAPTER 28

RIGHTING A NATION ADRIFT: AMERICA IN THE 1970s AND 1980s

 In the twenty-first century, the pro-life movement took advantage of new ultrasound portraits of fetuses in the womb that showed beating hearts to underscore their argument that life began at conception. Unable to overturn the Roe decision directly, pro-life activists secured a ban on federal funding for abortions. Some states also required parental notification when minors sought abortions.

Gay Rights


AIDS
Memorial Quilt, The panels of the AIDS Memorial Quilt portrayed the disease’s victims as sons, brothers, and lovers with strong ties to their families and communities to challenge stereotypes of homosexuals as diseased pariahs. 
 The rights revolution also encompassed the gay and lesbian subcultures that existed in the shadows of mainstream society until the 1960s. Except for a few men and women who joined fledgling gay rights groups after World War II, most gay men and lesbians before the 1960s chose to live “in the closet,” hiding their same-sex preferences from the world. Unlike blacks, women, and other minority groups, gay Americans did not have a long history of organizing to defend their rights. Heterosexual Americans uniformly disparaged gays as deviant and morally reprehensible. The American Psychiatric Association categorized homosexuality as a “mental disorder,” a position it did not jettison until 1973. Taking the psychological stereotyping a step further, Time magazine viewed homosexuality as “a pernicious sickness.” “If you were gay and you

 accepted those societal norms, then you were at war with yourself,” stated one college student as he recalled his own struggle to come to terms with his homosexuality. Exposure as a homosexual or lesbian could mean losing everything—job, spouse, friends, and social position. In the 1960s the Civil Rights Movement and the hippie counterculture assault on sexual taboos inspired some gay people to “come out of the closet” and challenge the ways that American society ostracized them. The true awakening of the gay rights movement came during the Stonewall riot on June 28, 1969, when patrons frequenting the Stonewall Inn, a Greenwich Village male gay bar, fought back during a New York City police raid. This open defiance electrified the gay community, and the next morning a huge crowd gathered outside the Stonewall Inn, chanting “Gay Power,” a modification of the “Black Power” slogan that black militants embraced (see Chapter 27). Energized gay men and lesbians founded the radical Gay Liberation Front in response to Stonewall, while hundreds of smaller gay rights groups sprouted up throughout the country. These organizations formed gay support groups on campuses, lobbied for antidiscrimination laws, marched in Gay Pride parades, and followed the “sit-in” model of the Civil Rights Movement by staging “kiss-ins” in restaurants. “We should have the same right to

 express our affection publicly as heterosexuals have,” asserted lesbian activist Barbara Gittings. The increased visibility of the gay rights movement provoked a conservative response. In 1977, the deeply religious pop singer Anita Bryant, known to most Americans for her appearances in Florida orange juice television commercials, spearheaded a campaign to overturn a gay rights law in Dade County, Florida. Her victory galvanized forces on both sides of the gay rights debate. Fundamentalist churches opposed legislation granting gays legitimacy, lobbying strongly for laws that prevented homosexuals from teaching in public schools. Gay rights groups ridiculed the notion that gay men, because they preferred men as sexual partners, were pedophiles. A more insidious challenge loomed ahead, however. In 1981, the mainstream press began printing stories of a mysterious ailment sweeping through homosexual communities in New York and San Francisco. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a virus transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, ravaged the immune system of its victims. Acquiring AIDS was a virtual death sentence in the 1980s; the disease killed over 100,000 Americans by 1990. Because in the U.S. AIDS disproportionately struck homosexuals, the nation viewed the epidemic as more than a public health crisis. The raging political debate over the status of homosexuals in America colored the competing visions about AIDS. Religious conservatives viewed AIDS as God’s retribution against the “morally degenerate,” ignoring evidence that AIDS could also strike the heterosexual population. (Thousands of hemophiliacs and other straight Americans for example, died after contracting AIDS from tainted blood transfusions.) Having just recently repudiated the notion that gay people were mentally ill, homosexuals now confronted fears that they were all diseased. AIDS patients told heartbreaking stories of losing their jobs, being turned away from hospital emergency rooms, and facing eviction from apartments by landlords who feared contamination. The gay community lobbied vigorously for increased federal funds to find a medical cure for the disease. Still, having fought so long to escape police harassment and end legal penalties for consensual homosexual acts, many gay activists were leery about urging homosexual men to modify their sexual behaviors. Larry Kramer chastised gay activists who “took the position that sexual promiscuity was the one freedom we had and that we had to fight to maintain it—even if it killed us.

 Kramer instead worked to popularize the “safe sex” message—no exchange of bodily fluids—that eventually gained currency in the gay community. The two images shown here illustrate the competing visions within the gay community over how to best draw media attention to the mounting AIDS death toll. In 1987, the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the brainchild of San Francisco activist Cleve Jones, began touring the country after an inaugural unfurling on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The nation’s largest-ever public art endeavor, the quilt (28.10) made the individual stories of AIDS visible by allowing family and friends to create a square for a loved one, homosexual or heterosexual, lost to the disease. Squares were the size of a human grave, and they portrayed a mixture of embroidered personal remembrances and treasured possessions like jewelry. Radical activists adopted a less poignant and more militant tone. Embracing the slogan “SILENCE = DEATH,” the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP) staged its first “funeral” demonstration in 1987 to demand better medical treatment. Protesters lay down on a busy Wall Street intersection until police carried them away (28.11), employing the same civil disobedience tactics used by the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. ACT-UP also conducted phone “zaps” that barraged officials with calls on AIDS-related issues and barricaded the doors to the Food and Drug Administration to protest delays

 in approving AIDS-fighting drugs. The New York Times called ACT-UP, “rude, rash, effective.” On September 14, 1989, seven ACT-UP members handcuffed themselves to the balcony of the New York Stock Exchange to protest the huge profits that Burroughs-Wellcome, a pharmaceutical company, had amassed selling AZT, the only drug then available to inhibit the progression of AIDS. Four days later, as a result of negative publicity, Burroughs-Wellcome dropped the price of AZT 20 percent. By 1996, a drug “cocktail” dramatically reduced AIDS-related deaths. A relentless safe-sex campaign and screening of donated blood also lowered the infection rate.

Environmentalism
 On April 22, 1970, communities throughout the nation celebrated their first Earth Day. New York City crowds walked through a block-long plastic bubble to breathe pure air; demonstrators in Boston protested noise pollution; and population control

 advocates in Bloomington, Indiana, handed out free birth control pills. Earth Day made environmentalism visible, but the variety of causes that activists championed revealed the competing visions within the environmental movement. For New Left and counterculture environmentalists, eating organically produced food grown without pesticides became a symbolic way of purging the poison of mainstream American values out of their lives. Politicians interested in securing environmentally friendly legislation framed pollution as a straightforward health issue. To win widespread support for laws mandating lead-free gas and paint, they focused, for example, on how lead poisoning damaged children’s brains. Traditional conservationist societies like the Sierra Club and Audubon Society concentrated on preserving pristine wild habitats from development. They supported expanding the National Park Service to safeguard wildness areas and provide recreational sanctuaries for over-taxed citizens living in the industrial world.

THE RIGHTS REVOLUTION

 Presidential support for environmental reforms had begun during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations (see Chapter 27), and in the 1970s Nixon and Carter also increased federal environmental controls. New laws required the removal of asbestos (a cancer-causing building material) from schools. Companies had to reduce the amount of airborne toxins that their factories produced and clean up sites they had contaminated. Car manufacturers installed required catalytic converters that helped reduce automobile pollution by 75 percent. Meanwhile the consumer protection movement spearheaded by Ralph Nader led to the creation of a federal Consumer Product Safety Commission that could ban the sale of hazardous products, from cribs to cars. While the general public applauded changes that made their lives healthier and safer, blue-collar workers feared that new, expensive pollution controls on industry 28.13 Three Mile Island Nuclear Reactor Towers America rejected nuclear power after the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. That decision, coupled with limited federal support for solar and windgenerated power, increased the nation’s dependence on overseas oil.



 simply encouraged industrialists to move their factories overseas. “If you’re hungry and out of work, eat an environmentalist,” read one popular labor union bumper sticker. Two well-publicized environmental scandals, however—one at Love Canal, a waterway near Niagara Falls, New York, and the other at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania—convinced most Americans that their well-being depended on strict federal environmental regulation (28.12). After years of ignoring residents’ complaints about rising levels of miscarriages and birth defects, New York State finally admitted in 1978 that the foul-smelling industrial waste dumped into the Love Canal contained deadly toxins that had polluted the area’s ground and air. Congress responded by creating a Superfund to clean up dangerously polluted areas, spending $400 million over 20 years to restore the Love Canal region. In 1979, the partial meltdown of a nuclear reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania caused nearly 100,000 panicked residents to flee when radioactive steam poured into the air. No one was hurt, but the government-sponsored clean-up took 14 years. Despite new, more stringent federal regulations for nuclear reactors, Americans equated the image of nuclear reactor towers with danger (28.13) and refused to accept new nuclear power plants in their neighborhoods despite a strong industrywide safety record. Not all Americans applauded new environmental regulation. A “Sagebrush Rebellion” arose in the West among conservatives demanding that the federal government return federally controlled lands to the states. Western miners, ranchers, and loggers chafed under new federal restrictions that limited their access to water, their ability to hunt predators, and their grazing rights on federal lands. Western votes helped Ronald Reagan win the presidency in 1980, and as president he listened sympathetically to their complaints about federal environmental policies. An avid outdoorsman who enjoyed riding horses at his California ranch, Reagan did not believe that the environment was in jeopardy. Emphasizing economic growth he loosened recently enacted pollution controls on industry and reduced the size and budget of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an agency founded under Nixon’s watch to enforce federal environmental regulations.

 Which environmental visions prevailed in the 1970s and 1980s?



 CHAPTER 28

RIGHTING A NATION ADRIFT: AMERICA IN THE 1970s AND 1980s

The Rise of the Right
 Successful attacks on environmental regulation were just one component of a resurgent conservative coalition that emerged as the dominant force in American politics in the 1980s. Through right-leaning policy institutes, magazines, lobbying groups, and direct mail campaigns, conservatives spearheaded a powerful political movement whose vision Ronald Reagan championed when he entered the White House. A charismatic leader, Reagan’s unrelenting optimism changed the national mood. The vision of a nation adrift evaporated as confidence in the economy and government rebounded.

The New Conservative
Coalition
 The emerging conservative coalition known as the New Right created alliances among groups with different concerns and views of what America and American government should be, reshaping the Republican Party in the process. Conservatives differed on whether a balanced budget or cutting taxes would guarantee prosperity. They disputed whether the government should actively promote conservative values or adopt a more libertarian approach that reduced governmental activity in all spheres. In the 1970s, the mix of ideas grew even more complicated, when neoconservatives, defectors from the liberal ranks, joined the conservative coalition. Seeking to explain his own political journey from the left to the right, Irving Kristol defined neoconservatives as “liberals who’ve been mugged by reality.” Neoconservatives focused mostly on foreign affairs, urging the nation to cast off its Vietnam hangover and stand proud in the world again. Their insistence that America had the right to act unilaterally in world affairs soon prevailed over lingering noninterventionism in conservative thinking. Former working-class and Southern Democrats also joined the emerging conservative coalition. Angry over court-ordered integration and busing, affirmative action programs that reserved jobs or school slots for minorities, and rising crime, these newcomers accepted the conservative orthodoxy of smaller government when it came to programs that primarily benefited minorities. Ethnic Northern whites in the Rust Belt resented their declining economic clout as industrial jobs evaporated, and they responded to Republican claims that “limousine liberal” elites were out of touch with workingclass America. Finally the popularity of grassroots

 Who made up the New Right?

 conservative movements among burgeoning Sun Belt populations from Florida to Arizona completed the political realignment in the 1980s. In the late 1970s, simmering resentment against increasing taxes exploded into open revolt. Big business and the well-to-do had long championed lower income and corporate taxes. Now the working class and middle class joined the tax revolt by demanding lower property taxes. Voters in California spearheaded the tax rebellion in 1978 when they approved Proposition 13. This ballot referendum, which reduced property taxes by 57 percent, caused drastic cuts in funding for public schools and universities. Voters in other states soon followed suit and increasingly found the Republican anti-tax message appealing. The Republican Party also benefited from the rise of the Religious Right, conservative Christian groups that defended traditional values and supported right-wing political causes—the most sustained grassroots movement of the late twentieth century. Reagan saw the benefits of reaching out to the Religious Right, hoping to create a strong conservative coalition that would “attract those interested in the so-called ‘social issues’ and those interested in economic issues.” Protestant Fundamentalists had mobilized their ranks in the 1920s to end the teaching of evolution in Southern public schools. After the Scopes Trial (see Chapter 21), the mainstream media paid little attention to religious conservatives, but Fundamentalist radio stations, publishing houses, and revival meetings thrived in the South. Fundamentalists ended their self-imposed exile from mainstream politics in the 1950s when religious conservatives supported the nation’s Cold War crusade against godless communism. The Supreme Court’s 1962 ruling against school prayer (see Chapter 27) incensed Fundamentalists, as did Carter’s attempts to revoke

Liberal Democrats, however, suspected that Reagan had a more sinister reason for slashing taxes. Reagan, they charged, planned to starve the budget to force Congress to undertake even more draconian cuts in New Deal and Great Society social welfare programs that conservatives longed to abolish. Liberal Democrats derided his budget proposal as trickledown economics, an approach discredited during the Hoover administration (see Chapter 22), when aid to the wealthy failed to create more jobs for the poor.

28.15 President Reagan Shot, 1981
 The last photo shows Secret Service agent Jerry Parr shoving Reagan into his presidential limousine as a bullet hits him, but no one realized that Reagan had been shot until he reached the hospital.

 Why was Reagan so popular?

 Democrats in Congress were determined to fight Reagan’s proposals. Then a nearly tragic turn of events gave Reagan an unexpected advantage. On March 30, 1981, a deranged 25-year-old named John Hinckley (seeking to impress teenage film actress Jodie Foster) shot Reagan, his press secretary James Brady, and two others outside a Washington hotel. After hearing a firecracker-like pop, news photographer Ron Edmonds took three quick photos (28.15): The first shows the president flinching as he hears shots; the second shows him turning to locate the source of the shooting; in the third, Secret Service agent Jerry Parr pushes Reagan into the presidential limousine as a bullet ricocheted off the car door and hit Reagan under his left armpit. Parr’s quick-thinking is credited with saving Reagan’s life—if Parr had not pushed the president down then the bullet would have likely hit him in the head. In the hospital, with a bullet lodged near his heart, Reagan maintained his trademark cheerfulness, telling his distraught wife, “Honey, I forgot to duck.” Americans rallied to his side, and when Reagan returned to work a month later, he presented his 70 percent approval ratings as evidence that the nation supported his budget proposal. It passed easily with bipartisan support from conservative Democrats. The top tax rate dropped from 70 percent to 50 percent, lowered again to 28 percent in 1986. Reagan’s image as a resolute leader got another boost when he fired 11,000 striking air traffic controllers in August 1981, enforcing a ban on strikes by federal employees working in critical industries. Liberal critics lamented that the president’s act sent a chilling message to organized labor, whose membership rolls and willingness to strike declined throughout the decade. In 1984, Reagan easily won his reelection bid against Democrat Walter Mondale. Mondale energized the Democratic Party when he selected New York Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate, the nation’s first female vice presidential candidate, but he made a key error by stating that he would raise taxes to close the deficit. Mondale expected Americans to reward him for his candor about the worrisome federal debt, but the nation was in no mood to fret. Reagan scored well with television campaign ads that centered on the theme “Morning Again in America.” They featured scenes of small-town America where contented citizens celebrated marriages, schoolchildren pledged allegiance to the flag, and friends laughed together. “America is prouder, stronger, better. Why would we want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?” the voiceover asked. Many Americans agreed, and Reagan won every vote in the Electoral College except those

THE RISE OF THE RIGHT

 from Mondale’s home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia, with a landslide total of 525 to 13. Reagan remained relentlessly pro-business throughout his presidency. Driven to free private industry from government regulations that, in his view, restricted its growth, Reagan convinced Congress to deregulate the savings and loan industry. Once freed from strict government oversight, these banks lost huge amounts of depositors’ money in speculative investments. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush, Reagan’s successor, convinced Congress to bail them out at great cost to taxpayers rather than accept wide-scale bank failures that would certainly have sent the economy into a deep recession. As the budget battles and savings and loan debacle revealed, Reagan’s fiscal policies remained controversial. During his time in office, the federal debt nearly tripled (from $994 billion in 1981 to $2.6 trillion in 1988) as the hoped-for tax revenue failed to materialize and the military build-up continued unabated. After a serious recession in 1981–1983, the economy began to improve as inflation lessened and business activity picked up. The return of prosperity muted the impact of liberal criticism and helped Republicans argue that people at all class levels were doing better financially under Reagan’s stewardship. Democrats and Republicans offered competing visions on the economy throughout the 1980s. Democrats lamented the increased concentration of income in the hands of the top fifth of the population. “What I want to see above all is that this remains a country where someone can always get rich,” Reagan stated in 1983. Chief executive officers (CEOs) of leading corporations had no reason for complaint. Their average salaries, adjusted for inflation, rose from $3 million to $12 million a year during Reagan’s eight years in office, while outlays for subsidized housing dropped from $30 billion to $7 billion. In 1980, the average CEO made 40 times more than the average factory worker. By 1989, CEOs earned 93 times more. To Democrats Reagan’s economic policies helped the rich get richer while the poor got poorer. Republicans countered that consumption was a better measurement of Americans’ overall financial health than income distribution. In the 1980s, Americans went on a buying spree that rivaled the postwar boom of the 1950s, purchasing nearly 88 million cars, 63 million VCRs, and 62 million microwave ovens. Items previously available only to the wealthy, such as refrigerators and telephones, were found in nearly every American household by 1990. While the poorest Americans were not living as well as the richest, their

Brandenberg Gate (1987)




 material circumstances were much improved when compared with those of previous generations. Reagan spoke eloquently about cutting taxes and slashing welfare. He was decidedly less passionate about education, housing, health care, and the environment, often letting subordinates make key decisions in these areas. His hands-off management style differed vastly from Carter’s micromanagement. Reagan rarely worked more than eight hours a day, enjoyed many vacations to his California ranch, and usually took an afternoon nap. “It’s true that hard work never killed anyone, but I figure why take the chance?” he joked. Reagan’s detractors viewed his detachment as senility and charged that he was just a figurehead. Supporters sometimes agreed that Reagan put his trust in the wrong hands. Over 100 members of his administration were indicted or forced to resign amid corruption charges, stemming in part from Reagan’s lax oversight of his subordinates, who often acted without consulting him.

Foreign Policy Triumphs
 and Scandals Reagan did more than reject the liberal economic vision; he also overturned the foreign policy initiatives set in place by his Republican predecessors. He changed the rules of the Cold War by abandoning MAD, the doctrine embraced by American and Soviet policymakers since the 1950s, as the basis for U.S. defense against the Soviet Union. Remaining defenseless against enemy nuclear weapons was an essential component of MAD. The ability to shoot down incoming missiles, the doctrine asserted, might encourage the enemy, who no longer feared its own destruction, to attack. Reagan offered a competing view. “Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope,” he declared in 1983, announcing the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Challenging the view that vulnerability made America more secure, Reagan proposed building a missile shield that used lasers from space satellites to destroy incoming missiles. Publicly, he argued that his plan was compatible with the 1972 ABM treaty (which critics disputed), since he intended to share the technology with the Soviets. Privately, he expected the Soviet Union to go bankrupt trying to match the United States in building its own missile defenses. Despite the billions spent on research, the SDI project failed. SDI nonetheless hurt the Soviet Union. A rapidly changing slate of elderly Soviet leaders responded to Reagan’s challenge much as he expected. The new leaders increased military

 CHAPTER 28

RIGHTING A NATION ADRIFT: AMERICA IN THE 1970s AND 1980s

 spending, ignoring the devastating consequences for Soviet citizens. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union spent between 15 and 17 percent of its GNP on defense, compared to 6.5 percent by the United States. Pervasive shortages meant that Soviet citizens spent hours in long lines outside poorly stocked stores, stoking discontent with communist rule. Closer to home, Reagan looked for ways to destabilize communist and leftist regimes in the Caribbean and Central America, activities portrayed on the map, American Intervention in Latin America, 1980–2000 (28.16). In Nicaragua he hoped to unseat the leftist Sandinistas. Sandinista aid to Marxist rebels battling the pro-American government in El Salvador confirmed Reagan’s fears that communism was on the march in Central America, and he approved covert CIA assistance to the Contras, counterrevolutionary forces in Nicaragua that opposed the Sandinistas. Congress had a different view of Central America. To continue the move away from direct interference in other nations’ domestic affairs (a process begun by Ford and Carter), Congress prohibited the CIA and Department of Defense from funding any effort to overthrow the Sandinistas. National Security Council (NSC) Director Robert McFarlane and his assistant Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North convinced Reagan that these restrictions did not prevent the NSC from soliciting millions from Saudi Arabia and private donors

 to aid the Contras. When Congress heard about these donations in 1984, it prohibited the government from using non-American funds to unseat the Sandinistas. To thwart the regional expansion of communism, in October 1983 Reagan ordered U.S. troops to invade the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada. The president ostensibly dispatched U.S. forces to rescue American medical students trapped in Grenada, when a leftist government seized control. The troops’ real mission was to remove a government seeking Cuban and Soviet military aid. By ordering troops into battle without consulting Congress, Reagan also used his powers as commander-in-chief (some argued unconstitutionally) to restore the strength of the presidency, badly diminished since Watergate. Reagan supporters celebrated America’s swift victory in Grenada, but critics viewed the event differently. They accused Reagan of using the Grenada invasion to distract Americans from more dismal news coming out the Middle East. Two days before the Grenada invasion, an Islamist suicide bomber had plowed a vehicle loaded with explosives into an unsecured barracks housing U.S. peacekeeping troops in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 servicemen. Iranian-backed Islamist terrorist groups (angry over U.S. support for Israel and Iraq, Iran’s enemy) then increased their assaults against the United States by taking Americans hostage in Lebanon.

THE RISE OF THE RIGHT

 Reagan’s desires to end the Middle Eastern hostage crisis and halt the spread of communism in Central America led to the biggest political scandal of his administration. In the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan administration officials sold arms to Iran to secure the hostages’ release and then illegally used the proceeds to support the anti-Communist Contras in Nicaragua. The problems began in 1985 when Reagan asked his new NSC director John Poindexter and Oliver North to devise a covert plan to sell arms to Iran, which needed the weapons for its war with Iraq. As part of the secret agreement, the United States demanded that Iran secure the release of hostages held in Lebanon. After the deal went through, a few hostages were freed, but the arms-for-hostages deal backfired. Reagan’s willingness to pay bribes to free American hostages encouraged militant Islamist groups to seize more over the next two years. Even more troubling, Poindexter and North secretly decided to divert profits from the arms sales to the Contras in Nicaragua—directly violating the congressional ban on aid to the anti-Communist rebels. When an American cargo plane carrying arms to the Contras crashed in 1986, their illegal action was exposed. Convicted of breaking the law, the pair won appeals based on legal technicalities and went free. Poindexter and North claimed that Reagan knew nothing about their illegal diversion of funds to the Contras. “I made a very deliberate decision not to ask the president so I could insulate him,” Poindexter testified before Congress. The public accepted this explanation, viewing Reagan as a hands-off administrator who could not always control his subordinates. With his approval rating dipping to below 50 percent, Reagan hoped to restore confidence in his leadership by improving relations with the Soviet Union. The night before he became the Soviet leader in 1985, 54-year-old Mikhail Gorbachev admitted to his wife, “We can’t go on living like this.” Gorbachev was referring to both the ironclad Soviet control over the domestic economy and the government’s long obsession with a possible American nuclear attack. Gorbachev embraced reform to save the Soviet Union, not destroy it. Eager to reduce Soviet outlays for defense so he could pump funds into the long-ignored economy, Gorbachev also moved to reduce tensions with the United States. When Reagan and Gorbachev met in Washington, D.C., in December 1987, the pair took a historic step by signing the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty that approved the destruction of all U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range missiles in Europe. Past



 arms treaties had curtailed the growth of nuclear stockpiles. For the first time a U.S.-Soviet pact actually reduced nuclear arms. The thaw in relations continued when Gorbachev withdrew Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1988 and reduced support for communist regimes throughout the world. Like Carter, Reagan enjoyed his greatest successes and failures in the foreign policy arena. He rewrote the rules of the Cold War and achieved a new accommodation in U.S.-Soviet relations. The Iran-Contra scandal, however, brought back fears in some circles that the imperial presidency of the Nixon years had returned.

The Reagan Revolution
 Reagan was a popular president, but supporters’ claims of a “Reagan Revolution” appear exaggerated. Reagan lowered taxes for the wealthy and permanently curtailed the growth of the welfare state. He appointed right-leaning judges to the federal judiciary, including Sandra Day O’Connor as the first female Supreme Court justice. Cultural conservatives remained loyal to Reagan even though he offered little more than lip-service to their goals of outlawing abortion, returning prayer to public schools, or ending affirmative action. As president Reagan always won applause when he proclaimed, “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” Yet when he left office, the New Deal and Great Society were as vibrant and relevant as the day he entered the White House. Americans still expected the federal government to pay pensions, guarantee unemployment benefits, curb pollution, and help educate poor children. Rather than leaving an enduring institutional legacy, Reagan presided over a profound shift in political vision. His pro-business policies reinvigorated faith that an unfettered free market could make Americans prosperous, and his open alliance with the Religious Right brought discussion of issues that concerned cultural conservatives into the center of American political discourse. In foreign policy neoconservatives’ interventionist ideas became influential in Republican circles. Finally, “Reagan succeeded in reviving national confidence at a time when there was a great need for inspiration. This was his great contribution as president,” reporter Lou Cannon concluded. In a testament to Reagan’s popularity, George H. W. Bush became the first vice president since Martin Van Buren (who followed the well-liked Andrew Jackson in 1837) to win election immediately after the president under whom he served completed his term.

 How does Reagan’s legacy compare to that left by Franklin D. Roosevelt?

Building a
New World Order
The United States, 1989–2011
 On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 young Arab men boarded four planes on the East Coast. All belonged to the Islamic extremist organization known as al-Qaeda. Within half an hour after take-off, they stormed the cockpits of their planes with box cutters and mace, killed the American pilots, and installed their own pilots (who had each received flight instruction in private American aviation schools) to fly the planes into predetermined targets. At 8:46 a.m. the first plane plowed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, an internationally recognized landmark that symbolized American dominance over the world economy. Seventeen minutes later a second plane hit the South Tower. The nation now understood that what had first looked like a tragic accident was actually a coordinated attack against the United States. A third plane crashed into the Pentagon, headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense, in Virginia, the building most closely associated with U.S. military might in the eyes of the world. Meanwhile passengers in the fourth hijacked plane reached the cockpit and prevented the terrorists from flying the plane into the Capitol, a worldwide symbol of democratic government. This plane instead crashed into a Pennsylvania field. The blazing World Trade Center towers quickly crumbled, with the office workers and firefighters still inside the buildings as onlookers ran for cover. The skeletal ruins and mountains of debris became the burial site for thousands. One onlooker echoed the nation’s sense of disbelief: “This is America. How can it happen in America? How?” The 9/11 attacks, as they came to be known, reshaped the ongoing debate about America’s role in the world and the best way to protect American citizens. Only 20 years earlier Americans had savored their victory in the Cold War as communist governments in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union collapsed. When the Cold War ended, Americans believed that their nation would take the lead in creating a new world order even as they disputed how best to spread democracy, protect the U.S. economy, and flex the nation’s military muscle. Enjoying prosperity for most of the 1990s, the country paid little attention to the new threat that loomed before the world’s sole remaining superpower—terrorist strikes by antiAmerican Islamist extremists, such as al-Qaeda. Political debate instead centered on whether the liberal or conservative vision of government would prevail at home. After 9/11 President George W. Bush moved with resolve to restore the image of America as a powerful and triumphant nation. He led the country into two wars: the first in Afghanistan; the second, far more controversial, in Iraq. In 2008, Americans provided a different sort of history-making moment by electing the first African American president of the United States. By then, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression posed an additional challenge for the nation.

 “None of us will ever forget this day, yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.” President GEORGE W. BUSH, speaking to the nation on the evening of September 11, 2001





 CHAPTER 29

BUILDING A NEW WORLD ORDER: THE UNITED STATES, 1989–2011

 “A Moment Rich with Promise” On his inauguration day in 1989, George H. W. Bush announced that he had become president “at a moment rich with promise.” The fall of communism throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union within the next two years seemed to confirm this judgment. However, the end of the Cold War did not mean peace; the United States immediately fought two short wars in Panama and the Persian Gulf. Conflict also arose at home, as a huge federal deficit and simmering racial tensions that occasionally exploded into violence left some feeling that America’s promise lay unfulfilled.

The Election of 1988
 The son of a former Connecticut senator, George H. W. Bush served as a congressman, ambassador, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director, and vice president before becoming the Republican candidate for president in 1988. In this sense the decorated World War II pilot and former oilman was the ultimate insider, a man familiar with the corridors of power in Washington and the exclusive private clubs where financial deals were negotiated. A moderate Republican with a patrician style, Bush never projected the same charisma or the passion for conservative causes that had drawn voters to Ronald Reagan, the man he hoped to follow as president. Bush’s campaign had to overcome these obstacles when he faced Massachusetts Democratic Governor Michael Dukakis in the presidential contest.

 When Dukakis proposed increased spending on health care, education, and housing, the Bush team ridiculed the Democrat as a big-spending liberal and began calling him the governor of “Taxachusetts.” In his stump speeches Bush also tapped into white peoples’ fears of so-called black criminality by frequently mentioning Willie Horton, an African American prisoner who had taken advantage of a weekend furlough program in Massachusetts and gone on a crime rampage that included raping a white woman. Adding to his woes Dukakis made critical missteps, including one ill-advised photo-op during which he donned an oversized helmet and military jumpsuit to ride a tank (29.1). Most Americans felt that the photo made Dukakis look ridiculous, not presidential. By Election Day Bush had defined Dukakis as someone who would raise taxes and let criminals out of jail, and was

 unprepared to be commander in chief. He defeated Dukakis 426 to 111 in the Electoral College, capturing 53 percent of the popular vote.

 Popular Revolts against Communism When Bush became the 41st president of the United States in 1989, the former director of the CIA remained suspicious about Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev’s true motives for instituting internal reforms and reaching out to the United States (see Chapter 28). Officials worried that Gorbachev “was attempting to kill us with kindness,” according to National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft. Gorbachev was equally distrustful of Bush and his inner circle: “These people were brought up in the years of the Cold War and still do not have any foreign policy alternative.” Caught off guard by the quick demise of communism in Eastern Europe, within a year Bush had changed his mind about Gorbachev “by 180 degrees.” In the first sign of the upheaval to come, Communist Hungary decided to take down the barbed wire fence between it and democratic Austria in May 1989. The East German government watched in dismay as thousands of its citizens drove to the Hungarian-Austrian border and then walked across to defect to the West. Turning to Moscow for help, East Germany received a surprising reply: “We can’t do anything about it.” A similarly uncharacteristic Soviet reaction greeted news that candidates from the democratic Polish workers’ union Solidarity had won control of Poland’s new bicameral Parliament, forming the first democratic government in postwar Eastern Europe. “This is entirely a matter to be decided by Poland,” a Soviet official announced. Soviet, Hungarian, and Polish leaders lifted restrictions on speech, voting, and economic activity to save their Communist regimes, unleashing a tide of popular revolt against Communist rule that soon overwhelmed them. Perhaps nowhere did the fall of communism come faster, and more unexpectedly, than in East Germany. On November 9, 1989, a botched news conference by a harried East German official triggered the destruction of the Berlin Wall. Instead of announcing a relaxation in rules governing travel between East and West Berlin, a confused East German official mistakenly told the press that starting immediately, East Germans could freely leave “through any of the border



 crossings.” Electrified by the news that the wall was open, thousands of people gathered at armed crossing points, places where over 175 East Germans had been shot trying to cross over the last 28 years (see Chapter 24). When confused guards opened the gates, streams of East Germans poured across and joined with West Germans to rejoice atop the Berlin Wall. Images as History: The Fall of the Berlin Wall (page 878) examines the media images that shaped Americans’ reactions to this event. Further evidence of television’s power to mold history came in the following days, as thousands of East Berliners headed for downtown department stores in West Berlin. Concrete walls had not prevented East Berliners from viewing American sitcoms (dubbed in German) showing the abundance of goods available in the West. Television-stoked desires for “worksaving gadgets, [well-stocked pantries], attractive surroundings and a touch of luxury,” one reporter contended, helped bring the Berlin Wall down. Gorbachev’s refusal to intervene with armed force was also critical. Within a year East and West Germany had reunified into one democratic nation, an American goal since the Cold War began in the late 1940s. By the end of 1989, the Soviet Union no longer dominated Eastern Europe, losing territory that it had controlled since the end of World War II. One by one the individual states that formed the Soviet Union also demanded their independence, secession movements that Gorbachev tried to squash with economic embargos and, occasionally, troops. Desperate to stop the hemorrhaging, hard-line Communist insiders orchestrated a coup attempt in August 1990. They put President Gorbachev under house arrest in his vacation home and ringed the Soviet Parliament in Moscow with troops and tanks. Hesitating, the coup leaders lost the military’s support, and the overthrow attempt failed. With the populace now demanding economic reforms and Communist Party officials blaming Gorbachev for losing control, he resigned as head of the Communist Party on August 24, 1990. Five days later the Soviet Communist Party itself was dissolved. By December 25, 1991, he was also no longer president as the Soviet Union ceased to exist, and all its member states, including Russia, became independent nations. After decades of trying to contain, weaken, and defeat the Soviet Union, the United States declared victory in the Cold War. “The Soviet Union did not simply lose the Cold War; the Western democracies won,” Bush announced.

 What role did ordinary citizens play in ending communism in East Germany and the Soviet Union?

Images as History
THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL
Photographs of Berlin had already punctuated key moments in the Cold War for Americans, including images of the 1948–1949 Berlin airlift and the wall’s construction in 1961 to prevent East Berliners from defecting to West Berlin (see Chapter 24). Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan had made welldocumented pilgrimages to the site, where they publicly denounced the Berlin Wall as a symbol of Communist oppression. Now, from the comfort of their living rooms, TV-viewing Americans watched as East and West Berliners climbed atop the wall throughout the night on November 9, 1989 to demand the reunification of their divided city. The fall of communism in Europe reinforced American faith in the superiority of capitalism over communism, but some commentators urged the United States to undertake economic reforms at home to ensure that capitalism operated more fairly. What competing views do this photograph and political cartoon offer Americans about the importance of the Berlin Wall falling? What counter-arguments could critics offer? 
 What symbolic importance did the fall of the Berlin Wall have?

 President Bush told the press that he had no desire “to dance on the wall,” worried that any gloating might goad Gorbachev into sealing up the wall or prompt Soviet hardliners to overthrow Gorbachev.

 The image of one man destroying the wall piece-by-piece with his hammer resonated with Americans—it symbolized the ability of common people to make history and their desire to collect pieces of the wall as souvenirs.

 Attacking the Berlin Wall with a Hammer Would the fall of Communism usher in a better world? Many Americans believed so, but cartoonist Pat Oliphant offered a competing view by implying that free market capitalism did not always benefit everyone equally. The befuddlement of the hungry, homeless man dressed in rags suggests that there is no “we” in the United States—rich and poor view events like the fall of the Berlin Wall differently.

MOMENT RICH WITH PROMISE”

 The U.S. battle against communism was not over, however. On the other side of the world, the Chinese Communist regime made different choices when faced with a popular revolt. In April 1989, university students occupied Tiananmen Square in central Beijing to protest the removal of a high-ranking Communist official who had called for economic and political reforms. Behind closed doors Chinese Communist officials debated whether to end the demonstrations with troops or adopt a Gorbachev-like approach and accommodate some of the students’ demands. On the morning of June 4, tanks appeared in Tiananmen Square, signaling that discussion within the inner circle had ended. Troops shot hundreds as they cleared the area of protesters. Two days later a lone man walking down the deserted Avenue of Eternal Peace made a solitary gesture of defiance by standing steadfast in the middle of the street as 17 tanks approached. When the lead tank swerved right to avoid hitting him, the man stepped right. When it swerved left, he stepped left. Finally the tanks stopped and the man jumped onto the first one, shouting to its driver, “Why are you here? My city is in chaos because of you.” Associated Press photographer Jeff Widener captured this encounter in an award-winning photo seen on newspaper

 front-pages around the globe (29.2). Americans hailed “Tank Man,” as he became known, for his inspirational defense of peace and human rights. No one in China, however, except for the bystanders who whisked him away and the Chinese authorities who probably executed him, ever knew of this encounter. As the economic relationship between the United States and China changed, China’s violent suppression of democracy movements provoked competing visions over how to proceed. In 1900, America wanted to sell China goods; by 1990, American companies increasingly outsourced manufacturing jobs to China, using cheap Chinese labor to satiate American consumers’ demands for affordable goods. Some critics argued that by helping the Chinese government improve the standard of living for ordinary citizens, Americans were also bolstering the autocratic Communist regime. Others countered that recent events in Eastern Europe demonstrated that exposing Chinese citizens to Western values and goods would sow the seeds for an eventual democratic and capitalist revolution. A third faction worried that a prosperous and industrially strong China might replace the United States as the world’s strongest power.

 The growing trade deficit with China (the United States bought more than it sold) was only one economic issue troubling Americans during the Bush years. “Read my lips: No new taxes,” Bush had proclaimed during the 1988 campaign. Once in office, however, he reneged on his pledge by raising income taxes. Faced with the largest deficit in American history, the result of increased defense spending during the Reagan years without any corresponding tax increases and Bush’s own decision to bail out the failing savings and loan industry in 1989 (see Chapter 28), he saw no other option. His decision angered many conservative Republicans, and some never forgave him. “Read My Lips: I Lied,” ran one New York Post headline. The combination of a huge deficit and an unfriendly Democratic majority in Congress discouraged Bush from proposing dramatic new domestic initiatives. A revolution of sorts nonetheless occurred when Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act, a 1990 civil rights law that prohibited discrimination against the disabled in employment, public accommodations, and telecommunications. The disabled gained unprecedented freedom of movement as legally required elevators, ramps, and sloped curbs became commonplace.

 Which gender and racial issues dominated the headlines in the early 1990s?

 During the campaign Bush had courted the conservative wing of the Republican Party by promising to appoint like-minded judges. He fulfilled this pledge by nominating a conservative African American judge, Clarence Thomas, to the Supreme Court when Thurgood Marshall, the Court’s first African American justice, retired. Controversy erupted, when Anita Hill, a former colleague, accused Thomas of sexual harassment, and Thomas responded by calling the televised confirmation hearings a “high-tech lynching.” The Senate ultimately confirmed Thomas by a narrow majority in 1991. With workplace sexual harassment front-page news, an unprecedented number of women won congressional seats in the 1992 elections, including the first female African American senator, Carol Mosley Braun, a Democrat from Illinois. While the Thomas hearings exposed gender discord, the 1991 Los Angeles riots brought simmering racial and ethnic tensions to the surface. In March a 78-mile car chase along Los Angeles freeways ended with white police brutally beating Rodney King, an African American, when he resisted arrest for speeding. A nearby resident captured the incident on film, but Americans differed on what the video revealed (29.3). Most blacks and some sympathetic whites saw a poorly trained and racist police force that harassed blacks, echoing complaints that had set off the Watts riots in 1965 (see Chapter 27).

 Others, including the jury (consisting of ten whites, one Latino, and one Asian American) that acquitted the officers, offered a competing vision. They saw overworked police doing their job to protect law and order in a dangerous neighborhood. The “not guilty” verdict set off four days of rioting in Los Angeles during which Latinos also took to the streets to air their frustration with failing schools and entrenched poverty. Television networks continuously aired footage of black youths assaulting a white truck driver, but paid little attention to the Asian-American–owned stores that blacks and Latinos ransacked as payback for allegedly having refused to serve or hire young men of color.



YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC

 YEMEN:

 Bush did not propose any new initiatives to address gender, racial, or ethnic inequities; his real interest lay in foreign affairs. As he contemplated the new role that the United States should assume in a post–Cold War world, Bush moved to address a festering problem close to home. His administration felt particularly uneasy about returning the Panama Canal in 2000 (see Chapter 28) to a Panamanian dictator who ruthlessly suppressed political opponents and oversaw lucrative drug-trafficking schemes. In December 1989, Bush launched Operation Just Cause, the largest American military campaign since the Vietnam War, to remove Manuel Noriega from power. The Panamanian invasion continued the nation’s long tradition of maintaining Central America as a U.S. sphere of influence. A crisis in the Middle East, however, offered Bush the opportunity to propose a new focus for U.S. foreign policy, now that the Cold War was

 over. Bush faced the severest test of his administration when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, whose nation’s oil fields supplied 11 percent of global oil exports, invaded the neighboring nation of Kuwait, a small country that provided 9 percent of the world’s oil, on August 2, 1990 (29.4). The 1979 Carter Doctrine (see Chapter 28) had already established the oil-rich Persian Gulf as a region vital to national economic and strategic interests. Throughout the 1980s Iranian-financed terrorist attacks and hostage crises in Lebanon convinced the U.S. government that the fundamentalist Islamic government in Iran, not Iraq, posed the major threat in the Persian Gulf. During the eightyear Iraq-Iran War, the United States supplied Iraq with weapons and intelligence. Oil-rich Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, had also lent Iraq billions of dollars to prevent Iranian revolutionary religious fervor from spreading to their kingdoms. When the war ended inconclusively in 1988 after nearly one million combatant deaths, Saddam demanded that Arab nations forgive Iraq’s debt. He harbored particular animosity against

 Kuwait, which he accused of exporting too much oil and depressing world oil prices, thereby hurting the Iraqi financial recovery from the war. When Kuwait refused his demands, Saddam declared that Kuwait had historically been part of Iraq and invaded. After the Iraqi army easily overran Kuwait, President Bush rushed American troops and ships to Saudi Arabia. Operation Desert Shield, the president assured the public, was solely a defensive measure to prevent Iraq from attacking Saudi Arabia. After Saddam announced that he was annexing Kuwait, Bush began to question whether a purely defensive strategy was enough. Now in control of 20 percent of the world’s oil, overnight Iraq became a major rival of Saudi Arabia, which had 26 percent of global oil supplies. With the president now contemplating war, General Colin Powell, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urged Bush to follow the rules of military engagement established in the Reagan years. The Powell Doctrine asserted that America should go to war only as a last resort when the president had full support from the nation and the international community, could employ overwhelming military force to win without serious loss of American life, and had a clear exit strategy. To amass overwhelming military strength, Bush sent Secretary of State James Baker on a diplomatic tour to build an international coalition

 that eventually included 34 nations. Bush secured a United Nations (UN) resolution authorizing military action if Saddam did not withdraw by January 15, 1991. With Saudi Arabia agreeing to serve as the staging ground for the invasion, nearly 500,000 U.S. troops and 65 warships made their way to the Persian Gulf. The Powell Doctrine called for more than overwhelming force; it also required enthusiastic support from the American people for an overseas military campaign. Bush faced stiff opposition from congressional Democrats, who argued that the president, a former Texas oilman, was primarily interested in protecting the lucrative profits of his former oil-business associates who imported oil from the Persian Gulf. Instead of war, Democrats promoted a competing vision that relied on economic sanctions to force Hussein to withdraw. Bush countered that Hussein’s atrocities against his own people, notably his 1988 poison gas attacks against Kurdish villagers in northern Iraq, made him “worse than Hitler.” Echoing Bush’s claim, this political cartoon (29.5) showed Saddam holding a paper labeled “Kuwait takeover” as he looked into the mirror and asked Adolf Hitler’s smiling reflection, “How’m I doing?” Bush, a decorated World War II veteran, reminded Americans that the world’s failure to act when Hitler began his expansionist drive in 1938 had led to World War II. If an emboldened Saddam next attacked Saudi Arabia, he would control nearly half of the world’s oil reserves. Bush also claimed that Saddam was actively trying to acquire nuclear weapons, and if he succeeded, he would be unstoppable. These arguments did not sway Democrats. With a vote split mostly along partisan lines, Congress voted to authorize war according to the terms spelled out in the UN resolution. When the UN deadline for withdrawal passed, the American-led UN coalition attacked Iraq the next day. Once the fighting started public debate ceased, and Americans rallied around the flag. The Persian Gulf War unfolded in two phases. In the 29.5 “Mirror, Mirror on the Wall–How’m I doing?” first phase U.S. forces bombed This 1990 political cartoon supported President George H. W. Bush’s Iraqi installations in Kuwait claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was a modern-day Hitler.

 and major cities in Iraq for 39 days. In Kuwait the massive bombing terrified many poorly trained occupying Iraqi soldiers, and nearly one-quarter of the 400,000-man force deserted. A news team from the cable television news network CNN stayed in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, throughout the bombing, and each night Americans watched their own nation’s missiles streak across the sky and explode. The bombing destroyed Iraq’s power grid, water treatment plants, radio and television stations, and roads—hampering its military activities but also leaving civilians without power or clean water. With Iraqi defenses in shambles from the air attacks, the war’s second phase began when ground troops attacked the Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait on February 23, 1991. General Norman Schwarzkopf led coalition forces during Operation Desert Storm, a massive assault that soundly defeated the Iraqi army within four days, pushing it out of Kuwait. When American soldiers crossed into Iraq, Bush abruptly halted the fighting. The war had lasted a total of 42 days.



 the war beyond its original goal, Bush’s approval ratings soared to 89 percent. The UN peace agreement prohibited Saddam from rearming or acquiring nuclear weapons, restrictions enforced by UN inspectors who stayed in Iraq until 1998. The establishment of no-fly zones over Shiite and Kurdish areas stopped Saddam and his Sunni-dominated government from launching aerial attacks against these minorities within his own nation. The UN also instituted an oil embargo to prevent him from acquiring funds to reconstitute his nuclear weapons program. Critics charged that the embargo led to widespread food and medicine shortages among the civilian population, and failed to prevent Iraq from rearming. Instead of caring for his people, Saddam used the nation’s meager cash flow to continue his lavish lifestyle and secured funds to amass a large arsenal of conventional weapons by illegally smuggling oil through Jordan, Turkey, Syria, and Egypt. When the UN initiated a “foodfor-oil” program in 1996 that allowed Saddam to export some oil legally if he used the profits

The United States would henceforth rely on sanctions to curb Saddam, returning to the strategy of containment that had succeeded against the Soviet Union to win the Cold War. Neoconservatives embraced a competing vision. They viewed the war as an opportunity to remove Saddam from power. Bush advisors, including Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, however, saw no advantage to staying in Iraq. They argued that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to bring together the nation’s three different ethnic and religious groups (Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds), each of which inhabited distinct regions, to form a democratic government. Abiding by the Powell Doctrine’s emphasis on a clear exit strategy, Bush wanted to avoid a long, protracted war that could become a Vietnam-like quagmire. Having suffered relatively few casualties (148 battlefield deaths) and avoided widening

 for humanitarian purposes, civilian conditions improved slightly. Victory in the Persian Gulf War, along with the end of the Cold War, led to a revaluation of American foreign policy goals. After defeating Iraq Bush announced that the United States would build a “new world order,” which he defined as playing an active global peacekeeping role dedicated to spreading democracy and prosperity. Some of his defense advisors encouraged the president to go even further to protect American dominance. In 1992, Cheney and his neoconservative aide, Paul Wolfowitz, asserted that the United States needed to respond immediately, and preemptively, to any foreign nation that challenged American military superiority or attempted to “overturn the established political and economic order.” Bush never publicly embraced these neoconservative principles, but his son George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States, proved more receptive to these ideas.

 What vision of American world leadership did neoconservatives promote?

BUILDING A NEW WORLD ORDER: THE UNITED STATES, 1989–2011

Contested Visions of Government
 The Reagan years had redefined the American political landscape, shifting the political center away from New Deal and Great Society liberal assumptions that government could be a positive force in citizens’ lives. To succeed in this changed political climate, a new breed of Democratic politician was needed—socially liberal but fiscally conservative. The most successful and most controversial “New Democrat” was William “Bill” Jefferson Clinton, who defeated George H. W. Bush in the 1992 presidential election and won reelection in 1996 against Kansas Senator Bob Dole. When Republican George W. Bush won the presidency in the heavily disputed 2000 election, he restored the conservative vision of low taxes and limited regulation that the political right had long championed.

 Clinton’s New Democrats Clinton was relatively unknown when the 1992 presidential campaign began. While governor of Arkansas, at just 44 years of age, Clinton had chaired the Democratic Leadership Council, a group committed to shifting the Democratic Party to the political center by accepting market-based solutions to social problems and ending deficit spending. Exuding boundless energy and a vast knowledge of government, Clinton’s magnetic personality and compassionate nature soon won him a dedicated following. “I feel your pain,” became his mantra as he bear-hugged voters on the campaign trail. Clinton, one commentator noted, cultivated the image of “the president as the guy next door,” who “struggles like the rest of us with his weight, his marriage, and his golf game.” Worried about the nation’s finances, third-party candidate Ross Perot, a self-made Texas billionaire, entered the race and focused almost exclusively on how the federal deficit had ballooned under Bush. Winning 19 percent of the popular vote, Perot registered the best third-party showing since Theodore Roosevelt’s run as the Progressive Party candidate in 1912. Clinton defeated Bush in the Electoral College, 370 to 168, but only 43 percent of the electorate voted for him. Widely praised for his political skills, Clinton nonetheless stumbled badly during his first few weeks in office when he tried and failed to fulfill a campaign pledge to lift the ban against gays in the military. Proponents viewed the issue as a straightforward question of protecting civil rights; opponents countered that ignoring heterosexual soldiers’ objections to serving alongside gay soldiers would undermine military discipline and hurt recruitment.

 How did Clinton’s centrist vision affect his policy decisions?

 Clinton pleased no one with his compromise. Rather than lift the ban, he instituted a policy of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” which allowed closeted homosexuals and lesbians—gays who kept their sexual preferences hidden—to serve in the military. Clinton’s domestic agenda was ambitious, including a comprehensive plan to provide all Americans with health care. He delegated this major policy initiative to Hillary Rodham Clinton, his wife, an attorney with extensive experience in public service. Republicans successfully attacked the plan as “socialized medicine” that would deprive Americans of the freedom to choose their healthcare providers. The plan failed to win congressional approval. Clinton achieved a more modest victory with his tax proposals. Overcoming Republican opposition, he passed an economic stimulus package that offered tax incentives for job creation and increased taxes for large corporations and wealthy Americans— reversing Reagan’s decision to lower taxes on the richest citizens. Clinton also addressed economic problems caused by the recent globalization of the American economy. As late as 1970 most U.S. businesses manufactured strictly for the American market, and few stores stocked items made overseas. By the early 1980s, the United States exported and imported more goods than ever before. Exports rose from $43 billion in 1970 to $178 billion in 2000, while imports surged from $40 billion to $519 billion in 2000 (all figures adjusted for inflation). Importing more than it exported, the nation questioned whether this trade deficit hurt or helped the overall economy. American companies selling products at home now faced stiff competition from foreign manufacturers, while U.S. companies shifted production to places like China and Mexico where

 workers earned less. Globalization, however, also lowered costs for consumers and gave them a greater selection of products. Clinton helped accelerate the trend toward globalization when he broke with organized labor to back the 1992 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a treaty that lifted trade barriers among the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Labor unions opposed NAFTA because they feared that it would encourage U.S. factories to relocate to Mexico, resulting in fewer jobs for American workers. American businesspeople liked NAFTA because it prohibited Mexican companies from manufacturing knock-offs of American products such as films, drugs, and clothing, essentially protecting their overseas and domestic markets by stopping the flow of counterfeit goods. Clinton’s emphasis on free trade reflected his desire to move the Democratic Party to the political center, but his Republican opponents cited his failed healthcare initiative as evidence that he subscribed to the same 1960s liberal vision that had spurred the creation of the Great Society (see Chapter 27). In the 1994 midterm elections, Georgia Congressman Newt Gingrich mobilized the New Right (see Chapter 28) with his call to end the “corrupt liberal welfare state.” The Republicans captured both the House and the Senate for the first time since 1952. Gingrich’s manifesto, “The Contract with America,” envisioned smaller government, less regulation, term limits for members of Congress, welfare reform, and adding a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Little of this ambitious agenda was enacted, partly because Clinton stole some of Gingrich’s thunder by undertaking his own program of welfare reform. Modifying legislation passed during the New Deal, he joined with Republicans and conservative Democrats in Congress to reduce the time that families (mostly single mothers) with dependent children could receive financial assistance. Clinton also tried to appeal to fiscal conservatives by balancing the federal budget for the first time in 30 years. Clinton used his superior political skills not only to weaken the Republican resurgence but also to survive the scandals that plagued his presidency. In 1994, a special federal prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, began investigating charges that the president had

 participated in a fraudulent land deal during his tenure as Arkansas attorney general. During his investigation, Starr learned that President Clinton had engaged in a sexual relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was not the first president to have extramarital dalliances, but when giving testimony under oath on an unrelated matter, he denied the affair. Seven months later the president publicly acknowledged that he had lied as seen in this New York Daily News headline reporting his televised address to the nation (29.6). Republicans argued that Clinton’s failure to tell the truth warranted impeachment. In 1998, the Republicancontrolled House of Representatives completed the first stage of impeachment by voting that the president had lied under oath and obstructed justice. The Senate now had to decide whether these infractions met the constitutional test of “high crimes and misdemeanors” needed to remove a president from office. Ten Republican senators joined with Democrats in defeating the first charge of perjury by a vote of 55 to 45. The second charge of obstructing justice resulted in a 50 to 50 tie. Neither charge obtained the requisite two-thirds vote required to remove Clinton from the White House. Clinton survived impeachment by cultivating the same “everyman” appeal that won him the presidency. “The essence of Clinton’s success has been to persuade America that this scandal is about human weakness, not crime, and that at its core is not a string of felonies but a sin familiar to all—adultery,” lamented conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan. The strong economy also helped keep Clinton’s approval ratings near 60 percent throughout the ordeal.



 29.6 Clinton’s Sex Scandal When Clinton finally admitted to an “inappropriate relationship” with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, the lies he had previously told to cover it up led to his impeachment.

 How did Clinton’s sex scandal compare to the Reagan-era Iran-Contra scandal (see Chapter 28)?



 CHAPTER 29

BUILDING A NEW WORLD ORDER: THE UNITED STATES, 1989–2011

The Disputed Election
 of 2000 The election of 2000 again offered voters two competing notions of the role that the government should play in American society. Democrat Al Gore, then serving as vice president under Bill Clinton, ran against Republican George W. Bush, the son of former president George H. W. Bush. More liberal than Clinton, Gore was a well-known environmentalist whose pedantic manner often made him appear wooden. Bush was a born-again evangelical Christian who had cultivated a folksy persona while governor of Texas. Reflecting the generally prosperous times, the two candidates put forward competing visions on how to spend the projected federal surplus. Calling it “the people’s money,” Bush proposed enormous tax cuts that he argued would fuel investment and economic growth. Rejecting the Democrat’s emphasis on federal government activism, Bush vowed to create an “ownership society” where people had more control over their wealth, Social Security retirement accounts, health care, and property. Gore adhered to the traditional Democratic vision of using government regulation and federally funded programs to promote equity, environmental responsibility, and prosperity. He charged that Bush’s tax cuts would disproportionately help the wealthy and starve federal programs for the poor. Gore proposed saving the surplus to prepare for the coming explosion in Social Security payments once the baby boom generation began retiring. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, a consumer advocate who railed against corporate greed, and the conservative Patrick Buchanan, who ran on the Reform Party ticket, also entered the race.

29.7 Hanging Chads
A
Florida election worker uses a magnifying glass to try to determine which candidate this voter had selected, reflecting the closeness of the 2000 presidential election. 
 Why was the 2000 presidential election so controversial?

 In an age of machine-counted votes and instantaneous communication, Americans expected complete results on election night. However, with several states too close to call that evening, it took a few days before Gore emerged with 266 electoral votes, three short of the 270 required to win the presidency, to Bush’s 246. All eyes now turned to Florida where a riveting 36-day drama unfurled over recounting ballots that vote-counting machines had rejected because voters had not completely punched the perforated box next to the candidate’s name. Gore’s team went to state court and won a hand recount in four primarily Democratic counties. Election inspectors, like the one pictured here (29.7), spent hours examining “hanging chads,” partially punched boxes, to determine voters’ intent. Arguing that time for a recount had run out, Republican Florida officials certified that Bush had won the state. The battle now moved to the Supreme Court, where conservative justices accepted the Republican argument that the different standards used by inspectors to include or reject ballots violated the “equal protection” clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As the map (29.8) shows, although Gore won the national popular vote, by winning Florida, Bush had the 271 electoral votes to win the election. Echoing the outraged Democratic response to the Supreme Court’s decision to halt the recount, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, “Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year’s Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.” Subsequent privately funded recounts undertaken by major news organizations all concluded that Bush had indeed won Florida. The election results continued to rankle Democrats. Besides questioning poor ballot design and Supreme Court partisanship, Democrats charged that Florida Republicans had used shady tactics

Transforming Daily Life
 In the 1990s, computers altered daily life in countless ways, becoming essential to work and leisure. The Monica Lewinsky scandal broke on the Internet, revealing how the emergence of the World Wide Web transformed the way Americans communicated with one another in the 1990s. Demographic shifts also reshaped American society. Fewer heterosexual American couples married, while the desire of gay couples to wed provoked heated debate over the meaning of marriage. A sizable population of senior citizens emerged, and new immigrant communities formed across the nation. Meanwhile environmentalists worried about humaninduced climate changes and entreated Americans to stop using fossil fuels to run their cars and factories.

 the twenty-first century. Virtual business meetings now took place among geographically dispersed colleagues who looked into small cameras attached to their computers to converse with the people they saw on their screens. Office workers working in the same building sent a stream of e-mails to each other throughout the day, rather than telephoning or delivering a message in person. Many companies replaced paper records with computer databases that stored personal and commercial data. Americans differed on the benefits that children derived from this new technology. A generation of youth hooked on computer games alarmed commentators who worried that their sedentary lifestyle was fueling an epidemic of childhood obesity. Others fretted that violent computer games desensitized children to real-world violence. Schools, however, quickly brought the Internet into the classroom. By simply typing a phrase into an Internet search engine, researchers of all ages gained instant access to information from libraries throughout the world. The Internet facilitated the spread of misinformation as well. Anyone could create a Web site, allowing virtual communities to form around almost any issue. A great resource for researching a medical condition, the Internet also helped terrorists publicize their causes and killings around the world. The Internet reshaped commerce, becoming a virtual shopping mall and entertainment center as entrepreneurs rushed to market their wares. Shopping on the Internet, however, differed from taking a stroll down Main Street. The Internet-based company Amazon.com not only sold books more cheaply but built virtual communities in which readers posted their own reviews of books and sold used copies. The privacy and accessibility that the Internet afforded gave the pornography and gambling industries a boost, drawing millions of customers on a daily basis. To pay the credit card bills that they accumulated while shopping online, many Americans stopped sending checks through the mail and began using the Internet to pay their bills electronically. Droves of Americans stopped watching their favorite shows on TV when broadcast, preferring instead to watch them through the Internet when it was convenient.

 title character’s decision to have a child. Quayle voiced the New Right’s lament that marriage had lost ground to nontraditional family arrangements. The charts “American Family Structure, 1972” and “American Family Structure, 1998” (29.9) show that the composition of the American family had indeed changed radically in less than a generation. By 1998, 47 percent of American families lived in non-married households, both with and without children, compared to 26 percent in 1972. Gender roles within families also changed. In the traditional model of marriage, the husband worked and the wife stayed at home. By the end of the 1990s, most married couples worked outside the home. Changing family structure prompted sometimes acrimonious debate between the New Right, who wanted to reverse these trends, and liberal Democrats, who championed the right of non-married partners to cohabitate and of single women to have children. Many people who considered themselves liberal on myriad economic and social issues, however, joined with the New Right in condemning same-sex or gay marriage.

 together, people on both ends of the political spectrum drew the line at same-sex marriages. In 1996, Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law that defined marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman. Under this statute states that banned same-sex marriages did not have to accept legal marriages performed in other states, if a gay couple moved to their jurisdiction. In 2011, only Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Iowa, Washington, D.C., and New York allowed same-sex marriages. Nine other states authorized “civil unions” between same-sex partners that granted them rights similar to those accorded married couples. Most of the remaining states, either through referendum or stature, prohibited same-sex marriage. But after lower federal courts ruled DOMA unconstitutional, the Justice Department stopped defending legal challenges to it in 2011. This opened up the possibility that all states would be required to recognize samesex marriages performed elsewhere. The debate over gay marriage received a tremendous amount of press exposure, but few reporters paid much attention to how the graying of America was altering family life. Life expectancy had increased thanks to improved medical care and decreasing poverty. Many middle-aged parents finished raising their children only to discover that their aging parents needed full-time caretaking. As the population aged, Social Security and Medicare payments went up, but a declining birthrate meant that there were fewer native-born workers available to pay the taxes that kept this social welfare system afloat. Over the last 25 years of the twentieth century, the birth rate had declined from 18.4 births for every 1,000 people in 1970 to 14.8 in 1996. Faced with a labor shortage of able-bodied workers, the nation turned, as it had in the past, to immigrants to fill available jobs.

 What competing visions emerged over same-sex marriage?

A
Wave of Immigration  The massive wave of immigration that began after Congress eliminated national quotas in 1965 initiated another important social transformation. Between 1931 and 1965, around five million immigrants came to the United States. These numbers skyrocketed to 4.5 million in the 1970s; 7.3 million in the 1980s; and 9.1 million in the 1990s. Hundreds of thousands more entered the country illegally. Most of these immigrants came from Asia, Africa, and Latin America—only two million Europeans settled in the United States between 1980 and 2000. Some Americans satirically referred to the exploding Hispanic immigrant population in the Southwest as the reconquista, or reconquest of territory that Mexico had lost to the United States after the Mexican-American War of 1848 (see Chapter 11). Overall the United States attracted twice as many immigrants as all of the other nations in the world combined. Competing claims about the economic benefits of immigration emerged, a debate explored more fully in Competing Visions: The Economic Costs of Immigration. The New Right also feared dire cultural consequences as the nation fragmented into permanent ethnic enclaves. “If America is to survive as ‘one nation, one people’ we need to call a ‘time-out’ on immigration, to assimilate the tens of millions who have lately arrived,” exhorted Patrick Buchanan. To protect the nation’s cultural cohesion, these right-leaning critics organized campaigns to make English the nation’s official language. Both Democrats and Republicans worried that immigrants, who were willing to work for less, took jobs away from native-born workers. Critics especially denounced illegal immigration, arguing that people who sneaked across the border often violated other laws as well. Illegal immigrants sent their

Competing Visions
THE ECONOMIC COSTS OF IMMIGRATION
To this day Americans continue to disagree about the economic costs of immigration. In the following passage Harvard economist George J. Borjas paints a pessimistic economic portrait. Tamar Jacoby disputes his claim that three decades of high immigration have hurt the U.S. economy. What factors does each emphasize to make a case? George J. Borjas suggested that immigration affected socioeconomic groups differently in his 1996 article “The New Economics of Immigration: Affluent Americans Gain: Poor Americans Lose.” New research has established a number of points. The relative skills of successive immigrant waves have declined over much of the postwar period. In 1970, for example, the latest immigrant arrivals on average had 0.4 fewer years of schooling and earned 17 percent less than natives. By 1990 the most recently arrived immigrants had 1.3 fewer years of schooling and earned 32 percent less than natives … The large-scale migration of less-skilled workers has done harm to the economic opportunities of less-skilled natives. Immigration may account for perhaps a third of the recent decline in the relative wages of less-educated native workers … The increasing welfare dependency in the immigrant population suggests that immigration may create a substantial fiscal burden on the most-affected localities and states … There exists a strong correlation between the skills of immigrants and the skills of their American-born children, so that the huge skill differentials observed among today’s foreign-born groups will almost certainly become tomorrow’s differences among American-born ethnic groups. In effect, immigration has set the stage for sizable ethnic differences in skills and socioeconomic outcomes, which are sure to be the focus of intense attention in the next century … Current immigration redistributes wealth from unskilled workers, whose wages are lowered by immigrants, to skilled workers and owners of companies that buy immigrants’ services, and from taxpayers who bear the burden of paying for the social services used by immigrants to consumers who use the goods and services produced by immigrants.… Immigration changes how the economic pie is sliced up.… The harmful effects of immigration will not go away simply because some people do not wish to see them. 
View the Closer Look Competing Visions: The
Economic Costs of Immigration


 In her 2002 article “Too Many Immigrants,” Tamar Jacoby argued that large-scale immigration benefited the United States economically. The most commonly heard complaint about foreign workers is that they take jobs from Americans. Not only is this assertion untrue—nobody has found real evidence to support it—but cities and states with the largest immigrant populations (New York, Los Angeles, and others) boast far faster economic growth and lower unemployment than cities and states that do not attract immigrants. In many places, the presence of immigrants seems to reduce unemployment even among native-born blacks—probably because of the way immigrants stimulate economic growth.… Even if Borjas is right that a native-born black worker may take home $300 less a year as a result of immigration, this is a fairly small amount of money in the overall scheme of things. More to the point, globalization would have much the same effect on wages, immigrants or no immigrants … What about the costs imposed by immigrants, especially by their use of government services? It is true that many immigrants—though far from all—are poorer than nativeborn Americans, and thus pay less in taxes. It is also true that one small segment of the immigrant population— refugees—tends to be heavily dependent on welfare. As a result, states with large immigrant populations often face chronic fiscal problems.… [But] If we shift the lens to the federal level, and include the taxes that immigrants remit to the IRS, the calculation comes out very differently: immigrants pay in more than they take out.… 28 million immigrants form but a small part of the $12-trillion U.S. economy, and most of the fiscal costs and benefits associated with them are relatively modest. Besides, fiscal calculations are only a small part of the larger economic picture. How do we measure the energy immigrants bring—the pluck and grit and willingness to improvise and innovate? Not only are immigrants by and large harder-working than the native-born, they generally fill economic niches that would otherwise go wanting.

 Are contemporary concerns about immigration similar or different from objections made earlier in the twentieth century?

 children to school and received health care in hospitals, all at taxpayer expense, they charged. Unions and their supporters complained that undocumented workers could not join labor unions, making it more difficult to organize labor to improve working conditions and wages. Champions of immigration, mostly from the political left, pointed to the nation’s past success in assimilating immigrants and argued that immigrants took the low-paying jobs such as busboys, gardeners, and nannies that few Americans wanted. Countering claims that new immigrants failed to assimilate, advocates of immigration noted the high rate of interethnic marriages among second-generation immigrants. They also viewed complaints about multiculturalism as a racist attempt to protect the United States as a primarily white society. The different meanings attached to the word “benefits” in this political cartoon by Brian Fairrington (29.10) encapsulated the debate over whether immigrants drained the economy by seeking taxpayer-funded social services or contributed to overall prosperity by working for very little.

Climate Change
 The computer revolution and shifting demographics were not the only factors changing American daily life. Scientists worried that accelerated climate change threatened to reshape the physical space that Americans inhabited and urged the nation to reverse human-induced environmental damage. They entreated Americans to switch from gas-guzzling cars like sport-utility

 vehicles (SUVs) to automobiles that burned little or no fossil fuels. Americans, 4.5 percent of the global population, drove 24 percent of the world’s 590 million cars. Ingrained driving habits, however, were hard to change. Environmental scientists claimed that average temperatures had risen 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 100 years, a phenomenon called global warming. They attributed this climate shift to the widespread burning of fossil fuels (coal and oil) that pumped carbon dioxide into the air. Carbon dioxide was one of several greenhouse gases that trapped the sun’s heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. While the sun’s rays were essential to human life, environmentalists blamed the rapidly rising levels of greenhouse gases for global warming. This 2007 world map (29.11) shows which nations emitted the greatest amounts of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. The United States, China, Russia, India, and Japan head the list. Developing nations in Africa with few cars or heavy industry emitted relatively little carbon dioxide. Besides emitting more total greenhouse gases than most other nations, the United States ranked tenth in the amount of greenhouse emissions per person. Why did global warming matter? The quickerthan-normal melting of the Arctic ice cap, environmentalists warned, was causing sea levels to rise. If unchecked, rising waters would soon wash over sea-level lands throughout the world including the Mississippi Delta in the United States. Scientists also speculated that global warming affected rainfall patterns and storms, increasing droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes. Not everyone in the United States accepted these dire predictions. Some Americans questioned the scientific evidence linking climate change to human activity. Fluctuations in the earth’s average temperature had occurred before, they argued, disputing the claim that permanent or catastrophic change in the atmosphere was underway. In 1997, the United States signed the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement that set targets for reducing greenhouse emissions in industrial nations. In 2001, however, President George W. Bush argued that the agreement was flawed because it exempted China and relied on governmental controls, not market incentives, to develop “green” technology. The United States subsequently became the only nation besides Australia to sign, but not ratify, the treaty.

 needed to change. Enjoying low gas prices few Americans felt compelled to invest time or money into developing “green” technology. National security concerns proved more effective in motivating the nation to re-examine its energy policy. The United States imported 65 percent of its oil, with Canada providing the largest share. After 9/11, a consensus emerged that the ongoing American presence in the Middle East (which provided 11 percent of the oil Americans consumed) bred resentment among Arab populations that helped Islamist terrorists recruit members.

 Republicans and Democrats, however, disagreed over how to wean the nation off its dependence on foreign oil. The Bush administration championed bolstering oil production at home by lifting restrictions on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a nationally protected wilderness in Alaska. This proposal enraged environmentalists and Democrats who worried that drilling accidents could contaminate this pristine area. They also feared losing valuable time in the battle against global warming by continuing, rather than ending, fossil fuel consumption.

New Threats in the
Post–Cold War World
 Middle East oil remained critical to the American economy throughout the 1990s and 2010s. Containing Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein presented an ongoing challenge for Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Ethnic cleansing in Eastern Europe and Africa raised additional questions of how much responsibility America should assume to prevent massacres worldwide. When Islamic terrorists attacked U.S. targets overseas and at home, competing visions also arose over how to defend the nation from this new threat.

Ethnic Cleansing
 and Terrorism In the 1990s, the nation faced a new foreign policy dilemma: when or whether to intercede on humanitarian grounds to stop massacres in parts of the world strategically unimportant to the United States. In 1992, images of a civil-war induced famine in Somalia, a country in East Africa, flooded American airwaves and newspapers. This image of a Somali woman and her starving child (29.12) echoed the Madonna and Child compositions used

 Photographs like this one of a starving Somali woman and child prompted Americans to demand that the United States send troops to end the civil war responsible for the famine. A year later, angered by a photograph of Somali rebels dragging the corpse of an American soldier through the streets, Americans called for the return of U.S. troops. Both images encouraged Americans to view African nations as dysfunctional places where famine and fighting were endemic.

 by Jacob Riis during the Gilded Age (see Chapter 17) and Dorothea Lange during the Depression (see Chapter 22) to rally popular support for aiding the poor. President George H. W. Bush responded to the public outcry by sending U.S. troops to help UN peacekeepers restore order, aid that incoming President Bill Clinton continued. Public opinion shifted dramatically in 1993, however, when news cameras captured the image of cheering Somalis dragging the corpse of an American soldier through the streets of Mogadishu, the capital city of Somalia, after rebel Somali warlords downed a U.S. helicopter (29.13). The

NEW THREATS IN THE POST–COLD WAR WORLD

 public now demanded an immediate withdrawal, and Clinton complied. The UN also withdrew its troops, and years of anarchy in Somalia followed. Reluctant to jeopardize American soldiers’ lives again, Clinton proceeded cautiously in April 1994 when Hutus, the majority ethnic group in Rwanda, a nation in Central Africa, unleashed a 100-day genocidal rampage that killed 800,000 Tutsis, a minority ethic group. This time Clinton came under attack for failing to intervene decisively with force. The photo of Somalis desecrating the corpse of an American soldier had other repercussions. Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who headed al-Qaeda, a fundamentalist Islamic terrorist organization, concluded that terrorist attacks against the United States would work, because Americans had no stomach for casualties. “One American pilot was dragged in the streets of Mogadishu [and] you left…. the extent of your impotence and weaknesses became very clear,” he jeered in 1996. Such pronouncements caused Paul Watson, the photojournalist who took the Pulitzer-prize winning image, to conclude that the “storm of outrage” over his photo taught terrorists that they could rely on publicity in the Western media to amplify the impact of their terrorist attacks. During his first years in office, Clinton also had to respond to “ethnic cleansing,” the intentional mass killing of one ethnic group by another, in the Balkans, a mountainous region of southeastern Europe. When Communist Yugoslavia dissolved in 1991, ethnic and religious differences provoked a civil war among Croatia, Bosnia, and Serbia, all former parts of Yugoslavia. Clinton resisted intervening until July 1995 when Serbian forces forced 25,000 Bosnian Muslim women and children to leave the town of Srebrenica, and murdered the 7,500 Muslim men and boys who remained behind. The United States participated in NATO air strikes of Serbian military positions and helped broker the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords, which settled disputed territorial boundaries and placed NATO troops (including Americans) on the ground as peacekeepers. Preoccupied with humanitarian tragedies overseas, Americans paid less attention in the early 1990s to signs that the terrorist threat was moving closer to home. Many Arabs saw the United States and Israel as one, blaming both for taking away land that belonged to the Palestinians. Overseas hostagetakings and plane hijackings in the 1970s and 1980s kept the Arab-Israeli conflict in the news. In 1993, Kuwaiti and Iraqi-born terrorists exploded a massive car bomb in the parking garage of the World Trade



 Center, two towering skyscrapers in the heart of New York City’s financial district that housed governmental agencies and companies involved in foreign trade. The explosion killed six people and created a six-story hole in the ground. The FBI captured the culprits easily when one tried to recover his deposit from a car rental agency for the van used in the attack. Reassured that law enforcement agencies had done their job and that the terrorists were inept, the public and government quickly forgot the incident. But al-Qaeda, which maintained training bases in Afghanistan, resolved to try again. Determined to launch a jihad, or holy war against Western nonbelievers, bin Laden relied on his family’s fortune and donations from Saudi Arabians to construct a clandestine terrorist network that recruited disciples from the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Not all terrorist threats during this period originated overseas. On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh parked a rental truck filled with explosives in front of a federal building in Oklahoma City. The blast killed 168 people, including many children in a day care center, and wounded 800. McVeigh and his accomplice Terry Nichols viewed the attack as payback for the federal government’s recent assaults against private paramilitary groups and their rural compounds filled with caches of weapons. Militia supporters like McVeigh rejected any legal restriction on their Second Amendment right to bear arms, citing gun laws as just one example of government tyranny. The bombing remained the deadliest terrorist attack against American civilians until 9/11. Meanwhile al-Qaeda attacked U.S. targets overseas. Issuing a fatwa, or religious decree, declaring war against all Americans, bin Laden demanded that the United States remove its troops from Saudi Arabia (stationed there since the 1991 Persian Gulf War) and end its support of Israel. “It is more important for Muslims to kill Americans than other infidels,” bin Laden declared. This pronouncement was more than rhetoric. In August 1998, al-Qaeda terrorists bombed the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, a city in Tanzania. Clinton ordered an immediate retaliatory attack, and tomahawk cruise missiles rained down on eight al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, which was thought to have supplied bin Laden with chemical weapons. His advisors presented Clinton with competing views over the next possible step. His antiterrorist advisor recommended continuing the bombing until the Taliban, Afghanistan’s fundamentalist Islamic

 government, turned bin Laden over to the United States. Pentagon officials opposed sustained bombing, worried that mounting civilian casualties would inflame anti-American sentiments throughout the Middle East. Assassinating bin Laden, others argued, would turn him into a martyr whose death fundamentalists would certainly avenge. Faced with these conflicting views, Clinton chose to rely on the CIA to thwart terrorist attacks against U.S. targets overseas. These covert agents uncovered several planned attacks but failed to prevent al-Qaeda from sending a small explosiveladen boat into the side of the USS Cole, a destroyer, which was anchored near the Middle Eastern

 country of Yemen. The October 12, 2000, assault killed 17 sailors and injured 40. Clinton left office still waiting for verification that al-Qaeda was behind this attack. Incoming President George W. Bush received that confirmation, but had not settled on a response when al-Qaeda struck again on September 11, 2001.

9/11
 On the morning of September 11, 2001, in an attack that became known as 9/11, 19 terrorists operating from al-Qaeda cells inside the United States hijacked four planes. The terrorists, from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates, flew two planes into the World Trade Center towers, and a third into the Pentagon. The fourth plane crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after the passengers seized control of the cockpit, thwarting the terrorist plan to fly it into the Capitol. On this “day of terror,” Americans watched in horror as the World Trade Center towers crumbled, causing rescue workers, victims, and onlookers to run for safety as the massive structures collapsed in a heap (29.14). A total of 2,973 people died in the attacks. President Bush immediately announced that “we will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.” He issued an ultimatum to Afghanistan’s Taliban government: turn over al-Qaeda members living there, including bin Laden, or face invasion. The Taliban refused. Receiving overwhelming support from Congress, the American people, and most foreign nations, the United States attacked Afghanistan on October 7, 2001. U.S. forces first bombed al-Qaeda training camps and arms depots, and then joined with the Northern Alliance, an Afghan rebel group, to drive the Taliban from power. The two-month conflict failed, however, to capture bin Laden, who had likely escaped into the mountains of neighboring Pakistan with help from Pakistani sympathizers. Most Americans had supported the invasion, but many grew uneasy about how the Bush administration was conducting the war. These critics accused Bush of condoning torture by allowing CIA agents to use water-boarding, an interrogation tactic that simulated drowning, to try to extract information from captured al-Qaeda suspects held prisoner at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay in Cuba. The decision to incarcerate captured prisoners indefinitely at Guantánamo Bay, denying them the right to a fair trial, also aroused controversy.

NEW THREATS IN THE POST–COLD WAR WORLD

 Responding to criticism that the nation’s security agencies had failed to prevent the 9/11 attack, the president created the Department of Homeland Security, a new umbrella organization that housed the nation’s intelligence-gathering and law enforcement agencies. He also secured congressional approval for the 2001 Patriot Act, which expanded the government’s investigative and police powers. Critics soon attacked the law as an unconstitutional assault on civil liberties. This 2002 political cartoon by Pulitzer Prize winner Clay Bennett (29.15) exposed a familiar wartime dilemma—how to protect the nation against enemy agents operating on American soil while simultaneously safeguarding the privacy rights of Americans. In the cartoon determined federal workers remove planks from a couple’s home to build a security fence, exposing their personal lives to public scrutiny. In the weeks after the 9/11 attacks, the FBI arrested hundreds of Arabs and Muslims in an effort to destroy any remaining al-Qaeda cells in the United States. Acting hastily, and often

 on flimsy evidence, the FBI caught innocent people in its dragnet, and some spent months in jail before being released. Scores of Arab Americans, like Japanese Americans in World War II, hung American flags outside their businesses to counter suspicions that all Muslims were terrorists. In 2007, a federal court overturned the sections of the Patriot Act that made it easier for the government to secure search warrants as well as Internet and phone records.

The Iraq War
 America’s “war on terror” soon spread to Iraq. Containing Saddam Hussein’s ambition to acquire weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons) had been an ongoing goal since the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. In 1998, the UN halted its weapons inspection program after Iraq refused to continue cooperating. President Clinton subsequently authorized Operation Desert Fox, a four-day

 bombing campaign in December 1998 against 100 Iraqi military targets to destroy any weapons Saddam was hiding. Neoconservatives publicly urged Clinton to make removing Saddam a goal of American foreign policy. They had the chance to advance their views more forcefully once Bush appointed neoconservatives to key defenserelated positions, including Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. This core of key neoconservative defense policy advisors included Vice President Dick Cheney. Reversing his previous stand when he had counseled the first President Bush to stop the Persian Gulf War without attacking Baghdad, Cheney, along with others, urged the president to attack Iraq while public concern about national security remained high. “Do we wait and hope he doesn’t do what we know he is capable of, which is distributing weapons of mass destruction to anonymous terrorists, or do we take preemptive action?” asked neoconservative Richard Perle, chairman of the Defense Policy Board. These advisors championed preemptive war, the doctrine that the United States should use force to remove hostile regimes before they could pose a serious threat.

 “Our security will require all Americans to be forward-looking and resolute, to be ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty and to defend our lives.” President GEORGE W. BUSH, announcing a shift in foreign policy from containment to preemption, 2002 State Department officials, especially Secretary of State Colin Powell, disagreed. They offered a competing vision that relied on the same Cold War–era containment policies that had eventually toppled the Soviet Union. Those urging restraint worried that a hostile fundamentalist Islamic government might replace Saddam’s secular regime, fueling rather than dampening the terrorist threat against the United States. “Better the devil we know than the one we don’t,” one high-ranking intelligence official reasoned.

 the options before Bush as he made his decision to attack Iraq. Having privately resolved to topple Saddam Hussein, Bush began laying the groundwork for sending American troops into Iraq. In September 2002, his administration announced a new national security strategy. The Bush Doctrine established the unilateral right to attack nations that harbored terrorists, to launch preemptive military strikes to prevent future attacks on the United States, and to replace autocratic governments with democratically elected ones. The inclusion of preemptive war was new, but other parts of the Bush Doctrine reiterated key principles announced by Bush’s father when he defined a new post–Cold War direction for American foreign policy in 1992. Neoconservative Paul Wolfowitz played a key role in both administrations, devising a foreign policy that aggressively protected America’s singular status as the world’s strongest military power. In building his case for war, the president repeatedly claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and had links to terrorist organizations, including al-Qaeda. By the summer of 2002, this rhetoric had convinced 54 percent of the American public of the falsehood that Saddam was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. To win support in the international community and at home, Bush sought both a UN resolution demanding that Iraq readmit weapons inspectors and a congressional joint resolution authorizing the use of force to enforce UN mandates and remove the “continuing threat” that Saddam posed. In arguing for war the administration pointed to secret correspondence between Iraq and Niger provided by Italian intelligence agents indicating that between 1999 and 2001 Saddam had made overtures to buy uranium oxide, material used to build a nuclear bomb, from Niger. Some CIA agents, including the envoy sent to Niger to investigate, privately doubted that Saddam had tried to buy uranium from Niger. This charge, however, convinced wavering Democrats to support the war. When the International Atomic Energy Agency announced that these incriminating letters were indeed forgeries, antiwar advocates charged that Bush had deliberately misled the country to build his case for war. The Iraq War followed the same pattern as the 1991 Persian Gulf War—intense bombing followed by a ground invasion. The bombing campaign began on March 19, 2003, and within three weeks

Choices and Consequences
LAUNCHING A PREEMPTIVE WAR
In 2002, the Bush administration feared that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had acquired, or was on the verge of acquiring, nuclear weapons and was developing chemical and biological weapons. President Bush worried that once Hussein acquired a sizeable arsenal, he would use it against his neighbors, including Israel, and help terrorists attack the United States. His advisors gave Bush three options about how to proceed. 
Choices




 Launch a preemptive war to remove Saddam from power.



 Work through the UN to impose economic sanctions and send weapons inspectors to Iraq.



 Support Iraqi exiles’ plan to organize a coup that might trigger a mass uprising.

Decision
 In February 2002, Bush decided to fight. He announced that Saddam harbored weapons of mass destruction and had aided al-Qaeda. He made a half-hearted effort to work with the UN to reconstitute the weapons inspection program halted in 1998 and secured support from a handful of potential allies if the United States went to war. Announcing that Saddam had refused to cooperate adequately with UN weapons inspectors, the United States attacked Iraq on March 19, 2003.

Consequences
 Active combat lasted three weeks and toppled Saddam. No weapons of mass destruction were found. Iraq elected a democratic government that struggled to contain ethnic and religious strife. U.S. forces came under daily attack until a surge of troops in 2008 weakened rebel insurgencies.

 Looking for a coherent Iraq policy, Jack Ohman, The Oregonian, 2002

Continuing Controversies
 Was the Iraq War justified? Supporters of Bush’s policies argued that removing Saddam benefited the Iraqi people and the world. Building a stable, democratic, and militarily weakened Iraq was necessary to protect American interests in the strategically and economically important Persian Gulf. The 9/11 attacks demonstrated that the United States must act aggressively and preemptively overseas to prevent future strikes on its own soil. Critics argued that Bush misled the American

 people by making false claims that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction and had ties to al-Qaeda. The war made America less secure by fanning antiAmerican sentiments in the Middle East that helped al-Qaeda recruit and diverted resources from the war in Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda was regrouping. Preemptive war set a dangerous precedent that lowered the threshold for going to war to simply feeling threatened by another nation.

 American troops were in Baghdad. On April 10, 2003, USA Today was one of many newspapers and television newscasts (29.16) showing an Iraqi crowd enlisting the aid of U.S. Marines to pull down a huge statue of Saddam. “The toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue in Baghdad will be recorded alongside the fall of the Berlin Wall as one of the great moments of liberty,” Bush proclaimed. Although the event was initially seen as emblematic of Iraqi celebration over the fall of Saddam, subsequent reports suggested that American army personnel had staged the event in a square across from the hotel housing international journalists to create a positive iconic image of the war similar to the World War II image of U.S. Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima (see Chapter 23). The controversy surrounding the picture mirrored Americans’ debate over whether the war was based on lies or was, as Bush and his

 supporters maintained, spreading democracy to the Middle East. After active combat operations ceased, American troops faced a host of problems that kept them in Iraq. Widespread looting greeted the fall of Saddam Hussein, who eluded capture until December 13, 2003. He was held in prison, then put on trial and executed on December 30, 2006. Restoring law and order and creating a new democratic government proved difficult as Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds divided along ethnic and religious lines. American soldiers caught up in the emerging civil war provided inviting targets for suicide bombers, while Iran and alQaeda penetrated Iraq to expand their influence in the region. Controversy over the war continued at home, especially when scandalous photographs taken by soldiers at the American-run Abu Ghraib prison circulated in the mainstream media and on the Internet in 2004. While interrogating prisoners U.S. guards had taken photos of prisoners forced into humiliating sexual positions and being threatened with dogs. Other photos showed smiling American soldiers standing beside beaten and bloody corpses. As with the 1968 My Lai massacre in Vietnam (see Chapter 26), Americans held strong competing visions on what they felt the photos represented. Some saw rogue soldiers acting on their own; others blamed the president for authorizing brutal interrogating techniques on suspected terrorists. Another group sidestepped the moral question and instead debated whether torture produced valuable information or simply encouraged suspects to say what interrogators 29.16 “Baghdad Falls,” April 10, 2003 wanted to hear. Initial news reports spoke of jubilant crowds cheering as U.S. Marines helped them pull down a statue of Saddam Hussein, but later reports suggested that the army had staged the incident.

 What accomplishments and setbacks did the United States experience in the Iraq War?

NEW THREATS IN THE POST–COLD WAR WORLD

The Election of 2008
 In 2004, Bush won reelection against Democratic challenger Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, a Vietnam War veteran whose record both as a decorated officer and peace activist came under Republican attack during the campaign. Despite the growing unpopularity of the war in Iraq, the fresh memories of 9/11 bolstered Bush’s argument that only he could adequately protect the nation against terrorism. In a close election Bush won the popular vote by only 3 percent and captured the Electoral College 286 to 252. By 2008, however, the president’s approval rates had sunk to historic lows—only Truman and Nixon had polled lower. These lows reflected the nation’s unease with its seemingly permanent presence in Iraq and recoil at the White House’s initial failure to react when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans’ predominantly black neighborhoods in 2005. In the 2008 presidential contest, Democratic and Republican candidates both repudiated the Bush administration and ran campaigns that promised change. The election soon assumed historic dimensions when Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former First Lady and now a senator from New York, announced her candidacy. Clinton had a long record of public service dedicated to healthcare issues, but her initial support for the war in Iraq angered antiwar Democrats. Firstterm Illinois Senator Barack Obama, the 47-year-old son of a white woman from Kansas and an African father, astutely campaigned on his own consistent opposition to the war. When the crowded Democratic field narrowed to Clinton and Obama, the 2008 election was guaranteed to make history. For the first time either a woman or an African American would head the national Democratic ticket. At the end of a bruising primary battle, Obama prevailed to become the Democratic nominee. In the general election Obama faced Republican John McCain, a former Navy pilot whom the Communist Vietnamese had held captive for six years during the Vietnam War. The 72-year-old senator from Arizona had a reputation as a maverick for occasionally breaking ranks with fellow Republicans. Hoping to make some history of his own, and perhaps woo Clinton supporters, McCain selected Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate— only the second time that a woman had received this honor. Obama pledged to end the war in Iraq quickly and roll back the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy, while McCain supported both. Debate over the Iraq War

 faded when a cascade of bank and insurance company failures sent the stock market into a tailspin. In the midst of the crisis, economists offered the following explanation for the downturn that future investigations may or may not confirm. During the last five years, as housing prices rose dramatically and Congress deregulated the banking and financial industries, banks had made numerous risky loans that let people purchase homes they could not afford, and Wall Street brokers had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities. When housing prices started declining in summer 2007, the dominos began to fall. Bank foreclosures on people who could not pay their mortgages increased, and even more ominously, the declining value of mortgage-backed securities threatened to bankrupt leading Wall Street firms, wiping out many Americans’ retirement investments. To stabilize the mortgage market, the government took over two leading lenders, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson refused to intervene when Lehman Brothers, a major investment firm, went bankrupt in September 2008. This bankruptcy shocked the financial sector. Credit markets froze as banks stopped lending and investors began moving money from stocks and bonds to U.S. Treasury notes. By mid-September the Bush administration decided that an infusion of $700 billion was needed to unfreeze the credit markets and stop the stock market’s freefall. Enraged House Republicans revolted. In their view the government “bail-out” used taxpayer money to reward bad behavior. Many Democrats accepted the competing view that the government would recoup this money when the economy and value of these investments improved. Congress eventually authorized the funds, which Paulson used to infuse capital directly into banks rather than buying low-valued assets. What happened to this money became a major political question, still unanswered. Obama was a captivating orator who drew thousands to his rallies. Even Hillary Clinton campaigned for him. Obama drew enthusiastic support from whites and blacks; young and old; Hispanic and Asian.

 Almost overnight Barack Obama became an American icon, a boon to Washington, D.C.area gift shops selling souvenirs to the 2 million people who braved freezing temperatures to see Obama inaugurated as the nation’s 44th president on January 20, 2009.

 Exuding confidence, calm, and charm, Obama amassed an inspired following who put his likeness on posters, vans, t-shirts, bridges, boats, and even tattoos. The image of Obama on the souvenir mugs in this photo (29.17) came from an iconic poster by artist Shepard Fairey. The mugs paired Obama’s silhouette with the campaign’s catchphrase: “Change we can believe in.” By contrast, Fairey’s poster carried the single word “Hope,” a message that detractors modified into “Nope” on their own tee-shirts and bumper stickers. An intensely disciplined candidate, Obama stuck to a clear message of economic reform. The McCain campaign was more erratic, one day highlighting economics; the next portraying Obama as the heir to sixties-era radicalism. Thanks to support from swing voters (those without strong ideological convictions), momentum for Obama built throughout the fall. On November 4, 2008, he became the first African American president of the United States by winning a decisive victory: 365 to 173 electoral votes, and 53 percent of the popular vote.

 withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan. Conservatives, however, adamantly opposed enlarging the role and cost of government. Within this highly contentious partisan environment, Obama found himself under attack from the right and left. The economic crisis posed the most immediate challenge for Obama. With the Democrats controlling both the House and Senate, he quickly secured passage of a massive government spending bill to stimulate the economy. Republicans (including many who had supported Bush’s deficit spending) vehemently opposed increasing the national debt. When the economy failed to rebound quickly, two competing views on the stimulus spending emerged. The Obama administration asserted that the infusion of government money prevented another Great Depression by staving off the collapse of the nation’s financial institutions and averting massive layoffs. Republicans countered that ineffective government interference stymied the recovery, leaving taxpayers with a bill that would take generations to pay off. Liberals urged Obama to hold Wall Street accountable for the misdeeds that caused the economic meltdown, and Congress did strengthen regulatory oversight of financial institutions. Americans increasingly, however, directed their anger over the ongoing economic crisis at Washington. Concerns about the escalating debt and federal power energized

 grassroots conservatives, who used social networking media to draw crowds to their initial demonstrations. The spectacular rise of the Tea Party movement had begun, named to evoke the revolutionary spirit of the 1774 Boston Tea Party. Support from conservative television pundits and high-profile politicians like Sarah Palin also fueled the movement’s growth. By actively opposing the president’s health insurance reform initiative, the Tea Party solidified its influence within Republican circles. In pushing for health-care reform, Obama hoped to succeed where Truman and Clinton had failed. J.R. Rose’s 2009 political cartoon aptly captured the political divide that characterized this rancorous debate (29.18). To marshal support, Obama cited the many uninsured (16 percent of the population, or 47 million people), rising health-care and insurance costs, and troubling industry practices such as lifetime limits on coverage. Opting for a reform of private health insurance practices rather than the single-payer government-run system liberals favored, Obama angered his base and did little to assuage conservatives. Health insurance reform legislation passed in 2010 without receiving a single Republican vote amid liberal criticism that the law did too little. The law’s requirement that all Americans purchase health insurance became a flashpoint for conservatives and independents worried about intrusive governmental power. States immediately challenged the constitutionality of this mandate. The mixed rulings in federal district courts suggested that the Supreme Court would ultimately determine whether Obama’s attempt to establish universal healthcare would prevail. Sweeping Republican victories in the 2010 mid-term elections included Tea Party candidates who vowed to curb the power of government by repealing the healthcare law, cutting the federal budget, and making Bush-era tax cuts permanent. Focused on fiscal issues, Tea Party activists had less interest in championing conservatives’ traditional social and cultural agenda. Instead of rallying supporters to reverse the 2010 repeal of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy that prevented gay servicemen from openly acknowledging their sexual orientation, the Tea Party used its influence within the Republican

 Party to demand a permanent reduction in the size and scope of the federal budget. Liberal disenchantment with Obama stemmed mainly from his foreign policy decisions, especially escalating the war in Afghanistan and continued operation of the Guantanamo Bay prison. Obama prohibited the use of water-boarding, but reaffirmed the Bush-era policy of holding prisoners indefinitely without charges. Sending an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in October 2009, Obama tried to reassure his liberal base by setting a tentative withdrawal date of 2014 from Afghanistan. Obama satisfied Americans of all political persuasions when he announced on May 2, 2011 that U.S. Special Forces had tracked down and killed Osama bin Laden in his Pakistani hideout. Documents recovered during the raid provided crucial intelligence that allowed Obama to claim that the United States for the moment had the upper-hand in the war on terror. He also moved decisively to draw down forces in Iraq. An influx of U.S. troops in 2008 had reduced insurgent attacks, both improving the public’s views of the Iraq War and strengthening Obama’s claim that the war had been won. In October 2011 Obama announced that the U.S. military would leave Iraq by year’s end. “After nearly nine years, America’s war in Iraq will be over,” he announced, a decision supported by 75% of Americans.
