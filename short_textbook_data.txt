america a not so new world pa r t one history is filled with ironies.
luck and accidents the unexpected and unplanned happenings of life often shape events more than intentions.
long before christopher columbus lucked upon the caribbean sea and an unexpected continent in his effort to find a westward passage to the indies east asia the native peoples he mislabeled indians had occupied and transformed the lands of the western hemisphere also called the americas north central and south.
initially everyone in what came to be called america came from somewhere else.
by 1492 when columbus began his voyage west from spain across an uncharted ocean there were millions of native americans living in the western hemisphere.
the new world he found was new only to the europeans who began exploring conquering and exploiting the region at the end of the fifteenth century.
over thousands of years native american peoples had developed highly sophisticated societies.
some were rooted in agriculture others focused on trade or the conquest of others.
many native americans were healthier better fed and lived longer than europeans but they and their cultures were almost destroyed by the arrival of europeans and africans.
as the two different societies european and native a merican collided each having its own distinct heritage and worldview indian peoples were exploited infected enslaved displaced and exterminated.
