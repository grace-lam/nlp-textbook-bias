Specialized Vocabulary of Social Studies
FOCUS on Reading If you flipped through the pages of this book, would you expect to see anything about square roots or formulas? How about petri dishes or hypotheses? Of course you wouldn't. Those are terms you'd only see in math and science books.
Specialized Vocabulary Like most academic subjects, social studies has its own specialized vocabulary. Included in it are words and phrases you will see over and over as you read social studies materials. The charts below list some terms you may encounter as you read this book.
Social Studies Terms	
decade	a period of 10 years
century	a period of 100 years
era	a long period marked by great events, developments, or figures
politics	the art of creating government policies
economics	the study of the creation and use of goods and services
movement	a series of actions that bring about or try to bring about a change in society
campaign	an effort to win a political office, or a series of military actions
colony	a territory settled and controlled by a country
Social Studies Vocabulary when you read or hear one of these terms used in class, make a note of it. Write down the term, the sentence in which it was used, and its meaning. If you don't know the definition of a social studies term, ask your teacher or a classmate. Make sure you understand the word by telling them or writing down the definition in your own words.
Each chapter has a list of vocabulary words found in the chapter. Write a definition for each term, and use the word in class discussions. If you don't understand the way the teacher or a classmate uses the word, ask for an explanation. If one of your classmates asks for a definition, explain the word you used.
Write down any words you hear or read that you think have a specialized meaning for social studies along with their definitions.
Academic Words Look at the Words to Know on page H5. As you read these words in the textbook, write their definitions in your own words. Use the words in class discussions, assignments, and presentations. Talk about the definitions with your teacher and classmates. If one of your classmates asks for a definition, explain the word.

Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest j carved images of totems—ancestor or ani-I mal spirits—on tall, wooden poles. Totem 5 poles held great religious and historical i significance for Native Americans of the 5 Northwest. Feasts called potlatches were another unique, or unusual, aspect of these Native Americans' culture. Use the clues to understand meaning.
1.	Find the word totems. The phrase after the dash is the definition. Often in this book, specialized vocabulary words are defined after a dash. So be on the lookout for dashes.
2.	The word potlatch is defined in the third sentence. The clue to finding this definition is the word called. Words like called and known as can indicate that a definition is coming up. In this case, the word feasts is a definition of potlatch.
3.	In the first sentence, you see a term that is in boldface print. You should recognize that word from seeing it in the section opener. The definition is highlighted. Why do you think some specialized vocabulary words are in boldface print, while others are not?
4.	The word unique is defined in the final sentence. The clue to finding this definition is the comma followed by the word or. So be on the lookout for commas followed by or.

E BUILDING BACKGROUND
The first settlers to the Americas I probably came in small groups from Asia. Over thousands of years, I they moved into nearly every region of North and South America.	?
s Inthe Americas, these people encountered, and adapted to, many	'
different climates and types of land.
First Migration to the Americas
Many scientists believe that the first people arrived in North America during the last Ice Age. At the start of the Ice Age, Earth's climate became intensely cold. Large amounts of water froze into huge, moving sheets of ice called glaciers. As a result, ocean levels dropped more than 300 feet lower than they are today. When the sea level fell, a land bridge between northeastern Asia and present-day Alaska was exposed. Geographers call this strip of land the Bering Land Bridge. Although no one knows exactly when or how people crossed into North America, evidence suggests that people called Paleo-lndians crossed this bridge into Alaska between 38,000 and 10,000 BC.
This migration—a movement of people or animals from one region to another—took place over a long time. It is believed that Paleo-lndians traveled south into Canada, the United States, and Mexico following herds of animals. Over time, their descendants went as far as the southern tip of South America. These people were hunter-gatherers, people who hunted animals and gathered wild plants for food.

1.	Movement In what general direction did early peoples migrate?
2.	Human-Environment Interaction
What natural features affected the route people took from Alaska to southern North America?
About 8000 BC,
Earth's climate grew warmer, and the Ice Age ended. Rising temperatures melted glaciers. Water levels in the oceans rose, and the Bering
Land Bridge was covered with water.
The warmer climate at the end of the Ice Age created new environments, climates and landscapes that surround living things. Large herds of animals such as buffalo and deer ate new short grasses that thrived in the warm climate. As the number of these animals grew, Paleo-lndians hunted these animals for survival.
Varied environments influenced the development of different Native American societies, or groups that share a culture. Culture is a group's set of common values and traditions, including language, government, and family relationships.
Like all societies, Native American groups changed over time. People planted seeds, and eventually they learned to breed animals, farm, and grow plants. Maize, or corn, was one of their most important early crops. Later, they learned to grow beans and squash. Farming allowed people to stop moving around looking for food and to settle in one place. With adequate food supplies, settlements could support larger populations. As populations grew, more advanced societies began to develop.

Academic Vocabulary develop the process of growing or improving
Early Mesoamerican and South American Societies
Some of the earliest American cultures arose in Mesoamerica, a region that includes the southern part of what is now Mexico and the northern parts of Central America.
Olmec and Maya
Around 1200 BC the Olmec developed the earliest known civilization in Mesoamerica. The Olmec are known for their use of stone in architecture and sculpture. They built the first pyramids in the Americas, and they created sculptures of huge stone heads. When their civilization ended around 400 BC, trade had spread Olmec culture throughout the region.
Like the Olmec, the Maya grew maize and other crops and lived in small villages. These villages traded goods with each other, and by about AD 200, the Maya were building large cities.
Maya cities had pyramids, large stone temples, palaces, and bridges. The Maya also paved large plazas for public gatherings and built canals to control the flow of water through the cities.
In the 900s Maya civilization began to collapse. Historians are still not sure what caused this great civilization's decline.
Aztec
The Aztec were fierce warriors, and their superior military ability was key to their success. Around the mid-HOOs AD, the Aztec migrated south to central Mexico. They conquered many towns, made alliances to build their empire, and controlled a huge trade network.
In AD 1325, the Aztec founded their capital, Tenochtitlan (tay-nawch-teet-LAHN), on an island in Lake Texcoco. It became the greatest city in the Americas and one of the world's largest cities. The city's island location made travel and trade difficult, so the Aztec built raised roads to connect the island to the shore.
Trade and tribute paid by conquered people in the form of cotton, gold, and food made the Aztec rich. By the early 1500s, they ruled the most powerful state in Mesoamerica.
Inca
The Inca began as a small tribe in the Andes Mountains of South America. They named their capital city Cuzco (Koo-skoh). In the
i
mid-1400s, the Inca began to expand their territory. By the 1500s the empire stretched along the Pacific coast from what is now northern Ecuador to central Chile. In time, the empire was home to about 12 million people. The Inca formed a strong central government with a king as ruler. The official language of the empire was Quechua. Because there was no written language, records were kept on a system of knotted strings called quipu.
The Inca are known for building and for art. Massive buildings and forts were made of huge stone blocks. An advanced system of highways ran the length of the empire. Paved roads and rope bridges connected all parts of Inca territory. This enabled the Inca to communicate with and control their large empire.

f TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on Native American cultures of North America.
Early Societies
The earliest people in North America were hunter-gatherers. After 5000 BC some of these people learned how to farm, and they settled in villages. Although less populated than South America and Mesoamerica, North America had many complex societies long before Europeans reached the continent.
Anasazi
By 1500 BC the people who lived in the North American Southwest, like those who lived in Mesoamerica, were growing maize. One of the early farm cultures in the Southwest was the Anasazi (ah-nuh-SAH-zee). The Anasazi lived in the Four Comers region, where present-day Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet. Anasazi farmers adapted to their dry environment and grew maize, beans, and squash. Over time, they began to use irrigation to increase food production. By the time the Anasazi settled in the area, they were already skilled basket makers. They wove straw, vines, and yucca to make containers for food and other items, and they eventually became skilled potters as well.
CHAPTER 1
Anasazi Cliff Dwellings
Dwellings like these were built into cliffs for safety. Often, ladders were needed to reach the buildings. The ladders could be removed, keeping invaders from reaching the dwelllings.
The early Anasazi lived in pit houses dug into the ground. After about AD 750 they built pueblos, or aboveground houses made of a heavy clay called adobe. The Anasazi built these houses on top of each other, creating large multistoried complexes. Some pueblos had several hundred rooms and could house 1,000 people.
The Anasazi often built their houses in canyon walls and had to use ladders to enter their homes. These cliff dwellings provided a strong defense against enemies. The Anasazi also built kivas, underground ceremonial chambers, at the center of each community. Kivas were sacred areas used for religious ceremonies. Some of these rituals focused on the life-giving forces of rain and maize.
The Anasazi thrived for hundreds of years. After AD 1300, however, they began to abandon their villages. Scholars believe that drought, disease, or raids by nomadic tribes from the north may have caused the Anasazi to move away from their pueblos.
Mound Builders
Several farming societies developed in the eastern part of North America after 1000 BC. The Hopewell lived along the Mississippi, Ohio, and lower Missouri river valleys.
They supported their large population with agriculture and trade. They built large burial mounds to honor their dead.
The Hopewell culture had declined by AD 700. Another culture, the Mississippian, began to thrive in the same area. Skilled farmers and traders, the Mississippian built large settlements. Their largest city, Cahokia, was located near present-day Saint Louis, Missouri. It had a population of 30,000.
The Mississippian built hundreds of mounds for religious ceremonies. Cahokia alone had more than 100 temple and burial mounds. These mounds had flat tops, and temples were built on top of the mounds. Many of the mounds were gigantic. Monks Mound, near Collinsville, Illinois, for example, was 100 feet high and covered 16 acres.
Several other mound-building cultures thrived in eastern North America. More than 10,000 mounds have been found in the Ohio River valley alone. Some of these mounds are shaped like birds and snakes. The moundbuilding cultures had declined by the time European explorers reached the Southeast. Their societies no longer existed by the early 1700s.

some Native American groups build mounds?

FOCUS ON
Reaping What is the definition of totems according to this sentence? Native American Culture Areas
Researchers use culture areas—the geographic locations that influenced societies—to help them describe ancient Native American peoples. North America is divided into several culture areas.
North and Northwest
The far north of North America is divided into the Arctic and Subarctic culture areas. Few plants grow in the Arctic because the ground is always frozen beneath a thin top layer of soil. This harsh environment was home to two groups of people, the Inuit and the Aleut. The Inuit lived in present-day northern Alaska and Canada. Their homes were igloos, hide tents, and huts. The Aleut, whose home was in western and southern Alaska, lived in multifamily houses that were partially underground. The two groups shared many cultural features, including language. Both groups survived by fishing and hunting large mammals. The Aleut and Inuit also depended on dogs for many tasks, such as hunting and pulling sleds.
South of the Arctic lies the Subarctic, home to groups such as the Dogrib and Mon-tagnais peoples. While they followed the seasonal migrations of deer, these peoples lived in shelters made of animal skins. At other times, they lived in villages made up of log houses. Farther south, the Kwakiutl and the Chinook thrived, thanks to the rich supply of game animals, fish, and wild plants that allowed large populations to increase without the need for farming.
Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest carved images of totems—ancestor or animal spirits—on tall, wooden poles. Totem poles held great religious and historical significance for Native Americans of the Northwest. Feasts called potlatches were another unique, or unusual, aspect of these Native Americans' culture. At these gatherings, hosts, usually chiefs or wealthy people, gave away most of their belongings as gifts. In this way, the hosts increased their social importance.
Bering
Sea
West and Southwest
Farther south along the Pacific coast was the California region, which included the area between the Pacific and the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Food sources were plentiful, so farming was not necessary. One major plant food was acoms, which were ground into flour. People also fished and hunted deer and other game. Most Native Americans in the California region lived in groups of families of about 50 to 300. Among these groups, including the Hupa, Miwok, and Yokuts, more than 100 languages were spoken.
The area east of the Sierra Nevada, the Great Basin, received little rain. To survive, Native Americans adapted to the drier climate by gathering seeds, digging roots, and trapping small animals for food. Most groups in this area, including the Paiute, Shoshone, and Ute, spoke the same language.
The Southwest culture region included the present-day states of Arizona and New Mexico, and parts of Colorado and Texas. Pueblo groups, such as the Hopi and Zuni, lived there. Like the Anasazi, these Native Americans also adapted to a dry climate. The Pueblo irrigated the land and grew maize, squash, and beans. These crops were vital to southwestern peoples. The Pueblo religion focused on two key areas of Pueblo life, rain and maize. The Pueblo performed religious rituals hoping to bring rain and a successful maize crop to their peoples.
Pueblo peoples were settled and built multistoried houses out of adobe bricks. Over time their towns grew larger, and some towns had more than 1,000 residents. Pueblo peoples made fine pottery that featured beautifully painted designs.

The Apache and Navajo also lived in the Southwest. These groups were nomadic—they moved from place to place hunting small animals and foraging for food. The Apache and Navajo also supported themselves by raiding the villages of the Pueblo and others.
Great Plains
The huge Great Plains region stretches south from Canada into Texas. This culture area is bordered by the Mississippi Valley on the east and the Rocky Mountains on the west. The Plains were mainly grassland, home to millions of buffalo. Deer, elk, and other game also thrived there.
Most Great Plains r eoples were nomadic hunters. Many groups hunted buffalo using bows and spears. Blackfoot and Arapaho hunters sometimes chased the animals over cliffs, drove them into corrals, or trapped them in a ring of fire. Native Americans used buffalo skins for shields, clothing, and coverings for their teepees—cone-shaped shelters.
Some Plains groups were farmers. The Mandan and Pawnee settled in villages and grew corn, beans, and squash. The Pawnee lived in round lodges made of dirt. Like some other Native American groups, Pawnee society was matrilineal. This means that people traced their ancestry through their mothers, not their fathers.
Northeast and Southeast
Eastern North America was rich in sources for food and shelter. Animals, plant foods, fish, and wood for housing were plentiful in the region's woodlands and river valleys.
Most southeastern groups, including the Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole, lived in farming villages governed by village councils. In the Northeast, groups like the Algonquian survived by hunting and gathering plants. Those in the south farmed, hunted, gathered plants, and fished. Many tribes used strings of beads known as wampum for money.
To the east of the Algonquian lived the Iroquois (or Haudenosaunee). They were farmers, hunters, and traders who lived in longhouses, or rectangular homes made from logs and bark, that housed 8 to 10 families.
The Iroquois created the Iroquois League. This confederation, or alliance, was established by the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca. The league waged war against and made peace with non-Iroquois peoples. Its goal was to strengthen the alliance against invasion. The league helped the Iroquois become one of the most powerful Native American peoples in North America.

j CHAPTER 1
Shared Beliefs
Although they were different culturally and geographically Native American groups of North America shared certain beliefs. The religion of most Native American peoples, for example, was linked to nature. Native Americans believed that spiritual forces were everywhere, dwelling in heavenly bodies and in sacred places on the earth. Spirits even lived within animals and plants. Native Americans tried to honor the spirits in their daily lives.
Ceremonies maintained the group's relationship with Earth and Sky, which were believed to be the sustainers of life. In addition, individuals who wanted help prayed to their spirit protector.
Native Americans also shared beliefs about property. They believed that individual ownership only applied to the crops one grew. The land itself was for the use of everyone in the village, and a person's right
to use it was temporary. Native Americans also thought they should preserve the land for future generations. These beliefs contrasted sharply with those of Europeans— a difference that would cause conflict.
Despite their shared beliefs, the diverse culture groups of North America had little interest in joining together into large political units. As a result, Native Americans on the North American continent did not form large empires like the Aztec and Inca of Meso-and South America did.

BUILDING BACKGROUND
The continent of Africa was luxuriously < rich in resources. West Africa had both fertile soils and valuable minerals, j especially gold and iron. Ancienttrade routes had connected Africa with j : the Middle East and Asia for hundreds of years. Over time, trade devel- \ oped between regions with different resources. Trade and abundant	j
t resources led to the growth of several great kingdoms in West Africa. ’
L.............................. ...................*___________J
West Africa's Great Kingdoms
For hundreds of years, trade routes crisscrossed West Africa. For most of that time, West Africans did not profit much from the Saharan trade because the routes were run by Berbers, a group of people from northern Africa. Eventually, that situation changed. A succession of three great kingdoms came to power as their peoples gained control of valuable trade routes in West Africa. Ghana (gah-nuh) was the first of these empires, followed by the kingdoms of Mali (MAH-lee) and Songhai (sAWNG-hy).
Kingdom of Ghana
Historians think the first people in Ghana were farmers along the Niger River. Sometime after AD 300 these farmers, the Soninke (soh-NiNG-kee), were threatened by nomadic herders. The herders wanted to take the farmers' water and pastures. For protection, groups of Soninke families began to band together. This banding together was the beginning of Ghana.

Ghana was in an ideal position to become a trading center. To the north lay the vast Sahara, the source of much of the salt. Ghana itself was rich in gold. People wanted gold for its beauty, but they needed salt in their diets to survive. Salt, which could be used to preserve food, also made bland food tasty. These qualities made salt very valuable. In fact, Africans sometimes cut up slabs of salt and used the pieces as money.
As trade in gold and salt increased, Ghana's rulers gained power. Eventually, they built up armies equipped with iron weapons that were superior to the weapons of nearby people. Over time, Ghana took control of trade from merchants. Merchants from the north and south then met to exchange goods in Ghana.
By 800 Ghana was firmly in control of West Africa's trade routes. Nearly all trade between northern and southern Africa passed through Ghana. With so many traders passing through their lands, Ghana's rulers looked for ways to make money from them. One way they raised money was by forcing traders to pay taxes. Every trader who entered Ghana had to pay a special tax
on the goods he earned. Then he had to pay another tax on any goods he took with him when he left. Ghana's rulers gained incredible wealth from trade, taxes on traders and on the people of Ghana, and their own personal stores of gold. They used their wealth to build an army and an empire.
Islam in Ghana
Extensive trade routes brought the people of Ghana into contact with people of many different cultures and beliefs. As the kingdom of Ghana extended into the Sahara, increased contact with Arab traders from the east brought the religion of Islam to Ghana.
Islam was founded in the 600s by an Arab named Muhammad. Muslims, followers of Islam, believe that God had spoken to Muhammad through an angel and had made him a prophet, someone who tells of God's messages. After Muhammad's death, his followers wrote down his teachings to form the book known as the Qur'an. Islam spread quickly through the Arabian Peninsula.
In the 1060s, a Muslim group called the Almoravids (al-muh-RAH-vuhdz) attacked Ghana in an effort to force its leaders to

convert to Islam. The Almoravids weakened Ghana's empire and cut off many trade routes. Without its trade, Ghana could not support its empire, and the empire eventually fell. The influence of Islam, however, remained strong. By the late 1400s Islam would become the most practiced religion in the region. Kingdom of Mali
Like Ghana, Mali lay along the upper Niger River. This area's fertile soil helped Mali grow. In addition, Mali's location on the Niger allowed its people to control trade on the river. Through this control of trade, the empire grew rich and powerful. According to legend, Mali's rise to power began under a ruler named Sundiata. Sundiata won back his country's independence and conquered nearby kingdoms, including Ghana.
Mali's most famous ruler, however, was a Muslim king named Mansa Musa (MAHN-sah moo-sAH). Under his leadership, Mali reached the height of its wealth, power, and fame.
Mansa Musa ruled Mali for about 25 years, from 1312 to 1337. During that time, Mali added many important trade cities, including Timbuktu (tim-buhk-Too), Djenne (je-NAY), and Gao (gow), to its empire. Traders came to Timbuktu from the north and the south to trade for salt, gold, metals, shells, and many other goods.
Religion was also very important to Mansa Musa. In 1324 he left Mali on a hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca. Making this journey once in their lives is the spiritual duty of all Muslims. As he traveled to Mecca, Mansa Musa introduced his empire to the world. The stories of Mali's wealth and religion spread far and wide. Because of Mansa Musa's influence, Islam spread through a large part of West Africa.
Mansa Musa wanted all Muslims to be able to read the Qur'an. Therefore, he stressed the importance of learning to read and write the Arabic language. He sent scholars to study in Morocco. These scholars later set up schools in Mali for studying the Qur'an.
8 CHAPTER 1
To encourage the spread of Islam in West Africa, Mansa Musa brought back artists and architects from other Muslim countries to build mosques, or buildings for Muslim prayer, throughout his lands.
The architectural advances in cities like Timbuktu as well as an organized government, an emphasis on education, and expansion of trade all combined to make Mansa Musa Mali's most successful ruler. Much of Mali's success depended on strong leaders. After Mansa Musa died, poor leadership weakened the empire. By 1500 nearly all of the lands the kingdom once ruled were lost. Only a small area of Mali remained. Songhai Empire
In the 1300s Mansa Musa had conquered a rival kingdom of people called the Songhai, who also lived along the Niger River. As the Mali Empire weakened in the 1400s, the Songhai grew in strength. They took advantage of
Mali's decline, regained their independence, and eventually conquered most of Mali.
One of Songhai's greatest rulers was Muhammad Ture, who chose the title askia, a title of military rank. He became known as Askia the Great. Like Mansa Musa, Askia the Great was a devout Muslim who supported education and learning. Under his rule, the cities of Gao and Timbuktu flourished. They contained great mosques, universities, schools, and libraries. People came from all parts of West Africa to study mathematics, science, medicine, grammar, and law.
Askia understood that an empire needed effective government. He created a professional army, and to improve the government, he set up five provinces within Songhai. He removed local leaders and appointed new governors who were loyal to him. He also created specialized departments to oversee various tasks, much like modern-day government offices do.

Music from Senegal to Memphis
Did you know that the music you listen to today may have begun with the griots, musicians from West Africa? From the 1600s to the 1800sz many people from West Africa were brought to America as slaves. In America, these slaves continued to sing the way they had in Africa. They also continued to play
traditional instruments such as the kora, shown here being played by Senegalese musician Soriba Kouyate (far right). Over time, this music developed into a style called the blues, made popular by such artists as B. B. King (near right). In turn, the blues shaped other styles of music, including jazz and rock. So, the next time you hear a Memphis blues song or a cool jazz tune, listen for its ancient African roots.
How did West African music affect modern American music?
THE WORLD BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE ATLANTIC 19
Soon after Askia the Great lost power, the empire of Songhai declined. Songhai was invaded by the Moroccans, the kingdom's northern neighbors. The Moroccans wanted to control the Saharan salt mines. They had superior military power and were able to take over Timbuktu and Gao. Changes in trade patterns completed Songhai's fall.

West African Slave Trade
The practice of slavery had existed in Africa and in many parts of the world for centuries. Traditionally, slavery in West Africa mostly involved only black Africans, who were both slaveholders and slaves. This changed in the 600s when Arab Muslims, and later Europeans, became slave traders. Though Europeans had long traded resources with Africa, they became more interested in the growing slave trade.
People who were captured by warring groups during battle could be sold into slavery. In addition, criminals were sometimes sold as slaves. Other enslaved people were captured during raids on villages, and sometimes
even the relatives of people who owed money were sold into slavery as payment for debts. Enslaved Africans were often bought to perform menial labor and domestic chores. In some cultures, having slaves raised the status of the slaveholder.
The market for West African slaves increased as Muslim traders bought or seized black Africans to sell in North Africa. West Africa was also home to many enslaved Africans brought to the Americas.
Over time, the slave trade became even more important to the West African economy. Kings traded slaves for valuable goods, such as horses from the Middle East and textiles and weapons from Europe. The trans-Saharan slave trade contributed to the power of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai.

What did he do? Mansa Musa, the ruler of Mali, was one of the Muslim kings of West Africa. He became a major figure in African and world history largely because of a pilgrimage he made to the city of Mecca.
Why is he important? Mansa Musa's spectacular journey attracted the attention of the Muslim world and of Europe. For the first time, other people's eyes turned to West Africa. During his travels, Mansa Musa gave out huge
amounts of gold. His spending made people eager to find the source of such wealth. Within 200 years, European explorers would arrive on the shores of western Africa.

I TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the changes in society during the periods listed.
BDING BACKGROUND
Hard work was a constant theme in res of peasants in the Middle Ages. Nobles were not free to live as
, :hose, either. As the Middle Ages ended, the Renaissance brought i new ways of thinking, and the growth of cities brought big changes to the way people lived and worked.
Greek and Roman Government
During the Renaissance, European thinkers and artists rediscovered the traditions of Greece and Rome. Ancient Greek and Roman texts were translated, and their ideas began to revolutionize European societies.
Greek Philosophers and Government
Ancient Greeks valued human reason and believed in the power of the human mind to think, explain, and understand life. Three of the greatest Greek thinkers, or philosophers, were Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Socrates, a great teacher, wanted to make people think and question their own beliefs. Plato, a philosopher and teacher, wrote a work called The Republic. It describes an ideal society based on justice and fairness for everyone. Aristotle taught that people should live lives based on reason, or clear and ordered thinking.
22 CHAPTER 1
Greek scientists and mathematicians also gained fame for their contributions to geometry and for accurately calculating the size of Earth. Doctors studied the human body to understand how it worked. One Greek engineering invention that is still used today is a water screw, which brings water to farm fields.
One of the Greeks' most lasting contributions, however, is their political system. During the time known as the Classical Period, around the fifth and fourth centuries BC, Greece was organized into several hundred independent city-states, which became the foundation for Greek civilization. Athens was the first Greek city-state to establish democracy—a form of government in which people rale themselves. All male citizens in Athens had the right to participate in the assembly, a gathering of citizens, to debate and create the city's laws. Because all male citizens in Athens participated directly in government, we call the Greek form of government a direct democracy.
Roman Law and Government
Later, Rome followed Greece's example by establishing a form of democratic government. The Roman Republic was created in 509 BC. Each year Romans elected officials to rale the city. These officials had many powers, but
Democracy and Republic	
Direct democracies and republics are similar forms of government	^1^^ in which the people rule. There are some slight differences, though.	
Direct Democracy	Republic
•	Every citizen votes on every issue. •	Ideas are debated at an assembly of all citizens.	•	Citizens elect representatives to vote on issues. •	Ideas are debated at an assembly of representatives.
THE IMPACT
TODAY
they only stayed in power for one year. This early republic was not a democracy. Later, the Romans changed their government into one with three parts. These three parts were made up of elected representatives who protected the city and its residents.
Roman laws were written and kept on public display so all people could know them. Roman concepts of equality before the law and innocent until proven guilty protected Roman citizens' rights.
The political ideas of Greece and Rome survived to influence governments around the world, including that of the United States. In the U.S. political system, citizens vote for representatives, making the nation a democratic republic.

Middle Ages
As the Roman Empire fell, groups from the north and east moved into former Roman lands. By the early 500s Europe was divided into many small kingdoms. This marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, a period that lasted about a thousand years.
Feudalism
In the 480s a powerful group called the Franks conquered Gaul, the region we now call France. The Franks created a huge empire in Europe. When invaders began to attack European settlements in the 800s, the Frankish kings could not defend their empire. Because they could not depend on protection from their kings, nobles had to defend their own lands. As a result, the power of European nobles grew, and kings became less powerful. Although these nobles remained loyal to the king, they ruled their lands as independent territories.
Nobles needed soldiers to defend their lands. Nobles gave knights, warriors who fought on horseback, land in exchange for military service. Nobles who gave land to
knights so that the knights would defend the land were called lords. A knight who promised to support the noble in battle was called a vassal. This system of promises between lords and vassals is known as feudalism.
Peasants owned no land, so they were not part of the feudal system. They did, however, need to grow food to live. As a result, a new economic system developed. Knights allowed peasants to farm land on their large estates, called manors. In return, the peasants had to give the knights food or other goods as payment.
Because of its structure, feudalism promoted the separation of territories and people. The Catholic Church, however, served as a strong unifying force among the states and people of Europe. During the Middle Ages, nearly everyone in Europe was Christian. Life revolved around the local church with markets, festivals, and religious ceremonies. The Crusades
In the late 1000s, a long series of wars called the Crusades began between the European Christians and Muslims in Southwest Asia.

4 CHAPTER 1
The Turks had captured Palestine, the Holy Land where Jesus had lived. Christians no longer felt safe to travel there on pilgrimages. Christians were called upon to go to war with the Turks to recapture Palestine.
Although the Crusades failed, they changed Europe forever. Trade between Europe and Asia began to grow, introducing Europeans to new products such as apricots, rice, and cotton cloth, as well as the ideas of Muslim thinkers.
Travel, Trade, and Towns
In the Middle Ages, towns were small. After about 1000, this situation began to change. New technology meant farmers could produce larger harvests. As farmers grew more food, the population increased.
Travel became safer as increased protection from stronger rulers kept larger territories secure. Over time, kingdoms became nationstates—organized political units with central governments. This development provided even more protection to merchants.
The rulers of the Mongols made routes like the Silk Road, a caravan route that started in China and ended at the Mediterranean Sea,
safe for travelers and traders. Among these traders was Marco Polo. In 1271 he journeyed from Europe to China along part of the old Silk Road. He spent 20 years living and traveling in Asia. When Marco Polo returned to Europe, he brought back stories of spices, coal, and paper money.
Trade routes spread all across Europe. Merchants brought goods from Asia and Africa to sell in European markets. Their ships also brought back rats infected with the plague. The disease, known as the Black Death, spread across Europe, killing an estimated 25 million people. The European economy was dramatically affected by the shortage of workers. Peasants and serfs could now demand payment for their labor. They began to move to cities, which began to grow in size.
In time, the growth of trade led to the decline of feudalism and the manor system. A new middle class of artisans and merchants emerged, and trade cities became commercial centers. Trade associations called guilds became an influential part of European life.

THE WORLD BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE ATLANTIC 25
Renaissance
The Renaissance period brought new ways of thinking to Europe, weakening the old feudal system even more. The word Renaissance means "rebirth" and refers to the period that followed the Middle Ages in Europe. This movement began in Italy and eventually spread to other parts of Europe.
During the Renaissance, European rulers began to increase their power over the nobles in their countries. Fewer invasions from outside forces helped bring a period of order and stability to Europe.
Search for Knowledge
Love of art and education was a key feature of the Renaissance. As Turks conquered much of the Byzantine Empire in the East, scholars fled to Italy. They brought ancient classical writings with them. Some of the works were by Greek thinkers like Plato.
Excited by the discoveries brought by Turkish scholars, European scholars went looking for ancient texts in Latin. They discovered many Latin texts in monasteries, which had preserved works by Roman writers. As Italian scholars read these ancient texts, they rediscovered the glories of Greece and Rome.
The search for knowledge and learning spread to all fields, including art, literature, science, and political thought. The Renaissance emphasized the importance of people rather than focusing on religion. This new focus on human value and the study of humanities was called humanism. People's interest in the humanities led them to respect those who could write, create, or speak well. During the Middle Ages, most people had worked only to glorify God.
Italian artists created some of the most beautiful paintings and sculptures in the world. Their art reflected the basic Renaissance idea—the value of human beings. Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci are two of the greatest Renaissance artists. They are known for their work in painting, sculpture, and architecture. Da Vinci was also an inventor, engineer, and mapmaker.
Italian writers also penned great works of literature. Dante Alighieri was a politician and poet. Before Dante, most authors wrote in Latin, the language of the church. But Dante chose to write in Italian, the common language of the people. This gave ordinary people the opportunity to read Dante's work.
Many texts that Europeans rediscovered in the 1300s dealt with science. After reading these works, Renaissance scholars went on
» CHAPTER 1
to make their own scientific advances. They also studied ancient math texts and built on the ideas they read about. For example, they created symbols for the square root and for positive and negative numbers. Astronomers discovered that Earth moves around the sun. Other scientists used measurements and made calculations to create better, more accurate maps.
The development of the printing press was a giant step forward in spreading new ideas. In the mid-1400s, a German man, Johannes Gutenberg (GooT-uhn-berk), developed a printing press that used movable type. This allowed an entire page to be printed at. once. For the first time in history, thousands of people could read the same books and share ideas about them.
Economic Changes Affect Trade
The growth in trade and services at the beginning of the Renaissance sparked a commercial revolution. This also brought a rise in mercantilism. Mercantilism is an economic system that unifies and increases the power and wealth of a nation.
Four northern Italian cities, Florence, Genoa, Milan, and Venice, developed into important trading centers. These cities played two major roles in trade. They served as ports along the Mediterranean Sea. They also served as manufacturing centers and specialized in certain crafts. This economic activity made some families in these cities very wealthy.
As trade and commerce grew, the need for banks arose. Bankers in Florence, Italy, kept money for merchants from all over Europe. The bankers also made money by charging interest on funds they loaned to merchants. The greatest bankers in Florence were from the Medici family. Although Florence was already wealthy from trade, banking increased that wealth.
During this time, merchants began to create joint-stock companies, or businesses in which a group of people invest together. In
a joint-stock company, the investors share in the companies' profits and losses. Forming joint-stock companies allowed investors to take fewer risks.

"And they died by the hundreds," wrote one man who saw the horror, "both day and night."The Black Death had arrived. The Black Death was a series of deadly plagues that hit Europe between 1347 and 1351, killing millions. People didn't know what caused the plague. They also didn't know that geography played a key role in its spread—as people traveled to trade, they unknowingly carried the disease with them to new places.

The plague is so terrifying that many people think it's the end of the world. They leave town for the country, spreading the Black Death even further.
People dig mass graves to bury the dead. Often, so many people are infected that there is no one left to bury them.
The garbage and dirty conditions in the town provide food and a home for the rats, allowing disease to spread even more.

The Maya developed one of the most advanced civilizations in the Americas, but their story is shrouded in mystery.
Around a.d. 250, the Maya began to build great cities in southern Mexico and Central America. They developed a writing system, practiced astronomy, and built magnificent palaces and pyramids with little more than stone tools. Around a.d. 900, however, the Maya abandoned their cities, leaving their monuments to be reclaimed by the jungle and, for a time, forgotten.

TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on Viking and Portuguese voyages of exploration.
Viking Sailors Reach North America
The Vikings were the first Europeans to make contact with North America. They came from Scandinavia, a peninsula that includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The Vikings were skilled sailors who developed a new style of ship, called the longship, that curved up at both ends. Viking vessels traveled the rough North Atlantic seas better than earlier ships because their designs were more stable.
The Vikings raided countries throughout Europe, but they also developed large trading networks. Viking ships sailed to the British Isles and the Mediterranean and Black seas. Eventually, the Vikings sailed west into the North Atlantic. There they founded a settlement on the island of Iceland in about 874. More than 100 years later, Viking Erik the Red left Iceland to settle Greenland.
Leif Eriksson, the son of Erik the Red, shared his father's love of adventure. In the year 1000, he was sailing from west Norway to Greenland when strong winds blew his ship off course and carried his ship all the way to the North American coast.
Eriksson and his crew landed on the Labrador Peninsula in present-day Canada. The Vikings then sailed farther south to the island of Newfoundland, and perhaps to what is now New England. According to their myths, Vikings saw forests, meadows, and rivers that held "larger salmon than they had ever seen."

38 CHAPTER 2
Eriksson settled in a coastal area he called Vinland, but the Vikings left after only a few years. Attacks by Native Americans posed a constant threat, and the area may have been too far from other Viking settlements to be supported.
After the Vikings left North America, Europeans did not return to the continent for centuries. In the 1400s, however, a growing interest in discovery and exploration spread across Europe.
READING CHECK
Sequencing List the stages of exploration that led to the Vikings' landing in North America.
Prince Henry the Navigator
In the early 1400s Portugal became a leader in world exploration. One man in particular, Prince Henry the Navigator, was responsible for advances that would make exploration more successful. Although he never set out on a voyage himself, Henry greatly advanced Portugal's exploration efforts.
In the early 1400s Prince Henry built an observatory and founded a school of navigation to teach better methods of sailing. He also financed research by mapmakers and shipbuilders. Finally, he paid for expeditions to explore the west coast of Africa.
Riches in Asia
During the 1400s, Europeans had several reasons to explore the world. First, they wanted Asian spices. They hoped to bypass the merchants who had a monopoly on, or economic control of, the Asian products that reached the Mediterranean. If a sea route to Asia could be found, countries could buy spices and other items directly.
Second, religion played a role in exploration. Christians in Europe wanted to convert more people to their faith. Third, many Europeans had become interested in Asian cultures. Explorer Marco Polo's book about his travels throughout Asia remained popular in Europe long after his death in 1324. Many Europeans wanted to learn more about Asia and its cultures.

New technology played a major role in advancing world exploration. Sailors began to use tools such as the magnetic compass and the astrolabe, a device that enabled navigators to learn their ship's location by charting the position of the stars. Better instruments made it possible for sailors to travel the open seas without landmarks to guide them.
The Portuguese also made advances in shipbuilding. They began designing ships that were smaller, lighter, and easier to steer than the heavy galleons they had used before. These new ships, called caravels (ker-uh-velz), used triangular sails that, unlike traditional square sails, allowed ships to sail against the wind. By placing rudders at the back of the ship, the Portuguese also improved the steering of ships.

Analyzing How did Henry the Navigator promote exploration?
A
Sea Route to Asia By the 1400s Portugal had several motives, financial support, and the technology necessary for exploration. Portuguese explorers set out to find new lands.
Rounding Africa
Even with new technology, travel on the open seas was dangerous and difficult. One person described the effect on sailors of a voyage south from Portugal.
Those which survived could hardly be recognized as human. They had lost flesh and hair, the nails had gone from hands and feet . . . They spoke of heat so incredible that it was a marvel that ships and crews were not burnt/,
-Sailor, quoted in World Civilizations, edited by Edward McNall Burns, et al.
In spite of the dangers, Portuguese explorers continued sailing south, setting up trading posts along the way.
In 1488 Portuguese navigator Bartolomeu Dias led an expedition from Portugal southward along the African coast. A storm blew his ships around the southern tip of Africa. This point became known as the Cape of Good Hope. Dias wanted to continue his voyage, but his men did not. Since supplies were very low, Dias decided to call off the voyage and return to Portugal.
Later, King Manuel of Portugal sent another explorer, Vasco da Gama, on an expedition around the Cape of Good Hope. Da Gama left Lisbon, Portugal, in July 1497 and arrived in southwestern India the next year. Portugal had won the European race for a sea route to Asia.
When da Gama reached the Indian port of Calicut, Muslim traders met him and his men. The Muslims surprised the sailors by speaking to them in Portuguese. Soon da Gama and his crew learned that the people of India had been trading with Muslim and Italian merchants who knew Portuguese. Da Gama made two more trips back to India. He even governed a small colony there.
40 CHAPTER 2
Results of Exploration
Portugal's explorations would have major results, including the start of the Atlantic slave trade. As Portuguese sailors explored the west coast of Africa, they negotiated for gold, ivory, and slaves. The slave trade devastated African communities. It led to increased warfare among kingdoms and broke up many families. The Portuguese sent many enslaved Africans to Europe and to islands in the Atlantic, where they lived and worked under brutal conditions.
The other nations of Europe watched as new trade routes brought increased wealth and power to Portugal. They soon launched voyages of exploration to find their own water routes to Asia.

Columbus Sails across the Atlantic
Stories of fabulous kingdoms and wealth in Asia captured the imagination of Christopher Columbus, a sailor from Genoa, Italy. Columbus was convinced that he could reach Asia by sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean.
The Journey Begins
Columbus asked King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain to pay for an expedition across the Atlantic. He promised them great riches, new territory, and Catholic converts. It took Columbus several years to convince the king and queen, but they finally agreed to help finance the journey. Ferdinand and Isabella ordered Columbus to bring back any items of value and to claim for Spain any lands he explored.
On August 3,1492, Columbus's three ships set sail. The Nina and the Pinta were caravels. Columbus sailed in the larger Santa Maria. The ships carried about 90 sailors and a year's worth of supplies. They made a stop in the Canary Islands, and then on September 6, they resumed their journey. Soon, they passed the limits of Columbus's

maps and sailed into uncharted seas. After more than a month with no sight of land, the crew grew restless.
Soon the crew saw signs of land—birds and floating tree branches. Columbus promised a reward "to him who first sang out that he saw land." On October 12,1492, a lookout cried, "Land! Land!" ending the long journey from the Canary Islands.
The ships landed on an island in the Bahamas. Columbus thought he had found a new route to Asia. Instead, he had reached another continent that was unknown to him. Columbus called the island San Salvador, which means "Holy Savior." Columbus also visited another island he called Hispaniola. There he met the Taino (TY-noh). At that time Europeans called Asia the Indies, so Columbus, believing he was in Asia, called these Native American people Indians.
The Taino lived in small farming communities. In his journal, Columbus wrote that the Taino were "so generous ... that no
one would believe it who has not seen it." However, Columbus and his crew were not interested in Taino culture, but in gold. After three months of exploring, looking for gold, and collecting exotic plants and animals, Columbus returned to Spain.
Columbus made three more journeys to the Americas during his lifetime. In 1504 he returned to Spain in poor health. Columbus died two years later, still believing that he had reached Asia.
Impact of Columbus's Voyages
The voyages of Columbus changed the way Europeans thought of the world and their place in it. A new era of interaction between Europe and the Americas had begun.
Columbus’s discovery also created conflict between European countries. Both Spain and Portugal wanted to add these lands to their growing empires. In 1493, Pope Alexander VI, originally from Spain, issued a decree that drew a new boundary for Spain and Portugal.

LETTER
Christopher Columbus, 1494
Two years after discovering the island of Hispaniola, Columbus wrote a letter to the Spanish king and queen outlining his ideas of its colonization.
Most High and Mighty Sovereigns,
In the first place, as regards the Island of Espanola: Inasmuch as the number of colonists who desire to go thither [there] amounts to two thousand, owing to the land being safer and better for farming and trading ...
1.	That in the said island there shall be founded three or four towns ...
2.	That for the better and more speedy colonization of the said island, no one shall have liberty to collect gold in it except those who have taken out colonists' papers ...
That each town shall have its alcalde [Mayor]...
That there shall be a church, and parish priests or friars to administer the sacraments, to perform divine worship, and for the conversion of the Indians.
-Christopher Columbus,
letter to the king and queen of Spain, 1494
ANALYSIS
SKILLS ANALYZING PRIMARY SOURCES
What were Columbus's main concerns in founding a colony on Hispaniola?
This imaginary Line of Demarcation divided the Atlantic Ocean. Spain could claim all land west of the line.
The Portuguese king believed that this arrangement favored Spain. To prevent war, the leaders of the two nations signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, which moved the Line of Demarcation 800 miles further west. This gave Portugal more opportunity to claim lands unexplored by other Europeans.

Identifying Points of View
Why did Columbus want to sail across the Atlantic?
Other Explorers Sail to the 1 Americas
j Columbus's discoveries inspired others to sail i across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1501 explorer i Amerigo Vespucci (vuh-SPOO-chee) led a \ Spanish fleet to the coast of present-day j South America. He was convinced the land he reached was not Asia. Instead, Vespucci believed he had found a "new world." A Ger-; man mapmaker labeled the continents across the ocean America in honor of Vespucci. Europeans began using the names North America and South America for these lands.
In a Spanish settlement in present-day Panama, another explorer, Vasco Nunez de Balboa (NOON-yays day bahl-BOH-uh), heard stories from local Native Americans about another ocean farther west. Balboa set out to find it. For weeks he and his men struggled through thick jungle and deadly swamps. In 1513 they reached the top of a mountain. From this spot Balboa saw a great blue sea—the Pacific Ocean—stretching out before him.
In 1519, Ferdinand Magellan (muh-jEHL-uhn), a Portuguese navigator, set out with a Spanish fleet to sail down the east coast of South America. After sailing around the southern tip of the continent, Magellan continued into the Pacific even though his ships were dangerously low on food and fresh water.
Magellan's fleet sailed across the Pacific Ocean. In the Philippines, Magellan was killed in a battle with native peoples. Down to three ships, the expedition continued sailing west into the Indian Ocean. In 1522 the voyage's only remaining ship returned to Spain. Only 18 members of Magellan's original crew survived. These sailors were the first people to circumnavigate, or go all the way around, the globe. Their entire journey was some 40,000 miles long.
European explorers and settlers took plants and animals with them to the Americas. They also brought back a variety of new plants and animals to Europe, Asia, and Africa.
44 CHAPTER 2
This transfer became known as the Columbian Exchange because it started with Columbus's explorations. The Columbian Exchange dramatically changed the world.
European explorers found many plants in the Americas that were unknown to them, including corn, potatoes, tobacco, and cocoa. They brought these items to Europe, where they were highly valued. The explorers also introduced horses, cattle, and pigs to the Americas. Native Americans came to use these animals for food and transportation. They also started to farm European grains such as wheat and barley.
Without intending to do so, the explorers also introduced deadly new diseases to the Americas. Native Americans had no natural resistance to European diseases and often died as a result of their exposure to them.
Over time, a trading pattern involving the exchange of raw materials, manufactured products, and slaves developed among Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Europeans shipped millions of enslaved Africans to work in the colonies in the New World.

TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on Spanish conquest and settlement in the Americas.
Spanish Conquistadors
The Spanish sent conquistadors (kahn-kees-tuh-DAWRS), soldiers who led military expeditions in the Americas. Conquistador Hernan Cortes left Cuba to sail to present-day Mexico in 1519. Cortes had heard of a wealthy land to the west ruled by a king named Moctezuma II (mawk-tay-soo-mah).
Conquest of the Aztec Empire
Moctezuma ruled the Aztec Empire, which was at the height of its power in the early 1500s. Moctezuma's capital, Tenochtitlan, was built in the middle of Lake Texcoco, near the present-day site of Mexico City. Tenochtitlan was a large city with temples, a palace, and buildings that were built on an island in the middle of the lake. The buildings and riches of the city impressed the Spaniards. They saw the Aztec Empire as a good source of gold and silver. They also wanted to convert the Aztec to Christianity.
The Aztec had thousands of warriors. In contrast, Cortes had only 508 soldiers, about 100 sailors, 16 horses, and some guns. Cortes hoped that his superior weapons would bring him victory. Cortes also sought help from enemies of the Aztec. An Indian woman named Malintzin (mah-LiNT-suhn) helped Cortes win allies.
■6 CHAPTER 2
At first Moctezuma believed Cortes to be a god and welcomed him. Cortes then took Moctezuma prisoner and seized control of Tenochtitlan. Eventually, Tenochtitlan was destroyed and Moctezuma was killed. Smallpox and other diseases brought by the Spanish quickened the fall of the Aztec Empire.
Conquest of the Inca Empire
Another conquistador, Francisco Pizarro (puh-ZAHR-oh), heard rumors of the Inca cities in the Andes of South America. The Inca ruled a large territory that stretched along the Pacific coast from present-day Chile to northern Ecuador.
Pizarro had fewer than 400 men in his army. But the Inca, like the Aztec, had no weapons to match the conquistadors' swords and guns. Though outnumbered, Pizarro's troops captured the great Inca capital at Cuzco in present-day Peru and killed the Inca leaders. By 1534 Pizarro and his Native American allies had conquered the entire Inca Empire.
In only a few years, the Spanish had conquered two great American empires. During the conquest, the Spanish and their

Armored Warfare
The armor of the Spanish conquistadors helped them defeat the Aztec and Inca. Spanish soldiers and their horses wore armor made of steel. The steel protected the soldiers from enemy weapons but was heavy and hard to wear. Armored weapons of today's soldiers include tanks and other large vehicles. Inside these vehicles, soldiers are safer from enemy gunfire.
allies killed thousands of Inca and Aztec and looted their settlements. Moreover, possibly more than three-quarters of the Aztec and Inca populations were killed by the diseases the Europeans brought.
Spanish Settlements
The Spanish began to settle their vast empire, which they called New Spain. Spain's government wanted to control migration to the Americas. Most of the emigrants were Spanish, though a few non-Spanish subjects of the king also migrated. Jews, Muslims, and non-Christians were forbidden to settle in New Spain. At first, most emigrants were men. The government then encouraged families to migrate. Eventually, women comprised one-quarter of the total emigration from Spain.
Spain ruled its large American empire through a system of royal officials. At the top was the Council of the Indies, formed in 1524 to govern the Americas from Spain. The Council appointed two viceroys, or royal governors. The Viceroyalty of Peru governed most of South America. The Viceroyalty of New Spain governed all Spanish territories in

Central America, Mexico, and the southern part of what is now the United States.
The Spanish established three kinds of settlements in New Spain. Pueblos served as trading posts and sometimes as centers of government. Priests started missions where they converted local Native Americans to Catholicism. The Spanish also built presidios, or military bases, to protect towns and missions.
To connect some of the scattered communities of New Spain, Spanish settlers built El Camino Real, or "the Royal Road." This network of roads ran for hundreds of miles, from Mexico City to Santa Fe. The roads later stretched to settlements in California.

Exploring the Borderlands of New Spain
Spain's American empire was not limited to lands taken from the conquered Aztec and Inca empires. Many other Spanish explorers came to North America. They explored the borderlands of New Spain and claimed many new lands for the Spanish crown.
Exploring the Southeast
In 1508 explorer Juan Ponce de Leon landed on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. By 1511 he had conquered the island for Spain and founded the city of San Juan. De Leon also discovered gold on Puerto Rico. Spanish officials appointed him governor of the colony.
In 1512 Ponce de Leon discovered the coast of present-day Florida. The next year he searched Florida for a mythical Fountain of Youth. Though he never found the fabled fountain, Ponce de Leon acquired royal permission to colonize Florida. However, he failed to colonize the area.
Two decades later another explorer traveled through Florida. Royal officials gave Hernando de Soto permission to explore the coastal region of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1539 his expedition landed in an area near the present-day city of Tampa Bay, Florida.
De Soto then led his men north through what is now Georgia and the Carolinas. The expedition then turned west and crossed the Appalachian Mountains. De Soto discovered the Mississippi River in 1541. The explorers then traveled west into present-day Oklahoma. De Soto died in 1542 on this journey.
Exploring the Southwest
The Spanish also explored what is now the southwestern United States. In 1528 explorer Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca joined conquistador Panfilo de Narvaez on an expedition to North America. Their group of 300 men first landed on the Florida coast. They faced many severe problems, including a shortage of food.
CHAPTER 2
The group built boats, which made it possible for them to travel around the Florida panhandle. The explorers continued along the Gulf Coast and eventually reached the Mississippi River. Severe weather hit this group hard, and many members of the expedition died. Cabeza de Vaca's boat shipwrecked on what is now Galveston Island in Texas. Only four men survived: Cabeza de Vaca, a Moroccan-bom slave named Estevanico, his Spanish slaveholder, and one other sailor.
Each of the four survivors was captured and enslaved by Native American groups living in the area. After six years of captivity, the men finally escaped. They journeyed on foot throughout the North American Southwest, receiving help from Native Americans they met along the way. In 1536, after turning south, the group reached Spanish settlements in Mexico.
Soon after their journey ended, Estevani-co's slaveholder sold him to a Spanish viceroy. The viceroy assigned Estevanico to serve as a guide for a new expedition he was sending into the Southwest. Native Americans killed the enslaved African in 1539.
De Vaca eventually returned to Spain, where he called for better treatment of Native Americans. De Vaca later wrote about his experiences in the first European book exclusively devoted to North America. De Vaca's book increased Spanish interest in the New World. His writings fueled the rumors that riches could be found in North America.
For two thousand leagues did we travel, on land, and by sea in barges, besides ten months more after our rescue from captivity; untiringly did we walk across the land,... During all that time we crossed from one ocean to the other,... We heard that on the shores of the South there are pearls and great wealth, and that the richest and best is near there."
-Cabeza de Vaca, The Journey of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca
De Vaca's account inspired other explorers to travel to North America. In 1540 Francisco Vasquez de Coronado set out
Estevanico was an enslaved African who traveled with Cabeza de Vaca.

Spanish Treatment of Native Americans
The journeys of the Spanish explorers allowed Spain to claim a huge empire in the Americas. Spain's American colonies helped
make the country very wealthy. From 1503 to 1660, Spanish fleets loaded with treasure carried 200 tons of gold and 18,600 tons of silver from the former Aztec and Inca empires to Spain. Mexico and Peru also grew food to help support Spain's growing empire. However, these gains came with a price for Native Americans. Native peoples suffered greatly at the hands of the Spanish.
Forced Labor
By 1650 the Spanish Empire in the Americas had grown to some 3 to 4 million people. Native Americans made up about 80 percent of the population. The rest were whites, Africans, and people of mixed racial background. Settlers who came from Spain were called peninsulares (pay-neen-soo-LAHR-ays) and usually held the highest government positions. To reward settlers for their service to the Crown, Spain established the encomienda (en-koh-mee-EN-duh) system. It gave settlers the right to tax local Native Americans or to make them work. In exchange, these settlers were supposed to protect the ’ Native American people and convert them to Christianity. Instead, most Spanish treated ’ the Native Americans as slaves. Native Americans were forced to work in terrible conditions. They faced cruelty and desperate situations on a daily basis.
The Spanish operated many plantations, large farms that grew just one kind of crop. Plantations throughout the Caribbean colonies made huge profits for their owners. It took many workers to run a plantation, however, so colonists forced thousands of Native Americans to work in the fields. Indians who were taken to work on haciendas, the vast Spanish estates in Central and South America, had to raise and herd livestock. Other Native Americans were forced to endure the backbreaking work of mining gold and silver. The forced labor and harsh treatment killed many native people in New Spain.


0 CHAPTER 2
The Role of the Catholic Church
The Catholic Church played a major role in the interactions of the Spanish with Native Americans. The Spanish king commanded priests to convert the local people to the Christian faith. Some Native Americans combined Spanish customs with their own. Others rejected Spanish ideas completely.
Some European settlers in the Americas protested the terrible treatment of Native Americans. A priest named Bartolome de Las Casas said that the Spanish should try to convert Native Americans to Christianity by showing them love, gentleness, and kindness. The Spanish monarchs agreed, but the colonists did not always follow their laws.

Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the reasons for European voyages to North America, the search for a Northwest Passage, and the development of European empires in North America.
Many significant events took place in Europe in the 1500s. Disagreements about religion threw Europe into turmoil. Some of these disagreements eventually led to wars. At the same time, several European nations began to compete for land and power overseas.
Key Events in European History, *1450-1588

c. 1450
Johannes Gutenberg develops his movable-type printing press.
The Protestant Reformation
Spain and England Go to War
In 1517 a German priest named Martin Luther publicly criticized the Roman Catholic Church. Luther charged that the church was too wealthy and that it abused its power. Criticisms like Luther's started the Protestant Reformation. This religious movement began in small German towns but quickly spread to most of Europe. It became a part of many political disputes as well. The Protestants were reformers who protested some of the Catholic Church's practices. Many Protestants believed God meant for religion to be simple.
The printing press—a machine that produces printed copies using movable type— helped spread the ideas of the Reformation. Protestants printed large numbers of Bibles as well as short essays explaining their ideas. This let more people read and think about the Bible on their own, rather than relying solely on the teachings of a priest.
Conflicts between Catholics and Protestants took place throughout Europe, often leading to civil war. In the late 1500s French Catholics fought French Protestants, known as Huguenots (HYOO-guh-nahts). Many Huguenots eventually emigrated to the Americas in search of religious freedom.
In 1534 King Henry VIII founded the Church of England, or the Anglican Church. By making himself the head of the church, Henry challenged the authority of the pope and angered Catholics. Political issues soon became mixed with the religious struggles.
In the late 1500s King Philip II used Spain's great wealth to lead a Catholic Reformation against the Protestant movement. He hoped to drive the Protestants out of England. Standing in his way was the Protestant English queen Elizabeth I and her sea dogs. Sea dogs was the name given to English sailors who raided Spanish treasure ships. The most successful and daring was Sir Francis Drake.
Philip was angered by English piracy. He began gathering the Spanish Armada, a huge fleet of warships meant to end English plans. The Armada had about 130 ships and some 27,000 sailors and soldiers. This mighty fleet was launched to invade England and overthrow Queen Elizabeth and the Anglican Church. But in July 1588, the smaller, but faster, English fleet defeated the Armada in a huge battle.
The Armada's defeat shocked the Spanish. In addition to the naval defeat, Spain's economy was in trouble. The gold and silver that Spain received from the Americas caused high inflation. Inflation is a rise in the price of goods caused by an increase in the amount of money in use. Economic problems in Spain combined with the defeat of the Spanish Armada led countries such as England, France, and the Netherlands to challenge Spanish power overseas.

Search for a Northwest Passage
Europeans wanted to find a Northwest Passage, a water route through North America that would allow ships to sail from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The English began sending explorers to find it.
Italian sailor John Cabot knew that the king of England wanted to find such a route. Cabot offered to pay for his own expedition, asking only that the king of England grant him a royal charter to any lands he found. The king agreed, and Cabot made voyages to North America for England in 1497 and 1498.
Cabot sailed to North America, but he left very few records of his journeys. It is believed that he traveled along the coast of present-day Newfoundland in Canada. Although Cabot did not find a passage to the Pacific Ocean, his voyages were successful. They became the basis of England's claim to land in North America.
In 1524 France sent an Italian captain, Giovanni da Verrazano (vayr-raht-SAHN-oh), to seek a Northwest Passage. Verrazano sailed along the coast of North America from present-day North Carolina to Maine. Jacques Cartier (kahr-TYAY), a French sailor, led France's next major exploration of North America. He made two trips to what is now Canada. Cartier sailed into the Saint Lawrence River and traveled all the way to present-day Montreal, claiming the areas he explored for France.
The Dutch also entered the race. They hired English captain Henry Hudson to find a Northwest Passage. Hudson first sailed to present-day New York in 1609. The following year Hudson returned to North America, sailing under the English flag. He traveled far to the north. Eventually he reached a strait that he hoped would lead to the Pacific Ocean. Instead, it led into a huge bay, later named Hudson Bay.
None of these explorers ever found a Northwest Passage. Their explorations, however, led to increased European interest in North America.

European Colonization
The Spanish and the Portuguese were the early leaders in overseas exploration. They dominated the beginning of the era of European colonization of the New World, which lasted from the 1500s through the 1700s. However, Spain and Portugal focused on Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. They left much of North America unexplored. The English, French, and Dutch explored and colonized North America, seeking to expand their colonial empires there.
English Colonies in the New World
The period of English colonization began in the late 1500s when England decided to set up a permanent settlement in North America. This colony was to establish an English presence in the New World. Sir Walter Raleigh received a charter, a document giving him permission to start a colony. In 1584 he sent an expedition that landed in present-day Virginia and North Carolina. Raleigh named the entire area Virginia.
The following year, Raleigh sent another group to found a colony on Roanoke Island, off the coast of North Carolina. The English colonists at Roanoke found life hard. They fought with Native Americans and had trouble finding and growing food. They did not have the wilderness survival skills needed to combat the new environment they faced. After only a year, the remaining colonists returned to England.
John White and 150 colonists resettled Roanoke in 1587. White's granddaughter, Virginia Dare, was the first English colonist born in North America. After a few months, White went back to England to get more supplies. War with Spain prevented White from returning for three years. When he came back, White found the colony deserted. The only clue he found to the fate of the colonists was the word Croatoan, the name of a nearby island, carved into a post. Did the colonists try to escape a Native American attack by fleeing to the island? White never found out. To this day, no one is certain what happened to the "lost colony" at Roanoke.

French Colonies in the New World
France built its first North American settlement in Florida, when Huguenots started a few small colonies there in 1564. The Spanish soon destroyed these settlements and drove out the French. Religious wars in France slowed further French efforts to colonize North America. When the fighting ended, the French renewed efforts to settle present-day eastern Canada. The explorations of Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain gave France a claim to this region.
Nearly 70 years after Cartier sailed up the Saint Lawrence, French sailor Samuel de Champlain began exploring North America. He recorded his ideas about European exploration in his journal.
Through [exploration] we gain knowledge of different countries, regions and kingdoms; through it we attract and bring into our countries all kinds of riches; through it... Christianity [is spread] in all parts of the earth/'
-Samuel de Champlain, quoted in The Canadian Frontier, 1534-1760, by W. J. Eccles
Champlain followed Cartier's old paths. Over the years he made many journeys along
the Saint Lawrence River. He also visited the Great Lakes, led by Native American guides.
In 1608 Champlain founded a small colony named Quebec on the Saint Lawrence River. This trading post opened fur-trading routes for the French throughout the region. Champlain's explorations became the basis of France's claim to much of Canada.
In the late 1600s the French began spreading out from the Saint Lawrence River. Calling their North American territory New France, French fur traders, explorers, and missionaries were all on the move.
In the 1650s French missionaries told stories about "a beautiful river, large, broad, and deep." In 1673 explorer Louisjolliet (jahl-ee-ET) and missionary Jacques Marquette set out to find this great river, the Mississippi. (Hernando de Soto was the first European to find the Mississippi River, in 1541.) They reached the river and traveled down it as far as present-day Arkansas.
Nine years later Rene-Robert de La Salle followed the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. He claimed the Mississippi Valley for King Louis XIV of France. To honor the king, La Salle named the region Louisiana.
NEW EMPIRES IN THE AMERICAS 55

Starting in the 1700s, the French built new outposts. These included Detroit on the Great Lakes and Saint Louis and New Orleans along the Mississippi River. Most towns in the French territory were small. As late as 1688 there were only about 12,000 French settlers in New France. The French focused on trapping the wild animals they found instead of establishing agriculture. Beaver pelts used in hatmaking became especially profitable. New France's small population and the value of the fur trade led French settlers to ally and trade with local Native American groups.
Because of their close trading relationships, the French treated the Native Americans with more respect than some other European settlers had done. Many French settlers learned Native American languages, and they even adopted their ways of life.
Dutch Colonies in the New World
The English and the French were not the only European powers to seek colonial empires in North America. The Dutch, who had merchant fleets around the world, came in search of trade. They also exploited the fur resources in the area. They claimed the land between the Delaware and Hudson rivers and called it New Netherland. This area included parts of what are now New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,and Delaware. In 1624 the newly formed Dutch West India Company sent about 30 families to settle in New Netherland. Two years later Peter Minuit bought Manhattan Island from local Native Americans for about $24. Minuit then founded the town of New Amsterdam, now New York City. To attract colonists, the Dutch allowed members of all religions to settle in their colony.
Minuit also helped Swedish settlers found New Sweden along the Delaware River. The first settlement, Fort Christina, was begun in 1638. The Swedish settlement was small, but the Dutch felt that it threatened Dutch lands and fur trading. The two sides fought a series of battles. Finally, the governor of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant (STY-vi-suhnt),
conquered New Sweden in 1655. He allowed the Swedes to continue their colony, but he called it the "Swedish Nation."

The Need for a New Labor Force
European diseases had a devastating effect on the Native American population. Measles, smallpox, and typhus were common in Europe. As a result, most adult Europeans were immune, or had a natural resistance, to them. Native Americans, however, had never been exposed to such diseases and had no immunity to them. As a result, many Native Americans became terribly sick after their first encounters with Europeans. Millions of them died in the years after Columbus reached the New World.
No one knows exactly how many Native Americans died from European diseases, but the loss of life was staggering. Spanish author Fernandez de Oviedo reported in 1548 about the destruction of the Native Americans of Hispaniola. He reported that, of the estimated 1 million Indians who had lived on the island in 1492, "there are not now believed to be at the present time... five hundred persons [left]." In North America the Native American population north of Mexico was about 10 million when Columbus arrived. This

i8 CHAPTER 2
number would drop to less than a million. The drop in the native population played a major role in the emerging need for an alternative labor force.
Plantation agriculture was a mainstay of the colonial economic structure. Spain and Portugal established sugar plantations that relied on large numbers of native laborers. In the 1600s English tobacco farmers in North America also needed workers for their plantations. With a lack of Native American workers, they, too, needed another source of labor. Plantation owners in both North and South America wanted a cheap work force.
Some colonists, including Spanish priest Bartolome de Las Casas, suggested using enslaved Africans as workers. Africans had already developed immunity to European diseases. The colonists soon agreed that slaves from West Africa could be the solution to their labor needs.

The Slave Trade
In 1510 the Spanish government legalized the sale of slaves in its colonies. The first full cargo ship of Africans arrived in the Americas eight years later. Over the next century, more than a million enslaved Africans were brought to the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the New World. The Dutch and English also became active in the slave trade.
Middle Passage
Enslavement was a horrible experience for the slaves. Most enslaved people had been captured in the interior of Africa, often by Africans who profited from selling slaves to Europeans. The captives were chained around the neck and then marched to the coast. This journey could be as long as 1,000 miles.
The Middle Passage was the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean that enslaved Africans were forced to endure. Africans were packed like cargo in the lower decks of the slave ships. The slaves were chained together and crammed

In this confinement, disease spread quickly, killing many Africans. Others suffocated or died from malnutrition. Some slaves took their own lives to end their suffering. It is estimated that one out of every six Africans died during the Middle Passage. African Diaspora
Between the 1520s and 1860s about 12 million Africans were shipped across the Atlantic as slaves. More than 10 million of these captives survived the voyage and reached the Americas. The slave trade led to the African Diaspora. (A diaspora is the scattering of a people.) Enslaved Africans were sent all across the New World.
More than a third of the enslaved Africans, nearly 4 million people, were sent to Brazil. Most of those slaves were forced to work on Portuguese sugar plantations. Nearly 2 million slaves went to the colonies of New Spain. Some worked on plantations in the Caribbean, while others were taken to the mines of Peru and Mexico. Some 3 million slaves worked in British and French colonies in the Caribbean and Latin America. More than 600,000 slaves went to Britain's North American colonies that later became the United States.
Colonial leaders across the Americas developed laws that regulated slave treatment and behavior. Slaves were given few rights in the colonies. The law considered enslaved Africans to be property. In some colonies, a slaveholder was not charged with

murder if he killed a slave while punishing him. Enslaved Africans, on the other hand, received harsh penalties for minor offenses, such as breaking a tool. Runaways were often tortured and sometimes killed.
The treatment of enslaved Africans varied. Some slaves reported that their masters treated them kindly. To protect their investment, some slaveholders provided adequate food and clothing for their slaves. However, severe treatment was very common. Whippings, brandings, and even worse torture were all part of American slavery.

AND PREVIEW
After disease much of the Native American population, colonists turned to slave labor. In the next chapter you will learn about English colonies in the Americas. Slave Culture in the Americas
Slaves in the Americas came from many different parts of Africa. They spoke different languages and had different cultural backgrounds. But enslaved Africans also shared many customs and viewpoints. They built upon what they had in common to create a new African American culture.
Families were a vital part of slave culture. Families provided a refuge—a place not fully under the slaveholders' control. However, slave families faced many challenges. Families were often broken apart when a family member was sold to another owner. In Latin America, there were many more enslaved males than females. This made it difficult for slaves there to form stable families.
Religion was a second refuge for slaves. It gave enslaved Africans a form of expression that was partially free from their slaveholders' control. Slave religion was primarily Christian, but it included traditional elements from African religions as well. Religion gave slaves a sense of self worth and a hope for salvation in this life and the next. Spirituals were a common form of religious expression among slaves. Slaves also used songs and folktales to tell their stories of sorrow, hope, agony, and joy.

NEW EMPIRES IN THE AMERICAS 61

111
The slave system that arose in the American colonies was strongly influenced by geographic forces. The climate of the southern colonies was suited to growing certain crops, like cotton, tobacco, and sugarcane. These crops required a great deal of labor to grow and to process. To meet this great demand for labor, the colonists looked to one main source—enslaved Africans.

Mahommah 6. Baquaqua was captured and sold into slavery as a young man. In this 1854 account, he recalls being taken to the African coast to board a slave ship.
“I was taken down to the river and placed on board a boat; the river was very large and branched off in two different directions, previous to emptying itself into the sea ... We were two nights and one day on this river, when we came to a ... place ... [where] the slaves were all put into a pen, and placed with our backs to the fire ... When all were ready to go aboard, we were chained together, and tied with ropes round about our necks, and were thus drawn down to the sea shore."

Framing Historical Questions
Define the Skill J
One of the most valuable ways that people gain knowledge is by asking effective questions. An effective question is one that obtains the kind of information the person asking the question desires. The ability to frame, or construct, effective questions is an important life skill as well as a key to gaining a better understanding of history. Asking effective historical questions will aid you in studying history and in conducting historical research.
Learn the Skill
Effective questions are specific, straightforward, and directly related to the topic. When we do not obtain the information we want or need, often it is because we have asked the wrong questions. Asking effective questions is not as easy as it seems. It requires thought and preparation. The following guidelines will help you in framing effective questions about history and other topics as well.
1.	Determine exactly what you want to know.
2.	Decide what questions to ask and write them down. Having written questions is very important. They will help guide your study or research and keep you focused on your topic and goal.
you want to know. For example, if you wanted to know more about trade and the voyages of exploration that are discussed in Chapter 2, "What were the voyages of exploration?" may not be a good question to ask. This question is too broad. Its answer would not give you the information you want.
Asking "Why was trade the most important cause of the voyages of exploration?" would not be an effective question either. This question is biased because it assumes trade was the main reason for the voyages, when that might not have been true. Good historical investigation assumes nothing that is not known to be fact. A more effective question, which would get the information you want, is "Were trade and the voyages of exploration connected, and, if so, in what ways?" Do you see now why wording is so important in asking effective questions and why you should write out and review your questions beforehand?
Practice the Skill
Reread the information about Cortes and the Aztec on pages 46-47, then complete the activities below.
1.	Suppose you wanted to learn more about
Cortes's defeat of the Aztec. Decide whether each of the following would be an effective question to ask about this topic. Explain why or why not.
3.	Review each of your questions to make sure it is specific, straightforward, and directly related to your topic.
4.	Rewrite any questions that are vague, too broad, or biased.
Questions that are vague or too broad are likely to produce information not directly related to what
a.	What happened when the Aztec and the Spanish met?
b.	Why did other Indians betray the Aztec?
c.	What resources did Cortes have that helped him conquer the Aztec?
2.	Frame five questions that would be effective in helping you to learn more about this topic.

Evaluating Sources
FOCUS
On Reading Historians study both primary and secondary sources to learn about the past. By studying both types, they can get a better picture of what life was like. Assessing Primary and Secondary Sources
However, not all sources are accurate or reliable. Checklists like the ones below can help you judge which sources are reliable and worth using in your research. Be sure to confirm facts in one source with other reliable sources. When you use facts in a report, you should always cite the source where you located the information.
Evaluating Language if a source uses biased or emotional language or has many factual or grammatical errors, it may not be valid. If the author states opinions as if they were facts, the source may be inaccurate.
Visual Sources Visual sources may be invalid if they contain factual errors or depictions of biased stereotypes. Remember that sometimes videos or photographs are fake or created for entertainment. A movie about the colony at Jamestown, for example, may not be historically accurate.
Not everyone who writes about history is a good historian. Try to ; use sources by qualified writers.
Good historians will always tell you where they got their information.
If information isn't documented, you can't always trust that it is true or accurate.

Checklist for Secondary Sources
/ Who is the author or creator? What are his or her credentials or qualifications?
/ Where did the author get his or her information?
/ Is the information in the source properly documented?
/ Has the author or creator drawn valid conclusions from his or her sources?

Bf TAKING NOTES	1
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the founding of the southern colonies.
BDING BACKGROUND
Several European nations took part in ce to claim lands in the Americas. Their next step was to establish • iesinthe lands thatthey claimed. The first English colonies were
started in the late 1500s but failed. Even in successful colonies, colonists s faced hardships and challenges.
Settlement in Jamestown
In 1605 a company of English merchants asked King James I for the right to found, or establish, a settlement. In 1606 the king granted the request of the company to settle in a region called Virginia.
Founding a New Colony
The investors in the new settlement formed a joint-stock company called the London Company. This allowed the group to share the cost and risk of establishing the colony. On April 26,1607, the first 105 colonists sent by the London Company arrived in America. On May 14, about 40 miles up the James River in Virginia, the colonists founded Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America.
A lack of preparation cost a lot of the colonists their lives. Most of the men who came to Jamestown were adventurers with no farming experience or useful skills such as carpentry. Jamestown was surrounded by marshes full of disease-carrying mosquitoes. By the time winter arrived, two-thirds of the original colonists had died.

2. Human-Environment Interaction What do you think would have been a commonly used method of transportation for people in this region?
Powhatan Confederacy
Jamestown fared better under John Smith, who took control of the colony and built a fort in 1608. He forced the settlers to work harder and to build better housing by creating rules that rewarded harder workers with food. The colonists received help from the powerful Powhatan Confederacy of Native Americans after Smith made an agreement with them. The Powhatan brought food to help the colonists and taught them how to grow com.
In 1609 some 400 more settlers arrived in Jamestown. That winter, disease and famine once again hit the colony. The colonists called this period the starving time. By the spring of 1610, only 60 colonists were still alive. Jamestown failed to make a profit until colonist John Rolfe introduced a new type of tobacco that sold well in England.
War in Virginia
John Rolfe married Pocahontas, daughter of the Powhatan leader, in 1614. Their marriage helped the colonists form more peaceful relations with the Powhatan. However, Pocahontas died three years later in England, where she was visiting with Rolfe.
In 1622, colonists killed a Powhatan leader. The Powhatan responded by attacking the Virginia settlers later that year. Fighting between the colonists and the Powhatan continued for the next 20 years. Because the London Company could not protect its colonists, the English Crown canceled the company's charter in 1624. Virginia became a royal colony and existed under the authority of a governor chosen by the king.

Daily Life in Virginia
In early Virginia, people lived on scattered farms rather than in towns. Tobacco farmers established large farms called plantations. Tobacco was so valuable that it was sometimes used as money.
Headright System
These plantations were made possible in part by the headright system, which was started by the London Company. Under this system, colonists who paid their own way to Virginia received 50 acres of land. A colonist could earn another 50 acres for every additional person brought from England. Rich colonists who brought servants or relatives to Virginia gained large amounts of land.

A
Note from Virginia In this 1619 letter, the secretary of the Virginia colony,
John Pory, encouraged people to move to Virginia.
“As touching the quality of this country, three things there be, which in ferny ears may bring this co bony to perfection; the English glow, vineyards, &, cattle... All our riches for the present do consist in tobacco, wherein one man by his own labor has in one year, raised to himself to the vadue of ZOO pounds sterlings and another by the means of sir. servants has cleared at one crop n thousand pound English. These be true, yet indeed rare examples,yet possible to be done by others.”

analysis
SKILL j Analyzing primary sources
How does this letter indicate the importance of tobacco in Virginia?
Labor in Virginia
Colonists in Virginia suffered very high death rates, which led to labor shortages. The majority of workers were indentured servants. These servants signed a contract to work for four to seven years for those who paid for their journey to America.
Expansion of Slavery
Not all laborers in Virginia came from Europe. A Dutch ship brought the first Africans to Virginia in 1619. Some Africans were servants; others had been enslaved. Some African servants became successful farmers when their contracts ended.
The demand for workers was soon greater than the supply of people willing to work as indentured servants. Over time, the cost of slaves fell. These factors led some colonists to turn to slave labor. By the mid-1600s most Africans in Virginia were being kept in lifelong slavery.
Bacon's Rebellion
As plantations grew, the economy of Jamestown began to expand. Soon, colonial officials began to ask for more taxes. During the mid-1600s poor colonists protested the higher taxes. They were also upset about the governor's policies toward Native Americans. They thought the colony was not well protected against attack. In 1676 a group of former indentured servants led by Nathaniel Bacon attacked some friendly American Indians. Bacon opposed the governor's policies promoting trade with American Indians. He also thought the colonists should be able to take the Indians' land. When the governor tried to stop him, Bacon and his followers attacked and burned Jamestown in an uprising known as Bacon's Rebellion.
At one point, Bacon controlled much of the colony. He died of fever, however, and the rebellion soon ended.

Colonial Williamsburg Foundation
Other Southern Colonies
As Jamestown was developing in Virginia, new groups of colonists began planning their move to America. Many English Catholics came to America to escape religious persecution. English Catholics had long been against England's separation from the Roman Catholic Church. For this reason they were not allowed by the Church of England to worship freely. English leaders also feared that English Catholics would ally with Catholic countries such as France and Spain in conflicts. Maryland
In the 1620s George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, asked King Charles I for a charter establishing a new colony in America for Catholics. In 1632 Charles issued the charter to Calvert's son, Cecilius, who took over the planning of the colony. Cecilius, known as the second Lord Baltimore, named the colony Maryland in honor of England's queen, Henrietta Maria. It was located just north of Virginia in the Chesapeake Bay area. Calvert intended for the colony to be a refuge for English Catholics. It would also be a proprietary colony.
This meant that the colony's proprietors, or owners, controlled the government.
In 1634 a group of 200 English Catholics came to Maryland. Included in the group were wealthy landowners, servants, craftspeople, and farmers. Settlers in Maryland benefited from the lessons learned by the Jamestown colonists. They spent their time raising corn, cattle, and hogs so that they would have enough to eat. Before long, many colonists also began growing tobacco for profit.
Although Catholics founded Maryland, a growing number of Protestants began moving there in the 1640s. Soon, religious conflicts arose between Catholics and Protestants in the colony. To reduce tensions, Lord Baltimore presented a bill to the colonial assembly that became known as the Toleration Act of 1649. This bill made it a crime to restrict the religious rights of Christians. This was the first law supporting religious tolerance passed in the English colonies.
The Toleration Act did not stop all religious conflict. However, it did show that the government wanted to offer some religious freedom and to protect the rights of minority groups.

The Carolinas and Georgia
Colonies were also established south of Virginia. In 1663 the English king, Charles II, gave much of the land between Virginia and Spanish Florida to eight of his supporters. At first Carolina was a single colony. However, the settlements were far apart, and it was hard to govern them. In 1712 the colony separated into North and South Carolina.
Most of the colonists in North Carolina were farmers who had moved south from Virginia. Colonists primarily from Europe settled South Carolina. Those who paid their own way received large grants of land, and some brought enslaved Africans with them. By 1730 about 20,000 enslaved Africans were living in the colony, compared to some 10,000 white settlers.
South Carolina's proprietors managed the colony poorly, and in 1719 the proprietary government was overthrown. The
James Oglethorpe tried to prevent slavery in Georgia. But slaves soon provided the labor for the colony's many rice plantations.
Crown then purchased North and South Carolina in 1729, making them royal colonies.
In 1732 King George II granted a charter to James Oglethorpe and other trustees to found Georgia. The king hoped that Georgia would shield Britain's other colonies from Spanish Florida. Oglethorpe wanted the new colony to be a place where debtors, who had been jailed for their debts in England, could make a new start. In 1733 Oglethorpe and 120 colonists, mostly from England, founded the city of Savannah.
Oglethorpe did not want Georgia to have large plantations owned by a few wealthy individuals. He wanted many small farmers. To reach this goal, Oglethorpe outlawed slavery and limited the size of land grants. Soon, however, the settlers grew unhappy with Oglethorpe's strict rules. In 1752 the British government made Georgia a royal colony with new laws. Coastal Georgia was soon filled with large rice plantations worked by thousands of slaves.

CHAPTER 3
Economies of the
Southern Colonies
The economies of the southern colonies depended on agriculture. They also exported materials for building ships, such as wood and tar. Some colonies traded with local Indians for deerskins to sell.
The colonies had many small farms and some large plantations. Farms did well because the South enjoyed a warm climate and a long growing season. Many farms grew cash crops that were sold for profit. Tobacco, rice, and indigo—a plant used to make blue dye—were the most important cash crops.
The southern colonies' cash crops required a great deal of difficult work to grow and harvest. This meant a large workforce was needed. By the 1700s enslaved Africans, rather than indentured servants, had become the main source of labor. African slaves brought with them knowledge that helped turn the wild environment into profitable farms. Many had previous experience raising cattle and knew the method for clearing brush using fire.
Slavery was a viciously brutal condition for many inhabitants of the southern
colonies. One former slave named Olaudah Equiano recorded his experiences.
^Tortures, murder, and every other imaginable barbarity... are practiced upon the poor slaves with impunity [no punishment]. I hope the slave-trade will be abolished/'
—Olaudah Equiano, from The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African
Most of the southern colonies passed slave codes, or laws to control slaves. Colonies with large numbers of slaves had the strictest slave codes. For example, South Carolina's slaveholders feared that slaves would revolt. As a result, South Carolina's code said slaves could not hold meetings or own weapons. Some colonies did not allow slaveholders to free their slaves.

If YOU were there...
You live in a town near London in the early 1700s. Some of your neighbors are starting new lives in the American colonies. You would like to go with them, but you cannot afford the cost of the trip. There is one way you can go, though. You can sign a paper promising to work as a servant for five years. Then you would be free—and in a new country!
Would you sign the paper and go to America?

I TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the reasons English colonists came to New England.
B)ING BACKGROUND
England's first successful colonial rients were in Virginia. They were started mainly as business es. Other colonists in North America had different reasons for ‘ leavingtheirhomes. Many, like the Pilgrims and Puritans, came to
have freedom to practice their religious beliefs. Others, like the person ! above, simply wanted a new way of life.
Pilgrims and Puritans
Religious tensions in England remained high after the Protestant Reformation. A Protestant group called the Puritans wanted to purify, or reform, the Anglican Church. The Puritans thought that bishops and priests had too much power over church members.
Pilgrims on the Move
The most extreme English Protestants wanted to separate from the Church of England. These Separatists formed their own churches and cut all ties with the Church of England. In response, Anglican leaders began to punish Separatists.
The Pilgrims were one Separatist group that left England in the early 1600s to escape persecution. The Pilgrims moved to the Netherlands in 1608. The Pilgrims were immigrants—people who have left the country of their birth to live in another country.
The Pilgrims were glad to be able to practice their religion freely. They were not happy, however, that their children were

learning the Dutch language and culture. The Pilgrims feared that their children would forget their English traditions. The Pilgrims decided to leave Europe altogether. They formed a joint-stock company with some merchants and then received permission from England to settle in Virginia.
On September 16,1620, a ship called the Mayflower left England with more than 100 men, women, and children aboard. Not all of these colonists were Pilgrims. However, Pilgrim leaders such as William Bradford sailed with the group.
The Mayflower Compact
After two months of rough ocean travel, the Pilgrims sighted land far north of Virginia. The Pilgrims knew that they would thus be outside the authority of Virginia's colonial government when they landed. Their charter would not apply. So, they decided to establish their own basic laws and social rules to govern the colony they would found.
On November 21, 1620, 41 of the male passengers on the ship signed the Mayflower Compact, a legal contract in which they agreed to have fair laws to protect the general good. The Compact represents one of the first attempts at self-government in the English colonies.
In late 1620 the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in present-day Massachusetts. The colonists struggled through the winter. Nearly half died during this first winter from sickness and the freezing weather, but the colony became the first permanent European colony in New England.
Pilgrims and Native Americans
In March 1621 a Native American named Samoset walked boldly into the colonists' settlement. He spoke in broken English. Samoset had learned some English from the crews of English fishing boats. He gave the Pilgrims useful information about the peoples and places of the area. He also introduced them to a Patuxet Indian named Squanto. Squanto had at one time lived in Europe and spoke English as well.

HISTORICAL DOCUMENT
The Mayflower Compact
In November 1620, Pilgrim leaders aboard the Mayflower drafted the Mayflower Compact. This excerpt from the Mayflower Compact describes the principles of the Pilgrim colony's government.
The Pilgrims describe the reasons they want to form a colony in North America.
We whose names are underwritten ... having undertaken, for the glory of God, and advancement of the Christian faith, and the honour of our King and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia, do by these presents solemnly and mutually in the presence of God, and one of another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body politic for our better ordering and preservation and furtherance of the z ends aforesaid; and by virtue hereof, to enact, The Pilgrims constitute, and frame such just and equal laws, promise to

2.	How do you think the Mayflower Compact influenced later governments in America?
From Squanto the Pilgrims learned to fertilize the soil with fish remains. Squanto also helped the Pilgrims establish relations with the local Wampanoag Indians. Conditions in the Plymouth colony began to improve.
The Pilgrims invited Wampanoag chief Massasoit and 90 other guests to celebrate their harvest. This feast became known as the first Thanksgiving. For the event, the Pilgrims killed wild turkeys. This event marked the survival of the Pilgrims in the new colony.

Pilgrim Community
Although the Pilgrims overcame many problems, their small settlement still struggled. Most Pilgrims became farmers, but the farmland around their settlement was poor. They had hoped to make money by trading furs and by fishing. Unfortunately, fishing and hunting conditions were not good in the area. Some colonists traded corn with American Indians for beaver furs. The Pilgrims made little money but were able to form a strong community. The colony began to grow stronger in the mid-1620s after new settlers arrived and, as in Jamestown, colonists began to have more rights to farm their own land.
The Pilgrims' settlement was different from Virginia's in that it had many families. The Pilgrims taught their children to read and offered some education to their indentured servants. Families served as centers of religious life, health care, and community well-being.
All family members worked together to survive during the early years of the colony. Women generally cooked, spun and wove wool, and sewed clothing. They also made soap and butter, carried water, dried fruit, and cared for livestock. Men spent most of their time repairing tools and working in the fields. They also chopped wood and built shelters.
Women in the Colony
In Plymouth, women had more legal rights than they did in England. In England women were not allowed to make contracts, to sue, or to own property. In America, Pilgrim women had the right to sign contracts and to bring some cases before local courts. Widows could also own property.
From time to time, local courts recognized the ways women helped the business community. Widow Naomi Silvester received a large share of her husband's estate. The court called her "a frugal [thrifty] and laborious [hardworking] woman."
Puritans Leave England
During the 1620s England's economy suffered. Many people lost their jobs. The English king, Charles I, made the situation worse by raising taxes. This unpopular act led to a political crisis. At the same time, the Church of England began to punish Puritans because they were dissenters, or people who disagree with official opinions. King Charles refused to allow Puritans to criticize church actions.
Great Migration
These economic, political, and religious problems in England led to the Great Migration. Between 1629 and 1640 many thousands of English men, women, and children left England. More than 40,000 of these people moved to English colonies in New England and the Caribbean. In 1629, Charles granted a group of Puritans and merchants a charter to settle in New England. They formed the Massachusetts Bay Company.
In 1630 a fleet of ships carrying Puritan colonists left England for Massachusetts to seek religious freedom. They were led by John Winthrop. The Puritans believed that they had made a covenant, or promise, with God to build an ideal Christian community.
A
New Colony The Puritans arrived in New England well prepared to start their colony. They brought large amounts of tools and livestock with them. Like the Pilgrims, the Puritans faced little resistance from local American Indians. Trade with the Plymouth colony helped them too. In addition, the region around Boston had a fairly healthful climate. Thus, few Puritans died from sickness. All of these things helped the Massachusetts Bay Colony do well. By 1691, the Massachusetts Bay Colony had expanded to include the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony.

Religion and Government in New England
Massachusetts Bay Colony had to obey English laws. However, its charter provided more independence than did the royal charter of i	Virginia. For example, it created a General
I
Court to help run the Massachusetts colony, t	The Puritan colonists turned this court
into a type of self-government to represent the needs of the people. Each town sent two or three delegates to the Court. After
John Winthrop served as the colony's first governor, the General Court elected the governor and his assistants. In 1644 the General Court became a two-house, or bicameral, legislature.
Politics and religion were closely linked in Puritan New England. Government leaders were also church members, and ministers often had a great deal of power in Puritan communities. Male church members were the only colonists who could vote. Colonists became full members in the church by becoming what the Puritans called God's "elect," or chosen. Reaching this status was a difficult process. Individuals had to pass a public test to prove that their faith was strong.
In 1636 minister Thomas Hooker and his followers left Massachusetts to help found Connecticut, another New England colony.

Biography
Anne Hutchinson
1591-1643
In 1634 Anne Hutchinson emigrated with her family from England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. After settling in Boston, she worked as a nurse and midwife. She also hosted a Bible-study class that met in her home. Over time, Hutchinson began to question the teachings of the local ministers. Meanwhile, her popularity grew.
After being banished from the colony, Hutchinson settled in Rhode Island and, later, Long Island. She died in an American Indian attack. Today we remember her as a symbol of the struggle for religious freedom.
Drawing Conclusions Why do
you think church leaders disliked Hutchinson's ideas?
Church and State
"crs
-
Religion Affected Government
•	Government leaders were church members.
•	Ministers had great authority.
.. '
Government Affected Religion
•	Government leaders outlawed certain religious views.
•	Government leaders punished dissenters.
In 1639 Hooker wrote the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. This set of principles made Connecticut's government more democratic. For example, the Orders allowed men who were not church members to vote. As a result, some historians call Hooker the father of American democracy. The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut also outlined the powers of the general courts.
Not all Puritans shared the same religious views. Minister Roger Williams did not agree with Massachusetts leaders. He called for his church to separate completely from the other New England congregations. He also criticized the General Court for taking land from American Indians without paying them.
Puritan leaders worried that Williams's ideas might hurt the unity of the colony, and they made him leave. Williams took his supporters to southern New England. They formed a new settlement called Providence. This settlement later developed into the colony of Rhode Island. In Providence, Williams supported the separation of the church from the state. He also believed in religious tolerance for all members of the community.
In Boston, an outspoken woman also angered Puritan church leaders. Anne Hutchinson publicly discussed religious ideas that some leaders thought were radical. For example, Hutchinson believed that people's relationship with God did not need guidance from ministers.
Hutchinson's views alarmed Puritans such as John Winthrop. Puritan leaders did not believe that women should be religious leaders. Puritan leaders put Hutchinson on trial for her ideas. The court decided to force her out of the colony. With a group of followers, Hutchinson helped found the new colony of Portsmouth, later a part of the colony of Rhode Island. Although these differences among religious views caused some community conflicts, they were also an important step in the development of religious freedom in the colonies.

CHAPTER 3
Reading Check
Perhaps the worst community conflicts in New England involved the witchcraft trials of the early 1690s. The largest number of trials were held in Salem, Massachusetts. In Salem a group of girls had accused people of casting spells on them. The community formed a special court to judge the witchcraft cases. The court often pressured the suspected witches to confess. Before the trials had ended, the Salem witch trials led to 19 people being put to death.
Identifying Cause and
Effect What led to religious disagreements among the Puritans, and what was the result?
New England Economy
Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island were very different from the southern colonies. The often harsh climate and rocky soil meant that few New England farms could grow cash crops. Most farming families grew crops and raised animals for their own use. There was thus little demand for farm laborers. Although some people held slaves, slavery did not become as important to this region.
Merchants
Trade was vital to New England's economy. New England merchants traded goods locally, with other colonies, and overseas. Many of them traded local products such as furs, pickled beef, and pork. Many merchants grew in power and wealth, becoming leading members of the New England colonies. Fishing
Fishing became one of the region's leading industries. The rich waters off New England's coast served as home to many fish, including cod, mackerel, and halibut. Merchants exported dried fish. Colonists also began hunting for whales that swam close to shore. Whales were captured with harpoons, or spears, and dragged to shore. Whaling provided valuable oil for lighting.
Shipbuilding
Shipbuilding became an important industry in New England for several reasons. The area had plenty of forests that provided materials for shipbuilding. As trade—particularly in slaves—in the New England seaports grew, more merchant ships were built. The fishing industry also needed ships. New England shipyards made high-quality, valuable vessels. Ship owners sometimes even told their captains to sell the ship along with the cargo when they reached their destination.
Skilled Craftspeople
The northern economy needed skilled craftspeople. Families often sent younger sons to learn skilled trades such as blacksmithing, weaving, shipbuilding, and printing. The young boys who learned skilled trades were known as apprentices.
Apprentices lived with a master craftsman and learned from him. In exchange, the boys performed simple tasks. Apprentices promised to work for a master craftsman for a set number of years. They learned trades that were essential to the survival of the colonies. Apprentices received food and often clothing from the craftsmen. Gabriel Ginings, for example, was an apprentice in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. He received "sufficient food and raiment [clothing] suitable for such an apprentice," as his 1663 contract stated.
After a certain amount of time had passed, apprentices became journeymen. They usually traveled and learned new skills in their trade. Eventually they would become a master of the trade themselves.

Public Education
THE IMPACT
TODAY
Public schools are the main source of education for most children in the United States. About 50 million students are enrolled in the nation's public elementary and secondary schools.
To be sure that future generations would have educated ministers, communities established town schools. In 1647 the General Court of" Massachusetts issued an order that a school be founded in every township of 50 families.
Schoolchildren often used the New England Primer, which had characters and stories from the Bible. They learned to read at the same time that they learned about the community's religious values.
The availability of schooling varied in the colonies. There were more schools in New England than in the other colonies where most children lived far from towns. These children had to be taught by their parents or by private tutors. Most colonial children stopped their education after the elementary grades. Many went to work, either on their family farm or away from home.
Higher Education
Higher education was also important to the colonists. In 1636 John Harvard and the General Court founded Harvard College. Harvard taught ministers and met the colony's need for higher education. The second college founded in the colonies, William and Mary, was established in Virginia in 1693.
By 1700 about 70 percent of men and 45 percent of women in New England could read and write. These figures were much lower in Virginia, where Jamestown was the only major settlement.

The Dutch founded New Netherland in 1613 as a trading post for exchanging furs with the Iroquois. The center of the fur trade in New Netherland was the town of New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. Generous land grants to patroons, or lords, and religious tolerance soon brought Jews, French Huguenots, Puritans, and others to the colony.

Soon after the English conquest in 1664, the Duke of York made Sir George Carteret and Lord John Berkeley proprietors of New Jersey. This colony occupied lands between the Hudson and Delaware rivers. It had a diverse population, including Dutch, Swedes, Finns, and Scots. The fur trade was important to the economies of New York and New Jersey through the end of the 1600s.

n Penn was bom in London as the if a wealthy admiral. Penn joined the akers in 1666 and became an active eacher and writer of religious works. He supported toleration of dissenters.
In 1681 he received a charter to establish a new colony called Pennsylvania. There, Penn put his beliefs into practice. He insisted on fair dealings with local American Indians, welcomed immigrants, and promised religious toleration.
Making Generalizations How did Penn's ideas influence the rules of the colony?
*******
Penn's Colony
The Society of Friends, or the Quakers, made up one of the largest religious groups in New Jersey. Quakers did not follow formal religious practices and dressed plainly. They believed in the equality of men and women before God. They also supported nonviolence and religious tolerance for all people. At the time, many Quaker beliefs and practices shocked most Christians. As a result, Quakers were persecuted in both England and America.
One proprietor of the New Jersey colony was a Quaker named William Penn. Penn wished to found a larger colony under his own control that would provide a safe home for Quakers. In 1681 King Charles II agreed to grant Penn a charter to begin a colony west of New Jersey.
Penn's colony, known as Pennsylvania, grew rapidly. Penn limited his own power and established an elected assembly. He also promised religious freedom to all Christians. His work made Pennsylvania an important example of representative self-government— a government that reflects its citizens' will— in the colonies.
Penn named the capital of his colony Philadelphia, which means "the city of brotherly love." In 1682 the Duke of York sold Penn a region to the south of Pennsylvania. This area, called Delaware, remained part of Pennsylvania until 1776.

Economy of the
Middle Colonies
The middle colonies combined characteristics of the New England and southern colonies. With a good climate and rich land, farmers there could grow large amounts of staple crops—crops that are always needed. These crops included wheat, barley, and oats. Farmers also raised livestock. However, their use of only one plant in each field made the fields vulnerable to erosion and insects.
Slaves were somewhat more important to the middle colonies than they were to New England. They worked in cities as skilled laborers, such as blacksmiths and carpenters. Other slaves worked on farms, onboard ships, and in the growing shipbuilding industry. However, indentured servants largely filled the middle colonies' growing labor needs. Between 1700 and 1775 about 135,000 indentured servants came to the middle colonies. About half of them moved to Pennsylvania. By 1760 Philadelphia had become the largest British colonial city. Other cities in the middle colonies, such as New York City, also grew quickly.
Trade was important to the economy of the middle colonies. Merchants in Philadelphia and New York City exported colonial goods to markets in Britain and the West Indies. These products included wheat from New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.
Throughout the colonies, women made important contributions to the economy. They ran farms and businesses such as clothing and grocery stores, bakeries, and drugstores. Some women also practiced medicine and worked as nurses and midwives. However, colonial laws and customs limited women's economic opportunities.
Most colonial women worked primarily in the home. Married women managed households and raised children. Sometimes they earned money for their families by selling products like butter or washing clothes.

In 1763 Great Britain and France signed the Treaty of Paris, giving Britain control over all lands east of the Mississippi River. With the stroke of a pen, the colonies increased enormously in size. The westward expansion of the English colonies—soon to be the United States—had begun.

F BUILDING BACKGROUND
When they moved to America, the Eng-I lish colonists brought their ideas about government. They expected to j I have the same rights as citizens in England. However, many officials f in England wanted tight control over the colonies. As a result, some j colonists, like this family, were unhappy with the policies of colonial I governments.	i
Colonial Governments
The English colonies in North America all had their own governments. Each government was given power by a charter. The English monarch had ultimate authority over all of the colonies. A group of royal advisers called the Privy Council set English colonial policies.
Colonial Governors and Legislatures
Each colony had a governor who served as head of the government. Most governors were assisted by an advisory council. In royal colonies the English king or queen selected the governor and the council members. In proprietary colonies, the proprietors chose all of these officials. In a few colonies, such as Connecticut, the people elected the governor.
In some colonies the people also elected representatives to help make laws and set policy. These officials served on assemblies. Each colonial assembly passed laws that had to be approved first by the advisory council and then by the governor.
Established in 1619, Virginia's assembly was the first colonial legislature in North America. At first it met as a single body, but it was later split into two houses. The first house was known as the Council of State. The governor's advisory council and the London Company selected its members. The House of Burgesses was the assembly's second house. The members were elected by colonists. It was the first democratically elected body in the English colonies.
In New England the center of politics was the town meeting. In town meetings people talked about and decided on issues of local interest, such as paying for schools.
In the southern colonies, people typically lived farther away from one another. Therefore, many decisions were made at the county level. The middle colonies used both county meetings and town meetings to make laws.
Political Change in England
In 1685 James II became king of England. He was determined to take more control over the English government, both in England and in the colonies. Because the colonies were so distant from the seats of government, they had developed many of their own systems of governing and felt a sense of separation from the British government.
James believed that the colonies were too independent. In 1686 he united the northern colonies under one government called the Dominion of New England. James named Sir Edmund Andros royal governor of the Dominion. The colonists disliked Andros because he used his authority to limit the powers of town meetings.
English Bill of Rights
Parliament replaced the unpopular King James and passed the English Bill of Rights in 1689. This act reduced the powers of the English monarch. At the same time, Parliament gained power. As time went on, the colonists valued their own right to elect

Colonial Courts
Colonial courts made up another important part of colonial governments. Whenever possible, colonists used the courts to control local affairs. In general, the courts reflected the beliefs of their local communities. For example, many laws in Massachusetts enforced the Puritans' religious beliefs. Laws based on the Bible set the standard for the community's conduct.
Sometimes colonial courts also protected individual freedoms. For example, in 1733 officials arrested John Peter Zenger for printing a statement that damaged the reputation of the governor of New York. Andrew Hamilton, Zenger's attorney, argued that Zenger could publish whatever he wished as long as it was true. Jury members believed that colonists had a right to voice their ideas openly and found him not guilty.

Analyzing Information
Why were colonial assemblies and colonial courts created, and what did they do?
English Trade Laws
One of England's main reasons for founding and controlling its American colonies was to earn money from trade. In the late 1600s England, like most western European nations, practiced mercantilism, a system of creating and maintaining wealth through carefully controlled trade. A country gained wealth if it had fewer imports—goods bought from other countries—than exports—goods sold to other countries.
To support this system of mercantilism, between 1650 and 1696 Parliament passed a series of Navigation Acts limiting colonial trade. For example, the Navigation Act of 1660 forbade colonists from trading specific items such as sugar and cotton with any country other than England. The act also required colonists to use English ships to transport goods. Parliament later passed
Triangular Trade
other acts that required all trade goods to pass through English ports, where duties, or import taxes, were added to the items.
England claimed that the Navigation Acts were good for the colonies. After all, the colonies had a steady market in England for their goods. But not all colonists agreed. Many colonists wanted more freedom to buy or sell goods wherever they could get the best price. Local demand for colonial goods was small compared to foreign demand.
Despite colonial complaints, the trade restrictions continued into the 1700s. Some traders turned to smuggling, or illegal trading. They often smuggled sugar, molasses, and rum into the colonies from non-English islands in the Caribbean. Parliament responded with the Molasses Act of 1733, which placed duties on these items. British officials, however, rarely carried out this law.
By the early 1700s English merchants were trading around the world. Most American merchants traded directly with Great Britain or the West Indies. By importing and exporting goods such as sugar and tobacco, some American merchants became wealthy.
Triangular Trade
Trade between the American colonies and Great Britain was not direct. Rather, it generally took the form of triangular trade—a system in which goods and slaves were traded among the Americas, Britain, and Africa. There were several routes of the triangular trade. In one route colonists exchanged goods like beef and flour with plantation owners in the West Indies for sugar, some of which they shipped to Britain. The sugar was then exchanged for manufactured products to be sold in the colonies. Colonial merchants traveled great distances to find the best markets.

Olaudah Equiano
1745-1797
Olaudah Equiano claimed to have been born in Africa in present-day Nigeria.
His autobiography told the story of his enslavement. According to his autobiography, Equiano survived the Middle Passage, traveling in a slave ship across the Atlantic. After arriving in the colonies, a Virginia planter purchased him and again sold him to a British naval officer. While working as a sailor, Equiano eventually earned enough money to purchase his own freedom in 1766. Equiano later settled in England and devoted himself to ending slavery.

The Great Awakening
George Whitefield gives a powerful sermon during the Great Awakening. Ministers like Whitefield emphasized personal religious experiences over official church rules. They also allowed ordinary church members—whatever their race, class, or gender—to play a role in services. The value placed on individuals of all types during the Great Awakening helped shape American political ideas about who should have a say in government.
How do you think religious freedom led to
Middle Passage
One version of the triangular trade began with traders exchanging rum for slaves on the West African coast. The traders then sold the enslaved Africans in the West Indies for molasses or brought them to sell in the mainland American colonies.
The slave trade brought millions of Africans across the Atlantic Ocean in a voyage called the Middle Passage. This was a terrifying and deadly journey that could last as long as three months.
Enslaved Africans lived in a space not even three feet high. Slave traders fit as many slaves as possible on board so they could earn greater profits. Thousands of captives died on slave ships during the Middle Passage. In many cases, they died from diseases such as smallpox. As farmers began to use fewer indentured servants, slaves became even more valuable.

What factors caused the slave trade to grow? How did this affect conditions on the Middle Passage?
Great Awakening and Enlightenment
In the early 1700s revolutions in both religious and nonreligious thought transformed
the Western world. These European movements affected life in the American colonies.
Great Awakening
Religious leaders wanted to spread religious feeling throughout the growing colonial population. In the late 1730s ministers began holding revivals, emotional gatherings where people came together to hear sermons.
Many American colonists experienced "a great awakening" in their religious lives. This Great Awakening—a religious movement that swept through the colonies in the 1730s and 1740s—changed colonial religion. It also affected social and political life. Jonathan Edwards of Massachusetts was one of the most important leaders of the Great Awakening. His dramatic sermons told sinners to seek forgiveness for their sins or face punishment in Hell forever.
The Great Awakening drew people of different regions, classes, and races. Women, members of minority groups, and poor people often took part in services. Ministers from different colonies met and shared ideas with one another. This represented one of the few exchanges between colonies.
The Great Awakening promoted ideas that may also have affected colonial politics. Sermons about the spiritual equality of all people led some colonists to begin
M CHAPTER 3
demanding more political equality. Revivals became popular places to talk about political and social issues. People from those colonies with less political freedom were thus introduced to more democratic systems used in other colonies. Enlightenment
During the 1600s European scientists began to better understand the basic laws that govern nature. Their new ideas about the universe began the Scientific Revolution. The revolution changed how people thought of the world. In 1675, for example, Anton van Leeuwenhoek became the first to observe microorganisms through a microscope.
Many colonists were also influenced by the Enlightenment. This movement, which took place during the 1700s, spread the idea that reason and logic could improve society. Enlightenment thinkers also formed ideas about how government should work. They based many of their ideas on the concept of using reason to best achieve virtue and social order.
Some Enlightenment thinkers believed that there was a social contract between government and citizens. Philosophers such as John Locke thought that people had natural rights such as equality and liberty. One judge, William Blackstone, published a book describing the system of English law. His ideas about natural laws and rights became influential in colonial legal education. Ideas of the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment eventually influenced colonial leaders' desire for self-government.
Summarizing How did new
ideas influence colonial society?
French and Indian War
By the 1670s tensions had arisen between New England colonists and the Wampa-noag. Metacomet, a Wampanoag leader also known as King Philip, opposed the colo-

nists' efforts to take his people's lands. In 1675 these tensions finally erupted in a conflict known as King Philip's War. The colonial militia—civilians serving as soldiers— fought American Indian warriors. Both sides attacked each other's settlements, killing men, women, and children. The fighting finally ended in 1676, but only after about 600 colonists and some 3,000 Indians had been killed, including Metacomet.
Native American Allies
Some Native Americans allied with the colonists to fight against Metacomet and his forces. These Indians had developed trade relations with colonists. They wanted tools, weapons, and other goods that Europeans could provide. In exchange, the colonists wanted furs, which they sold for large profits in Europe. As a result, each side came to depend upon the other.
French colonists traded and allied with the Algonquian and Huron. English colonists traded and allied with the Iroquois League. This powerful group united American Indians from six different groups. Many American Indians trusted the French more than they did the English. The smaller French settlements were less threatening than the rapidly growing English colonies. No matter who their allies were, many Indian leaders took care to protect their people's independence. As one leader said:
We are born free. We neither depend upon [the governor of New France] nor [the governor of New York]. We may go where we please... and buy and sell what we please/'
—Garangula, quoted in The World Turned Upside Down, edited by Colin G. Calloway
War Erupts
Until the mid-1700s, France and Great Britain struggled for control of territory in North America. British colonists wanted to settle in the Ohio River valley, where they could

North American Empires before and after the Treaty of Paris
take advantage of the fur trade. The French believed this settlement would hurt their profits. A standoff developed in the Ohio Valley where the French had built three forts. Fighting erupted in 1753 as the British military moved to take over the valley.
When a young Virginian named George Washington arrived with more soldiers, he found the area under French control. Washington and his troops built a small, simple fort that he named Fort Necessity. After his troops suffered many casualties—captured, injured, or killed soldiers—Washington finally surrendered. His defeat in 1754 was the start of the French and Indian War. Leaders from the colonies met to discuss defense. The convention produced a plan for uniting the colonies called the Albany Plan. Meanwhile, in 1756 fighting began in Europe, starting what became known as the Seven Years' War.
Treaty of Paris
The turning point of the war came in 1759. That year British general James Wolfe captured Quebec, gaining the advantage in the war. However, the war dragged on for four more years. Finally, in 1763 Britain and France signed the Treaty of Paris, officially ending the war.
The terms of the treaty gave Canada to Britain. Britain also gained all French lands east of the Mississippi River except the city of New Orleans and two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. From Spain, which had allied with France in 1762, Britain received Florida. In an earlier treaty, Spain had received Louisiana, the land that France had claimed west of the Mississippi River. The Treaty of Paris changed the balance of power in North America. Soon British settlers began moving west to settle new lands.
Western Frontier
Most colonial settlements were located along the Atlantic coast. Colonial settlers, or pioneers, slowly moved into the Virgin-
ia and Carolina backcountry and the Ohio River valley.
Indian leaders like Chief Pontiac opposed British settlement of this new land. Pontiac's Rebellion began in May 1763 when his forces attacked British forts on the frontier. Within one month, they had destroyed or captured seven forts. Pontiac then led an attack on Fort Detroit. The British held out for months.
British leaders feared that more fighting would take place on the frontier if colonists kept moving onto American Indian lands. To avoid more conflict, King George III issued the Proclamation of 1763. This law banned British settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. The law also ordered settlers to leave the upper Ohio River valley. These limitations angered many colonists and some began to question British policies.

Comparing Governments Economic differences would have long-lasting effects on the politics of the regions. Northern merchants and tradespeople began to favor policies that made imported goods more expensive, because this increased demand for the goods they produced themselves. Agricultural colonies, on the other hand, preferred policies that kept the prices of imported goods down, because this kept prices for all goods down. Because agricultural colonies did not produce many goods themselves, they had to buy most of their household goods. All colonies formed both local and county governments in order to provide services such as constables and fence inspectors. Both levels of government, however, had little power because of their limited ability to tax residents.

Comparing Economies Economic activities were centered on trade in New England, agriculture based on slavery in the South, and a mix of farming and trade in the Middle Colonies. These differences were a result of the contrast among the natural resources in each area. The South had rich soil and warm temperatures, while New England had more rocky soil and a colder climate. Northern colonies also had access to rich fishing grounds and to timber for shipbuilding. Because the merchants and tradespeople in the North needed to work near each other in order for their businesses to thrive, the largest cities were in the North.
In every colony the majority of people focused on some type of business venture to earn a profit. However, some colonists, especially in the rural areas, developed barter economies.

Similarities Although there were many differences among the colonies, there were also many similarities. Almost none of the colonists who arrived from England were members of the English aristocracy. The colonies were seen as a place where anyone could become prosperous. In addition, each colony had small communities of non-English colonists. German, Irish, Scots-Irish, Welsh, and Dutch communities existed throughout the colonies. Each colony at one time or another bordered Native American land. As settlers moved west, they experienced conflict with the people living there. This was one of the situations that drew colonies together.

Great Britain Raises Taxes
Great Britain had won the French and Indian War, but Parliament still had to pay for it. The British continued to keep a standing, or permanent, army in North America to protect the colonists against Indian attacks. To help pay for this army, Prime Minister George Grenville asked Parliament to tax the colonists. In 1764 Parliament passed the Sugar Act, which set duties on molasses and sugar imported by colonists. This was the first act passed specifically to raise money in the colonies.
British officials also tried harder to arrest smugglers. Colonial merchants were required to list all the trade goods they carried aboard their ships. These lists had to be approved before ships could leave colonial ports. This made it difficult for traders to avoid paying duties. The British navy also began to stop and search ships for smuggled goods.
'8 CHAPTER 3
Parliament also changed the colonies' legal system by giving greater powers to the vice-admiralty courts. These courts had no juries, and the judges treated suspected smugglers as guilty until proven innocent. In regular British courts, accused persons were treated as innocent until proven guilty.
Taxation without Representation
Parliament's actions upset many colonists who had grown used to being independent. The rising merchant class thought the taxes were unfair and hurt business. Many believed that Great Britain had no right to tax the colonies at all without popular consent.
James Otis argued that the power of the Crown and Parliament was limited. Otis said they could not "take from any man any part of his property, without his consent in person or by representation." Colonial assemblies had little influence on Parliament's decisions. In addition, the colonists had no
direct representatives in Parliament. The colonists were subjects of the Crown instead of citizens of England.
At a Boston town meeting in May 1764, local leader Samuel Adams agreed with Otis. He believed that Parliament could not tax the colonists without their permission. The ideas of Otis and Adams were summed up in the slogan "No Taxation without Representation," which spread throughout the colonies.
Adams helped found the Committees of Correspondence.Each committee got in touch with other towns and colonies. Its members shared ideas and information about the new British laws and ways to challenge them.
A popular method of protest was the boycott, in which people refused to buy British goods. The first colonial boycott started in New York in 1765. It soon spread to other colonies. Colonists hoped that their efforts would hurt the British economy and might convince Parliament to end the new taxes.
THE ENGLISH COLONIES 99
Stamp Act
The British government continued to search for new ways to tax the American colonies, further angering many colonists. For example, Prime Minister Grenville proposed the Stamp Act of 1765. This act required colonists to pay for an official stamp, or seal, when they bought paper items. The tax had to be paid on legal documents, licenses, newspapers, pamphlets, and even playing cards. Colonists who refused to buy stamps could be fined or sent to jail.
Grenville did not expect this tax to spark protest. After all, in Britain people already paid similar taxes. But colonists saw it differently. The Stamp Act was Parliament's first attempt to raise money by taxing the colonists directly, rather than by taxing imported goods.
Protests against the Stamp Act began almost immediately. Colonists formed a secret society called the Sons of Liberty. Samuel Adams helped organize the group in Boston. This group sometimes used violence to frighten tax collectors. Many colonial courts shut down because people refused to buy the stamps required for legal documents. Businesses openly ignored the law by refusing to buy stamps.
In May 1765 a Virginia lawyer named Patrick Henry presented a series of resolutions to the Virginia House of Burgesses. These resolutions stated that the Stamp Act violated colonists' rights. In addition to taxation without representation, the Stamp Act denied the accused a trial by jury. Henry's speech in support of the resolutions convinced the assembly to support some of his ideas.
Repealing the Stamp Act
In Boston the members of the Massachusetts legislature called for a Stamp Act Congress. In October 1765, delegates from nine colonies met in New York. They issued a declaration that the Stamp Act was a violation of their rights and liberties.
Pressure on Parliament to repeal, or do away with, the Stamp Act grew quickly. A group of London merchants complained that their trade suffered from the colonial boycott. Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766.
Members of Parliament were upset that colonists had challenged their authority. Thus, Parliament issued the Declaratory Act, which stated that Parliament had the power to make laws for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever." The Declaratory Act further worried the colonists. The act stripped away much of their independence.
Townshend Acts
In June 1767 Parliament passed the Townshend Acts. These acts placed duties on glass, lead, paints, paper, and tea. To enforce the Townshend Acts, British officials used writs of assistance. These allowed tax collectors to search for smuggled goods. Colonists hated the new laws because they took power away from colonial governments.
The colonists responded to the Townshend Acts by once again boycotting many British goods. Women calling themselves the Daughters of Liberty supported the boycott. In February 1768 Samuel Adams wrote a letter arguing that the laws violated the legal rights of the colonists. The Massachusetts legislature sent the letter to other colonies' legislatures, who voted to join the protest.
At the same time, tax collectors in Massachusetts seized the ship Liberty on suspicion of smuggling. This action angered the ship's owner and the Sons of Liberty. They attacked the houses of customs officials in protest. In response, the governor broke up the Massachusetts legislature. He also asked troops to restore order. British soldiers arrived in Boston in October 1768.

Why do you think the people described were not intimidated by the soldiers?
Boston Massacre
Many Bostonians saw the presence of British troops as a threat by the British government against its critics in Massachusetts. Some colonists agreed with Samuel Adams, who said, "I look upon [British soldiers] as foreign enemies." The soldiers knew that they were not welcome. Both sides resented each other, and name-calling, arguments, and fights between Bostonians and the soldiers were common.
The tension exploded on March 5, 1770. A lone British soldier standing guard had an argument with a colonist and struck him. A crowd gathered around the soldier, throwing snowballs and shouting insults. Soon a small number of troops arrived. The crowd grew louder and angrier by the moment. Some yelled, "Come on you rascals... Fire if you dare!" Suddenly, the soldiers fired into the crowd, instantly killing three men, including sailor Crispus Attucks. "Half Indian, half negro, and altogether rowdy," as he was called, Attucks is the best-remembered casualty of the incident. Two others died within a few days.
Samuel Adams and other protesters quickly spread the story of the shootings. They used it as propaganda—a story giving only one side in an argument—against the British. Colonists called the shootings the Boston Massacre. Paul Revere created an elaborate color print titled "The Bloody Massacre perpetrated in King Street" (above).
The soldiers and their officer, Thomas Preston, were charged with murder. Two Boston lawyers, Josiah Quincy and John Adams—Samuel Adams's cousin—agreed to defend the soldiers. They argued that the troops had acted in self-defense. The Boston jury agreed, finding Preston and six soldiers not guilty. Two soldiers were convicted of killing people in the crowd by accident. These men were branded on the hand and released. The trial helped calm people down, but many were still angry at the British.

The Boston Tea Party
To reduce tensions in the colonies, Parliament repealed almost all of the Townshend Acts. However, it kept the tax on tea. British officials knew that the colonial demand for tea was high despite the boycott. But colonial merchants were smuggling most of this imported tea and paying no duty on it.
The British East India Company offered Parliament a solution. The company had huge amounts of tea but was not allowed to sell it directly to the colonists. If the company could sell directly to the colonists, it could charge low prices and still make money. Cheaper tea might encourage colonists to stop smuggling. Less smuggling would result in more tax money.
Parliament agreed and passed the Tea Act in 1773, which allowed the British East India Company to sell tea directly to the colonists. Many colonial merchants and smugglers feared that the British East India Company's cheap tea would put them out of business.
Three ships loaded with tea from the British East India Company arrived in Boston Harbor in 1773. Members of the Sons of Liberty demanded that the ships leave. But the governor of Massachusetts would not let the ships leave without paying the duty. Unsure of what to do, the captains waited in the harbor.
On the night of December 16, 1773, colonists disguised as Indians sneaked onto the three tea-filled ships and dumped over 340 tea chests into Boston Harbor. This event became known as the Boston Tea Party. Soon the streets echoed with shouts of "Boston harbour is a teapot tonight!" It was an early example of what later became known as an act of "civil disobedience." The protest quickly increased the tensions between Britain and the colonies.

Interpreting Time Lines
Define the Skill
Knowing the sequence, or order, in which historical events took place is important to understanding these events. Time lines visually display the sequence of events during a particular period of time. They also let you easily see time spans between events, such as how long after one event a related event took place—and what events occurred in between. Sequencing the life spans and major accomplishments of people helps you see when people's lifespans overlapped, who might have been influenced by whom, and what ideas and events happened around the same time. In addition, comparing time lines for different places makes relationships between distant events easier to identify and understand.
Learn the Skill
Follow these guidelines to read, interpret, and compare time lines.
1.	Determine each time line's framework. Note the years it covers and the periods of time into which it is divided.
2.	Study the order of events on each time line. Note the length of time between events. Compare what was taking place on different time lines around the same time period.
3.	Look for relationships between events. Pay particular attention to how an event on one time line might relate to an event on another.
[ Practice the Skill
Interpret the time lines below to answer the following questions.
1.	What is each time line's framework?
2.	How long was England without a king?
3.	What event in England allowed the colonists to get rid of the Dominion of New England in 1689?

Main Ideas in Social Studies
FOCUS
On Reading When you are reading, it is not always necessary to remember every tiny detail of the text. Instead, what you want to remember are the main ideas, the most important concepts around which the text is based. Identifying Main Ideas Most paragraphs in history books include main ideas. Sometimes the main idea is stated clearly in a single sentence. At other times, the main idea is suggested, not stated. However, that idea still shapes the paragraph's content and the meaning of all of the facts and details in it.
Topic: The paragraph is about the pamphlet Common Sense by Thomas Paine.
News of the work spread throughout the colonies, eventually sell-} ing some 500,000 copies. Paine reached a wide audience by writing as a common person speaking to common people. Common Sense changed the way many colonists viewed their king. (p. 118)
Facts and Details:
•	Many people from different colonies read the pamphlet.
•	Common Sense eventually sold 500,000 copies.
•	Thomas Paine's writing style was easy for the common people to read.

I BUILDING BACKGROUND
Taxes and harsh new laws led some , | colonists to protest againstthe British. In some places, the protests I turned violent. The British government refused to listen, ignoring the I colonists'demands for more rights. That setthe stage for war.
First Continental Congress
To many colonists the closing of Boston Harbor was the final insult in a long list of abuses. In response to the mounting crisis, all the colonies except Georgia sent representatives to a meeting in October 1774. This meeting, known as the First Continental Congress, was a gathering of colonial leaders who were deeply troubled about the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies in America. At Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia, the leaders remained locked in weeks of intense debate. Patrick Henry and others believed that violence was unavoidable. On the other hand, delegates from Pennsylvania and New York had strict orders to seek peace.
Wisely, the delegates compromised. They encouraged colonists to continue boycotting British goods but told colonial militias to prepare for war. Meanwhile, they drafted the Declaration of Rights, a list of 10 resolutions to be presented to King George III. Included was the colonists' right to "life, liberty, and property."
The First Continental Congress did not seek a separation from Britain. Its goal was to state the colonists' concerns and ask the king to correct the problems. But before they left Philadelphia, the delegates agreed to meet in 1775 if the king refused their petition.
Patrick Henry returned from the Congress and reported to his fellow Virginians. To encourage them to support the Patriot cause,
CHAPTER 4
Henry voiced these famous words:
’They tell us, Sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when will we be stronger? Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace—but there is no peace. I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death/^

—Patrick Henry, quoted in Eyewitnesses and Others
In time many colonists came to agree with Henry. They became known as Patriots—colonists who chose to fight for independence from Great Britain.

'Shot Heard 'round the World"
The Continental Congress planned to meet again in 1775. Before it could, the situation in the colonies had changed— for the worse.
The Ride of Paul Revere
British military leaders in the colonies grew uneasy when local militias seemed to be preparing for action. The governor of Massachusetts, Thomas Gage, learned that a stockpile of weapons was stored in Concord, about 20 miles from Boston. In April 1775 he decided to seize the supplies.

Academic
Vocabulary

response
Gage thought he had kept his plan a secret. However, Boston was full of spies for the Patriot cause. They noticed the British were preparing for action and quickly informed the Patriots. Unsure of how the British would strike, Sons of Liberty member Paul Revere enlisted the aid of Robert Newman. Newman was to climb into the steeple of the Old North Church and watch for British soldiers. If they advanced across land, Newman would display one lantern from the steeple. If they rowed across the Charles River, Newman would display two lanterns.
When Revere and fellow Patriot William Dawes saw two lights shine, they set off on horseback. Using two different routes out of Boston, they sounded the alert. As the riders advanced, drums and church bells called out the local militia, or minutemen—who got their name because they were ready to fight at a minute's notice. Another rider, a free African American named Wentworth Cheswell, rode north to New Hampshire and Maine to gather reinforcements.
Battles at Lexington and Concord
At dawn on April 19, the British troops arrived at the town of Lexington, near Concord and about 15 miles from Boston, where 70 armed minutemen waited. Patriot captain John Parker yelled to his troops, "Don't fire unless fired upon." Suddenly a shot rang out. To this day, no one knows who fired this "shot heard 'round the world."
The battle at Lexington ended in minutes with only a few volleys fired. When the smoke cleared, 8 of the badly outnumbered minutemen lay dead, and 10 were wounded. The British, with only one soldier wounded, marched on to Concord.
Although Revere had been arrested, the citizens of Concord were warned by another rider, Samuel Prescott. Most of the weapons in Concord had already been hidden, but the few that were left were now concealed. Some of the British troops, frustrated because the stockpile had disappeared, set fire to a
few buildings. In reaction the minutemen charged forward.
For the skilled colonial marksmen of Concord, the British soldiers made an easy target. They were wearing the British military uniform with its bright red jacket. For some time the colonists had called the British soldiers Redcoats because of these jackets. The British were forced to retreat to Boston, suffering many casualties along the way.
Reading Check
Drawing Inferences Why did the Patriots need several riders? Why did they take different routes?
Second Continental
Congress
King George III had refused to address the concerns listed in the Declaration of Rights. In May 1775, delegates from 12 colonies met again in Philadelphia for the Second Continental Congress. This second group of delegates from the colonies was still far from unified, but represented the first attempt at a Republican government in the colonies.
Some of the delegates called for a war, others for peace. Once again they compromised. Although the Congress did not openly revolt, delegates showed their growing dissatisfaction. They sent word to colonial authorities asking for new state constitutions. States set up conventions to write them. They also authorized the Massachusetts militia to become the Continental Army. This force would soon include soldiers from all colonies and would carry out the fight against Britain. Congress named a Virginian, George Washington, to command the army.
As Washington prepared for war, the Congress pursued peace. On July 5 the delegates signed the Olive Branch Petition as a final attempt to restore harmony. King George refused to read it. Instead, he looked for new ways to punish the colonies.

Summarizing What did the Second Continental Congress accomplish?
Early Battles
While the Congress discussed peace, the Massachusetts militia began to fight. Boston was a key city in the early days of the war. Both Patriots and the British fought to hold it.
Bunker Hill
Desperate for supplies, leaders in Boston sent Benedict Arnold and a force of 400 men to New York State. Their objective was to attack the British at Fort Ticonderoga. In May 1775, Arnold captured the fort and its large supply of weapons.
Meanwhile, the poorly supplied Patriots kept the British pinned down inside Boston. Although British leaders were trying to form a battle plan, they awoke on June 17 to a stunning sight. The colonial forces
had quietly dug in at Breed's Hill, a point overlooking north Boston. The Redcoats would have to cross Boston Harbor and fight their way uphill.
As the British force of 2,400 advanced, 1,600 militia members waited. Low on gunpowder, the commander ordered his troops not to fire "until you see the whites of their eyes." As they climbed the exposed hillside with their heavy packs, the British soldiers were cut down. Twice they retreated. Stepping over the dead and wounded, they returned for a third try. The colonists were now out of ammunition, and eventually they had to retreat.
This famous conflict is now known as the Battle of Bunker Hill, although it was actually launched from Breed's Hill. While the Patriots lost, they proved they could take on the Redcoats. For the British, the battle was a tragic victory. To win, they had sacrificed about double the number of Patriot soldiers.
Dorchester Heights
Shortly after the Battle of Bunker Hill, General Washington arrived in Boston to command the Continental Army. Washington knew that he would need heavier guns to drive the British out of Boston, and he knew where to get them—Fort Ticonderoga. Colonel Henry Knox was assigned to transport the captured cannons from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston. He successfully brought the heavy guns over 300 miles of rough terrain in the middle of winter. When Knox delivered the cannons, Washington was ready to regain control of Boston.
On March 4, 1776, Washington moved his army to Dorchester Heights, an area that overlooked Boston from the south. He stationed the cannons and his troops on Nook's Hill overlooking British general William Howe's position. When Howe awoke the next
morning and saw the Patriots' well-positioned artillery, he knew he would have to retreat. "The Rebels have done more in one night than my whole army could do in months," Howe declared. On March 7 Howe retreated from Boston to Canada. The birthplace of the rebellion was now in Patriot hands.

If YOU were there...
You live on a farm in New York in 1776. The conflicts with the British have torn your family apart. Your father is loyal to King George and wants to remain British. But your mother is a fierce Patriot, and your brother wants to join the Continental Army. Your father and others who feel the same way are moving to British-held Canada. Now you must decide what you will do.
Would you go to Canada or support the Patriots?
BUILDING BACKGROUND
The outbreak of violence at Lexington, Concord, and Boston took some colonists by surprise. Many, like the father above, opposed independence from Britain. Those who supported freedom began to promote their cause in many ways. Paine's Common Sense
"[There] is something very absurd in supporting a continent to be perpetually [forever] governed by an island." This plainspoken argument against British rule over America appeared in Common Sense, a 47-page pamphlet that was distributed in Philadelphia in January 1776. Common Sense was published anonymously—that is, without the author's name. The author, Thomas Paine, argued that citizens, not kings and queens, should make laws. At a time when monarchs ruled much of the world, this was a bold idea.
News of the work spread throughout the colonies, eventually selling some 500,000 copies. Paine reached a wide audience by writing as a common person speaking to common people. Common Sense changed the way many colonists viewed their king. It made a strong case for economic freedom and for the right to military self-defense. It cried out against tyranny—that is, the abuse of government power. Thomas Paine's words rang out in his time, and they have echoed throughout American history.
Supporting a Point of View Would you have agreed

CHAPTER 4
Independence Is Declared
Many colonial leaders agreed with Paine. In June 1776 the Second Continental Congress began writing a document declaring independence. A committee also created a seal for the new country with the Latin motto "Epluribus unum” or "out of many, one." This motto recognized the new union of states.
A
New Philosophy of Government The Declaration of Independence formally announced the colonies' break from Great Britain. In doing so, it expressed three main ideas. First, Thomas Jefferson, the document's main author, argued that all people possess unalienable rights, or rights that are a natural part of being bom and cannot be taken away. These include the rights of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Next, Jefferson listed the complaints of the colonists. He asserted that King George III had violated the colonists' rights by taxing them without their consent. Jefferson
accused the king of passing unfair laws and interfering with colonial governments. He also believed that stationing a large British army within the colonies was a burden.
Third, Jefferson stated that the colonies had the right to break from Britain. Influenced by the Enlightenment ideal of the social contract, he maintained that governments and rulers must protect the rights of citizens. In exchange, the people agree to be governed. Jefferson argued that King George III had broken the social contract.
On July 4,1776, the Continental Congress approved the Declaration of Independence. This act broke all ties to the British crown. The United States of America was bom.
Choosing Sides
The signing of the Declaration made the rebellion a full-scale revolt against Britain. Those who supported it would be considered traitors. Colonists who chose to side with the British were known as Loyalists—often called Tories.
THE IMPACT
TODAY
The Continental Congress voted for independence on July 2. However, because the Declaration was not approved until July 4, the fourth is celebrated today as Independence Day.

When Ben Franklin's son William was a child, he helped his father experiment with lightning. But by the time William had grown and the Revolution started, the two men viewed the conflict differently. They exchanged letters on the subject.

of Independence HISTORY
Historians estimate that 40 to 45 percent of Americans were Patriots, while 20 to 30 percent were Loyalists. The rest were neutral.
Because of persecution by Patriots, more than 50,000 Loyalists fled the colonies during the Revolution. Most went to Canada, where Britain allowed them more self-rule after the Revolution. In doing so, they abandoned their homes and property. Divided allegiances tore apart families and friendships—even Benjamin Franklin became separated from his Loyalist son William.
Native Americans were at first encouraged by both sides to remain neutral. By the summer of 1776, however, both Patriots and the British were aggressively recruiting Indian fighters. Most sided with the British. In northern New York, four of the six Iroquois nations fought for the British. However, the Oneida and Tuscarora helped the Patriots, even delivering food to the soldiers at Valley Forge.

would Native Americans have lost out no matter who won the war?
READING CHECK
Unfinished Business
Today we recognize that the Declaration of Independence excluded many colonists. While it declared that "all men are created equal," the document failed to mention women, enslaved Africans, or Native Americans. The rights of these minorities would be subject to the rule of the majority.
Women
Although many women were Patriots, the Declaration did not address their rights. At least one delegate's wife, Abigail Adams, tried to influence her husband, John, to include women's rights in the Declaration. In a failed effort, she expressed her concerns:
^Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands... If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we are and will not hold ourselves bound by Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation/^
—Abigail Adams, quoted in Notable American Women
10 CHAPTER 4
African and Native Americans
The Declaration did not recognize the rights of enslaved Africans, either. The authors had compared life under British rule to living as an enslaved people. The obvious question arose: Why did any form of slavery exist in a land that valued personal freedom? Even Thomas Jefferson, the main author of the Declaration, was a slaveholder.
In July 1776 slavery was legal in all the colonies. By the 1780s the New England colonies were taking steps to end slavery. Even so, the conflict over slavery continued long after the Revolutionary War.
The Declaration of Independence also did not address the rights of Native Americans to life, liberty, or property. Despite the Proclamation of 1763, American colonists had been quietly settling on lands that belonged to Native Americans. This tendency to disregard the rights of Native Americans would develop into a pattern after the colonists won their independence from Great Britain.

The Declaration
of Independence
In Congress, July 4,1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.—Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislature.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighboring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislature, and declaring themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.
Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

BUILDING BACKGROUND
Many colonists struggled for the Patriot cause. Men, women, and children all made important contributions. They fought, kept farms and shops running, and provided food and supplies. In spite of their efforts, winning the war was a great challenge. Supporting the War Effort
George Washington's chief task as the Continental Army's commander in chief was to raise troops. During the war, more than 230,000 soldiers served in the Continental Army, and another 145,000 enlisted in local militias. The typical soldier was young, often under the legal age of 16, and had little money or property. The army offered low pay, harsh conditions, and a big chance of becoming a casualty. Yet the Patriots knew they were fighting for their homes and their freedom.
Finding and keeping dedicated soldiers would be a constant challenge throughout the war. In time, the Continental Congress required states to supply soldiers. Men who could afford it often paid others, such as slaves or apprentices, to fight in their places.
One question facing General Washington was whether to recruit African Americans. Many white southerners opposed the idea, and at first Washington banned African Americans from serving. When the British promised freedom to any slave who fought on their side, however, thousands of African Americans joined the Redcoats.

In response, the Continental Army began allowing free African Americans to serve.
While men served as soldiers, many women ran farms and businesses. Others helped the army by raising money for supplies or making clothing. Mercy Otis Warren, a member of a prominent family of Patriots, wrote and published several plays that supported the Revolutionary cause. Women served as messengers, nurses, and spies. A Massachusetts man noted:
At every house Women and children [are] making Cartridges, running Bullets... and at the same time animating [encouraging] their Husbands and Sons to fight.
—Anonymous, quoted in Born for Liberty, by Sara M. Evans
Perhaps the best known woman to fight in the war was Mary Ludwig Hays. She was called Molly Pitcher because she brought water to the troops. When her husband was wounded in a 1778 battle, she took his place 'loading cannons. Another woman, Deborah Sampson, dressed as a man and fought in . several battles.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 127
FOCUS OH
Reaping What is the main idea of the third paragraph under "New York"? Canada
In part because the army was short on supplies, many Patriot leaders favored fighting a defensive war. Others wanted to invade British-controlled Canada and make it the "14th colony."
Patriot troops led by General Richard Montgomery captured Montreal in November 1775. The next major target was the city of Quebec. Benedict Arnold, now a general, led his troops north on a remarkable trek through the rough backcountry of Maine. He reached Quebec around the same time that Montreal fell to Montgomery. Since his first attempt to take the city failed, Arnold waited for Montgomery's troops to join his.
Taking an immense chance, the combined armies attacked during a fierce blizzard on New Year's Eve. They were quickly defeated. The Americans had suffered a crushing loss, and the Patriots' hopes of taking Canada faded.
New York
New York City became the next battleground. General Washington had moved his troops to New York, expecting the British arrival. Sure enough, in June 1776, a fleet of British ships approached New York Bay. Led by General William Howe, the British forced the Continental Army off Long Island.
Howe's 32,000 soldiers were much better equipped than Washington's 23,000 men, most of whom were militia. The Patriot general had to use all of his skills just to save his army.
In a series of battles, Howe pounded the Continental Army, forcing it to retreat farther and farther. The Redcoats captured Patriots as well as supplies. Eventually, the British pushed Washington across the Hudson River into New Jersey. Howe's revenge for his defeat at Boston was complete.
During the New York campaigns, a young Connecticut officer named Nathan Hale went behind British lines to get secret information. Seized by the British with documents hidden in the soles of his shoes, Hale was ordered to be hanged. Before his
Crossing the Delaware
George Washington and his troops crossed the partially frozen Delaware River on the night of December 25,
1776. This daring act led to a key Patriot victory at the Battle of Trenton. German American artist Emanuel Leutze created this famous painting in 1851. A version of Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
What feelings do you think Leutze wanted to inspire with this painting?

execution, he is said to have declared, "I regret that I have but one life to lose for my country."
New Jersey
In November 1776 the tattered
Continental Army was on the
run. Washington's remaining
6,000 men were tired and dis- ■■■■ couraged. The one-year contract for many of them would end on December 31. Who would re-enlist in this losing army, and who would replace the soldiers who left? Washington's army was in danger of vanishing.
Thinking the rebellion would end soon, Howe left New Jersey in the hands of soldiers from the German state of Hesse. The Hessians were mercenaries —foreign soldiers who fought not out of loyalty, but for pay.
On December 7 Washington retreated across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. Even with 2,000 fresh troops, the Patriots were near the end. "These are the times that try men's souls," wrote Thomas Paine in The American Crisis, a series of pamphlets he began publishing in late 1776.
Without a convincing victory, Washington knew he would lose his army. He decided to take a big chance and go on the offensive. The Americans would attack the Hessians at Trenton, New Jersey.
128 CHAPTER 4
On Christmas night, 1776, with a winter storm lashing about them, Washington and 2,400 soldiers silently rowed across the ice-clogged Delaware River. As morning broke, the men, short on supplies and many with no shoes, marched through the snow to reach the enemy camp.
The Hessians, having celebrated the holiday the night before, were fast asleep when the Patriots sprang upon them. The Battle of Trenton was an important Patriot victory. American soldiers took more than 900 prisoners.
British general Charles Cornwallis rushed to stop Washington as he marched northeast to Princeton. On the night of January 2,1777, the Patriots left their campfires burning, then slipped into the darkness and circled behind the British troops. In the morning, Washington attacked. A local resident witnessed it:
^The battle was plainly seen from our door... and the guns went off so quick and many together that they could not be numbered ... Almost as soon as the firing was over, our house was filled and surrounded with General Washington's men/'
—Anonymous, quoted in Voices of 1776 by Richard Wheeler
As Washington watched the Redcoats flee Princeton, he cheered, "It is a fine fox chase, my boys!" Now, new soldiers joined the chase. Others re-enlisted. The army—and the Revolution—was saved.
Saratoga
The two quick defeats stung the British. In the spring of 1777, they wanted a victory.
British general John Burgoyne decided to push through New York State and cut off New England from the other colonies. The strategy required perfect timing. According

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 129
to the plan, Burgoyne's army would invade from Canada, recapture Fort Ticonderoga, and sweep south to Albany. General Howe, in New York City, would sail up the Hudson River to meet him, strangling New England.
Indeed, Burgoyne took Ticonderoga in early July and headed toward Albany. Here, the timing went wrong for the British. Unknown to Burgoyne, Howe had left New York, sailed up the Chesapeake Bay, and captured Philadelphia. Delegates to the Continental Congress were forced to flee.
Meanwhile, Burgoyne's army bogged down in thick forests. The Patriots had chopped down large trees and dammed rivers to create obstacles. All along the route, the militia swarmed out of nowhere to attack the Redcoats. As Burgoyne neared Saratoga, New York, he found himself surrounded. On October 17,1777, he was forced to surrender his entire army to General Horatio Gates.
The Battle of Saratoga in New York was the turning point of the Revolutionary War. It was the greatest victory yet for the American forces. Morale soared. Patriot James Thacher wrote, "This event will make one of the most brilliant pages of American history."
Help from Europe
The French and Indian War had drastically changed the balance of power in North America. The French and Spanish had lost a large expanse of valuable land to the British. Both countries were delighted to see their powerful rival experiencing trouble in its American colonies.
The victory at Saratoga gave the Patriots something they had been desperately seeking: foreign help. Not surprisingly, it came from Britain's enemies, France and Spain. Even Britain's old ally, Holland, joined the fight on the side of the Patriots.

Two Remarkable Europeans
"The welfare of America is closely bound up with the welfare of mankind," declared a wealthy young Frenchman, the Marquis de Lafayette. Inspired by the ideas of the Revolution, Lafayette bought his own ship and arrived in America in 1777. He brought with him a group of well-trained soldiers and volunteered to serve in the Continental Army himself without pay.
Lafayette spoke little English and had never seen battle. However, he quickly became a skillful commander, earning the title of major general. Lafayette led 2,000 Patriots to successfully pursue 6,000 Redcoats throughout Virginia during 1780-81. He gave $200,000 of his own money to support the Revolution and wrote many letters home to powerful friends and family asking their aid for the Patriot cause.
In February 1778 another European came to serve heroically under Washington. Baron Friedrich von Steuben, an experienced military officer from Prussia, led with a combination of respect and fear. He started training the American troops, focusing on basic military drills. Soon he turned the Continental Army into a finely tuned fighting force. A historian called von Steuben's feat "perhaps the most remarkable achievement in rapid military training in the history of the world."
Help from France
Benjamin Franklin, a skilled and experienced diplomat, had gone to France to ask King Louis XVI for support. Finally, the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 persuaded the king that the colonists could win the war. Not until then did the king agree to an official alliance with the Patriots.
In May 1778 the Continental Congress ratified the treaty of support with France. The French had been helping the Patriots all along with some supplies and ammunition. After the treaty became official, the French increased the level of supplies and provided soldiers and ships. French naval support would be a key to defeating the British. French loans were converted into cash by New Yorker Haym Salomon. He also convinced many Hessians to leave the conflict. Help from Spain
Spain, also a bitter enemy of Britain, joined the war in 1779. Bernardo de Galvez, the governor of Spanish Louisiana, became a key ally to the Patriots. Galvez gathered a small army of Spanish soldiers, French Americans, colonists, and Native Americans. Together they made their way east from Louisiana. Galvez seized British posts all the way to Pensacola, Florida.

Valley Forge
A surgeon at Valley Forge, Albigence Waldo kept a journal of what he saw during the winter of 1777—78.
//The Army which has been surprisingly healthy hitherto, now begins to grow sickly from the continued fatigues they have suffered this Campaign. Yet they still show a spirit of Alacrity [cheerful readiness] and Contentment not to be expected from so young Troops. I am Sick—discontented—and out of humour. Poor food— hard lodging—Cold Weather—fatigue—Nasty Cloaths [clothes]—nasty Cookery ... smoke and Cold—hunger and filthyness—A pox on my bad luck.//

ANALYSIS
SKILL! ANALYZING PRIMARY SOURCES
Why did Waldo seem surprised by the soldiers' attitude?
Winter at Valley Forge
The entry of France and Spain into the war came at a crucial moment. The Continental Army was running very low on food and clothing. In December 1777, Washington settled his 12,000 men at Valley Forge, north of Philadelphia.
To this day, the name of Valley Forge brings to mind suffering—and courage. Yet no battles took place here. The only enemy was the brutal winter of 1777-78.
Washington's men lacked even the most basic protections against shin-deep snows. In spite of the general's repeated requests for supplies, conflicts over funding between state authorities and Congress kept supplies from coming. Washington wrote in a letter:
^To see men without clothes... without blankets to lie upon, without shoes... without a house or hut to cover them until those could be built, and submitting without a murmur, is a proof of patience and obedience which, in my opinion, can scarcely be paralleled [matched]/^
—George Washington, quoted in George Washington: A Collection
As winter roared in, soldiers quickly built crude shelters that offered little protection against the weather. Some soldiers had no shirts. Others had marched the shoes off their feet. At their guard posts, they stood on their hats to keep their feet from touching the freezing ground. One soldier wrote that getting food was the "business that usually employed us."
During that terrible winter, some 2,000 soldiers died of disease and malnutrition. Amazingly, the survivors not only stayed— they drilled and marched to the orders of Baron von Steuben, becoming better soldiers.
While the soldiers suffered through the winter at Valley Forge, the British lived a life of luxury in Philadelphia. Most of the Patriots had fled the city, leaving only Loyalists and British soldiers. Together they enjoyed the city's houses, taverns, and theaters, and held parties and balls.

War at Sea and in the West
While some Americans struggled against the British on land in the former colonies, others fought at sea and on the western frontier. Each area posed tough challenges.
War at Sea
The entry of the French navy into the war greatly aided the colonists. Many people had thought that the mighty British navy would crush the much smaller American fleet. However, the British failed to use their powerful navy effectively during the war.
In the fall of 1775, the Continental Congress made plans to build four American warships. Soon afterward the Congress formally established the marines and the Continental Navy. By adapting merchant vessels, the navy had eight fighting ships ready for combat by February 1776.
That month the tiny American navy launched a major offensive to damage the operating ability of the British fleet located off the Carolina coast. Rather than attack the fleet directly, the Patriots went after the British supply base on Nassau, in the Bahamas.
The American troops seized the main supply fort on the island. They then raised the newly created flag of the American Revolution over Nassau. After that campaign, the American navy focused on seizing British supply ships and weakening Britain's naval forces in the West Indies.
John Paul Jones
The Patriots owed much of their success on the seas to naval hero John Paul Jones. Jones had once been considered an outlaw. He was bom John Paul in Scotland and began working on ships at a young age. After accidentally killing the leader of a mutiny, he fled to America and added Jones to his name.
When the war broke out, Jones volunteered his services to the newly created navy. He quickly established himself as a brave and clever sailor. Considered a pirate by the
British, Jones captured many British supply ships. The French greatly admired Jones. When France entered the war in 1778, French leaders presented him with a small fleet of seven vessels to command. He named his flagship Bonhomme Richard ("Gentleman Richard") in honor of Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac.
One of Jones's most famous victories was the capture of the British warship Serapis on September 23, 1779. Early in the battle, the British knocked out the heaviest artillery on the Bonhomme Richard. Captain Richard Pearson of the Serapis then called out to Jones, "Has your ship struck [surrendered]?" Jones replied, "I have not yet begun to fight!" The battle continued for more than two hours. Finally the Americans wore down the British, who surrendered at 10:30 p.m.
The Continental Navy used fewer than 100 ships over the course of the war. Yet the British lost more than 200 ships to the small but effective American naval force.
War in the West
The lands west of the Appalachian Mountains were controlled by Native American nations. Both the British and the Patriots tried to enlist these groups in their cause.
George Rogers Clark volunteered to lead the western campaign. Clark had been a surveyor along the Ohio and Kentucky rivers. By the time the war broke out, he knew the lands of the Midwest well. Clark created an army from the scattered settlements in the area. One of the best-known groups was the Over Mountain Men, a band of settlers from present-day Tennessee.
Determined to weaken British support systems, Clark targeted trading villages. Following the Ohio River to the Tennessee, Clark's force set out on a 120-mile overland trek to Kaskaskia, in present-day Illinois. The village's leaders learned of the attack and surrendered. Other Patriots took Cahokia without a fight.
In February 1779 Clark launched a surprise attack on Fort Sackville near the town

of Vincennes. The attack was unexpected because the nearby Wabash River was icy and flooded. Despite overflowing riverbanks, Clark's force of 150 men endured an 18-day march through freezing water. They also managed to bring enough Patriot flags for an army of hundreds. The flags were displayed near the fort, and the skilled pioneers sustained enough musket fire to indicate a much larger army. Falling for the ruse, the commander of Fort Sackville surrendered.
In general the British were more successful at winning over the Native Americans. But Clark's many campaigns undermined British support in the West.

If YOU were there...
You have grown up on a farm in South Carolina. You know every inch of the woods and marshes around your home. You are too young to join the Continental Army, but you have heard stories about a brave group of soldiers who carry out quick raids on the British, then disappear into the woods. These fighters get no pay and live in constant danger.
Would you consider joining the fighters? Why?
1. Patriot forces faced many problems in the war in the South.
2.	The American Patriots finally defeated the British at the Battle of Yorktown.
3.	The British and the Americans officially ended the war by signing the Treaty of Paris of 1783.
Building Background As the war moved to the South, American forces encountered new problems. They suffered several major defeats. But American resistance in the southern colonies was strong. Backwoods fighters confused and frustrated the British army.
The war spread to the southern colonies, where the British were finally defeated.
I l ........	. ...■ ■...:....... '
War in the South
The war across the ocean was not going the way the British government in London had planned. The northern colonies, with their ragged, scrappy fighters, proved to be tough to tame. So the British switched strategies and set their sights on the South.
The British hoped to find support from the large Loyalist populations living in Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia. As they moved across the South, the British also planned to free enslaved Africans and enlist them as British soldiers. Under the leadership of a new commander, General Henry Clinton, the strategy paid off—for a while.
Brutal Fighting
The southern war was particularly brutal. Much more than in the North, this phase of the war pitted Americans—Patriots versus Loyalists—against one another in direct combat. The British also destroyed crops, farm animals, and other property as they marched through the South. One British officer, Banastre Tarleton, sowed fear throughout the South by refusing to take prisoners and killing soldiers who tried to surrender.

IE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 135
Georgia, the last colony to join the Revolution, was the first to fall to the British. A force of 3,500 Redcoats took Savannah in 1778 and put in place a new government.
Britain's next major target was Charleston, South Carolina. In early 1780 General Clinton landed a force of 14,000 troops around the port city. With a minimal cost of about 250 casualties, the British scored one of their biggest victories of the war. The Patriots surrendered Charleston in May, handing over four ships and some 5,400 prisoners.
Camden and King's Mountain
In August 1780, Patriot forces led by Horatio Gates tried to drive the British out of Camden, South Carolina. The attack was poorly executed, however. Gates had only half as many soldiers as he had planned for, and most were tired and hungry. In the heat of battle, many panicked and ran. The Patriot attack quickly fell apart. Of some 4,000 American troops, only about 700 escaped.
General Nathanael Greene arrived to reorganize the army. As he rode through the southern countryside, he was discouraged by the devastation. He later wrote, "I have never witnessed such scenes." American forces attacked Loyalists at King's Mountain in October 1780, scoring a major victory.
Swamp Fox
Francis Marion leads his soldiers down a river in South Carolina. From a hideout on a river island, Marion led raids against British communication and supply lines.
Which figure do you think is Francis Marion? Why?
Guerrilla Warfare
The southern Patriots
switched to swift hit-and-
run attacks known as guerrilla
warfare. No Patriot was better at this style of fighting than Francis Marion. He organized Marion's Brigade, a group of guerrilla soldiers.
Marion's Brigade used surprise attacks to disrupt British communication and supply lines. Despite their great efforts, the British could not catch Marion and his men. One frustrated general claimed, "As for this... old fox, the devil himself could not catch him." From that point on, Marion was known as the Swamp Fox.

Sequencing List the events of the war in the South in chronological order.
Battle of Yorktown
In early 1781 the war was going badly for the Patriots. They were low on money to pay soldiers and buy supplies. The help of their foreign allies had not brought the war to a quick end as they had hoped. The British held most of the South, plus Philadelphia and New York City. The Patriots' morale took another blow when Benedict Arnold, one of America's most gifted officers, turned traitor.
Regrouped under Nathanael Greene, the Continental Army began harassing British general Charles Cornwallis in the Carolinas. The Patriot's system of spies kept Washington and Lafayette informed of British plans. One African American spy, a slave named James Armistead, posed as a runaway slave who wanted to help the British. He moved easily in the camps of both Cornwallis and Arnold, but sent reports of their plans back to Lafayette. Hoping to stay in communication with the British naval fleet, Cornwallis moved his force of 7,200 men to Yorktown, Virginia. It was a fatal mistake.

General Washington, in New York, saw a chance to trap Cornwallis at Yorktown. He ordered Lafayette to block Cornwallis's escape by land. Then he combined his 2,500 troops with 4,000 French troops commanded by the Comte de Rochambeau (raw-shahn-BOH). Washington led the French-American force on a swift march to Virginia to cut off the other escape routes. The Patriots surrounded Cornwallis with some 16,000 soldiers. Meanwhile, a French naval fleet seized control of the Chesapeake Bay, preventing British ships from rescuing Cornwallis's stranded army.
The siege began. For weeks, the fight-
ing steadily wore down the British defenses.
In early October, Washington prepared for a major attack on the weakened British troops.
Facing near-certain defeat, on October 19, 1781, Cornwallis sent a drummer and a soldier with a white flag of surrender to Washington's camp. The Patriots took some 8,000 British prisoners—the largest British army in America.
The Battle of Yorktown was the last major battle of the American Revolution. Prime Minister Lord North received word of the Yorktown surrender in November. In shock he declared, "It is all over!"

Sentiments of an
American Woman
The Continental Army received aid from female Patriots led by Esther DeBerdt Reed and Sarah Franklin Bache, the daughter of Benjamin Franklin. In 1780 these women organized a campaign that raised $300,000 for soldiers' clothing. The following pamphlet, written by the campaign's leaders, announced the campaign. In it, the authors used images of women helping with war efforts of the past to gain support for their cause.
//On the commencement of actual war, the Women of America manifested a firm resolution to contribute ... to the deliverance of their country. Animated by the purest patriotism they are sensible of sorrow at this day, in not offering more than barren wishes for the success of so glorious a Revolution. They aspire to render themselves more really useful; and this sentiment is universal from the north to the south of the Thirteen United States. Our ambition is kindled by the fame of those heroines of antiquity, who ... have proved to the universe, that... if opinion and manners did not forbid us to march to glory by the same paths as the Men, we
should at least equal, and sometimes surpass them in our love for the public good. I glory in all that which my sex has done great and commendable. I call to mind with enthusiasm and with admiration, all those acts of courage, of constancy and patriotism, which history has transmitted to us.. JJ
//So many famous sieges where the Women have been
seen ... building new walls, digging trenches with their feeble hands, furnishing arms to their defenders, they themselves darting the missile weapons of the enemy, resigning the ornaments of their apparel, and their fortune, to fill the public treasury, and to hasten the deliverance of their country; burying themselves under its ruins; throwing themselves into the flames rather than submit to the disgrace of humiliation before a proud enemy.//
//Born for liberty, disdaining to bear the irons of a
tyrannic Government, we associate ourselves... [with
those rulers] who have extended the empire of liberty,
and contented to reign by sweetness and justice, have broken the chains of slavery, forged by tyrants.//

The Treaty of Paris
After Yorktown, only a few small battles took place. Lacking the money to pay for a new army, Great Britain entered into peace talks with America. Benjamin Franklin had a key role in the negotiations.
Delegates took more than two years to come to a peace agreement. In the Treaty of Paris of 1783, Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States. The treaty also set America's borders. A separate treaty between Britain and Spain returned Florida to the Spanish. British leaders also accepted American rights to settle and trade west of the original thirteen colonies.
The Revolution, which had begun in 1774 with the meeting of the First Continental Congress, was finally over. At the war's end, Patriot soldiers returned to their homes and families. The courage of soldiers and civilians had made America's victory possible. As they returned home, George Washington thanked his troops for their devotion. "I . . . wish that your latter days be as prosperous as your former ones have been glorious."

Constructing Time Lines
Define the Skill
Time lines are a good way to organize historical information. Time lines clearly show a sequence of historical events, eras, or people's achievements over a certain period of time. Using a time line to describe the events in the sequence in which they happened is using relative chronology. In addition to showing events in the order they happened, time lines also show the amount of time between events. Using the specific dates of events is ordering events with absolute chronology.
When you construct a time line to sequence events you can often better understand the context of certain events. It can help you determine cause and effect relationships among them or see specific themes within a time period.
The first step in actually constructing the time line is to draw a straight line using a ruler. Then mark intervals of time on the line. These represent the dates that divide the time line into smaller, equal time periods. For example, a time line of the Revolution might include three-year intervals: 1770, 1773, 1776, and so on. Then add events in the correct places on the time line. The beginning and end of the time line, each interval, and each event should be labeled with dates. As a final touch, the time line needs a title.
Once you have completed the time line, you can use it to interpret the events. Look for events that are similar, such as the meetings of the First and Second Continental Congresses. You can describe how far apart they are and which events led to each one.
Learn the Skill
Practice the Skill
When you construct a time line, you need to make some basic decisions. First, the time line needs a topic. This topic can be general or specific. For example, it might be as general as "The American Revolution," or more specific, such as "Important Battles of the Revolution." The time line should span a period that includes the main events related to the topic. A time line on all the major events of the Revolution might cover the period 1770-1783.
The next step in constructing a time line is taking notes on events from the chosen time period and topic. Write down the date when each event happened. If there are too many events, it is a good idea to include only the most important ones.
Follow these instructions to construct a time line.
1.	Using your textbook, choose a topic related to the Revolution for your time line. Decide on the dates your time line will need to cover.
2.	Use your textbook to take notes on events to include in your time line and their dates. Put the events in order.
3.	Following the steps described above, construct your time line. The finished time line should include clearly labeled dates, at least six events, and a title.
4.	Look for relationships between the events and then write a summary of the time line.

Assignment
Write a biographical narrative about a person who lived in the early Americas before or
during the colonial period.
A
Biographical Narrative You have been listening to and telling narratives all your life. A biographical narrative, a form of historical writing,
i is a true story about an event or brief period in a person's life.
1 Asking Questions Try using I the 5I/1/-How?questions {Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?) to help you think of descriptive details. Ask questions such as, Who was this person? What was he or she doing? Exactly where and when did the event occur? How did the person or other people react to the event?
1.	Prewrite
Getting Started
■	Think of all the people you read about in this unit. Which ones interested you most?
■	What particular events and situations in these people's lives seem most exciting or significant?
Pick one of these events or situations as the subject of your narrative.
Creating an Interesting Narrative
Make your narrative lively and interesting by including
■	Physical descriptions of people, places, and things, using details that appeal to the five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste)
■	Specific actions that relate directly to the story you are telling
■	Dialogue between the people involved or direct quotations
■	Background information about the place, customs, and setting
■	All relevant details and information needed to relate the events of the story and how they affected the person (and perhaps history)
Organize the events in your narrative in chronological order, the order in which they occurred.
2.	Write
You can use this framework to help you draft your narrative.
A
Writer's Framework Introduction
■	Grab your reader's attention with a striking detail or bit of dialogue.
■	Introduce the historical person and setting, using specific details.
■	Set the scene by telling how the event or situation began.
Body
■	Present actions and details in the order in which they occurred.
■	Connect actions with transition words like first, then, next, and finally.
■	Provide specific details to make the person and the situation come alive.
Conclusion
■	Wrap up the action of the narrative.
■	Tell how the person was affected by what happened.
■	Explain how the event or situation was important in the person’s life and how it affected history.
14 UNIT1

3. Evaluate and Revise
Evaluating
Read through your completed draft to make sure your narrative is complete, coherent, and clear. Then look for ways to improve it.
Evaluation Questions for a Biographical Narrative
; ■ Does your introduction grab the reader's attention? Do you introduce the historical person and tell how
i the event or situation began? s ■ Do you include details to make the
person, place, and event seem real? i ■ Are the actions in the story in the
order in which they occurred?
■	Have you included all of the actions and details a reader would need to understand what happened?
■	Does the conclusion tell how the event or situation affected the person and history?
Showing Sequence A clear sense of the sequence of events is important in any narrative. Here is a list of words that show those
after	next
before	now
finally	soon
first	still
(second, etc.)	then
last	when
later	while

Revising
When you revise your narrative, you may need to add transition words. Transition words help you link ideas between sentences and paragraphs. Notice the words in bold in the following sentences.
After Cabeza de Vaca and the other adventurers left the beach and started inland, they separated into different groups. Later, Cabeza de Vaca heard that many of the others had died. Still, he never lost faith that he would reach his fellow Spaniards in Mexico.

Focus on Themes Visualize a row of dominoes, lined up one after the other. Push over the first one, and—one after the other—all eventually fall. In this way, the events in this chapter are like dominoes that cause
each other to occur. These events, one after another, finally led to the formation of a new government and a new society. If you read closely, you will see that political disagreements started the entire process.
Understanding Chronological Order
FOCUS on Reading Like falling dominoes, historical events can create huge chains of results, often stretching over many years. To understand history and events, therefore, we often need to see how they are related in time.
Understanding Chronological Order The word chronological means "related to time." Events discussed in this history book are discussed in sequence, in the order in which they happened. To understand history better, you can use a sequence chain to take notes about events in the order they happened.
Sequence Chain
Tip: Writers sometimes signal chronological order, or sequence, by using words or phrases like these:
first, before, then, later, soon, after, before long, next, eventually, finally
Definition: There are two kinds of chronological order: absolute and relative. An absolute chronology includes the date of each event and the amount of time between each one. A relative chronology does not include dates, it simply notes the order in which events occurred.
II
Tip: You can put lengths of time in chronological order. People's life spans or important eras of time can be placed in the order | of the first date and with the I spans of time overlapping on a I time line. 50 CHAPTER 5

I TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the new American government.
Ideas about Government
The American colonies had taken a bold step in declaring their independence from Great Britain in July 1776. Their next political goal was to form a new government. To do so, the American people drew from a wide range of political ideas.
English Laws and the Enlightenment
One source of inspiration was the rule of law. This rule makes even government officials subject to law. England had limited the power of its kings and queens in two documents. These were Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights. Magna Carta, a document signed by King John in 1215, made the king subject to law. The English Bill of rights, passed in 1689, declared the supremacy of Parliament. It kept the king or queen from changing laws without Parliament's consent. As a result, the people's representatives had a strong voice in England's government.
Many Americans were also influenced by the Enlightenment— a philosophical movement that emphasized the use of reason to
152 CHAPTER 5
examine old ideas and traditions. Philosopher John Locke believed that a social contract existed between political rulers and the people they ruled. Baron de Montesquieu argued that the only way to achieve liberty was through the separation of governmental powers.
American Models of Government
Americans had their own models of self-government to follow, like town meetings, the Virginia House of Burgesses, and the Mayflower Compact. In 1639 the people of Connecticut drew up the English colonies' first written constitution. A constitution is a set of basic principles and laws that states the powers and duties of the government. In addition, the Declaration of Independence clearly set forth the beliefs on which Americans thought government should be based.
To keep individual leaders from gaining too much power, the new state constitutions created limited governments, or governments in which all leaders have to obey the laws. Most state constitutions had rules to protect the rights of citizens or those accused of
crimes. Some banned slavery. The Massachusetts constitution of 1780 is the oldest state constitution still in effect.
Thomas Jefferson's ideas about religious freedom were included in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. This document declared that no person could be forced to attend a particular church or be required to pay for a church with tax money.
Right to Vote
Under British rule, only free, white men that owned land could vote. Many states' constitutions expanded suffrage, or the right to vote, by allowing any white man who paid taxes to vote. In every state, however, only land-owners could hold public office. Some states originally allowed women and free African Americans to vote, but these rights were soon taken away. Suffrage would not be restored to these groups for decades to come.
Comparing What two
principles were common to state constitutions written during the Revolutionary War?
READING CHECK .
Articles of Confederation
The Second Continental Congress was organized to create a national government. The Continental Congress appointed a Committee of Thirteen, with one member from each colony. This group was assigned to discuss and draft the Articles of Confederation, the new national constitution.
Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress would become the single branch of the national government, but it would have limited powers in order to protect the liberties of the people. Each state had one vote in the Congress. Congress could settle conflicts among the states, issue coins, borrow money, and make treaties with other countries and with Native Americans. Congress could also ask the states for money and soldiers. However, states had the power to refuse these requests. The government did not have a president or a national court system.
The Second Continental Congress passed the Articles of Confederation on November 15, 1777. Then it sent the Articles to each state legislature for ratification, or official approval, before the new national government could take effect.
Conflicts over claims to western lands slowed the process, but by 1779 every state except Maryland had ratified the Articles. Maryland's leaders refused to ratify until other states gave up their western land claims. Thomas Jefferson assured Maryland that western lands would be made into new states, rather than increasing territory for existing states. Satisfied with this condition, in March 1781 Maryland ratified the Articles. This put the first national government of the United States into effect.

two weaknesses of the new national government?

Northwest Territory
Congress had to decide what to do with the western lands now under its control and how to raise money to pay debts. It tried to solve both problems by selling the western lands. Congress passed the Land Ordinance of 1785, which set up a system for surveying and dividing western lands. The land was split into townships, which were 36 square miles divided into 36 lots of 640 acres each. One lot was reserved for a public school, and four lots were given to veterans. The remaining lots were sold to the public.
To form a political system for the region, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The ordinance established the Northwest Territory, which included areas that are now in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The Northwest Ordinance created a system for bringing new states into the Union. Congress agreed that the Northwest Territory would be divided into several smaller territories with a governor appointed by Congress. When the
population of a territory reached 60,000, its settlers could draft their own constitution and ask to join the Union.
In addition, the law protected civil liberties and required that public education be provided. Finally, the ordinance stated that "there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude [forced labor] in the... territory." This last condition banned slavery in the Territory and set the standard for future territories. The system of land allotment and political structures created by the two ordinances would become the typical method of organizing all new land added to the United States. However, slavery would continue to be a controversial issue.

MAGNA CARTA, 1215
THE MAYFLOWER COMPACT, 1620
The Mayflower, shown here in an illustration, sailed to America in 1620. Aboard the ship, 41 men signed the Mayflower Compact, the first document in the colonies to establish guidelines for self-government. The signers agreed that they and their families would combine to form a "civil body politic," or community.
COLONIAL ASSEMBLIES



In this painting King John of England is signing Magna Carta, or the Great Charter, which established that the king was subject to the law just like everyone else.
It also declared that people could not be deprived of their lives, liberty, or property "except by the lawful judgment of [their] peers, or by the law of the land." Compare this language to that of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.
"No person shall be... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law..."
—Fifth Amendment, U.S. Constitution
THE ENGLISH BILL OF RIGHTS, 1689
The British Parliament's two-chamber structure also influenced colonial governments. In Article I, Section 1, of the Constitution, the framers continued the practice of a two-chamber legislature.
"All legislative powers... shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives."

VIRGINIA STATUTE FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, 1786

This painting shows King William and Queen Mary of England. Before taking the throne, William and Mary had to accept the English Bill of Rights. The English Bill of Rights took even more power away from the monarch than did Magna Carta. It also protected the rights of English citizens. These ideas would later influence the U.S.Constitution.
"Excessive bail ought not be required, nor excessive fines imposed; nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." —English Bill of Bights
Classical liberal principles such as the written protection of citizens' personal liberties were reflected in the addition of the Bill of Rights. The First Amendment's freedom of religion clauses were based on Thomas Jefferson's Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. The document, which was accepted by the Virginia legislature in 1786, ensured the separation of church and state in Virginia.
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..." —First Amendment, U.S. Constitution

DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, 1776
The framers wrote the Constitution to help implement the ideals put forth in the Declaration of Independence. The grievances listed in the Declaration discussed the king's interference with representative government and the application of laws by judges and juries, the quartering of troops in colonists' homes, and the ignoring of petitions sent to the king that requested changes to British policies. The Constitution provided for a clear system of representation in government. The Bill of Rights addresses some of the grievances specifically: The Sixth Amendment requires criminal trials to have juries. The First Amendment guarantees the right of citizens to petition the governmer The Third Amendment restricts the government's ability to quarter troops in private homes.

I BUILDING BACKGROUND
Americans surprised the world by win- > I ning their independence from Great Britain. Butthe 13 new states were I far from being a strong nation. Internal problems, especially with taxes	j
! and the economy, led to protests and rebellion. The government also	’
had trouble with foreign trade and treaties.
---------------------------------------
Relations with Other Countries
Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress could not force states to provide soldiers for an army. The Continental Army had disbanded, or dissolved, soon after the signing of the Treaty of Paris of 1783. Without an army, the national government found it difficult to protect its citizens against foreign threats.
Trouble with Britain
It was also difficult to enforce international treaties such as the Treaty of Paris of 1783. The United States found it especially hard to force the British to turn over "with all convenient speed" their forts on the American side of the Great Lakes. The United States wanted to gain control of these forts because they protected valuable land and fur-trade routes. Still, Britain was slow to withdraw from the area. A British official warned against the United States trying to seize the forts by force. He said that any attempt to do so would be opposed by the thousands of British soldiers who had settled in Canada after the Revolution "who are ready to fly to arms at a moment's warning."
58 CHAPTER 5
Trade with Britain
The United States also faced problems trading with Great Britain. After the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Britain closed many of its ports to American ships. Before the Revolutionary War, colonial ships had traded a great deal with the British West Indies and stopped there on their way to other destinations. This travel and trading stopped after 1783.
In addition, Britain forced American merchants to pay high tariffs—taxes on imports or exports. The tariffs applied to goods such as rice, tobacco, tar, and oil that were grown or mined in the United States and then sold in Britain. Merchants had to raise prices to cover the tariffs. Ultimately, the costs would be passed on to customers, who had to pay higher prices for the goods. The economic condition of the country was getting worse by the day.
Trade with Spain
In 1784 Spanish officials closed the lower Mississippi River to U.S. shipping. Western farmers and merchants were furious because they used the Mississippi to send goods to eastern and foreign markets. Congress tried to work out an agreement with Spain, but the plan did not receive a majority vote in Congress. The plan could not be passed. As a result, Spain broke off the negotiations.
Many state leaders began to criticize the national government. Rhode Island's representatives wrote, "Our federal government is but a name; a mere shadow without substance [power]." Critics believed that Spain might have continued to negotiate if the United States had possessed a strong military. These leaders believed that the national government needed to be more powerful.
FORMING A GOVERNMENT 159
Impact of Closed Markets
The closing of markets in the British West Indies seriously affected the U.S. economy. James Madison of Virginia wrote about the crisis.
^The Revolution has robbed us of our trade withthe West Indies . . . without opening any other channels to compensate [make up for] it.
In every point of view, indeed, the trade of this country is in a deplorable [terrible] condition/^
—James Madison, quoted in Independence on Trial by Frederick W. Marks III
Farmers could no longer export their goods to the British West Indies. They also had to hire British ships to carry their goods to British markets, which was very expensive. American exports dropped while British goods flowed freely into the United States.
This unequal trade caused serious economic problems for the new nation. British merchants could sell manufactured products in the United States at much lower prices than locally made goods. This difference in prices hurt American businesses.
The Confederation Congress could not correct the problem because it did not have the authority either to pass tariffs or to order the states to pass tariffs. The states could offer little help. If one state passed a tariff, the British could simply sell their goods in another state. Most states did not cooperate in trade matters. Instead, states worked only to increase their own trade rather than working to improve the trade situation for the whole country.
In 1785 the situation led a British magazine to call the new nation the Dis-United States. As a result of the trade problems with Britain, American merchants began looking for other markets such as China, France, and the Netherlands. Despite such attempts, Britain remained the most important trading partner of the United States.
Reading Check
Analyzing Why was the Confederation Congress unable to solve America's international trade problems?
Economic Problems
In addition to international trade issues, other challenges soon appeared. Trade problems among the states, war debts, and a weak economy plagued the states.
Trade among States
Because the Confederation Congress had no power to regulate interstate commerce— trade between two or more states—states followed their own trade interests. As a result, trade laws differed from state to state. This situation made trade difficult for merchants whose businesses crossed state lines.
Inflation
After the Revolutionary War, most states had a hard time paying off war debts and struggled to collect overdue taxes. To ease this hardship, some states began printing large amounts of paper money. The result was inflation. This money had little

or no real value, because states did not have gold or silver reserves to back it up. Inflation occurs when there are increased prices for goods and services combined with the reduced value of money. Congress had no power to stop states from issuing more paper money and thus stop inflation.
Weak Economy
In Rhode Island the state legislature printed large amounts of paper money worth very little. This made debtors—people who owe money—quite happy. They could pay back their debts with paper money worth less than the coins they had borrowed. However, creditors—people who lend money—were upset. Hundreds of creditors fled Rhode Island to avoid being paid back with worthless money.
The loss of trade with Britain combined with inflation created a depression. A depression is a period of low economic activity combined with a rise in unemployment.
Reading Check
Summarizing What economic problems did the new nation face?
Shays's Rebellion
Each state handled its economic problems differently. Massachusetts refused to print worthless paper money. It tried to pay its war debts by collecting taxes on land.
Heavy Debts for Farmers
Massachusetts's tax policy hit farmers hard. As landowners, they had to pay the new taxes. However, farmers had trouble paying their debts. The courts began forcing them to sell their property. Some farmers had to serve terms in debtors' prison; others had to sell their labor.
Many government leaders in the state did not care about the problems of poor farmers, however. In some cases, farmers actually owed these leaders money.
Farmers Rebel
In August 1786, farmers in three western counties began a revolt. Bands of angry citizens closed down courts in western Massachusetts. Their reasoning was simple—with the courts shut down, no one's property could be taken. In September a poor farmer and Revolutionary War veteran, Daniel Shays, led hundreds of men in a forced shutdown of the Supreme Court in Springfield, Massachusetts. The state government ordered the farmers to stop the revolt under threat of capture and death. These threats only made Sh< i £ nd his followers more determined. The of farmers to protest high taxes anc : debt became known as Shays's Rebellion. Shays's Defeat
Shays's forces were defeated by state troops in January 1787. By February many of the rebels were in prison. During their trials, 14 leaders were sentenced to death. However, the state soon freed most of the rebels, including Shays. State officials knew that many citizens of the state agreed with the rebels and their cause.

Because of the poor attendance, the participants, including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, called on all 13 states to send delegates to a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in May 1787. They planned to revise the Articles of Confederation to better meet the needs of the nation. The failure of the Articles of Confederation led to the creation of the Constitution and began the period of the early republic. This period would last until 1800, when the political system we know today became more established.

In the end, Shays's Rebellion showed the weakness of the Confederation government. It led some Americans to admit that the Articles of Confederation had failed to protect the ideals of liberty set forth in the Declaration of Independence.
When Massachusetts had asked the national government to help put down Shays's Rebellion, Congress could offer little help. More Americans began calling for a stronger central government. They wanted leaders who

The Constitutional Convention was held in May 1787 in Philadelphia's Independence Hall to improve the Articles of Confederation. However, delegates would leave with an entirely new U.S. Constitution. This decision angered some of the participants.
Most delegates were well educated, and many had served in state legislatures or Congress. Benjamin Franklin and James Madison were there. Revolutionary War hero George Washington was elected president of the Convention.
Several important voices were absent. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson could not attend. Patrick Henry chose not to attend because he did not want a stronger central government. Women, African Americans, and Native Americans did not take part because they did not yet have the rights of citizens.
Summarizing What was the
purpose of the Constitutional Convention?
Reading Check ,
Great Compromise
Several issues divided the delegates to the Constitutional Convention. Some members wanted only small changes to the Articles of Confederation, while others wanted to rewrite the Articles completely.
Those delegates who wanted major changes to the Articles had different goals. For example, small and large states had different ideas about representation, economic concerns such as tariffs, and slavery. In addition, delegates disagreed over how strong to make the national government.
Virginia Plan
After the delegates had met for four days, Edmund Randolph of Virginia presented the Virginia Plan. He proposed a new federal constitution that would give sovereignty, or supreme power, to the central government. The legislature would be bicameral—made

up of two houses, or groups of representatives—and chosen on the basis of state populations. Larger states would thus have more representatives than would smaller states. Delegates from the smaller states believed that it would give too much power to the larger states.
New Jersey Plan
The smaller states came up with a plan to stop the larger states from getting too much
power. New Jersey delegate William Paterson presented the small-state or New Jersey Plan, which called for a unicameral, or one-house, legislature. The plan gave each state an equal number of votes, and thus an equal voice, in the federal government. The plan gave the federal government the power to tax citizens in all states, and it allowed the government to regulate commerce.
Compromise Is Reached
After a month of debate, the delegates were unable to agree on how states should be represented. The convention reached a deadlock.
Finally, Roger Sherman of Connecticut proposed a compromise plan. The legislative branch would have two houses. Each state, regardless of its size, would have two representatives in the Senate, or upper house. This would give each state an equal voice, pleasing the smaller states. In the House of Representatives, or lower house, the number of representatives for each state would be determined by the state's population. This pleased the larger states. The agreement to create a two-house legislature became known as the Great Compromise. James Wilson, a great speaker, saw his dream of a strong national government come true.

POINTS OF VIEW
Compromise and the Slave Trade
The issue of slavery highlighted the growing division between the North and the South. Gouverneur Morris of New York spoke with much emotion against the Three-Fifths Compromise. Also, the idea of banning the foreign slave trade prompted southerners such as John Rutledge of South Carolina to defend the practice.
//If the Convention thinks that North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia will ever agree to the plan [to prohibit the slave trade], unless their right to import slaves be untouched, the expectation is vain [useless]/^
—John Rutledge,
quoted in The Atlantic Monthly, February 1891, by Frank Gaylord Cook
//The admission of slaves into the Representation ... comes to this: that the inhabitant of [a state] who goes to the coast of Africa and ... tears away his fellow creatures from their dearest connections and damns them to the most cruel bondage [slavery], shall have more votes in a Government [established] for protection of the rights of mankind//
—Gouverneur Morris,
quoted in Founding the Republic, edited by John J. Patrick
Finding Main Ideas How did these two views of slavery differ?
Three-Fifths Compromise
The debate over representation also involved regional differences. Southern delegates wanted enslaved Africans to be counted as part of their state populations. This way they would have more representatives, and more power, in Congress. Northerners disagreed. They wanted the number of slaves to determine taxes but not representation.
To resolve this problem, some delegates thought of a compromise. They wanted to count three-fifths of the slaves in each state as part of that state's population to decide how many representatives a state would have. After much debate, the delegates voted to accept the proposal, called the Three-Fifths Compromise. Under this agreement only three-fifths of a state's slave population would count when determining representation.
Another major issue was the foreign slave trade. Some of the delegates believed slavery was wrong and wanted the federal government to ban the slave trade. Others said that the southern states' economies needed the slave trade. Many southern delegates said they would leave the Union if the Constitution immediately ended the slave trade. Also at issue was Congress's ability to tax imports and exports.
Worried delegates reached another compromise. The Commerce Compromises allowed Congress to levy tariffs on imports, but not exports, and allowed the importation of slaves until the end of 1807. The delegates omitted, or left out, the words slavery and slave in the Constitution. They referred instead to "free Persons" and "all other Persons."

mise was reached over the issue of the slave trade?

New System of Government
Most of the delegates to the Convention wanted a stronger central government than the Articles of Confederation could provide. They believed it was necessary for the protection and administration of the group of states. But delegates also wanted to protect the individual rights that had been won in the Revolution. They wanted the new system of government to support the ideals stated in the Declaration of Independence.
The right of individual citizens to maintain the unalienable rights of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" was supported by the idea of popular sovereignty. This is the idea that political authority is in the hands of the people. In the new nation, people expressed this power through their votes. The power of the government is limited by the power of voters. In a republic, the government consists of people elected by voters to represent them. In this system, voters can limit the actions of government by removing representatives who do not truly work for the goals of voters.
Checks and Balances
The delegates also divided the roles of government into three branches: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. The legislative branch is Congress. It is responsible for proposing and passing laws, which are also called legislation. It is made up of two houses, as created in the Great Compromise. Members of the Senate and members of the House of Representatives are elected through different systems, which helps balance the power among voters from different states. The executive branch includes the president and the departments that help run the government. The executive branch makes sure that laws are carried out. The judicial branch is made up of all of the national courts. This branch is responsible for interpreting laws, punishing criminals, and settling disputes between states.
The framers of the Constitution created a system of checks and balances, which keeps any single branch of government from becoming too powerful. For example, Congress has the power to pass bills into law. The president has the power to veto, or reject, laws that Congress passes. However, Congress can override the president's veto with a two-thirds majority vote. The Supreme Court has the power to review laws passed by Congress and strike down any law that violates the Constitution.
Federalism
Even though many of the delegates wanted a stronger central government, they did not want to destroy state governments. In order to balance the power between these two types of government, they created the system of federalism. Federalism is the sharing of power between a central government and the states that make up a nation. Under the previous confederal system, states were only loosely joined together.
Under the Constitution, each state must obey the authority of the federal, or national, government. States have control over government functions not specifically assigned to the federal government. This includes control of local government, education, the chartering of corporations, and the supervision of religious bodies. States also have the power to create and oversee civil and criminal laws. States must protect the welfare of their citizens.
Amending the Constitution
One of the most important decisions the framers made was to include a method for changing or adding to the Constitution. They wanted the government to be able to adapt as changes were needed. The process for amending the Constitution was made difficult, however, so that major changes to the government would require the support of a large majority of voters. Two-thirds of each house of Congress and three-fourths of
FORMING A GOVERNMENT 167
states must approve a change before it can take effect. Although many amendments, or changes to the Constitution, have been suggested, only twenty-seven have been approved. The purposes of these amendments have usually focused on protecting civil and voting rights, and on procedures for administering the government.
Even though the final draft of the Constitution was adopted by the Convention, many disagreements still existed among delegates. Debates continued around the power of state governments and the role of each branch. Almost as soon as the document was adopted, different interpretations of the language used began to appear. Some of the disagreements

Federalists and Antifederalists
When the Constitution was made public, a huge debate began among many Americans. Antifederalists—people who opposed the Constitution—thought that the Constitutional Convention should not have created a new government. Others thought the Constitution gave too much power to the central government. Convention delegate George Mason became an Antifederalist for this reason. In a speech to a Virginia ratifying convention he stated, "This power is calculated to annihilate totally the state governments." For some Antifederalists, the main problem was that the Constitution did not have a section that guaranteed individual rights.
Many Antifederalists were small farmers and debtors. Some Patriots, including Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry, were also strong Antifederalists. At the Virginia ratifying convention, Henry spoke out against the lack of protection of individual freedoms. "The first thing I have at heart is American liberty," he said. "The second thing is American union." Antifederalists were

challenged by those who believed that the United States needed a stronger central government.
Federalists, supporters of the Constitution, included James Madison, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Alexander Hamilton. Most Federalists believed that the Constitution offered a good balance of power between various political views. Many Federalists were wealthy planters, farmers, and lawyers. However, others were workers and craftspeople.
Federalists and Antifederalists debated whether the new Constitution should be approved. They made speeches and printed pamphlets advocating their views. Mercy Otis Warren, an ardent Patriot during the war, wrote a pamphlet entitled Observations on the New Constitution, in which she criticized the lack of individual rights it provided. The Federalists had to convince people a change in the structure of government was needed. To do this, they had to overcome people's fears that the Constitution would make the government too powerful.

Federalist Papers
One of the most important defenses of the Constitution appeared in a series of essays that became known as the Federalist Papers. These essays supporting the Constitution were written anonymously under the name Publius. They were actually written by Hamilton, Madison, and Jay.
The authors of the Federalist Papers tried to reassure Americans that the new federal government would not overpower the states. In Federalist Paper No. 10, Madison argued that the diversity of the United States would prevent any single group from dominating the government.
The Federalist Papers were widely reprinted in newspapers around the country as the debate over the Constitution continued. Finally, they were collected and published in book form in 1788.

HISTORIC DOCUMENT
Federalist Paper No. 10
In November 1787, Number 10 in the series called the Federalist Papers was written in support of the Constitution. In it, James Madison describes the way federalism will overcome disagreements within society.
Mk landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile [trading] interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated [moved] by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests [opinions] forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction [group] in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government...
The federal Constitution forms a happy combination ... the great... interests being referred to the national [legislature]; the local and particular to the state legislatures ... The influence of factious leaders may kindle [start] a flame within their particular states, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration [large fire] through the other states/*
—James Madison, quoted in Living American Documents, edited by Isidore Starr, et al.
Madison believes that lawmakers are responsible for regulating the many competing concerns that make up society.
The federal government will handle issues affecting the nation as a whole; state and local governments will handle those concerning local issues.
ANALYSIS
SKILL? analyzing Primary sources
Why does Madison think federalism will prevent disagreement?
The Constitution needed only 9 states to pass it. However, to establish and preserve national unity, each state needed to ratify it. Every state except Rhode Island held special state conventions that gave citizens the chance to discuss and vote on the Constitution.
Paul Revere served on a committee supporting ratification. He wrote of the Constitution, "The proposed... government, is well calculated [planned] to secure the liberties, protect the property, and guard the rights of the citizens of America." Antifederalists also spoke out in state conventions, and wrote articles and pamphlets that became known as the Antifederalist Papers. In New York, one citizen said, "It appears that the government will fall into the hands of the few and the great."
On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the Constitution. It went
into effect in June 1788 after New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify it.
Political leaders across America knew the new government needed the support of the large states of Virginia and New York, where debate still raged. Finally, Madison and fellow Virginia Federalists convinced Virginia to ratify it in mid-1788. In New York, riots had occurred when the draft of the Constitution was made public. At the state convention in Poughkeepsie to discuss ratification, Hamilton argued convincingly against the Antifederalists led by DeWitt Clinton. When news arrived of Virginia's ratification, New York ratified it as well. Rhode Island was the last state to ratify the Constitution in May 1790.

Drawing Conclusions
Why were Virginia and New York important to the ratification of the Constitution?
2 CHAPTER 5
Bill of Rights
Several states ratified the Constitution only after they were promised that a bill protecting individual rights would be added to it. Many Antifederalists did not think that the Constitution would protect personal freedoms.
Some Federalists said that the nation did not need a federal bill of rights because the Constitution itself was a bill of rights. It was, they argued, written to protect the liberty of all U.S. citizens.
James Madison wanted to make a bill of rights one of the new government's first priorities. In Congress's first session, Madison _ encouraged the legislators to put together a bill of rights. The rights would then be added to the Constitution as amendments, or official changes. In Article V of the Constitution, the founders had provided a way to change the document when necessary in order to reflect the will of the people. The process requires that proposed amendments must be approved by a two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress and then ratified by three-fourths of the states before taking effect.
Legislators took ideas from the state ratifying conventions, the Virginia Declaration of Rights, the English Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence to make sure that the abuses listed in the Declaration of Independence would be illegal under the new government. In September 1789 Congress proposed 12 amendments and sent them to the states for ratification. By December 1791 the states had ratified the Bill of Rights—10 of the proposed amendments intended to protect citizens' rights.
These 10 amendments set a clear example of how to amend the Constitution to fit the needs of a changing nation. The flexibility of the U.S. Constitution has allowed it to survive for more than 200 years.

Determining Different Points of View
Define the Skill
A point of view is a person's outlook or attitude. It is the way that he or she looks at a topic or thing. Each person's point of view is shaped by his or her background. Because people's backgrounds are different, their points of view are too. Since a person's point of view shapes his or her opinions, knowing that point of view helps you understand and evaluate those opinions. Being able to detect differences in point of view is important to understanding differences in people's opinions and actions in history.
Learn the Skill
When you encounter someone's beliefs, opinions, or actions in your study of history, use the following guidelines to determine his or her point of view.
1.	Look for information about the person's background.
2.	Ask yourself what factors in the person's background might have influenced his or her opinion or action concerning the topic or event.
3.	Be aware that sometimes the person's opinions or actions themselves will provide clues to his or her point of view.
Benjamin Lincoln led the troops that put down
Shays's Rebellion in Massachusetts. He was also a state politician and a general during the Revolution. Lincoln offered this explanation of Shays's uprising.
Among [the main causes] I rank the ease with which... credit was obtained... in the time of [the Revolution]... The moment the day arrived when all discovered that things were fast returning [to normal],... and that the
indolent [lazy persons] and improvident [unwise persons] would soon experience the evils of their idleness and sloth, many startled [panicked]... and... complained ... ofthe weight of public taxes... and at the cruelty of... creditors [those to whom money is owed] to call for their just dues [rightful payment]... The disaffected [unhappy people]... attempted... to stop the courts of law, and to suspend the operations of government. This they hoped to do until... an end should thereby be put to public and private debts/'
Lincoln's background as a general, state official, and leader against the rebels likely gave him a negative point of view on the revolt. His reference to the rebels as lazy and unwise also provides clues to his attitude. You should weigh such factors when evaluating the accuracy of his statement.
Practice the Skill
The following statement about Shays's Rebellion came from a Massachusetts farmer. Read it and apply the guidelines to answer the questions.
^1 have labored hard.. .all my days. I have been... obliged to do more than my part in the [Revolution], been loaded with... rates [taxes], ... have been... [abused] by sheriffs... and [debt] collectors... I have lost a great deal... [T]he great men are going to get all we have, and I think it is time for us to... put a stop to it."
1.	From what point of view is this person commenting on the revolt? What is his opinion of it?
2.	How does his view of himself differ from Lincoln's view of people like him?
3.	Is this view of the revolt likely to be more accurate than Lincoln's view? Why or why not?

TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the structure of each of the branches of government.
The Federal System
The framers of the Constitution wanted to create a government powerful enough to protect the rights of citizens and defend the country against its enemies. To do so, they set up a federal system of government, a system that divided powers between the states and the federal government. This system is also known as federalism.
The Constitution assigns certain powers to the national government. These are called delegated powers. Among them are the rights to coin money and to regulate trade. Reserved powers are those kept by the states. These powers include creating local governments and holding elections. Concurrent powers are those shared by the federal and state governments. They include taxing, borrowing money, and enforcing laws.
Sometimes, Congress has had to stretch its delegated powers to deal with new or unexpected issues. A clause in the Constitution states that Congress may "make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper" for carrying out its duties. This clause, called the elastic clause—-because it can be stretched (like elastic)—provides flexibility for the government. The federal government has used this clause to provide public services such as funding for the arts and humanities.

Legislative Branch
The federal government has three branches, each with distinct responsibilities and powers. This separation balances the branches and keeps any one of them from growing too powerful. The first branch of government is the legislative branch, or Congress. It makes the nation's laws. Article I of the Constitution divides Congress into the House of Representatives and the Senate.
With 435 members, the House of Representatives is the larger congressional house. The U.S. Census, a population count made every 10 years, determines how many members represent each state. A system called apportionment keeps total membership at 435. If one state gains a member, another state loses one. Members must be at least 25 years old, live in the state where they were elected, and have been U.S. citizens for seven years. They serve two-year terms.
The Senate has two members, or senators, per state. Senators represent the interests of the whole state, not just a district. They must be at least 30 years old, have been U.S. citizens for nine years, and live in the state they represent. They serve six-year terms. The senior senator of a state is the one who has served
the longer of the two. Members of Congress can serve an unlimited number of terms in office.
The political party with more members in each house is the majority party. The one with fewer members is the minority party. The leader of the House of Representatives, or Speaker of the House, is elected by House members from the majority party.
The U.S. vice president serves as president of the Senate. He takes no part in Senate debates but can vote to break ties. If he is absent, the president pro tempore (pro tern for short) leads the Senate. There is no law for how the Senate must choose this position, but it traditionally goes to the majority party's senator who has served the longest.
Congress begins sessions, or meetings, each year in the first week of January. Both houses do most of their work in committees. Each committee studies certain types of bills, or suggested laws. For example, all bills about taxes begin in the House Ways and Means Committee.

Executive Branch
Article II of the Constitution lists the powers of the executive branch. This branch enforces the laws passed by Congress.
President and Vice President
As head of the executive branch, the president is the most powerful elected leader in the United States. To qualify for the presidency or vice presidency, one must be a native-born U.S. citizen at least 35 years old. The president must also have been a U.S. resident for 14 years.
Americans elect a president and vice president every four years. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who won four times, was the only president to serve more than two terms. Now, the Twenty-second Amendment limits presidents to two terms. If a president dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the vice president becomes president for the rest of the term.
The House of Representatives can impeach, or vote to bring charges of serious crimes against, a president. Impeachment cases are tried in the Senate. If a president is found guilty, Congress can remove him from office. In 1868 Andrew Johnson was the first president to be impeached. President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998. However, the Senate found each man not guilty.
Working with Congress
The president and Congress are often on different sides of an issue. However, they must still work together.
Congress passes laws. The president, however, can ask Congress to pass or reject bills. The president also can veto, or cancel, laws Congress has passed. Congress can try to override, or undo, the veto. However, this is difficult since it takes a two-thirds
B4 CHAPTER 6
majority vote. To carry out laws affecting the Constitution, treaties, and statutes, the president issues executive orders. These commands have the power of law. The president also may grant pardons, or freedom from punishment, to persons convicted of federal crimes or facing criminal charges.
The president also commands the armed forces. In emergencies, the president can call on U.S. troops. Only Congress, however, can declare war. Other executive duties include conducting foreign relations and creating treaties. Executive departments do most of the executive branch work. As of 2004 there were 15 such departments. The president chooses department heads, who are called secretaries, and the Senate approves them. The heads make up the cabinet, which advises the president.
Drawing Conclusions

Judicial Branch
The third branch of government, the judicial branch, is made up of a system of federal courts headed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Constitution created the Supreme Court, but the Judiciary Act of 1789 created the system of lower district and circuit courts.
Article III generally outlines the courts' duties. Federal courts can strike down a state or federal law if the court finds a law unconstitutional. Congress can then try to revise the law to make it constitutional.
District Courts
The president makes appointments to federal courts. In an effort to keep federal judges free of party influence, the judges are given life appointments. The lower federal courts are divided according to cases over which they have jurisdiction, or authority. Each state has at least one of the 94 district courts.
THE IMPACT
TODAY
The Office of Homeland Security was established in 2002 to address the increased threat of terrorism following September 11, 2001. In 2003, the office became the Department of Homeland Security, the newest executive department.
Background of the Court
The rest of the Supreme Court decisions you see in this book will highlight important cases of the Court. But in this first one, well discuss the history of the Court.
The first Supreme Court met in 1790 at the Royal Exchange in New York City. The ground floor of this building was an open-air market. When the national government moved to Philadelphia, the Court met in basement rooms in Independence Hall. Once in Washington, the Court heard cases in the Capitol building until the present Supreme Court building was completed in 1932.
Circuit Riding
Today the Supreme Court holds court only in Washington, D.C. In the past, however, the justices had to travel through assigned circuits, hearing cases together with a district judge in a practice known as riding circuit.
The justices complained bitterly about the inconvenience of travel, which was often over unpaved roads and in bad weather. This system was not just inconvenient to the justices, however. Some people worried about the fairness of a system that required justices who had heard cases at trial to rule on them again on appeal. Other people, however, thought that the practice helped keep the justices in touch with the needs and feelings of the average citizen. Eventually,
circuit riding interfered so much with the increased amount of business of the Supreme Court that Congress passed a } law ending the practice in the late 1800s. Path to the Supreme Court When a case is decided by a state or federal court, the losing side may have a chance to appeal the decision to a higher court. Under the federal system, ; this higher court is called the court of j appeals. A person who loses in that court S may then appeal to the Supreme Court to review the case. But the Supreme Court does not have to accept all appeals. It usually chooses to hear only cases in which there is an important legal principle to be decided or if two < federal courts of appeals disagree on how an issue should be decided.

THE IMPACT
TODAY
Supreme Court rulings can have dramatic effects on the nation, as in Bushv. Gore, which decided the outcome of the 2000 presidential election.
Courts of Appeals
If someone convicted of a crime believes the trial was unfair, he or she may take the case to the court of appeals. There are 13 courts of appeals. Each has a panel of judges to decide if cases heard in the lower courts were tried appropriately. If the judges uphold, or accept, the original decision, the original outcome stands. Otherwise, the case may be retried in the lower court.
Supreme Court
After a case is decided by the court of appeals, the losing side may appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. Thousands of cases go to the Supreme Court yearly in the hope of a hearing, but the Court has time to hear only about 100. Generally, the cases heard involve important constitutional or public-interest issues. If the Court declines to hear a case, the court of appeals decision is final.
Nine justices sit on the Supreme Court. The chief justice of the United States leads the Court. Unlike the president and members of Congress, there are no specific constitutional requirements for becoming a justice.
In recent decades, the Supreme Court has become more diverse. In 1967 Thurgood Marshall became the first African American justice. Sandra Day O'Connor became the first female Court justice after her 1981 appointment by President Ronald Reagan.

When did he live? 1751-1836
Where did he live? Like several of the founding fathers, Janies Madison was a Virginian. He grew up in the town of Montpelier, and he kept a home there for his whole life.
What did he do? Through the persuasive power of his writing, Madison helped create the foundations of the U.S. government.
Why is he important? Madison is known as the Father of the Constitution. A brilliant thinker, he provided many of the basic ideas in the Constitution. He argued tirelessly for a strong national government, for separate branches of government, and for rights such as freedom of religion. He then rallied support for adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. In 1809 Madison became the fourth president of the United States. As president, he led the country through another war with Britain, the War of 1812. He and his wife, Dolley, were forced to flee Washington temporarily when the British invaded the capital and set fire to the White House.

But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.

Native Americans and the
Commerce Clause
The commerce clause gives Congress the power to "regulate Commerce with ... the Indian Tribes."The clause has been interpreted to mean that the states cannot tax or interfere with businesses on Indian reservations, but that the federal government can. It also allows American Indian nations to develop their own governments and laws. These laws, however, can be challenged in federal court. Although reservation land usually belongs to the government of the Indian group, it is administered by the U.S. government.

Executive Branch
Article II The Executive
The president is the chief of the executive branch. It is the job of the president to enforce the laws. The framers wanted the president's and vice president's terms of office and manner of selection to be different from those of members of Congress. They decided on four-year terms, but they had a difficult time agreeing on howto select the president and vice president. The framers finally set up an electoral system, which varies greatly from our electoral process today.
Section 1. 1 The Presidency
1. Terms of Office
The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:

Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.
3.	Former Method of Electing President
The Electors shall meet in their
respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom-onc at least
shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they
shall-makc a List of-all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes
for each; which List they shall sign and certify; and transmit scaled to the

Article V ) Amending the Constitution
The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in-any Manner
affect the first and-fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and
that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in
the Senate.
National Supremacy
One of the biggest problems facing the delegates to the Constitutional Convention was the question of what would happen if a state law and a federal law conflicted. Which law would be followed? Who would decide? The second clause of Article VI answers those questions. When a federal law and a state law disagree, the federal law overrides the state law. The Constitution and other federal laws are the "supreme Law of the Land." This clause is often called the supremacy clause.
Article VI
Supremacy of National Government
All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.
This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.
The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.

Bill of Rights
One of the conditions set by several states for ratifying the Constitution was the inclusion of a bill of rights. Many people feared that a stronger central government might take away basic rights of the people that had been guaranteed in state constitutions.
The First Amendment forbids Congress from making any "law respecting an establishment of religion" or restraining the freedom to practice religion as one chooses. Why is freedom of religion an important right?

The Reconstruction Amendments
The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments are often called the Reconstruction Amendments.This is because they arose during Reconstruction, the period of American history following the Civil War. The country was reconstructing itself after that terrible conflict. A key aspect of Reconstruction was extending the rights of citizenship to former slaves.
The Thirteenth Amendment banned slavery.The Fourteenth Amendment required states to respect the freedoms listed in the Bill of Rights, thus preventing states from denying rights to African Americans. The Fifteenth Amendment gave African American men the right to vote.

But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.

From the time of President George Washington's administration, it was a custom for presidents to serve no more than two terms in office. Franklin D. Roosevelt, however, was elected to four terms. The Twenty-second Amendment restricted presidents to no more than two terms in office. Why do you think citizens chose to limit the power of the president in this way?
After Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to four consecutive terms, limits were placed on the number of terms a president could serve.

Presidential Disability
The illness of President Eisenhower in the 1950s and the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963 were the events behind the Twenty-fifth Amendment. The Constitution did not provide a clear-cut method for a vice president to take over for a disabled president or upon the death of a president. This amendment provides for filling the office ofthe vice president if a vacancy occurs, and it provides a way for the vice president—or someone else in the line of succession—to take over if the president is unable to perform the duties of that office.

The Bill of Rights
If YOU were there...
Your father runs a bookshop in colonial Boston in 1770. Your family lives in a very small brick house. You and your sisters must share one small room. One day, a red-coated British officer knocks on your door and strides into the parlor. He says that your family will have to provide a room and meals for two British soldiers. "We're already crowded!"you protest, but he insists.
Would you support the British government’s requirement that colonists provide food and shelter for troops? Why?
The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution to define clearly the rights and freedoms of citizens.
K BUILDING BACKGROUND
People in the American colonies I resented the British soldiers stationed in their towns. They objected to i sudden searches and to soldiers being housed in private homes. They disliked censorship of their newspapers. When the Constitution was written, Americans remembered those wrongs. They insisted on adding a bill of rights to the document.

I TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights and which amendment protects each.
First Amendment
Federalist James Madison promised that a bill of rights would be added to the Constitution. This promise allowed the Constitution to pass. In 1789 Madison began writing a huge list of proposed amendments. He then presented a shorter list to the House of Representatives. Of those, the House approved 12. The states ratified 10, which took effect December 15, 1791. Those 10 amendments, called the Bill of Rights, protect U.S. citizens' individual liberties. Some of the amendments specifically address complaints mentioned in the Declaration of Independence.
The protection of individual liberties is important in a representative democracy. Without safeguards, people's rights would not always be protected because of majority rule. This is the idea that the greatest number of people in society can make policies for everyone. While this means that most people agree on what the law should be, it also means that smaller groups, or minorities, might lose their rights. The Bill of Rights ensures that the rights of all citizens are protected.

16 CHAPTER 6
The ideas spelled out in the First Amendment form the most basic rights of all U.S. citizens. These rights include freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and the right to petition.
In the spirit of Thomas Jefferson's Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, the First Amendment begins, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." In other words, the government cannot support or interfere with the practice of a religion. This amendment keeps the government from favoring one religion over any other or establishing an official religion.
The First Amendment also guarantees freedom of speech and of the press. This means that Americans have the right to express their own ideas and views. They also have the right to hear the ideas and views of others. Former senator Margaret Chase Smith discussed why these freedoms are important. "The key to security," she once said, "is public information."
Freedom of speech does not mean that people can say anything they want to, how-

ever. The Constitution does not protect slander—false statements meant to damage someone's reputation. Libel, or intentionally writing a lie that harms another person, is not protected, either. The Supreme Court has also ruled that speech that endangers public safety is not protected. For example, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes declared in 1919 that falsely shouting "Fire" in a crowded theater is not protected as free speech.
Americans also have freedom of assembly. Any group may gather peacefully. As long as they do not engage in illegal activities, the government cannot interfere. The right to petition, or make a request of the government, is another right of the American people. Any American can present a petition to a government official. This right lets Americans show dissatisfaction with a law. They can also suggest new laws. One of the reasons the Declaration of Independence gave for breaking with Britain was King George Ill's refusal to respond to petitions sent by colonists.

Amendment III
No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.
Amendment IV
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
to having their property searched for illegal goods. Anger over such actions led to the Fourth Amendment rule against “unreasonable searches and seizures." Before a citizen's property can be searched, authorities must now get a search warrant. This order gives authorities permission to search someone's property. A judge issues this order only when it seems likely that a search might uncover evidence relating to a crime. In emergencies, however, police can make an emergency search. This may preserve evidence needed to prove possible illegal activity.

Finding Main Ideas
Why were the Third and Fourth Amendments matters of great importance to Americans when the Bill of Rights was written?
Protecting Citizens
The Second, Third, and Fourth Amendments relate to colonial disputes with Britain and reflect many of the ideals outlined in the Declaration of Independence. The Second Amendment deals with state militias and the right to bear arms. Colonial militias played a big role in the Revolutionary War. The framers of the Constitution thought that the states needed their militias for emergencies. Today the National Guard has largely replaced organized state militias.
Supporters of gun-control laws have generally argued that the Second Amendment was intended to protect the collective right of states to maintain well-regulated militia units. Opponents hold that the amendment was meant to protect an individual's right of self-defense. The meaning of the amendment continues to be debated.
The Third Amendment prevents the military from forcing citizens to house soldiers. Before the Revolution, the British pressured colonists to shelter and feed British soldiers, a practice colonists protested in the Declaration of Independence. British leaders also forced colonists to submit
Rights of the Accused
The Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Amendments provide guidelines for protecting the rights of the accused. According to the Fifth Amendment, the government cannot punish anyone without due process of law. This means that the law must be fairly applied. A grand jury decides if there is enough evidence to indict (en—dyt), or formally accuse, a person. Without an indictment, the court cannot try anyone for a serious crime. The Fifth Amendment also protects people from having to testify at their own criminal trial. To keep from testifying, a person need only "take the Fifth." In addition, anyone found not guilty in a criminal trial cannot face double jeopardy. In other words, he or she cannot be tried again for the same crime.
The final clause of the Fifth Amendment states that no one can have property taken without due process of law. There is one exception: the government's power of eminent domain. This is the power to take personal property to benefit the public. One example would be taking private land to build a public road. However, the government must pay the owners a fair price for the property.
CHAPTER 6
The Sixth Amendment protects the rights of a person who has been indicted. Under British rule, colonists were sometimes held in jail for long periods or taken to Britain before being brought to trial. The British government also prevented some accused of crimes from having a jury trial. The Declaration of Independence listed these and other interferences with trials as a reason for rebelling against Britain. The Sixth Amendment guarantees an indicted person a speedy public trial. Public trials ensure that laws are followed by allowing the public to witness the proceedings. Accused people have the right to know the charges against them and can hear and question witnesses who testify against them. Accused people have the right to an attorney. If they cannot pay for one, the government must provide it. Sometimes accused persons refuse their Sixth Amendment rights. For example, some defendants refuse the services of an attorney, while others choose to have a trial in front of a judge alone instead of before a jury. In many cases, defendants can forgo trial and agree to a plea bargain. This means that a defendant pleads guilty to a lesser charge and avoids risking conviction for a crime with a greater sentence.
The Seventh Amendment states that juries can decide civil cases. It is possible to harm another person without committing a crime.
In such cases, the injured party may sue, or seek justice, in a civil court. Civil cases usually involve disputes over money or property. For example, someone might bring a civil suit against a person who refuses to repay a debt.
Amendment V
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.
Amendment VI
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.
Amendment VII
In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.
A judge and jury listen to attorneys and witnesses from each side of a court case to determine a verdict.
citWiship and the constitution 219




Amendment VIII
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.
A
Right to Bail The Eighth Amendment allows for bail. Bail is a set amount of money that defendants promise to pay the court if they fail to appear in court at the proper time.
By posting, or paying, bail, a defendant can avoid staying in jail before and during a trial. If a defendant does not show up in court for trial, the court demands the bail money be paid and issues a warrant for arrest.
The Eighth Amendment keeps courts from setting unfairly high bail. However, in cases of very serious crimes, a judge may refuse to set bail altogether. This can be the case, for example, if the court regards a j defendant as being potentially • dangerous to the public by j being left free. A judge can also deny bail if he or she thinks the defendant will not show up for trial. In such cases the | defendant must remain in jail through the trial.
FOCUS ON
Reading Summarize the Bill of Rights.
"Cruel and Unusual Punishments"
The Eighth Amendment also bans "cruel and unusual punishments" against a person convicted of a crime. For many years, Americans have debated the question of what exactly constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The debate has often centered on the issue of capital punishment. In 1972 the Supreme Court ruled that the way in which most states carried out the death penalty was cruel and unusual. The Court also found that the ways in which many states sentenced people to death were unfair. However, a few years later, the Court ruled that not all executions were in themselves cruel and unusual.
Most states still allow the death penalty. Those that do must follow the Supreme Court's rules. To do so, many states have changed the ways in which they carry out the death penalty.

Summarizing What is the purpose ofthe Eighth Amendment?
Rights of States and Citizens
The final two amendments in the Bill of Rights give a general protection for other rights not addressed by the first eight amendments. These amendments also reserve some governmental powers for the states and the people.
Ninth Amendment
The Ninth Amendment says that the rights listed in the Constitution are not the only rights that citizens have. This amendment has allowed the courts and Congress to decide other basic rights of citizens.
The Constitution does not address the question of education. However, most Americans believe that it is a basic and essential right. This seems especially true in view of the fact that American citizens must be able to vote for the people who represent them in government. "Education is not just another
Amendment IX

consumer item. It is the bedrock [foundation] of our democracy," explained educational leader Mary Hatwood Futrell. Today state governments offer free education from elementary to high school—to all citizens.
Tenth Amendment
The Tenth Amendment recognizes that the states and the people have additional powers. These powers are any ones that the Constitution does not specifically give to Congress—the delegated powers. The Tenth Amendment makes it clear that any powers not either delegated to the federal government or prohibited to the states belong to the states and the people. Thus, the last amendment in the Bill of Rights protects citizens' rights and helps keep the balance of power between the federal and state governments.

CITIZENSHIP AND THE CONSTITUTION 221
On September 17, Constitution Day, Americans celebrate the signing of the United States Constitution in 1787. In Texas, social studies classrooms also observe Celebrate Freedom Week. This important celebration focuses on the meaning and significance of the two foundational documents in United States history—the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.
The Declaration of Independence
One of the most eloquent and influential documents ever written, the Declaration of Independence gave the reasons the American colonies were willing to fight for independence. Thomas Jefferson, the main author of the document, began by explaining the purpose of government. Part of this first section, known as the Preamble, must be recited by Texas students during Celebrate Freedom Week. It is perhaps the most famous statement from the document:
These powerful words established the idea that governments exist to serve their citizens, and that people have basic natural rights that government cannot take away. Throughout our history, these words have inspired Americans to fight for and expand the definitions of freedom, equality, and basic rights. For example, women's rights advocates echoed the language of the Declaration of Independence in 1848 when they demanded the right to vote by declaring that "all men and women are created equal." Abolitionists and civil rights leaders also looked to the Declaration of Independence in their struggles to end slavery and ensure that African Americans were guaranteed equal rights. Even beyond America, the Declaration of Independence has inspired independence and prodemocracy movements around the world. It continues to inspire us today.
Independence Day
Each 4th of July, Americans celebrate the adoption of the Declaration of Independence with parades, fireworks, picnics, fairs, and ceremonies honoring our freedoms and government.
We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.

The U.S. Constitution
Building on the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution established the system of government that is still in effect today. Another truly groundbreaking document, the Constitution established the rule of law and made clear that no one, including the highest government official, is above it. The document's opening words, the Preamble, elegantly state its purpose:
I/Ve the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
—United States Constitution
The three opening words, IVe the People, which were written so much larger than the others, announced dramatically that in the United States the people are the source of all government power and authority.
To protect people's rights and to balance power, the Constitution set up a system that divides power among federal and state governments. Federal power is supreme, and certain powers are shared or reserved for the states. A system of checks and balances further divides power among three equal branches of government—legislative, executive, and judicial.
The Constitution also includes a process by which it can be amended, or changed. It is sometimes referred to as "a living document" for this reason; it can be added to and improved by the people to reflect changes in society. Since it was adopted in 1787, the Constitution has been amended 27 times. These amendments have abolished slavery, guaranteed women and minorities the right to vote and to receive equal treatment under the law, changed voting and election procedures, and made other improvements to our government.
One of the most important parts of the Constitution is the Bill of Rights—the first 10 amendments. The Bill of Rights helps protect the rights described in the Declaration of Independence. For example, the Bill of Rights protects such basic rights as freedom of speech, press, and religion as well as due process rights such as the right to a fair trial. The Bill of Rights was an important early addition to the Constitution because it stated in writing some of the specific individual rights and protections guaranteed for all Americans.

American citizenship involves great privileges and serious responsibilities.
Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship
If YOU were there...
Your older brother and his friends have just turned 18. That means they must register with selective service. But it also means that they are old enough to vote in national elections. You are interested in the upcoming elections and think it would be exciting to have a real voice in politics. But your brother and his friends don't even plan to register to vote.
How would you persuade your brother that voting is important?

Gaining U.S. Citizenship
People become U.S. citizens in several ways. First, anyone born in the United States or a territory it controls is a citizen. People born in a foreign country are U.S. citizens if at least one parent is a U.S. citizen. Foreign-born people whose parents are not citizens must move to the United States to become naturalized citizens. Once in the United States, they go through a long process before applying for citizenship. If they succeed, they become naturalized citizens, giving them most of the rights and responsibilities of other citizens.
In the United States, legal immigrants have many of the rights and responsibilities of citizens but cannot vote or hold public office. The U.S. government can deport, or return to the country of origin, immigrants who break the law.
Legal immigrants over age 18 may request naturalization after living in the United States for five years. All legal immigrants have to
2 CHAPTER 6
support themselves financially. If not, someone must assume financial responsibility for them. Immigrants must be law-abiding and support the U.S. Constitution. They must demonstrate understanding of written and spoken English. They also must show basic knowledge of U.S. history and government.
When this is done, candidates take an oath of allegiance to the United States. They then get certificates of naturalization.
Only two differences between naturalized and native-born citizens exist. Naturalized citizens can lose their citizenship, and they cannot become president or vice president. Many famous Americans have been naturalized citizens, including German Jewish scientist Albert Einstein and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, originally from Czechoslovakia.

Drawing Conclusions
Why does U.S. law have such demanding requirements for people to become naturalized citizens?
Responsibilities of
Citizenship
For a representative democracy to work, Americans need to fulfill their civic duties. "The stakes ... are too high for government to be a spectator sport," former Texas congresswoman Barbara Jordan once said.
Civic Duties
Citizens elect officials to make laws for them. In turn, citizens must obey those laws and respect the authorities who enforce them. Obeying rules and laws includes knowing them and staying informed about any changes. Ignorance of a law will not prevent a person from being punished for breaking it.
Another duty is paying taxes for services such as public roads, police, and public schools. People pay sales taxes, property taxes, and tariffs. Many Americans also pay a tax on their income to the federal, and sometimes state, government.
Becoming a Citizen
For many people around the world, becoming a citizen ofthe United States is a lifelong dream. The highlight ofthe naturalization process is the ceremony where candidates promise to "support and defend the Constitution and laws ofthe United States of America."
Citizens have the duty to defend the nation. Men 18 years or older must register with selective service. In the event of a draft, or required military service, those able to fight are already registered. Although women do not register, many serve in the armed forces.
Americans have the right to a trial by jury under the Sixth Amendment. To protect this right, citizens should be willing to serve on a jury when they are called. Otherwise, fulfilling each person's Sixth Amendment rights would be difficult.
CITIZENSHIP AND THE CONSTITUTION 223
Responsibilities of Citizens
For representative democracy to work, citizens must do their part. Each activity pictured here serves an important role in the community.
Military Service
Civic Responsibilities
In addition to duties, which are required by law, citizens also have responsibilities to fulfill. These are not required by law, but are necessary for American democracy to work. Civic responsibilities are often considered to be an important part of the character of the country itself.
The most important of these responsibilities is voting. Voting is also one of our most important rights, because it shapes government policies. If citizens do not vote, they are not taking part in choosing who represents them in government. Elected representatives respond to the opinions of the voters who elect them. If only a small portion of constituents vote, the policies of the representative may not reflect the true opinion of the majority of people he or she represents.
To make the best choices in voting, people have a responsibility to stay informed on public issues and candidates. Information is available from many sources: the Internet, newspapers, television, other media, and from attending public meetings or listening to speeches. However, voters should also be aware that some material may be deliberately biased to support or discredit a particular viewpoint. Comparing many sources of information and opinions can help voters
make the decision that best represents what they want the government to do.
Society benefits when people fulfill their personal responsibilities, because it means that people take responsibility for the consequences of their behavior, whether good or bad. These responsibilities are different for everyone, but might include supporting one's family, attending school, working at a job, or caring for a pet. When people fulfill their personal responsibilities, it puts less strain on the resources of other people and the government.
The responsibilities of U.S. citizens are some of the most basic aspects of the national identity. The United States was founded on the principles of democracy and the idea that each citizen should have a voice in the nation's government. Some other nations have used these ideas as a template for their own democracies, so that the U.S. today is known for its citizens' responsibility and right to vote. Keeping informed about issues is also part of the national identity. Following poll and election results, for example, is a common activity for many Americans.

First Amendment Rights
Many of the rights enjoyed by U.S. citizens are specifically protected by the Constitution. As you have read, the 27 amendments are especially important tools to protect these rights. Many of the amendments protect voting rights and the rights of people accused of crimes. The rights protected by the first 10 amendments, or the Bill of Rights, were so important to the founders that they were included before the government went into effect.
The rights protected by the First Amendment are considered by many people to be the most fundamental to the identity of the nation. The First Amendment reads:
^Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
This amendment prevents the government from making policies that support one religion over another. It also allows people to practice any religion they want or no religion at all. The freedom of religion has shaped the American way of life since colonial times. Several colonies were founded to protect
religious freedom. The freedom of religion has led to the existence of a wide variety of kinds of worship in the United States. Having many choices for religious worship is one part of the American national identity.
The right to free speech and a free press allow citizens to express their viewpoints, even if they are critical of the government or elected officials. These rights are necessary for a constitutional republic because citizens need to be informed about the government, elected officials, policies, and issues so that people can hear important facts and opinions when making voting decisions. They are also valuable for sharing new information and stories that can educate, entertain, or promote invention.
The final two rights mentioned in the First Amendment, the right to assemble and the right to petition the government, are directly related to British policies toward the colonies. British authorities tried to stop the revolutionary movement by arresting people who gathered to discuss the issues. They also ignored petitions for change by claiming the colonists were not following the correct rules in asking for different laws.

Citizens and Government
Even after an election, people can influence officials. Political participation is part of our nation's identity and tradition. When colonists protested British rule in the 1700s, they formed committees and presented their views to political leaders.
Influencing Government
As the new American nation grew, so did political participation. French diplomat Alexis de Tocqueville visited the United States in 1831 to study American democracy. He was amazed at the large number of political groups Americans participated in. He wrote about them:
^What political power could ever carry on the vast multitude [large number] of lesser undertakings which the American citizens perform every day, with the assistance ofthe principle of association [joining a group]? Nothing, in my opinion, is more deserving of our attention than the intellectual and moral associations of America/'
—Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America
U.S. citizens sometimes work with interest groups. These groups of people share a common interest that motivates them to take political action. Interest groups organize speeches and rallies to support their cause. However, citizens need not join a group to influence government. They can write letters to leaders of government or attend city council meetings. Active political participation is an important duty for U.S. citizens and immigrants alike.
In addition to voting, many Americans choose to campaign for candidates or issues. Anyone can help campaign, even if he or she is not eligible to vote. Many people also help campaigns by giving money directly or through political action committees (PACs), groups that collect money for candidates who support certain issues.
Helping the Community
Commitment to others moves many Americans to volunteer in community service groups. Some small communities rely on volunteers for services such as fire protection and law enforcement. The American Red Cross helps citizens in times of natural disasters or other
emergencies. The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts plan many projects such as planting trees to improve the environment. Even simple acts such as picking up trash in parks or serving food in shelters help a community.

Understanding Historical Interpretation
Define the Skill
Historical interpretations are ways of explaining the past. They are based on what is known about the people, ideas, and actions that make up history. Two historians can look at the same set of facts about a person or event of the past and see things in different ways. Their explanations of the person or event, and the conclusions they reach, can be very different. The ability to recognize, understand, and evaluate historical interpretations is a valuable skill in the study of history.
Learn the Skill
When people study the past, they decide which facts are the most important in explaining why something happened. One person may believe certain facts to be important, while other people may believe other facts are more important. Therefore, their explanation of the topic, and the conclusions they draw about it, may not be the same. In addition, if new facts are uncovered about the topic, still more interpretations of it may result.
Asking the following questions will help you to understand and evaluate historical interpretations.
1.	What is the main idea in the way the topic is explained? What conclusions are reached? Be aware that these may not be directly stated but only hinted at in the information provided.
2.	On what facts has the writer or speaker relied? Do these facts seem to support his or her explanation and conclusions?
3.	Is there important information about the topic that the writer or speaker has dismissed
or ignored? If so, you should suspect that the interpretation may be inaccurate or deliberately slanted to prove a particular point of view.
Just because interpretations differ, one is not necessarily "right" and others "wrong." As long as a person considers all the evidence and draws conclusions based on a fair evaluation of that evidence, his or her interpretation is probably acceptable.
Remember, however, that trained historians let the facts lead them to conclusions. People who start with a conclusion, select only facts that support it, and ignore opposing evidence produce interpretations that have little value for understanding history.
[ Practice the Skill
Historians have different views on which documents and ideas were most influential on the framers of the Constitution. Some believe that Enlightenment writers provided the strongest reason for writing the Constitution, while others think that the practice of self-government in the colonies influenced the writing of the Constitution the most.
Review the documents and ideas that influenced the framing of the Constitution. Then answer the following questions.
1.	Which facts in the textbook support each viewpoint? Are there any that support both?
2.	Which view do you think is more convincing?
Explain why.
3.	Which viewpoint do you think the framers would have agreed with? Explain why you think this. Include facts to support your opinion.

the establishment of two parties to elect the president, and Jefferson's struggles with both Washington and Hamilton. Throughout the chapter, you will see that disagreement often defined these early days.
Drawing Inferences about History
FOCUS on Reading What's the difference between a good guess and a weak guess? A good guess is an educated guess. In other words, the guess is based on some knowledge or information. That's what an inference is, an educated guess.
Drawing Inferences About What You Read To draw an inference, combine information from your reading with what you already know and make an educated guess about what it all means. Once you have made several inferences, you may be able to draw a conclusion that ties them all together.
i Question What kind of person was Alexander Hamilton?
Inside the Text
•	Hamilton ran a company when he was just a teenager.
•	He had a career as a lawyer.
•	He became the secretary of the treasury under Washington.
Outside the Text
•	Running a company takes intelligence and cleverness.
•	Becoming a lawyer takes dedication.
•	Washington probably wanted someone clever and capable.

Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.
Economic Differences
...Hamilton wanted new forms of economic growth. He wanted to promote manufacturing and business. He even suggested that the government award a prize to companies that made excellent products.
In addition, Hamilton wanted to pass higher tariffs. Known as protective tariffs, these taxes would raise the prices of foreign products. Hamilton hoped this would cause Americans to buy U.S. goods. As a result, American manufacturing would be protected from foreign competition.
Jefferson worried about depending too much on business and manufacturing. He believed that farmers were the most independent voters....
Jefferson wanted to help farmers by keeping the costs of the goods they bought low. Lower tariffs would help keep prices low.

Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on why and how George Washington was chosen as first president.
The First President
Americans believed in George Washington. They saw him as an honest, intelligent, and steady leader. He was a hero of the Revolution and was known for his ability to motivate and administer the army. Many believed he should be the first U.S. president. Washington had been looking forward to retirement and a quiet life on his Virginia farm. When he hesitated to become a candidate for the presidency, his friends convinced him to run. Fellow politician Gou-vemeur Morris told him, "Should the idea prevail [win] that you would not accept the presidency, it should prove fatal... to the new government." Morris concluded confidently, "Of all men, you are the best fitted to fill that office."
In January 1789 each of the 11 states that had passed the Constitution sent electors to choose the first president. The group was the electoral college—a body of electors who represent the people's vote in choosing the president. The electoral college selected Washington unanimously, and John Adams became his vice president.

Leaders of the New Nation
Hard work lay ahead for members of the new government. The new federal government had to create policies and procedures that would determine the future of the country.
The Founding Fathers
Many leaders who had been involved in the Revolution, the creation of the Articles of Confederation, and the framing of the Constitution continued to be leaders after the adoption of the Constitution. There were more than 100 men who might be called founding fathers for their work in founding the nation. Delegates to conventions and members of early state governments all worked together and brought ideas for the creation of the new system of government. These men expressed the civic virtue of representing the good of the whole nation, even those people they disagreed with.
Seven men stand out from the rest for their wide-ranging contributions to the nation. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were known for their leadership in authoring the Declaration of Independence and Constitution respectively. John Adams, Alexander
Hamilton, and John Jay were known for their strong support of the new Constitution. Benjamin Franklin was older than many of the others, and was respected for his wise ideas on the organization and purpose of the Revolution. George Washington led the American forces during the Revolutionary War and then led the nation during its first years. Several of these men acted as ambassadors to European nations, and several became president. Each of them contributed their time, intelligence, and leadership to help found the nation.
Women's Contributions
Washington's wife, First Lady Martha Washington, entertained guests and attended social events with her husband. She described the scene to her niece: "I have not had one half-hour to myself since the day of my arrival." She ran the presidential household with style.
Other women of the time period, such as author Judith Sargent Murray, believed that women needed to play a greater role in the new nation than Martha Washington did. Murray, Abigail Adams, and others believed in Republican Motherhood, the idea that women played an important role in teaching their children to be good citizens.

LAUNCHING THE NATION 235
Some Americans lived in growing cities like New York, shown above. However, the new republic was overwhelm* ingly rural. Most Americans lived and worked on farms.
Why might rural Americans and urban Americans want different things from their new government?
A
Rural Nation Some promoters of Republican Motherhood did not expect women to participate in politics or business. Other people, however, hoped that Republican Motherhood would lead to greater opportunities for women. They hoped more women would receive an education. Only a few families were willing to provide much education for their daughters, and adult women rarely had the time or money to get an education later in life. Most women in the early republic faced long days managing their households and working hard inside or outside the home to support their families.

Organizing the Government
As President Washington noted in a letter to James Madison, "The first of everything in our situation will serve to establish a precedent." A precedent is an action or decision that later serves as an example.
The First Congress created departments in the executive branch for different areas of national policy. Washington met with the department heads, or cabinet members, who advised him.
Today we know that presidents have cabinet meetings with their top advisers. This practice started during Washington's presidency and was common by 1792.
> CHAPTER 7
For two of his most important cabinet positions, Washington chose carefully. He picked Alexander Hamilton as secretary of the treasury and Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state. Henry Knox served as secretary of war, and Samuel Osgood was chosen as postmaster general. Hamilton was a gifted economic planner, and Jefferson had served as ambassador to France. Knox had helped Washington run the Continental Army, and Osgood had government experience.
To set up the federal court system and the courts' location, Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789. This act created three levels of federal courts and defined their powers and relationship to the state courts. It set up federal district courts and circuit courts of appeals. The president nominated candidates for federal judgeships. Those candidates then had to be approved or rejected by the Senate. Washington wrote about the importance of these duties:
"l have always been persuaded that the stability and success of the national government... would depend in a considerable degree on the interpretation and execution of its laws. In my opinion, therefore, it is important that the judiciary system should not only be independent in its operations, but as perfect as possible in its formation/'
—George Washington, quoted in The Real George Washington, edited by Parry et al.
The basic parts of the federal government were now in place. Leaders began to face the challenges of the new nation. Hard work lay ahead.

Finding Main Ideas
What two important precedents were established for the federal government?
Expectations for the Nation
In 1790 the United States was home to almost 4 million people. Most Americans lived in the countryside and worked on farms. They wanted fair tax laws and the right to settle western lands. Other Americans worked in towns as craftspeople, laborers, or merchants.
Many merchants wanted simpler trade laws, but manufacturers wanted tariffs to protect them from foreign competitors.
Americans had high expectations for their new nation. They hoped the government would improve trade and keep the economy stable. During this period the economic system of free enterprise expanded. Most business owners and merchants wanted the government to make few regulations on business practices, protect the rights of property owners, and keep taxes low. They believed such government policies would encourage businesses to expand production and trade.
Most cities were small. Only New York City and Philadelphia had populations larger than 25,000. New York City was the first capital of the United States, and it represented the spirit of the new nation. Although badly damaged during the Revolution, the city had already begun to recover. Citizens got rid of many signs of British rule.
New York City had a bustling economy. International trade and business became more active. A French visitor to New York City noted the city's energy.
^Everything in the city is in motion; everywhere the shops resound [ring out] with the noise of workers... one sees vessels arriving from every partoftheworld/,

I problems were economic. The national and state governments had I run up huge debts during the war. Butthe proposed solutions to these • problems revealed differences in regional viewpoints. Southern planters !
and northern businesspeople had very different ideas about how the j national economy should develop.
Settling the Debt
Alexander Hamilton seemed born with a head for economics. While still in his teens, he helped run a shipping company in his native British West Indies. Family friends then sent him to the American colonies for an education. Hamilton eventually married into a wealthy New York family and began practicing law. He served as Washington's aide and as a delegate to four Continental Congresses.
National Debt
As secretary of the treasury, Hamilton's biggest challenge was paying off the national debt—money owed by the United States— from the Revolutionary War. The United States owed about $11.7 million to foreign countries and about $40.4 million to U.S. citizens. During the war the government raised money with bonds. Bonds are certificates of debt that carry a promise to buy back the bonds at a higher price. The new government could not afford to keep this promise. Bondholders who needed money sold

• Create a national bank
would free up state money for business and trade
their bonds for less than the original value to speculators, or people who buy items at low prices in the hope that the value will rise and they can sell the items for a profit.
Hamilton wanted to pay the foreign debt immediately and gradually repay the total value of all bonds. The second part of his plan caused disagreements because paying full value would allow speculators to make a profit. Hamilton thought this was fair. He said, "He [the speculator] paid what the commodity [bond] was worth... and took the risks."
Thomas Jefferson disagreed. He thought the idea cheated bondholders who had sold their bonds at low prices. Jefferson wrote, "Immense sums were thus filched [stolen] from the poor and ignorant." But more politicians agreed with Hamilton. In 1790 the government exchanged old bonds for new, more reliable ones that were guaranteed.
States' Debts
The states owed $25 million for Revolutionary War expenses. Hamilton wanted the federal government to pay for $21.5 million of this debt. Hamilton believed that this action would help the federal government. He
thought that paying the states' debts would help the national economy. Debtor states would not have to spend so much on repayment and would have money to develop business and trade. Increased business and trade would put more money back into the national economy.
The South, however, did not want to help the federal government pay the debts of other states. States such as Virginia and North Carolina did not have many war debts. They thought Hamilton's idea was unfair. Patrick Henry said he did not believe that the Constitution gave Congress the power to pay state debts. Hamilton knew that he needed the help of southern representatives to get his plan approved.
Moving the Capital
Hamilton also knew that he had something to bargain with. Southern officials wanted to change the location of the nation's capital. Many southerners thought that having the capital in New York gave the northern states too much influence over national policy. Hamilton, Jefferson, and James Madison met in June 1790. Hamilton

promised to convince northern members of Congress to move the capital. Jefferson and Madison then agreed to gather support in the South for Hamilton's debt plan.
The compromise worked. The national capital was moved to Philadelphia in 1791 for 10 years. For the capital's permanent location, Washington chose a place on the Potomac" River that included part of both Maryland and Virginia. The land was made up of swamps and farms. This site would eventually become the city of Washington, D.C.

Hamilton and Jefferson did not cooperate for long. Instead, they began to disagree about how to define the authority of the central government. Hamilton believed in a strong federal government. Jefferson wanted to protect the powers of the states. Their conflict reflected basic differences in their opinions about democracy. Hamilton had little faith in the average individual. He once said that "the people . . . seldom judge or determine [decide] right."
Differing Views
Hamilton wanted a strong central government that balanced power between the "mass of the people" and wealthier citizens. He believed that his approach would protect everyone's liberties while keeping the people from having too much power.
Jefferson disagreed strongly with Hamilton's views of the average citizen's ability to make decisions for the country. He admitted that "the people can not be all, and always, well informed." However, Jefferson believed that it was the right of the people to rule the country.

In addition, Hamilton wanted to pass higher tariffs. Known as protective tariffs, these taxes would raise the prices of foreign products. Hamilton hoped this would cause Americans to buy U.S. goods. As a result, American manufacturing would be protected from foreign competition.
Jefferson worried about depending too much on business and manufacturing. He believed that farmers were the most independent voters. They did not depend on other people's work to make a living.
Jefferson wrote, "Our governments will remain virtuous [pure] for many centuries; as long as they are chiefly agricultural." Jefferson wanted to help farmers by keeping the costs of the goods they bought low. Lower tariffs would help keep prices low.

National Bank Hamilton's and Jefferson's differences became more and more public in early 1791. The two men had very different opinions about how the government should approach its economic problems.
Hamilton's Plan for a National Bank
Hamilton wanted to start a national bank where the government could safely deposit its money. The bank would also make loans to the government and businesses. Hamilton "also thought that the United States should build a national mint, a place to make coins. Then the country could begin issuing its own money.
Hamilton knew that people who wanted to protect states' rights might have a strong reaction to the idea of a national bank, so he suggested limiting it to a 20-year charter. After that time Congress could decide whether to extend the charter. Hamilton also asked each state to start its own bank so the national bank would not have a monopoly.

Beginning in 2008 the U.S. Mint has tried to increase the use of $1.00 coins for several reasons, including the ability to recycle the metal used to make them.
LAUNCHING THE NATION 241
Jefferson Opposes the Bank
Both Jefferson and Madison believed that Hamilton's plans for the economy gave too much power to the federal government. They also thought the U.S. Constitution did not give Congress the power to create a bank. But Hamilton quoted the elastic clause, which states that Congress can "make all laws which shall be necessary and proper" to govern the nation.
Hamilton declared that the clause allowed the government to create a national bank. Hamilton believed in loose construction of the Constitution. Loose construction means that the federal government can take reasonable actions that the Constitution does not specifically forbid.
Jefferson thought that the elastic clause should be used only in special cases. He wrote to President Washington, "The Constitution allows only the means which are 'necessary,' not those which are merely 'convenient.'" Jefferson believed in strict construction of
the Constitution. People who favor strict construction think that the federal government should do only what the Constitution specifically says it can do.
President Washington and Congress agreed with Hamilton. They hoped a bank would offer stability for the U.S. economy. In February 1791 Congress enacted the charter for the Bank of the United States—the country's first national bank. The bank played an important role in making the U.S. economy more stable.

Tensions between France and Britain began to build after the French people rebelled against their king. On July 14,1789, citizens of Paris attacked and captured the Bastille, a hated fortress and prison that stood as a mighty symbol of royal power.
The storming of the Bastille was one of the first acts of the French Revolution—a rebellion of French people against their king in 1789. The French people overthrew their king and created a republican government.

Vocabulary
neutral
unbiased, not favoring either side in a conflict
Many French citizens had been inspired to take action by the American Revolution. Many Americans, in turn, supported the French Revolution. They thought that France was creating the same kind of democracy as the United States.
Some Americans worried about the French Revolution's violent riots and attacks on traditional authority. Revolutionaries shocked many Americans by beheading King Louis XVI in January 1793 and Queen Marie-Antoinette later that year.
A few years after the French Revolution started, France and Great Britain went to war. Some Americans supported the French, while others backed the British. Some wanted to remain neutral.
The Neutrality Proclamation
The debate divided Congress and Washington's cabinet. Washington presented his opinion to Congress on April 22,1793:
^The duty and interest of the United States require that they should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial [unbiased] towards the belligerent [fighting] powers.
—George Washington, quoted in The Real George Washington by Parry et al.
This Neutrality Proclamation stated that the United States would not take sides with any European countries that were at war. Washington believed his plan was the safest for the long run, but not everyone agreed.
Some members of Congress criticized Washington's ideas. James Madison believed that the president had gone beyond his authority. He questioned Washington's right to issue the proclamation without the approval of Congress.
The French Question
France's new representative to the United States, Edmond Genet (zhuh-NAY), asked American sailors to help France fight England by commanding privateers. Privateers were private ships hired by a country to attack its enemies. Washington told Genet that using American privateers violated U.S. neutrality. Jefferson wanted the French revolutionaries to succeed, but even he agreed that allowing France to use American privateers against England was a bad idea.
Jefferson was still upset by U.S. policy toward France. He believed that the United States should back France because France had supported the United States during the Revolutionary War. Hamilton, on the other hand, was pro-British. He hoped to strengthen trading ties with Britain—the most powerful trading nation in the world at the time. Jefferson thought that Hamilton had too much influence on the president's foreign policy and that Hamilton consequently interfered with Jefferson's role as secretary of state. Jefferson decided to resign from Washington's cabinet in 1793.
Time Line
The Struggle for Neutrality
April 1789 George Washington becomes president.
April 1793 President Washington I issues the Neutrality Proclamation.
Jay's Treaty
There were other threats to U.S. neutrality. In late 1793 the British seized ships carrying food to the French West Indies. Hundreds of the ships were neutral American merchant ships. Also, British officers were helping Native Americans fight settlers.
Washington wanted to prevent another war with the British. He sent Chief Justice John Jay to London to work out a compromise. The British knew the United States lacked a strong navy and that U.S. businesses relied heavily on British trade. However, the British did not want to fight another war in America.
In November 1794 the two sides signed Jay's Treaty. Jay's Treaty settled the disputes that had arisen between the United States and Great Britain in the early 1790s. The British would pay damages on seized American ships and abandon their forts on the northwestern frontier. The United States agreed to pay debts it owed the British.
The treaty was unpopular and sparked violent protests. Citizens and congressional leaders thought the treaty hurt trade and did not punish Britain enough for some of its actions. Southerners were especially angry that the treaty did not ask Britain to repay them for slaves that Britain had set free during the Revolutionary War. Washington did not like the treaty but believed it was the most that could be done. At his urging the Senate approved the treaty.
Pinckney's Treaty
American businesses faced problems as well. The Spanish disputed the border between the United States and Florida. Spain closed the port of New Orleans to U.S. trade in 1784. This hurt the American economy because all goods moving down the Mississippi to places in the East or overseas had to pass through New Orleans.
Washington asked Ambassador Thomas Pinckney to meet with Spanish officials to discuss the problem. He asked the Spaniards to reopen New Orleans to U.S. trade. Pinckney also asked for the right of deposit in New Orleans. This right would allow American boats to transfer goods in New Orleans without paying cargo fees.
Spanish minister Manuel de Godoy (goh-thoy) tried to delay reaching an agreement, hoping Pinckney would become desperate and sign a treaty that favored the Spanish. He was worried that the United States and Great Britain might join against Spain after signing Jay's Treaty. Pinckney was patient, however, and his patience was rewarded.
In October 1795, Godoy agreed to Pinckney's Treaty, which settled the border and trade disputes with Spain. Under the treaty Spain agreed to recognize the U.S. southern boundary as 31°N latitude. Spain's government also reopened the port at

Summarizing Why did
President Washington want the United States to remain neutral?
Conflict in the Northwest Territory
As the United States dealt with international conflicts, trouble was also brewing at home. Americans continued to settle the Northwest Territory despite Native Americans' protests. Supplied by British traders with guns, Native Americans went to war. In 1790 a Native American alliance under the command of Miami chief Little Turtle defeated U.S. forces under General Josiah Harmar. Then in 1791, Native Americans defeated General Arthur St. Clair's troops.
General Wayne Takes Command
In 1792 President Washington gave command of the army in the West to General Anthony Wayne. Wayne's task was to bring troops to the frontier to fight against the Indians. In 1793 General Wayne arrived in Ohio. Many of his men were ill from smallpox and influenza, so they were unable to fight well.
Wayne's troops moved north and built Fort Greenville, where they remained during the winter. They built additional forts for protection and to have supplies at hand.
As the summer of 1794 neared, several Native American groups led by Little Turtle attacked a supply train near the fort. Wayne and his men responded. They attacked Native American towns and burned crops.
The British no longer aided the Native Americans after this defeat, and Little Turtle realized that he was outmatched. He urged his people to seek peace.
16 CHAPTER 7
The trail has been long and bloody; it has no end. The [whites]... are many. They are like the leaves of the trees. When the frost comes they fall and are blown away. But when the sunshine comes again they come back more plentiful than ever before/^
—Little Turtle, quoted in The Ohio Frontier by Douglas Hurt
The End of Conflict
On August 20,1794, Native Americans fought Wayne's troops in the Battle of Fallen Timbers and were defeated. The battle was named for an area where many trees had been destroyed by a tornado. Wayne’s forces burned Indians' villages and fields. The strength of Indian forces in the region was broken.
The frontier war soon ended. In August 1795, Native American leaders signed the Treaty of Greenville, which gave the United States claim to most Indian lands in the Northwest Territory. The treaty also guaranteed the safety of citizens there. In exchange, Native Americans received $20,000 worth of goods and an acknowledgment of their claim to the lands they still held.

conflicts did the United States face in the late 1700s?
The Whiskey Rebellion
Other conflicts occurred on the frontier. Congress passed a tax on American-made whiskey in March 1791. The tax was part of Hamilton's plan to raise money to help pay the federal debt. He was also testing the power of the federal government to control the states' actions.
Reaction in the West
People in areas such as western Pennsylvania were bitter about the tax. They were already angry with the federal government, which they believed did not protect settlers from Native American attacks and did not allow settlers enough opportunities for trade. The farmers' com crops were often made into whiskey, which was easier to transport than

the com. Because cash was rare, whiskey became like money in their region. The farmers believed that the tax was aimed specifically at them.
Farmers who produced small amounts of whiskey for trade argued that they could not afford the tax. They believed they should be able to keep the money they had made from a product they created themselves. Protests in 1792 led President Washington to issue a proclamation saying that people had to obey the law.
Westerners also disliked the fact that cases about the law were to be tried in a district court. These courts were usually far away from the people they affected and were a great inconvenience to them.
Whiskey Rebellion Is Crushed
The complaints of western Pennsylvanians were at first expressed peacefully. But by 1794 fighting had broken out. In what became known as the Whiskey Rebellion, farmers lashed out against the tax on whiskey. Protesters refused to pay the tax. They even tarred and feathered tax collectors. Some called themselves the new Sons of Liberty.
Incidents of violence spread to other states. President Washington feared that the rebels threatened the federal government's authority. He believed he needed to make people understand that the Constitution gave Congress the right to pass and enforce the tax.
Washington declared that he could "no longer remain a passive [inactive] spectator" in the event. He personally led the army in military action against the rebellion—the first and only time an American president has done so. The army of about 13,000 men approached western Pennsylvania in November 1794. By this time most of the rebels had fled. The Whiskey Rebellion ended without a battle.
Supporting a Point of View
Defend the viewpoint of the Pennsylvania farmers who did not want to pay the whiskey tax.

Washington's Farewell Address
On September 19,1796, President George Washington's Farewell Address first I appeared in a Philadelphia newspaper. In it, Washington wrote about the nation's > economy, political parties, and foreign policy.
While, then, every part of our country ... feels an immediate and particular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to find in the united mass ..
• 9reater strength, greater resource, proportionally greater security from external
danger, [and] a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations;...	\
I have already intimated1 to you the danger of [political] parties in the state, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations2. Let me now take a more comprehensive3 view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful4 effects of the spirit of party, generally.	V
If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification5 of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment...
Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion6 of knowledge ... As the structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened ... y
[Avoid] likewise the accumulation of debt,... not ungenerously throwing upon > posterity7 the burden, which we ourselves ought to bear...
Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate8 peace and harmony with all...
The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is... to have with them as little political connection as possible.
Washington lists the benefits of uniting the states under one government.
It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world ... There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate9 upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion, which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.
In this phrase,
Washington emphasizes his warning against the dangers of political parties.
Washington points out the need for education.
This is Washington's advice to the new nation about foreign policy.
The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred ... from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every nation ... to maintain inviolate10 the relations of peace and amity11 towards other nations.

Washington Says Farewell
In 1796 Washington decided not to run for a third presidential term. He wrote that he was "tired of public life" and "devoutly [strongly] wished for retirement." He also wanted to remind Americans that the people were the country's true leaders.
With the help of Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, Washington wrote his Farewell Address. In it he spoke about what he believed were the greatest dangers to the American republic. Among these were the dangers of foreign ties and political conflicts at home. Washington warned against forming permanent ties with other countries because choosing sides could draw the United States into war. The nation would try to follow a course of non-involvement for another century, but some involvement with other governments seemed unavoidable.
He also worried about growing political conflicts within the nation. Washington believed that disagreements between political
groups weakened government. Political unity, he said, was a key to national success. Washington left office warning the nation to work out its differences and protect its independence. Washington also warned against too much public debt. He thought the government should try not to borrow money. He wanted future generations to be protected from debt.
He concluded his speech by looking forward to his retirement and praising his country. "I anticipate . . . the sweet enjoyment ... of good laws under a free government, the ever favorite object of my heart."

You are a newspaper editor in Virginia in 1798. You've joined Jefferson's political party, which opposes the new president. In fact, your paper has printed many articles that criticize him, calling him greedy and foolish. You believe that's your right in a free country.
But now Congress has passed a law that makes it illegal to criticize the government. You could be arrested for your articles!
Would you stop criticizing the government? Why?
The development of political parties in the United States contributed to differing ideas about the role of the federal government.

People within the new United States had differing viewpoints on many issues. Personal rivalries among political leaders also created divisions in the new nation. Trying to limit dissent in the country, the federal government passed several unpopular laws. hmhsocialstudies.com
I TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the two political parties that emerged during the election of 1796, their views of government, their candidates, and the outcome of the election.
The Election of 1796
The election of 1796 began a new era in U.S. politics. For the first time, more than one candidate ran for president. Political parties, groups that help elect people and shape policies, had begun to form during Washington's presidency. Despite Washington's warnings about political parties, the rivalry between two parties dominated the 1796 election.
Alexander Hamilton helped found the Federalist Party, which wanted a strong federal government and supported industry and trade. The Federalists chose John Adams and Thomas Pinckney as candidates. Adams knew he was not well liked in the South or the West, but he hoped people would support him after they thought about his years of loyal public service.
Thomas Jefferson and James Madison founded the Democratic-Republican Party. Its members, called Republicans, wanted to limit the federal government's power. (This party is not related to today's Republican Party.) They chose Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr as their candidates.

Party differences were based partly on where and how people lived. Businesspeople in the cities tended to support the Federalists. Farmers in more isolated areas generally favored the Democratic-Republicans. Both sides attacked each other. Republicans called Adams a royalist—an insult to a man so involved in the Revolution. The Federalists accused the Republicans of favoring the French.
In the end, Adams defeated Jefferson. At the time, the person who came in second in a presidential election became vice president. So, after months of campaigning against one another, Adams and Jefferson took office together.

President Adams and the XYZ Affair
John Adams had the challenging task of following Washington as president. The people had adored Washington. Adams would have to work hard to win the people's trust.
A
New President At first glance, John Adams did not appear well suited for the presidency. Although Adams had been a leading Patriot during the American Revolution and had later served as a foreign diplomat, he lacked Washington's dignity, and most people saw him as a cold and distant person. Still, many people—even those who opposed him— respected Adams. They recognized his hard work, honesty, and intelligence.

The XYZ Affair
After the XYZ affair, French ships continued to attack American merchant ships. In this cartoon, the United States is represented by the woman. The men, symbolizing the French, are taking valuables from her. The people in the distance are other European nations.
Why do you think this man is encouraging the woman to look awav?
ANALYSIS
SKILL! INTERPRETING POLITICAL CARTOONS
How does the cartoon show that America is being preyed upon by the French?
The French government also wanted a loan of $12 million. The amazed diplomats refused these demands.
In March 1798 President Adams told Congress that the peace-seeking mission had failed. He described the French terms, substituting the letters X, Y, and Z for the names of the French agents. Upon hearing the disgraceful news, Federalists in Congress called for war with France.
The XYZ affair, as the French demand for a bribe came to be called, outraged the American public. "Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute!" became the rallying cry of the American people.
Preparations for War
Fearing war, Adams asked Congress to expand the navy to a fleet of more than 30 ships. He thought war with France might be unavoidable. He also decided the United States should keep a peacetime army. Congress approved both measures.
Although Adams had asked Congress for military support, he did not want to go to war with France. He was worried about its cost. And he remembered Washington's warning to remain neutral. So he did not ask Congress to declare war. Instead, he tried to reopen peace talks with France.
The United States and France
One of Adams's first goals as president was to improve the relationship between the United States and France. You may remember that the French had once tried to hire American privateers to help them fight Great Britain, a practice Washington frowned upon. Adams sent U.S. diplomats to Paris to smooth over the conflict and to negotiate a treaty to protect U.S. shipping.
When the diplomats arrived in France, they learned that French foreign minister Talleyrand would not speak to them. Instead, they had a strange and secret visit from three French agents. Shockingly, the agents said that Talleyrand would discuss a treaty only in exchange for a $250,000 bribe.
Peace Efforts
Adams's decision not to declare war stunned Federalists. Despite intense pressure from members of his own party, Adams refused to change his mind.
American and French ships, however, began fighting each other in the Caribbean. Adams sent a representative to France to engage in talks to try to end the fighting. The United States and France eventually signed a treaty. Adams then forced two members of his cabinet to resign for trying to block his peace efforts.

CHAPTER 7
The Alien and Sedition Acts
Many Democratic-Republicans continued to sympathize with France. Federalists, angered by their stand, called them "democrats, mob-ocrats, and all other kinds of rats."
In 1798 the Federalist-controlled Congress passed four laws known together as the Alien and Sedition Acts. These laws were said to protect the United States, but the Federalists intended them to crush opposition to war. The most controversial was the Sedition Act, which forbade anyone from publishing or voicing criticism of the federal government. In effect, this cancelled basic protections of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
The two main Democratic-Republican leaders, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, viewed these acts as a misuse of the government's power. Attacking the problem at the state level, they wrote resolutions passed by the Kentucky legislature in 1798 and in Virginia in 1799. Known as the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, these documents
argued that the Alien and Sedition Acts were unconstitutional. They stated that the federal government could not pass these acts because they interfered with state government. Madison and Jefferson pressured Congress to repeal the Alien and Sedition Acts. Congress did not, although it allowed the acts to expire within a few years.
The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions did not have the force of national law, but they supported the idea that states could challenge the federal government. This idea would grow to have a tremendous impact on American history later in the 1800s.

Civic
Participation
Making Group Decisions
Define the Skill
Democracy is one of the most valued principles of American society. It is based on the idea that the members of society, or representatives they choose, make the decisions that affect society. Decisionmaking would be much more efficient if just one person decided what to do and how to do it. However, that method is not at all democratic.
Making decisions as a group is a complicated and difficult skill. However, it is an important one at all levels of society—from governing the nation to making group decisions at school, in the community, and with your friends. At every level, the skill is based on the ability of the group's members to interact in effective and cooperative ways.
Learn the Skill
Think about the job the first Congress faced after the Constitution was ratified. The nation was still millions of dollars in debt from the Revolutionary War. Congress had to find a way to pay these debts as well as raise money to run the government. They had to work together to find the best plan for the nation.
Like that first Congress, being part of an effective group requires that you behave in certain ways.
1.	Identify the situation. Decide as a group what situation or problem the decision needs to address.
2.	Gather information. Each person in the group should gather information to develop his or her idea about what the best decision might be.
3.	Identify options and predict outcomes.
Members of the group should contribute opinions and ideas for what the decision should be. Part of supporting your decision should be a description of what the outcome of your decision would be, and why it would benefit the group as a whole.
4.	Discuss and compromise. After everyone has contributed his or her opinions and thoughts on the decisions, the group should work together to discuss the best option. The final decision might include parts of several people's ideas.
5.	Implement the decision. Each member of the group should act according to the decision. This might be as simple as going to see the same movie with your friends, or it might involve each member of the group doing a different task to carry out the plan of the group.
Practice the Skill
Suppose that you are a member of the first Congress. With a group of classmates, you must decide what and who should be taxed to raise the money the government needs. When your group has finished, answer the following questions.
1.	Did your group have a plan? Did it discuss what taxes to pass? Compared to other members, how much did you take part in those activities?
2.	How well did your group work together? What role did you play in that? Explain.
3.	Was your group able to make a decision? If not, why? If so, was compromise involved? Do you support the decision? Explain why or why not.

Making Generalizations
FOCUS on Reading As you read about different people and events, you probably notice some similarities among them. Seeing those similarities may lead you to make a generalization. A generalization is a broad, general idea drawn from new information combined with what you already know, such as your own experience. Notice how this process works with the following passage.
Lewis and Clark used the Missouri River as their highway through the unknown lands. As they moved upstream, a lookout on the boats kept a sharp eye out for sandbars and for tree stumps hidden underwater. When darkness fell, the weary explorers would pull their boats ashore. They cooked, wrote in their journals, and slept.
Swarms of gnats, flies, and mosquitoes often interrupted their sleep

Three attacks were planned—from Detroit, from Niagara Falls, and from up the Hudson River valley toward Montreal.
The attack from Detroit failed when British
soldiers and Indians led by Tecumseh captured Fort Detroit. The other American attacks failed when state militia troops refused to cross the Canadian border, arguing that they did not have to fight in a foreign country.
In 1813 the United States went on the attack again. A key goal was to break Britain's control of Lake Erie. The navy gave the task to Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. After building a small fleet, Perry sailed out to meet the British on September 10, beginning the Battle of Lake Erie. The battle ended when the British surrendered. Perry sent a message to General William Henry Harrison: "We have met the enemy and they are ours." Perry's brilliant victory forced the British to withdraw, giving the U.S. Army control of the lake and new hope.

Jefferson Becomes President
If YOU were there...
You are a Maryland voter from a frontier district—and you are tired! For days, you and your friends have been wrangling over the presidential election. Who shall it be—John Adams or Thomas Jefferson? Your vote depends on your personal judgment.
Which candidate would you choose for president?
BUILDING BACKGROUND
John Adams had not been a popular president, but many still admired his ability and high principles. Both he and Thomas Jefferson had played major roles in winning independence and shaping the new government. Now, political differences sharply divided the two men and their supporters. In the election of 1800, voters were also divided. The Election of 1800
In the presidential election of 1800, Federalists John Adams and Charles C. Pinckney ran against Democratic-Republicans Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. Each party believed that the American republic's survival depended upon the success of their candidates. With so much at stake, the election was hotly contested.
Unlike today, candidates did not travel around giving speeches. Instead, the candidates' supporters made their arguments in letters and newspaper editorials. Adams's supporters claimed that Jefferson was a pro-French radical. Put Jefferson in office, they warned, and the violence and chaos of the French Revolution would surely follow in the United States. Plus, Federalists argued, Jefferson's interest in science and philosophy proved that he wanted to destroy organized religion.
Democratic-Republican newspapers responded that Adams wanted to crown himself king. What else, they asked, could be the purpose of the Alien and Sedition Acts? Republicans also hinted that Adams would use the newly created permanent army to limit Americans' rights.
Ik*

• Peaceful change of political power from one party to another The tied race led to the Twelfth Amendment (1804), which created
a separate ballot for president and vice president.
When the election results came in, Jefferson and Burr had won 73 electoral votes each to 65 for Adams and 64 for Pinckney. The Democratic-Republicans had won the election, but the tie between Jefferson and Burr caused a problem. Under the Constitution at that time, the two candidates with the most votes became president and vice president. The decision went to the House of Representatives, as called for in the Constitution.
The House, like the electoral college, also deadlocked. Days went by as vote after vote was called, each ending in ties. Exhausted lawmakers napped on the floor.
Jefferson finally won on the thirty-sixth
vote. The election marked the first time that
one party had replaced another in power in the United States. It is seen by some as the end of the early republic that began with the failure of the Articles of Confederation and creation of the Constitution. The election signaled that the new system of government would carry the nation through a peaceful transition of political power.
The problems with the voting system led Congress to propose the Twelfth Amendment. This amendment created a separate ballot for president and vice president.

Jefferson's Inaugural Address
On March 4,1801, Thomas Jefferson gave his first inaugural address. In the following excerpt Jefferson describes his thoughts on the nation's future.
By using phrases like these, Jefferson tries to reassure his political opponents.
Here Jefferson states his opinion of what is essential to good government.
//Let us, then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind ...[E]very difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren1 of the same principle. We are all republicans; we are all federalists.//
//Still one thing more, fellow citizens, a wise and frugal2 Government, which shall restrain men from injuring one
another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their n own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not
take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government... //

THE IMPACT
TODAY
A monument to Thomas Jefferson was completed in 1943 and is one of the most frequently visited sites in Washington, D.C.
Jefferson's Policies
When Jefferson took office, he brought with him a style and political ideas different from those of Adams and Washington. Jefferson was less formal than his predecessors, and he wanted to limit the powers of government.
Jefferson Is Inaugurated
Americans looked forward with excitement to Jefferson's first speech as president. People from across the nation gathered in the new capital, Washington, D.C., to hear him. Curious travelers looked with pride at the partially completed Capitol building and at the executive mansion (not yet called the White House). The two buildings dominated the surrounding homes and forests.
Small businesses dotted the landscape. At one of these, a modest boardinghouse, the president-elect was putting the finishing touches on his speech. On the morning of March 4, 1801, he left the boardinghouse and walked to the Capitol. The leader of a republic, Jefferson believed, should not ride in fancy carriages.
Jefferson read his speech in a quiet voice.
He wanted to make it clear that he supported
the will of the majority. He also stressed the need for a limited government and the protection of civil liberties.
From these humble surroundings in which Jefferson delivered his speech, Washington eventually grew into a large and impressive city. Over the years, the Capitol and the executive mansion were joined by other state buildings and monuments. Jefferson, who had long dreamed of a new national capital that would be independent of the interests of any one state, was pleased to be a part of this process of building a federal city.
Jefferson in Office
President Jefferson faced the task of putting his republican ideas into practice. One of his first actions was to select the members of his cabinet. His choices included James Madison as secretary of state and Albert Gallatin as secretary of the treasury.
Jefferson would also benefit from the Democratic-Republican Party's newly won control of both houses of Congress. At Jefferson's urging, Congress allowed the hated Alien and Sedition Acts to expire. Jefferson
I CHAPTER 8
lowered military spending and reduced the size of the army. The navy was cut to seven active ships. Jefferson and Gallatin hoped that saving this money would allow the government to repay the national debt. Jefferson also asked Gallatin to find ways to get rid of domestic taxes, like the tax on whiskey. The Democratic-Republican-led Congress passed the laws needed to carry out these policies.
The entire national government in 1801 consisted only of several hundred people. Jefferson preferred to keep it that way. He believed that the primary functions of the federal government were to protect the nation from foreign threats, deliver the mail, and collect customs duties.
Jefferson did recognize that some of the Federalist policies—such as the creation of the Bank of the United States—should be kept. Although Jefferson had battled Hamilton over the Bank, as president he agreed to leave it in place.
Reading Check
Summarizing What policy changes did Democratic-Republicans introduce, and which Federalist policies did Jefferson keep?
Marbury v. Madison
Although Republicans controlled the presi-
dency and Congress, Federalists dominated
the federal judiciary. In an effort to continue
their control over the judiciary, Federalist
legislators passed the Judiciary Act of 1801
shortly before their terms of office ended.
This act created 16 new federal judgeships
that President Adams filled with Federalists
before leaving office. The Republican press
called these people midnight judges, arguing
that Adams had packed the judiciary with Academic
Federalists the night before he left office.
°	functions
Some of these appointments were made uses Or purposes so late that the documents that authorized them had not been delivered by the time Adams left office. This led to controversy once Jefferson took office. William Marbury, named as a justice of the peace by President Adams, did not receive his documents before Adams left office. When Jefferson took office, Marburydemandedthedocuments. On Jefferson's advice, however, the new secretary of state, James Madison, refused to deliver them. Jefferson argued that the appointment of the midnight judges was not valid.
Marbury v. Madison (1803)
Background of the Case Shortly before Thomas Jefferson took office, John Adams had appointed William Marbury to be a justice of the peace. Adams had signed Marbury's commission, but it was never delivered. Marbury sued to force Madison to give him the commission.
The Court's Ruling
The Court ruled that the law Marbury based his claim on was unconstitutional.
The Court's Reasoning
The Judiciary Act of 1789 gave the Supreme Court the authority to hear a wide variety of cases, including those like Marbury's. But the Supreme Court ruled that Congress did not have the power to make such a law. Why? Because the Constitution limits the types of cases the Supreme Court can hear. Thus, the law was in conflict with the Constitution and had to be struck down.
Why It Matters
Marburyv. Madison was important for several reasons. It confirmed the Supreme Court's power to declare acts of \ Congress unconstitutional. By doing so, it established the Court as the final authority on the Constitution.
This helped make the judicial branch of government equal to the other two branches. Chief Justice John Marshall and later federal judges would use this power of judicial review as a check on the legislative and executive branches.

THE JEFFERSON ERA 269
Marbury brought suit, asking the Supreme Court to order Madison to deliver the papers.
Marbury claimed that the Judiciary Act of 1789 gave the Court the power to do so.
John Marshall, a Federalist appointed by John Adams, was the chief justice of the Court.
Marshall and President Jefferson disagreed about many political issues. When Marshall agreed to hear Marbury's case, Jefferson protested, saying that the Federalists "have retired into the judiciary as a stronghold." Marshall wrote the Court's opinion in Marbury v. Madison, a case that helped establish the Supreme Court's power to check the power of the other branches of government. The Constitution, Marshall noted, gave the Court authority to hear only certain types of cases. A request like Marbury's was not one of them. The law that Marbury's case depended upon was, therefore, unconstitutional.
In denying Marbury's request in this way, the Court avoided a direct confrontation with Jefferson's administration. But more impor-
John Marshall
tant, it established the Court's power of judicial review, the power to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional. Marshall and later federal judges would use this power to make the judiciary a much stronger
part of the national government. Under Marshall's leadership, the Court gained additional power by beginning to issue only one decision in a case. In British courts, each justice provided a separate decision. The system of one decision gave the courts more authority. In response to Marbury, Jefferson urged Congress to impeach Justice Samuel Chase. The Congress held the impeachment trial, but Chase was acquitted.

KEY EVENTS
Thomas Jefferson
How would you inspire people to seek freedom?
When did he live? He was born on April 13,1743. He died on July 4,1826, within hours of the death of President John Adams, his rival and friend. The date was also the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
Where did he live? He was born in Albemarle County, Virginia, where he inherited a large estate from his father. At age 26 he began building his elegant lifetime home, Monticello, which he designed himself. He spent much of his life away from home, in Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; and Europe. Yet he always longed to return to his peaceful home.
What did he do? Jefferson wanted only three of his accomplishments listed on his tomb: author of the Declaration of American Independence, author of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia. What did he not mention? Governor of Virginia, lawyer, Revolutionary leader, writer, philosopher, inventor, architect, plant scientist, book collector, musician, astronomer, ambassador, secretary of state—and, of course, president of the United States.
Why is he important? Jefferson's powerful words in the Declaration of Independence have inspired people throughout the world to seek freedom, equality, and self-rule. His most celebrated achievement as president (1801-1809) was the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 nearly doubled the size of the United States. Jefferson then sponsored the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore this new territory. His leadership is remembered for his keen intelligence, commitment to democracy, and foresight.

The Louisiana Purchase
If YOU were there...
You and your family live on a small farm in Kentucky in about 1800. Raised on the frontier, you are a skillful hunter and trapper. One day at the trading post, you see a poster calling for volunteers to join the Corps of Discovery.This expedition will explore the vast region west of the Mississippi River. You think it would be exciting—but dangerous. You might never come home.
Would you volunteer to join the Corps of Discovery?
I BUILDING BACKGROUND
As the 1800s began, the United States I was expanding steadily westward. More lands were opened, and w settlers moved in to occupy them. Americans were also curious about the vast lands that lay farther west Adventurous explorers organized expeditions to find out more about those lands.
American Settlers Move West
By the early 1800s, thousands of Americans settled in the area between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River. As the region's population grew, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio were admitted to the Union. Settlers in these states depended upon the Mississippi and Ohio rivers to move their products to eastern markets.
New Orleans, located at the mouth of the Mississippi, was a very important port. Its busy docks were filled with settlers' farm products and valuable furs bought from American Indians. Many of these cargoes were then sent to Europe. At the same time, manufactured goods passed through the port on their way upriver. As American dependence on the river grew, Jefferson began to worry that a foreign power might shut down access to New Orleans.
There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans, through which the produce of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market/'
—Thomas Jefferson, quoted in Annals of America, Volume4,1797-1820
2 CHAPTER 8
■
Spain controlled both New Orleans and Louisiana. This region stretched west from the mighty Mississippi River to the great Rocky Mountains. Although Spain owned Louisiana, Spanish officials found it impossible to keep Americans out of the territory. "You can't put doors on open country," the foreign minister said in despair.
Years of effort failed to improve Spain's position. Under a secret treaty, Spain agreed to trade Louisiana to France, passing the problem on to someone else. One Spanish officer expressed his relief. "I can hardly wait to leave them [the Americans] behind me," he said.

Louisiana
In 1802, just before handing over Louisiana to France, Spain closed New Orleans to American shipping. Angry farmers worried about what this would do to the economy. President Jefferson asked the U.S. ambassador to France, Robert R. Livingston, to try to buy New Orleans. Jefferson sent James Monroe to help Livingston.
Napoleon and Louisiana
France was led by Napoleon (nuh-POH-lee-uhn) Bonaparte, a powerful ruler who had conquered most of Europe. He wished to rebuild France's empire in North America.
Napoleon's strategy was to use the French colony of Haiti, in the Caribbean, as a supply
THE JEFFERSON ERA 273
base. From there he could send troops to Louisiana. However, enslaved Africans had revolted and freed themselves from French rule.
Napoleon sent troops to try to regain control of the island, but they were defeated in 1802. This defeat ended his hopes of rebuilding a North American empire.
Jefferson Buys Louisiana
The American ambassador got a surprising offer during his negotiations with French foreign minister Charles Talleyrand. When the Americans tried to buy New Orleans, Talleyrand offered to sell all of Louisiana.
With his hopes for a North American empire dashed, Napoleon had turned his attention back to Europe. France was at war with Great Britain, and Napoleon needed money for military supplies. He also hoped that a larger United States would challenge British power.
Livingston and Monroe knew a bargain when they saw one. They quickly accepted the French offer to sell Louisiana for $15 million.
The news pleased Jefferson. But as a strict constructionist, he was troubled. The Constitution did not mention the purchase of foreign lands, and he did not want to expand the power of the federal government. He also did not like spending large amounts of public money. Nevertheless, Jefferson agreed to the purchase in the belief that doing so was best for the country.
On October 20,1803, the Senate approved the Louisiana Purchase agreement, which roughly doubled the size of the United States. With the $15 million in the French treasury, Napoleon boasted, "I have given England a rival who, sooner or later, will humble her pride."

Explorers Head West
Americans knew little about western Native Americans or the land they lived on. President Jefferson wanted to learn more about the people and land of the West. He also wanted to see if there was a river route that could be taken to the Pacific Ocean.
Lewis and Clark Expedition
In 1803 the president asked Congress to fund an expedition to explore the West. To lead it, he chose former army captain Meriwether Lewis. Lewis then chose his friend Lieutenant William Clark to be the co-leader of the expedition.
To prepare for the journey, Lewis spent weeks studying with experts about plants, surveying, and other subjects. This knowledge would allow him to take careful notes on what
he saw. With Clark, Lewis carefully selected about 50 skilled frontiersmen to join the Corps of Discovery, as they called their group.
In May 1804 the Lewis and Clark expedition began its long journey to explore the Louisiana Purchase. The Corps of Discovery traveled up the Missouri River to the village of St. Charles. Once past this village the men would receive no more letters, fresh supplies, or reinforcements.
Lewis and Clark used the Missouri River as their highway through the unknown lands. As they moved upstream, a lookout on the boats kept a sharp eye out for sandbars and for tree stumps hidden underwater. When darkness fell, the weary explorers would pull their boats ashore. They cooked, wrote in their journals, and slept. Swarms of gnats, flies, and mosquitoes often interrupted their sleep.

ANALYSIS
SKILL I
Analyzing Primary Sources What did Lewis find so impressive about the Great Plains?
Insects were not the only cause of sleeplessness for the Corps of Discovery. As weeks passed without seeing any Native Americans, the explorers wondered what their first encounter would be like.
Contact with Native Americans
During the summer of 1804 the Corps of Discovery had pushed more than 600 miles upriver without seeing any Native Americans. But when the men spotted huge buffalo herds in the distance, they guessed that Indian groups would be nearby. Many Indian groups depended on the buffalo for food, clothing, and tools.
Lewis used interpreters to talk to the leaders of each of the peoples they met. He told them that the United States now owned the land on which they lived. Yet the explorers relied on the good will of the people they met. Sacagawea (sak-uh-juh-wee-uh),
a Shoshone from the Rocky Mountains, accompanied the group with her husband, a French fur trader who lived with the Mandan Indians and served as a guide and interpreter. Sacagawea helped the expedition by naming plants and by gathering edible fruits and vegetables for the group. At one point, the group met with Sacagawea's brother, who provided horses and a guide to lead the expedition across the mountains.
After crossing the Rockies, Lewis and Clark followed the Columbia River. Along the way they met the powerful Nez Perce. Like the Shoshone, the Nez Perce provided the expedition with food. At last, in November 1805, Lewis and Clark reached the Pacific Ocean. The explorers stayed in the Pacific Northwest during the rough winter. In March 1806 Lewis and Clark set out on the long trip home.
Lewis and Clark had not found a river route across the West to the Pacific Ocean. But they had learned much about western lands and paths across the Rockies. The explorers also established contact with many Native American groups and collected much valuable information about western plants and animals. Pike's Exploration
In 1806 a young army officer named Zebulon Pike was sent on another mission to the West. He was ordered to find the starting point of the Red River. This was important because the United States considered the Red River to be a part of the Louisiana Territory's western border with New Spain.
Heading into the Rocky Mountains, in present-day Colorado, Pike tried to reach the summit of the mountain now known as Pikes Peak. In 1807 he traveled into Spanish-held lands until Spanish cavalry arrested him. They suspected Pike of being a spy. When he was finally released, he returned to the United States and reported on his trip. Despite his imprisonment, he praised the opportunities for doing business with the Spanish in the Southwest.

When the Corps of Discovery headed west in 1804, an estimated 30 million buffalo roamed the plains alongside 97,000 people, mostly Native Americans. Since that time the numbers have reversed. Today nearly 40 million people call the lands of the Louisiana Purchase home, In contrast, the buffalo, which had been driven nearly
to extinction by the late 1800s, has recovered to a population of approximately 15,000 in the wild.

The Coming of War
If YOU were there...
You are a tea merchant in Boston in 1807, but right now a new law forbids trading with European nations. Boston Harbor is full of empty ships. It seems to you that the law is hurting American merchants more than European ones! You know that some are breaking the law and smuggling goods, just to stay in business.
Would you obey the law or smuggle?
BUILDING BACKGROUND
The United States tried to stay neutral in the conflicts between France and Great Britain, but it was impossible to avoid getting involved. French and British ships interfered with American trade across the Atlantic. The British also caused trouble along the western frontier. Many Americans began to urge war with Great Britain. Violations of Neutrality
During the late 1700s and early 1800s, American merchant ships fanned out across the oceans. The overseas trade, while profitable, was also risky. Ships had to travel vast distances, often through violent storms. Merchant ships sailing in the Mediterranean risked capture by pirates from the Barbary States of North Africa, who would steal cargo and hold ships' crews for ransom. The young United States had no formal navy to protect these ships. Congress provided money for just six ships, but the ships were designed to compete against the largest navies in the world. Attacks continued until the United States sent the USS Constitution, a large warship, to end them.
The Barbary pirates were a serious problem, but an even larger threat soon loomed. When Great Britain and France went to war in 1803, each country wanted to stop the United States from supplying goods to the other. Each government passed laws designed to prevent American merchants from trading with the other. In addition, the British and French navies captured many American merchant ships searching for war supplies.
The real trouble, however, started when Britain began stopping and searching American ships for sailors who had run away from the British navy, forcing the sailors to return to British ships. Sometimes U.S. citizens were captured by accident and pressed into

1.	Why do you think gunpowder was stored on the bottom deck?
2.	What was the purpose of the copper sheathing?
Boys called "powder monkeys" carried gunpowder from the orlop, or lowest, deck up to the gunners.
In the early years of the republic, foreign trade was critical to the nation's survival. In 1797 Congress decided to create a navy to protect American merchant ships. The powerful warship USS Constitution was a key part of the new navy and was undefeated in battle. It is the oldest commissioned warship in the world.
service. This impressment, or the practice of forcing people to serve in the army or navy, continued despite American protests.
Soon Britain was even targeting American navy ships. In June 1807, for example, the British ship Leopard stopped the U.S. Navy ship Chesapeake and tried to remove sailors. When the captain of the Chesapeake refused, the British took the sailors by force. The brazen attack on the Chesapeake stunned Americans.
The Embargo Act
Great Britain's violations of U.S. neutrality
sparked intense debate in America about how
to respond. Some people wanted to go to war.
Others favored an embargo, or the banning of trade, against Britain. Without a strong navy, many feared that the young nation would be unable to defend its independence in a fight against the largest navy in the world.
Jefferson, who had easily won re-election in 1804, supported an embargo. At his urging, in late 1807 Congress passed the Embargo Act. The law essentially banned trade with all foreign countries. American ships could not sail to foreign ports. American ports were also closed to British ships. Congress hoped that the embargo would punish Britain and France and protect American merchant ships from capture.
The effect of the law was devastating to American merchants. Without foreign trade,
THE JEFFERSON ERA 279
they lost enormous amounts of money. Northern states that relied heavily on trade were especially hard hit by the embargo. Congressman Josiah Quincy of Massachusetts, in a speech before Congress, described the situation. "All the business of the nation is in disorder. All the nation's industry is at a standstill," he said. The free enterprise system of economics was becoming more important to the financial well-being of merchants and other Americans, and many did not want government policies to interfere with trade.
The embargo damaged Jefferson's popularity and strengthened the Federalist Party. Angry merchants sent Jefferson hundreds of petitions demanding the Embargo Act's repeal. One New Englander said the embargo was like "cutting one's throat to stop the nosebleed." Even worse, the embargo had little effect on Britain and France.
Non-Intercourse Act
In 1809 Congress tried to revive the nation's trade by replacing the unpopular act with the Non-Intercourse Act. This new law banned trade only with Britain, France, and their colonies. It also stated that the United States would resume trading with the first side that stopped violating U.S. neutrality. In time, however, the law was no more successful than the Embargo Act.

Conflict in the West
Disagreements between Great Britain and the United States went beyond the neutrality issue. In the West, the British and Native Americans again clashed with American settlers over land.
The Conflict over Land
In the early 1800s, Native Americans in the old Northwest Territory continued to lose land as thousands of settlers poured into the region. The United States had gained this land in the Treaty of Greenville, but Indian leaders who had not agreed to the treaty protested the settlers' arrival. Frustrated Indian groups considered what to do. In the meantime, Britain saw an opportunity to slow America's westward growth. British agents from Canada began to arm Native Americans who were living along the western frontier. Rumors of British activity in the old Northwest Territory quickly spread, filling American settlers with fear and anger.
Tecumseh Resists U.S. Settlers
Soon an Indian leader emerged who seemed more than capable of halting the American settlers. Tecumseh (tuh-KUHM-suh), a Shawnee chief, had watched angrily as Native Americans were pushed off their land. A brilliant speaker, he warned other Indians about the dangers they faced from settlers. He believed that the Native Americans had to do what white Americans had done: unite.

Analyzing primary sources
How does the cartoonist emphasize the unpopularity of the Embargo Act?
Tecumseh hoped to unite the Native Americans of the northwestern frontier, the South, and the eastern Mississippi Valley. He was helped by his brother, a religious leader called the Prophet. They founded a village called Prophetstown near the Wabash and Tippecanoe rivers for their followers.
The Battle of Tippecanoe
The governor of the Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison, watched Tecumseh's activities with alarm. Harrison called him "one of those uncommon geniuses which spring up occasionally to . . . overturn the
established order." The governor was convinced that Tecumseh had British backing. If true, Tecumseh could be a serious threat to American power in the West.
In 1810 Tecumseh met face to face with Harrison. The governor urged him to follow the Treaty of Greenville that had been signed in 1795. Tecumseh replied, "The white people have no right to take the land from the Indians, because the Indians had it first." No single chief, he insisted, could sell land belonging to all American Indians who used it. In response, Harrison warned Tecumseh not to resist the power of the United States.

Views of War
Tecumseh urged Native Americans to unite to oppose what he called the "evil" of white settlement.
^The only way to stop this evil is for all the red men to unite in claiming a common and equal right to the land, as it was at first, and should be yet. Before, the land never was divided, but belonged to all, for the use of each person. No group had a right to sell, not even to each other, much less to strangers who want all and will not do with less/J
—Tecumseh
William Henry Harrison was proud of his efforts to obtain land for settlers.
//By my own exertions in securing the friendship of the chiefs... by admitting them at all times to my house and table, my propositions for the purchase of their lands were successful beyond my...hopes...In the course of seven years
s the Indian title was extinguished to the amount of fifty millions of acres.//
—William Henry Harrison

How did Harrison's and Tecumseh's views on western settlement differ?

FOCUS ON
Reading What generalization can you make about the views on going to war?
Tecumseh traveled south to ask the Creek nation to join his forces. In his absence, Harrison attacked. Harrison raised an army and marched his troops close to Prophetstown. Fighting broke out when the Prophet ordered an attack on Harrison's camp on November 7, 1811.
The Indians broke through army lines, but Harrison kept a "calm, cool, and collected" manner, according to one observer. During the all-day battle, Harrison's soldiers forced the Indian warriors to retreat and then destroyed Tecumseh's village. Said Chief Shabbona, "With the smoke of that town and loss of that battle, I lost all hope." Although Tecumseh was safe, U.S. forces defeated Tecumseh and his followers in the Battle of Tippecanoe. The defeat destroyed Tecumseh's dream of a great Indian confederation. He fled to Canada. The Prophet was removed from power for ordering the failed attack.
READING CHECK _
Finding Main Ideas Why were U.S. officials worried about Tecumseh's actions?
Call for War
The evidence of British support for Tecumseh further inflamed Americans. A Democratic-Republican newspaper declared, "The war on the Wabash [River] is purely BRITISH." Many Americans felt that Britain had encouraged Tecumseh to attack settlers in the West.
The War Hawks
Several young members of Congress—called War Hawks by their opponents—took the lead in calling for war against Britain. These legislators, most of whom were from the South and West, were led by Henry Clay of Kentucky, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, and Felix Grundy of Tennessee. They saw war as the only answer to British insults. "If we submit," Calhoun warned, "the independence of this nation is lost." Calls for war grew. The War Hawks wanted to put a stop to British influence among Native Americans and enforce national security. They also wanted to invade Canada and
I CHAPTER 8
gain more land for settlement. Others were angered by British trade restrictions that hurt southern planters and western farmers. War Hawks gave emotional speeches urging Americans to stand up to Great Britain.
The Opposition
The strongest opponents of the War Hawks were New England Federalists. British trade restrictions and impressment had hurt New England's economy. People there wanted to renew friendly business ties with Britain instead of fighting another war.
Other politicians argued that war with Great Britain would be foolish. They feared that the United States was not yet ready to fight powerful Britain. America's army and navy were small and poorly equipped compared to Britain's military. In addition, Americans could produce only a fraction of the military supplies Britain could. Senator Obadiah German of New York pleaded with the War Hawks to be patient: "Prior to any declaration of war... my plan would be, and my first wish is, to prepare for it—to put the country in complete armor."
Declaring War
Republican James Madison was elected president in 1808. He faced the difficulty of continuing an unpopular trade war begun by Jefferson. He also felt growing pressure from the War Hawks. By 1812 he decided that Congress must vote on war. Speaking to Congress, Madison blasted Great Britain's conduct. He asked Congress to decide how the nation should respond.
When Congress voted a few days later, the War Hawks won. For the first time in the nation's brief history, Congress had declared war. Months later, Americans elected Madison to a second term. He would serve as commander in chief during the War of 1812.

Early Battles
In the summer of 1812 the United States found itself in a war with one of the world's most powerful nations. Despite the claims by the War Hawks, the War of 1812 would not be a quick and easy fight.
War at Sea
When the war began, the British navy had hundreds of ships. In contrast, the U.S. Navy had fewer than 20 ships. None of them was as powerful as the greatest British warships.
Most of the British navy's ships, however, were scattered around the globe. Although small, the U.S. Navy had well-trained sailors and powerful new warships such as the USS Constitution. American vessels defeated British ships several times in one-on-one duels. Such victories embarrassed the British and raised American morale. Eventually, the British ships blockaded America's seaports.
Battles Along the Canadian Border
American leaders hoped to follow up victories at sea with an overland invasion of Canada. Three attacks were planned—from Detroit, from Niagara Falls, and from up the Hudson River valley toward Montreal.
CHAPTER 8
TheWar of 1812
The attack from Detroit failed when British soldiers and Indians led by Tecumseh captured Fort Detroit. The other American attacks failed when state militia troops refused to cross the Canadian border, arguing that they did not have to fight in a foreign country.
In 1813 the United States went on the attack again. A key goal was to break Britain's control of Lake Erie. The navy gave the task to Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. After building a small fleet, Perry sailed out to meet the British on September 10, beginning the Battle of Lake Erie. The battle ended when the British surrendered. Perry sent a
message to General William Henry Harrison: "We have met the enemy and they are ours." Perry's brilliant victory forced the British to withdraw, giving the U.S. Army control of the lake and new hope.
With American control of Lake Erie established, General Harrison marched his army into Canada. At the Battle of the Thames River in October 1813, he defeated a combined force of British troops and Native Americans. Harrison's victory ended British power in the Northwest. Tecumseh's death during the fighting also dealt a blow to the British alliance with Native Americans in the region.
THE JEFFERSON ERA 285
THE IMPACT
TODAY
One witness to the shelling was a lawyer named Francis Scott
Key. He was so inspired by what he witnessed and the Americans' refusal to surrender that he wrote the poem that would become the song "The Star-Spangled Banner." The phrases "rockets' red glare" and "bombs bursting in air" describe the intense shelling the fort endured. The bombing was so heavy that it was heard in Philadelphia, 90 miles away. The song became the U.S. national anthem in 1931.
The Creek War
Meanwhile, war with American Indians erupted in the South. Creek Indians, angry at American settlers for pushing into their lands, took up arms in 1813. A large force attacked Fort Mims on the Alabama River, destroying the fort and killing close to 250 of its defenders. In response, the commander of the Tennessee militia, Andrew Jackson, gathered about 2,000 volunteers to move against the Creek nation.
In the spring of 1814 Jackson attacked the Creek along the Tallapoosa River in Alabama. Jackson's troops won this battle, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. The Treaty of Fort Jackson, signed late in 1814, ended the Creek War and forced the Creek to give up millions of acres of their land.

Britain on the Offensive
Despite U.S. success on the western and southern frontiers, the situation in the East grew
worse. After defeating France in April 1814, the British sent more troops to America.
British Attacks in the East
Now reinforced, the British attacked Washington, D.C. President Madison was forced to flee when the British broke through U.S. defenses. The British set fire to the White House, the Capitol, and other government buildings.
The British sailed on to Baltimore, Maryland, which was guarded by Fort McHenry. They shelled the fort for 25 hours. The Americans refused to surrender Fort McHenry. The British chose to retreat instead of continuing to fight.
The Battle of New Orleans
After the attack on Washington, the British moved against New Orleans. British commanders hoped to capture the city and thus take control of the Mississippi River.
Andrew Jackson commanded the U.S. forces around New Orleans. His troops were a mix of regular soldiers, including two battalions of free African Americans, a group of Choctaw Indians, state militia, and pirates led by Jean Lafitte.
The battle began on the morning of January 8, 1815. Some 5,300 British troops attacked Jackson's force of about 4,500. The British began marching toward the U.S. defenses, but they were caught on an open field. The British were cut down with frightening speed. More than 2,000 British soldiers were killed or wounded. The Americans, for their part, had suffered about 70 casualties. The Battle of New Orleans made Andrew Jackson a hero and was the last major conflict of the War of 1812.

at Hartford, Connecticut. At the Hartford Convention, Federalists agreed to oppose the war and send delegates to meet with Congress. Before the delegates reached Washington, however, news arrived that the war had ended. Some critics now laughed at the Federalists, and the party lost much of its political power.
Slow communications at the time meant that neither the Federalists nor Jackson knew about the Treaty of Ghent. The treaty, which had been signed in Belgium on December 24, 1814, ended the War of 1812.
Though each nation returned the territory it had conquered, the fighting did have several consequences. The war produced feelings of patriotism in Americans for having stood up to the mighty British. Some even called it the second war for indepen-
dence. The war also broke the power of many Native American groups. During the war, American manufacturers produced more to replace goods that could not be imported. When the war ended and trade resumed, American manufacturing grew even more as the economy revived. Finally, people began to see that the federal government needed a national bank in order to finance wars and other emergencies.

In 1803 the United States made the biggest land purchase in its history—the Louisiana Purchase. With this purchase, the country stretched west all the way to the Rocky Mountains. In 1819 the United States acquired Florida from Spain, gaining even more new territory. By 1820, the young American republic had roughly doubled in size, as you can see on the map. Explorers, traders, and settlers began to pour into the new lands in search of wealth, land, and a place to call home.

Determining Historical Context
Define the Skill
A context is the circumstances under which something happens. Historical context includes values, beliefs, conditions, and practices that were common in the past. At times, some of these were quite different from what they are today. To truly understand a historical statement or event, you have to take its context into account. It is not right to judge what people in history did or said based on present-day values alone. To be fair, you must also consider the historical context of the statement or event.
Learn the Skill
To better understand something a historical figure said or wrote, use the following guidelines to determine the context of the statement. Each of these steps will help you understand the person's frame of reference, or the factors that influenced his or her view of the world.
1.	Identify the speaker or writer, the date, and the topic and main idea of the statement.
2.	Determine the speaker's or writer's attitude and point of view about the topic.
3.	Review what you know about beliefs, conditions, or practices related to the topic that were common at the time. Find out more about the times in which the statement was made.
4.	Decide how well the statement reflects the values, attitudes, and practices of people living at that time. Then, determine how well it reflects values, attitudes, and practices related to the topic today.
Applying these guidelines will give you a better understanding of statements made by the the press during the lead up to the War of 1812. An editor of a newspaper in 1809 discussed the impressment of American sailors by Britain with language designed to inflame people into supporting the war:
^We can have no natural sympathies for a government which has tyrannized over us in every shape—which has murdered, torn from their homes, and plundered our citizens, insulted our flag, our territory, and our independence—and trampled upon the laws of civilized nations/^
By modern standards, the language seems strong. But think about the times in which it was written. The United States had only recently won the Revolutionary War against Britain, and Britain had not followed all of the requirements of the Treaty of 1783. When its historical context is considered, the statement might seem less extreme.
Practice the Skill
Read the following statement made by Henry Clay in 1811. Then answer the questions to determine its context and better understand it.
** What are we to gain by war, has been emphatically asked? In reply, he would ask, what are we not to lose by peace?~commerce, character, a nation's best treasure, honor!
1.	What was Clay's opinion of war?
2.	How might Americans' recent experience in the Revolution have caused him to feel that way?

In 1804 Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and the 33-man Corps of Discovery began an 8,000-mile journey across uncharted territory. Under orders from President Thomas Jefferson, the expedition mapped a route across the Louisiana Purchase to the Pacific Ocean. From St. Louis, Missouri, they traveled west up the Missouri River, then across the Rocky Mountains, and to the Pacific. They met Native American peoples and cataloged geography,
plants, and animals. Not only was their mission one of history's greatest explorations; it also secured an American claim to the Pacific Coast and helped inspire millions to migrate west.

FOCUS on Themes This chapter is titled "A New National Identity" because it explains how the United States government established relations with European powers and how Americans developed a strong sense of national pride even as they struggled
with important state issues. You will learn about the Monroe Doctrine, the Missouri Compromise, the Cumberland Road project, and the rise of American music, literature, and public schools—events that changed the country's culture and politics.
Comparing and Contrasting
FOCUS on Reading Comparing and contrasting facts, ideas, or concepts is a good way to learn more about them. That's one reason historians use comparison and contrast to explain people and events in history.
Understanding Comparison and Contrast To compare is to look for likenesses, or similarities. To contrast is to look for differences. Sometimes writers point out similarities and differences. Other times you have to look for them yourself. You can use a diagram like this one to keep track of similarities and differences as you read.

Clues for Comparison-Contrast
Writers sometimes signal compari-' sons or contrasts with words like
these:
j Comparison—similarly, like, in the ; same way, too
Contrast—however, unlike, but, i although, in contrast
Sentences or paragraphs that contain separate information on a single topic may be comparing and contrasting ideas on the topic.

Tariffs and Sectionalism
Not everyone agreed with the plan, however. Most of the resistance was centered in the West and the South. These regions were more dependent on trade to acquire manufactured goods than the North was. The plan for a high tariff on imported manufactured goods resulted in higher prices for these goods. This increase in prices would be felt more in the West and the South, while benefiting the manufacturers in the North.

Settling Disputes with Great Britain
The Treaty of Ghent had ended the War of 1812, yet there were issues left unresolved. The United States and British Canada both wanted to keep their navies and fishing rights on the Great Lakes. In the spring of 1817, the two sides compromised by establishing the Rush-Bagot Agreement, which limited naval power on the Great Lakes for both the United States and British Canada.
Another treaty with Britain gave the United States fishing rights off parts of the Newfoundland and Labrador coasts. This treaty, known as the Convention of 1818, also set the border between the United States and Canada at 49°N latitude as far west as the Rocky Mountains. Interest in the valuable fur trade in the Oregon Country was another issue resolved by this treaty. Both countries agreed to occupy the Pacific Northwest together, an agreement that would be tested in the years to come.

United States Gains Florida
The United States also had a dispute over its southern border with Spanish Florida. In 1818 Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, son of John and Abigail Adams, held talks with Spanish diplomat Luis de Onis about letting Americans settle in Florida. Meanwhile, President James Monroe, elected in 1816, had sent U.S. troops to secure the U.S.-Florida border. General Andrew Jackson led these soldiers.
At the same time, conflicts arose between the United States and the Seminole Indians of Florida. The Seminole often helped runaway slaves and sometimes raided U.S. settlements. In April 1818 Jackson's troops invaded Florida to capture Seminole raiders. This act began the First Seminole War. During the war Jackson took over most of Spain's
important military posts. Then he overthrew the governor of Florida. He carried out these acts against Spain without receiving direct orders from President Monroe. Jackson's actions upset Spanish leaders. Most Americans, however, supported Jackson.
Jackson's presence in Florida convinced Spanish leaders to negotiate. In 1819 the two countries signed the Adams-Oms Treaty, which settled all border disputes between Spain and the United States. Under this treaty, Spain gave East Florida to the United States. In return, the United States gave up its claims to what is now Texas. U.S. leaders also agreed to pay up to $5 million of U.S. citizens' claims against Spain.

The Monroe Doctrine
President James Monroe established the foundation for U.S. foreign policy in Latin America in the Monroe Doctrine of 1823.
In this phrase, Monroe warns European nations against trying to influence events in the Western Hemisphere.
Monroe notes here the difference between existing colonies and newly independent countries.
The occasion has been judged proper for asserting ... that the American continents... are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers...
The political system of the allied powers is essentially different... from that of America. We ... declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety ...
With the existing colonies... we have not interfered and shall not interfere. But with the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it, and whose independence we have ... acknowledged, we could not view any interposition1 for the purpose of oppressing them ... by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation2 of an unfriendly disposition3 toward the United States.

Monroe Doctrine
Meanwhile, Spain had other problems. By the early 1820s most of the Spanish colonies in the Americas had declared independence. Revolutionary fighter Simon Bolivar, called the Liberator, led many of these struggles for independence. The political circumstances surrounding the revolutions reminded most American leaders of the American Revolution. As a result, they supported these struggles.
After Mexico broke free from Spain in 1821, President Monroe grew worried. He feared that rival European powers might try to take control of newly independent Latin American countries. He was also concerned about Russia's interest in the northwest coast of North America.
Secretary of State Adams shared President Monroe's concerns. In a Fourth of July speech before Congress, Adams said that the
United States had always been friendly with European powers, and that the country did not want to be involved in wars with them. He implied that he supported the newly independent countries but said the United States would not fight their battles.
Great Britain was also interested in restraining the influence of other European nations in the Americas. This was because Britain had formed close trading ties with most of the independent Latin American countries. Britain wanted to issue a joint statement with the United States to warn the rest of Europe not to interfere in Latin America.
Instead, Secretary of State Adams and President Monroe decided to put together a document protecting American interests. The Monroe Doctrine was an exclusive statement of American policy warning European powers not to interfere with the Americas.
0 CHAPTER 9
The doctrine was issued by the president on December 2, 1823, during his annual message to Congress.
The Monroe Doctrine had four basic points.
1.	The United States would not interfere in the affairs of European nations.
2.	The United States would recognize, and not interfere with, European colonies that already existed in North and South America.
3.	The Western Hemisphere was to be off-limits to future colonization by any foreign power.
4.	The United States would consider any European power's attempt to colonize or interfere with nations in the Western Hemisphere to be a hostile act.
Some Europeans strongly criticized the Monroe Doctrine, but few European countries challenged it. One impact of the doctrine was to bring Latin America under the economic, political, and military influ-
ence of the United States. It also kept most European powers from interfering in Latin American affairs. The doctrine has remained important to U.S. foreign policy. The United States has continued to consider Latin America within its sphere of influence—the area a nation claims some control over. At times, it has intervened in Latin American affairs when its own interests, such as national security, were at risk.

BDING BACKGROUND
Peace, prosperity, and a growing country Americans a sense of national unity. In practical terms, building and canals also helped unify the nation. They made travel easier, linking people from different regions of the country. Nevertheless, some ' i regional conflicts continued.
Growing Nationalism
Pleased by successful negotiations with foreign powers, Americans enjoyed a rising sense of nationalism. Nationalism is feelings of pride in and loyalty to a nation. Americans believed in the nation's potential to build a society that was equal to European powers.
The American System
The Democratic-Republicans wanted to build a strong national economy to promote the sense of a unified country and reduce sectional conflicts. They pushed forward a plan eventually known as the American System —a series of measures intended to make the United States economically self-sufficient. The most vocal supporter of the plan was U.S. representative Henry Clay from Kentucky. To build the economy, Clay pushed for a national bank that would provide a single currency, making interstate trade easier. And the lessons learned in the War of 1812 led many to think that a national bank would stabilize the economy. Clay wanted the money from a protective tariff to be used to improve and build roads and canals.
>02 CHAPTER 9
Economics and Sectionalism
industry and favored policies that made imported goods more expensive than American-made goods.
These internal improvements would unite the country. They would provide a way for both goods and people to travel more easily across the long distances of the nation. Agricultural products of the West and the South and manufactured goods made in the North would be easier to transport to distant markets.
Not everyone agreed with the plan, however. Most of the resistance was centered in the West and the South. These regions were more dependent on trade to acquire manufactured goods than the North was. The plan for a high tariff on imported manufactured goods resulted in higher prices for these goods. This increase in prices would be felt more in the West and the South, while benefiting the manufacturers in the North. Clay responded with the argument that the North would be dependent on those regions for food and cotton. The South, however, still opposed the possibility of higher prices.
Respected Congressman Daniel Webster spoke against the tariff because he believed it would help one industry over others. Webster and his supporters argued that using a federal law that benefited one region of the nation more than others violated the ideals
Results
•	American-made goods were cheaper, leading to higher sales and great profits for U.S. businesses.
•	Iron and cotton would be used by U.S. businesses instead of foreign businesses.
•	American businesses would receive help in order to expand.
•	Trade within the nation would increase.
The West produced many food crops and favored policies that encouraged trade and lower prices on goods.
The South exported enormous amounts of cotton and favored policies that allowed them to trade with European textile manufacturers.

of the Constitution. They also believed that it put too much control of the nation in the hands of the central government and acted against the principles of a free-market economy. Some members of Congress believed that the Constitution did not permit the federal government to spend money on internal improvements. Clay argued that the possible gains for the country justified federal action.
Roads and Canals
In the early 1800s most roads in the United States were made of dirt, making travel difficult. British actress Frances Kemble described one New York road she had struggled along during a visit in the 1830s.
^The wickedest road, I do think, the cruellest, hard-heartedest road, that ever [a] wheel rumbled upon/,
—Frances Anne (Kemble) Butler, Journal
To improve the nation's roads, Congress agreed with Clay and invested in road building. The Cumberland Road was the first road built by the federal government.
It ran from Cumberland, Maryland, to Wheeling, a town on the Ohio River in present-day West Virginia. Construction began in 1815. Workers had to cut a 66-foot-wide band, sometimes through forest, to make way for the road. Then they had to use shovels and pickaxes to dig a 12- to 18-inch roadbed, which they filled with crushed stone. All of the work had to be done without the benefit of today's bulldozers and steamrollers.
By 1818 the road reached Wheeling. By 1833 the National Road, as the expansion was called, stretched to Columbus, Ohio. By 1850 it reached all the way to Illinois.
Meanwhile, Americans tried to make water transportation easier by building canals. One of the largest projects was the Erie Canal, which ran from Albany to Buffalo, New York.
Construction of the canal began in 1817 and was completed in 1825. Using shovels, British, German, and Irish immigrants dug the entire canal by hand. The canal cost millions of dollars, but it proved
to be worth the expense. The Erie Canal allowed goods and people to move between towns on Lake Erie and New York City and the East Coast. Its success served as an incentive for a canal-building boom across the country.
The construction of canals and roads had direct and indirect effects on the environment. The landscape was changed by the clearing of forests, and rivers and streams were redirected or dammed. Once the canals and roads were built, new farms and towns developed and further changed the environment. Even in rural areas, the natural environment was changed to accommodate the needs of humans.
Era of Good Feelings
From 1815 to 1825 the United States enjoyed the Era of Good Feelings, a time of peace, pride, and progress. The phrase was coined by a Boston editor in 1817 during James Monroe's visit to New England early in his presidency.
The emphasis on national unity was strengthened by two Supreme Court case decisions that reinforced the power of the federal government. In the 1819 case McCulloch v. Maryland, the Court asserted the implied powers of Congress in allowing for the creation of a national bank. In the 1824 case Gibbons v. Ogden, the Court said that the states could not interfere with the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.
Both of these court cases, along with others, showed the increasing control of the national government over the decisions of state governments. Congress began to make more laws based on the loose interpretation of the necessary and proper clause. The system of federalism that was framed by the Constitution was still debated, however, and many people disagreed with the growing power of the central government.

Drawing Inferences How did
new roads and canals affect the economy?
The Issue of Sectionalism
Even as many Americans felt a growing national pride, tensions between the three geographic regions of the nation began to grow. The three regions—the West, the North, and the South—had different economies, political goals, and social customs. Disagreements between the different regions, or sectionalism, were a common part of the political debates of the era of the early to mid-1800s.
When the nation was founded, the main political divisions between states followed the regional lines between those in the North and those in the South. From the beginning, the two regions had different economic and political concerns. The North worked for laws supporting trade and commerce, while the South favored policies that benefited agricultural production. Northern states insisted on equal representation for states with lower populations to make sure they were not overpowered by the more populous southern states. But the biggest difference between the regions was the southern system of slavery. From the beginning of the nation, leaders in the two regions debated how to handle the difference.
Under the Articles of Confederation, the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 had established a new kind of political region in the country. Territories were not states, but they were under the direct administration of the federal government. The ordinances established the policies and political structures for new land acquired in the future. As Americans settled the regions, new states were created. Their economies and political goals, however, were different than those of the northern and southern states along the Atlantic coast.
Slavery and Expansion
The most heated debates about sectionalism were often linked with slavery. Leaders in the southern states knew that many in the North wanted the practice to be abolished. They knew that if enough votes from free states

He became involved in local politics early in his life, and by age 29 he was appointed to the U.S. Senate. Throughout his career in the Senate, he was dedicated to preserving the Union. The Missouri Compromise and a later agreement, the Compromise of 1850, helped to ease sectional tensions, at least temporarily.

Missouri Compromise
As new states were added, leaders argued over whether or not slavery should spread into new states. One such disagreement arose in 1819 when Congress considered Missouri's application to enter the Union as a slave state. At the time, the Union had 11 free states and 11 slave states. Adding a new slave state would have tipped the balance in the Senate in favor of the South.
1.	Region In which part of the country was slavery permitted?
2.	Human-Environment Interaction Why did leaders choose 36° 30' as the compromise line?
To protect the power of the free states, the House passed a special amendment. It declared that the United States would accept Missouri as a slave state, but importing enslaved Africans into Missouri would be illegal. It also set free the children of Missouri slaves. Southern politicians angrily opposed this plan.
North Carolina senator Nathaniel Macon wanted to continue adding slave states. "Why depart from the good old way, which has kept us in quiet, peace, and harmony?" he asked. Eventually, the Senate rejected the amendment. Missouri was still not a state.
Henry Clay convinced Congress to agree to the Missouri Compromise, which settled the conflict that had arisen from Missouri's application for statehood. This compromise had three main conditions:
1.	Missouri would enter the Union as a slave state.
2.	Maine would join the Union as a free state, keeping the number of slave and free states equal.
3.	Slavery would be prohibited in any new territories or states north of 36°30' latitude—Missouri's southern border.
105a CHAPTER 9
Congress passed the Missouri Compromise in 1820. Despite the success of the compromise, there were still strong disagreements between the North and South over the expansion of slavery. Although people hoped that the compromise would end the debate, the issue would continue to arise with each new application for statehood.

The Election of 1824
Soon, a presidential election also brought controversy. Andrew Jackson won the most popular votes in 1824, although he did not win a majority. However, he did not have enough electoral votes to win office. Under the Constitution, the House of Representatives
had to choose the winner. When the House chose John Quincy Adams as president, Jackson's supporters claimed that Adams had made a corrupt bargain with Speaker of the House Henry Clay in order to be named president. These accusations grew after Adams chose Clay to be secretary of state. The controversy weakened Adams's support and encouraged more political action by Jackson's supporters in the Democratic Party.

In 1825 New York opened the Erie Canal which connected Buffalo on Lake Erie to Albany on the Hudson River. With the new canal boats and barges could travel from New York Harbor in the east to the Great Lakes region in the west. Trade boomed, new cities formed, and settlers moved farther west as the Erie Canal helped open up the Midwest region to farming and settlement.

As the United States grew, developments in many cultural areas contributed to the creation of a new American identity.
I BUILDING BACKGROUND
Until the early 1800s, Americans took ■ most of their cultural ideas from Great Britain and Europe. But as w American politics and the economy developed, so too did a new national culture. Writers and artists were inspired by American history and the American landscape.

I TAKING NOTES I
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the new developments in American culture in the 1820s and 1830s.
Like many people the world over, Americans expressed their thoughts and feelings in literature and art and sought spiritual comfort in religion and music. Developments in education and architecture also reflected the growing national identity. The arts became a way to show the similarities among Americans as well as the differences between American and European life. To do this, writers and artists used themes and images that were familiar to most Americans.

CHAPTER 9
One of the first American writers to gain international fame was Washington Irving. Born in 1783, he was named after George Washington. Irving's works often told about American history. Through a humorous form of writing called satire, Irving warned that Americans should learn from the past and be cautious about the future.
Irving shared this idea in one of his best-known short stories, "Rip Van Winkle." This story describes a man who falls asleep during the time of the American Revolution. He wakes up 20 years later to a society he does not recognize. Irving published this and another well-known tale, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," in an 1819-20 collection.
In some of his most popular works, Irving combined European influences with American settings and characters. His work served as a bridge between European literary traditions and a new type of writer who focused on American characters and society.
Perhaps the best known of these new writers was James Fenimore Cooper. Cooper was born to a wealthy New Jersey family in 1789. Stories about the West and the Native Americans who lived on the frontier fascinated him. These subjects became the focus of his best-known works.
Cooper's first book was not very successful, but his next novel, The Spy, was a huge success. Published in 1821, itwas an adventure story set during the American Revolution. It appealed to American readers' patriotism and desire for an exciting, action-filled story.
In 1823 Cooper published The Pioneers, the first of five novels featuring the hero Natty Bumppo. Cooper's novels told of settling the western frontier and included historical events. For example, his novel The Last of the Mohicans takes place during the French and Indian War. By placing fictional characters in a real historical setting, Cooper popularized a type of writing called historical fiction.
Some critics said that Cooper's characters were not interesting. They particularly criticized the women in his stories; one writer labeled them "flat as a prairie." Other authors of historical fiction, such as Catharine Maria Sedgwick, wrote about interesting heroines. Sedgwick's characters were inspired by the people of the Berkshire Hills region of Massachusetts, where she lived. Her works include A New-England Tale and Hope Leslie.
Analyzing How did Ameri-
can writers such as Irving and Cooper help create a new cultural identity in the United States?
A
New Style of Art The writings of Irving and Cooper inspired painters. These artists began to paint landscapes that showed the history of America and the beauty of the land. Earlier American painters had mainly painted portraits. By the 1830s the Hudson River school had emerged.
READING CHECK .
309
The artists of the Hudson River school created paintings that reflected national pride and an appreciation of the American landscape. They took their name from the subject of many of their paintings—the Hudson River valley.
Landscape painter Thomas Cole was a founder of the Hudson River school. He had moved to the United States from Britain in 1819. He soon recognized the unique qualities of the American landscape. As his work gained fame, he encouraged other American artists to show the beauty of nature. "To walk with nature as a poet is the necessary condition of a perfect artist," Cole once said.
Artists also began studying and painting the birds, animals, and plants of the United States. One wildlife painter, John James Audubon, became famous in both America and England for his paintings of birds. He traveled throughout the West, as far as Yellowstone, collecting images and descriptions of American wildlife.
By the 1840s the style of American painting was changing. More artists were trying to combine images of the American landscape with scenes from people's daily lives. Painters like George Caleb Bingham and Alfred Jacob Miller travelled west to paint scenes of the American frontier, including trappers, traders, settlers, and Native Americans.
Religion and Music
Through the early and mid-1800s, several waves of religious revivalism swept the United States. During periods of revivalism, meetings were held for the purpose of reawakening religious faith. These meetings sometimes lasted for days and included large sing-alongs.
At many revival meetings people sang songs called spirituals. Spirituals are a type of folk hymn found in both white and African American folk-music traditions. This type of song developed from the practice of calling out text from the Bible. A leader would call out the text one line at a time, and the congregation would sing the words using a familiar tune. Each singer added his or her own style to the tune. The congregation of singers sang freely as inspiration led them.
While spirituals reflected the religious nature of some Americans, popular folk music of the period reflected the unique views of the growing nation in a different way. One of the most popular songs of the era was "Hunters of Kentucky," which celebrated the Battle of New Orleans. It became an anthem for the spirit of nationalism in the United States and was used successfully in Andrew Jackson's campaign for the presidency in 1828.

Architecture and Education
American creativity extended to the way in which people designed buildings. Before the American Revolution, most architects followed the style used in Great Britain. After the Revolution, leaders such as Thomas Jefferson called for Americans to model their architecture after the styles used in ancient Greece and Rome. Many Americans admired the ancient civilization of Greece and the Roman Republic because they contained some of the same democratic and republican ideals as the new American nation did.
As time went by, more architects followed Jefferson's ideas. Growing American cities soon had distinctive new buildings designed in the Greek and Roman styles. These buildings were usually made of marble or other stone and featured large, stately columns.
Americans also embraced educational progress. Several early American political leaders expressed a belief that democracy would only succeed in a country of educated and enlightened people. But there was no general agreement on who should provide that education.
Eventually, the idea of a state-funded public school gathered support. In 1837 Massachusetts lawmakers created a state board of education. Other states followed this example, and the number of public schools slowly grew.

from The Last of the Mohicans
by James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851)
About the Reading The Last of the Mohicans is one of five novels known as the Leatherstocking Tales. These novels follow the life and adventures of American pioneer Natty Bumppo (also known as Leatherstocking, Hawkeye, and the Deerslayer). Bumppo is the perfect woodsman: resourceful, honest, kind to both his friends and his enemies, but always a loner at heart.
AS YOU READ ,
Try to imagine what Natty Bumppo looks like.
On that day, two men were lingering on the banks of a small but rapid stream ... While one of these loiterers showed the red skin and wild accoutrements of a native of the woods, the other exhibited, through the mask of his rude and nearly savage equipments, the brighter though sunburnt and long-faded complexion of one who might claim descent from a European parentage. O
The frame of the white man, judging by such parts as were not concealed by his clothes, was like that of one who had known hardships and exertion from his earliest youth. His person, though muscular, was rather attenuated than full; but every nerve and muscle appeared strung and indurated by unremitted exposure and toil. He wore a hunting shirt of forest green, fringed with faded yellow, and a summer cap of skins which had been shorn of their fur. He also bore a knife in a girdle of wampum, © like that which confined the scanty garments of the Indian, but no tomahawk. His moccasins were ornamented after the ... fashion of the natives, while the only part of his underdress which appeared below the hunting frock was a pair of buckskin leggings that laced at the sides, and which were gartered above the knees with the sinews of a deer. A pouch and horn completed his personal accoutrements, though a rifle of great length, which the theory of the more ingenious whites had taught them was the most dangerous of all firearms, leaned against a neighboring sapling.
from The Legend of Sleepy Hollow
by Washington Irving (1783-1859)
About the Reading "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" has been called one of the first American short stories. Even though it is based on an old German folktale, its setting, a small village in the Hudson River valley, is American through and through. Irving's knack for capturing the look and the feel of the region made the story instantly popular—as did the tale's eerie central character, a horseman without a head.

AS YOU READ
Try to picture both the ghost and the setting.
The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander in chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback without a head. It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, O whose head had been carried away by a cannon ball, in some nameless battle during the revolutionary war, and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk, hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed, certain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre, allege, that the body of the trooper having been buried in the church yard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head, © and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the church yard before day break.
Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and the spectre is known, at all the country firesides, by the name of The Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow. ©

Identifying Central Issues
Define the Skill
The reasons for historical events are often complex and difficult to determine. An accurate understanding of them requires the ability to identify the central issues involved. A central issue is the main topic of concern in a discussion or dispute. In history, these issues are usually matters of public debate or concern. They generally involve political, social, moral, economic, or territorial matters.
Being able to identify central issues lets you go beyond what the participants in an event said and gain a more accurate understanding of it. The skill is also useful for understanding issues today, and for evaluating the statements of those involved.
Learn the Skill
In this chapter you learned about the dispute that arose over Missouri's admission to the Union. Yet that was not what this controversy was really about. Recognizing the central issue in this dispute helps you understand why each side fought so hard over just one state.
Use the following steps to identify central issues when you read about historical events.
1.	Identify the main subject of the information.
2.	Determine the nature and purpose of what you are reading. Is it a primary source or a secondary one? Why has the information been provided?
3.	Find the strongest or most forceful phrases or statements in the material. These are often clues to the issues or ideas the speaker or writer thinks most central or important.
4.	Determine how the information might be connected to the major events or controversies that were concerning the nation at the time.
[ Practice the Skill
Soon after the Missouri Compromise passed, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams wrote:
^The impression produced upon my mind by the progress of this discussion [the dispute over Missouri] is that the bargain between freedom and slavery contained in the Constitution... is morally and politically vicious,... cruel and oppressive.... I have favored this Missouri Compromise, believing it to be all that can be effected [accomplished] under the present Constitution, and from an extreme unwillingness to put the Union at hazard [risk]. But perhaps it would have been a... bolder course to have persisted in the restriction upon Missouri till it should have terminated [ended] in a convention of the states to... amend the Constitution. This would have produced a new Union of thirteen or fourteen states unpolluted with slavery... If the Union must be dissolved, slavery is precisely the question upon which it ought to break. For the present, however, this contest [issue] is laid to sleep/^
Apply the steps to identifying central issues to analyze Adams's statement and answer the following questions:
1.	About what subject was Adams writing? What was his reason for making these remarks?
2.	What did Adams believe was the most important issue in the dispute? What strong language does he use to indicate this?
3.	What evidence suggests Adams did not think the breakup of the Union the central issue?

FOCUS on Themes In this chapter you will read about the events that shaped the United States from 1828 to 1838. You will see how political and economic decisions were intertwined. For instance, you will read about the tensions between southern
and northern states over tariff regulations. You will also read about the forced relocation of many Native Americans to the West. Understanding how economic issues led to political decisions will help you understand this time.
Drawing Conclusions about the Past
Focus on Reading Writers don't always tell you everything you need to know about a subject. Sometimes you need to think critically about what they have said and make your own decisions about what you've read.
Drawing Conclusions Earlier in this book, you learned how to make inferences. Sometimes when you read, you will need to make several inferences and put them together. The result is a conclusion, an informed judgment that you make by combining information.
The 1828 campaign focused a great deal on the candidates' personalities. Jackson's campaigners described him as a war hero who had been born poor and rose to success through his own
hard work.
Adams was a Harvard graduate whose father
had been the second U.S. president. Jackson's supporters described Adams as being out of touch with everyday people . . . When the ballots were counted, Jackson had defeated Adams, winning a record number of popular
votes. Ipp. 323-324)

Inference: Jackson shared many qualities with American voters.
Inference: Adams enjoyed many privileges that most Americans did not.
Inference: Jackson easily won the election by a huge majority.

Democracy
If YOU were there...
It's 1829, and you live in Washington, D.C. You've come with a friend to the party for Andrew Jackson's inauguration as president. Your friend admires Jackson as a man ofthe people. You are less sure about his ability. Jackson's inauguration soon turns into a rowdy party, as mobs crowd into the White House. They break glasses and overturn the furniture.
How would you feel about having Jackson as your president?
I BUILDING BACKGROUND
In the early years of the United States, I the right to vote belonged mainly to a few—free white men who owned
property. As the country grew, more men were given the right to vote.
This expansion of democracy led to the election of Andrew Jackson, a war hero. But not everyone approved of Jackson.	j
Expansion of Democracy
America in the early 1800s was changing fast. In the North, workshops run by the craftspeople who owned them were being replaced by large-scale factories owned by businesspeople and staffed by hired workers. In the South, small family farms began to give way to large cotton plantations, owned by wealthy white people and worked by enslaved African Americans. Wealth seemed to be concentrating into fewer hands. Many ordinary Americans felt left behind.
These same people also began to believe they were losing power in their government. In the late 1700s some Americans thought that government was best managed by wealthy, property-owning men. Government policies seemed targeted to help build the power of these people. The result was a growing belief that the wealthy were tightening their grip on power in the United States.
Hoping for change, small farmers, frontier settlers, and slaveholders rallied behind reform-minded Andrew Jackson, the popular hero of the War of 1812 and presidential candidate in the 1824 election. They believed Jackson would defend the rights of the common

Democracy in Action
Democracy spread in the early 1800s as more people became active in politics. Many of these people lived in the new western states. In these mostly rural areas, a political rally could be as simple as neighboring farmers meeting to talk about the issues of the day, as the farmers in the painting on the right are doing.
During the early 1800s democracy and demonstrations blossomed in the United States. The demonstrators of today owe much to the Americans of Andrew Jackson's time. Today, political rallies are a familiar sight in communities all over the country.

people and the slave states. And they had been bitterly disappointed in the way Jack-son had lost the 1824 election because of the decision in the House of Representatives.
During the Age of Jackson, many democratic reforms were made. Some states changed their qualifications for voters to grant more white males suffrage. The revised rules, however, usually excluded free blacks from voting as they had been allowed under original state constitutions. Political parties began holding public nominating conventions, where party members choose the party's candidates instead of the party leaders. This period of expanding democracy in the 1820s and 1830s later became known as Jacksonian Democracy.

Election of 1828
Jackson supporters were determined that their candidate would win the 1828 election. They formed the Democratic Party to support Jackson's candidacy. Many people who backed President Adams began calling themselves National Republicans.
The 1828 presidential contest was a rematch of the 1824 election. Once again, John Quincy Adams faced Andrew Jackson. Jackson chose John C. Calhoun as his vice presidential running mate.

ANALYZING PRIMARY SOURCES
How does the author view the people that support Jackson?
Adams was a Harvard graduate whose father had been the second U.S. president. Jackson's supporters described Adams as being out of touch with everyday people. Even a fan of Adams agreed that he was "as cold as a lump of ice." In turn, Adams's supporters said Jackson was hot tempered, crude, and ill-equipped to be president of the United States. When the ballots were counted, Jack-son had defeated Adams, winning a record number of popular votes.
Jackson's Inauguration
Jackson's supporters saw his victory as a win for the common people. A crowd cheered outside the Capitol as he took his oath of office, then followed Jackson to a party on the White House lawn. The few police officers on hand had difficulty controlling the partygoers.
As president, Jackson rewarded some of his supporters with government jobs. This spoils system — the practice of giving government jobs to political backers—comes from the saying "to the victor belong the spoils [valued goods] of the enemy."
Secretary of State Martin Van Buren was one of Jackson's strongest allies in his official cabinet. President Jackson also relied a great deal on his Kitchen Cabinet, an informal group of trusted advisers who sometimes met in the White House kitchen.

J TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the conflicts that Andrew Jackson faced during his administration.
Sectional Differences Increase
Regional differences had a major effect on Andrew Jackson's presidency. Americans' views of Jackson's policies were based on where they lived and the economy of those regions.
Three Regions Emerge
There were three main U.S. regions in the early 1800s. The North, first of all, had an economy based on trade and on manufacturing. Northerners supported tariffs because tariffs helped them compete with British factories. Northerners also opposed the federal government's sale of public land at cheap prices. Cheap land encouraged potential laborers to move from northern factory towns to the West.
The second region was the South. Its economy was based on farming. Southern farmers raised all types of crops, but the most popular were the cash crops of cotton and tobacco. Southerners sold a large portion of their crops to foreign nations.
26 CHAPTER 10

Regions of the United States, Early 1800s

Southerners imported their manufactured goods. Tariffs made imported goods more expensive for southern farmers. In addition, high tariffs angered some of the South's European trading partners. These trading partners would likely raise their own tariffs in retaliation. To avoid this situation, southerners called for low tariffs.
Southerners also relied on enslaved African Americans to work the plantations. The issue of slavery would become increasingly controversial between the North and South.
In the third region, the West, the frontier economy was just emerging. Settlers favored policies that boosted their farming economy and encouraged further settlement. Western farmers grew a wide variety of crops. Their biggest priority was cheap land and internal improvements such as better roads and water transportation.
Tariff of Abominations
Tariffs became one of the first issues that President Jackson faced. In 1827, the year before Jackson's election, northern manufacturers began to demand a tariff on imported woolen goods. Northerners wanted the tariff
to protect their industries from foreign competition, especially from Great Britain.
British companies were driving American ones out of business with their inexpensive manufactured goods. The tariff northerners supported, however, was so high that importing wool would be impossible. Southerners opposed the tariff, sayng it would hurt their economy.
Before Andrew Jackson took office, Congress placed a high tariff on imports. Angry southerners called it the Tariff of Abominations. (An abomination is a hateful thing.) Southern voters were outraged.
President John Quincy Adams signed the tariff legislation, though he did not fully support it. In early U.S. history, presidents tended to reserve veto power for legislation that they believed violated the Constitution. Signing the tariff bill meant Adams would surely be defeated in his re-election bid. The new tariff added fuel to the growing sectional differences plaguing the young nation.

Reaping What conclusions can you draw about the importance of the states' rights debate after reading this section?
States' Rights Debate
When Andrew Jackson took office in 1829, he was forced to respond to the growing conflict over tariffs. At the core of the dispute was the question of an individual state's right to disregard a law that had been passed by the U.S. Congress.
Nullification Crisis
Early in his political career, Vice President John C. Calhoun had supported the criteria of a strong central government. But in 1828 when Congress passed the Tariff of Abominations, Calhoun joined his fellow southerners in protest. Economic depression and previous tariffs had severely damaged the economy of his home state, South Carolina. It was only beginning to recover in 1828. Some leaders in the state even spoke of leaving the Union over the issue of tariffs.
In response to the tariff, Calhoun drafted the South Carolina Exposition and Protest. It said that Congress should not favor one state or region over another. Calhoun used the Protest to advance the states' rights doctrine, which said that since the states had formed the national government, state power should be greater than federal power. The doctrine challenged the idea of the supremacy and authority of a central government. Calhoun believed states had the right to nullify, or reject, any federal law they judged to be unconstitutional.
Calhoun's theory was controversial, and it drew some fierce challengers. Many of them were from the northern states that had benefited from increased tariffs. These opponents believed that the American people, not the individual states, made up the Union. Conflict between the supporters and the opponents of nullification deepened. The dispute became known as the nullification crisis. It became not only a crisis over the tariff but also a question about the ideas behind the Constitution as a system of government.
Although he chose not to put his name on his Exposition and Protest, Calhoun did resign from the vice presidency. He was then elected to the Senate, where he continued his arguments in favor of nullification. Martin Van Buren replaced Calhoun as vice president when Jackson was re-elected president.
The Hayne-Webster Debate
The debate about states' rights began early in our nation's history. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison supported the states' power to disagree with the federal government in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798-99. Some of the delegates at the Hartford Convention supported states' rights. But Calhoun's theory went further. He believed that states could judge whether a law was or was not constitutional. This position put the power of the Supreme Court in question.
The issue of nullification was intensely debated on the floor of the Senate in 1830. Robert Y. Hayne, senator from South Carolina, defended states' rights. He argued that nullification gave states a way to lawfully protest federal legislation. Daniel Webster of Massachusetts argued that the United States was one nation, not a pact among independent states. He believed that the welfare of the nation should override that of individual states.
Jackson Responds
Although deeply opposed to nullification, Jackson was concerned about economic problems in the southern states. In 1832 he urged Congress to pass another tariff that lowered the previous rate. South Carolina thought the slight change was inadequate. The state legislature took a monumental step; it decided to test the doctrine of states' rights.
South Carolina's first action was to pass the Nullification Act, which declared the 1828 and 1832 tariffs "null, void ... [and not] binding upon this State, its officers or citizens." South Carolina threatened to withdraw
8 CHAPTER 10
from the Union if federal troops were used to collect duties. The legislature also voted to form its own army. Jackson was enraged.
The president sternly condemned nullification. Jackson declared that he would enforce the law in South Carolina. At his request, Congress passed the Force Bill, approving use of the army if necessary. In light of Jackson's determined position, no other state chose to support South Carolina.
Early in 1833, Henry Clay of Kentucky had proposed a compromise that would gradually lower the tariff over several years. As Jackson's intentions became clear, both the U.S. Congress and South Carolina moved quickly to approve the compromise. The Congress would decrease the tariff, and South Carolina's leaders would enforce the law.
Despite the compromise, neither side changed its beliefs about states' rights. The argument continued for years, resulting in the huge conflict known as the Civil War.

Summarizing What led to the nullification crisis, and why was it important?
Jackson Attacks the Bank
President Jackson upheld federal authority in the nullification crisis. He did not, however, always support greater federal power. For example, he opposed the Second Bank of the United States, founded by Congress in 1816.
The Second Bank of the United States was given a 20-year charter. This charter gave it the power to act exclusively as the federal government's financial agent. The Bank held federal deposits, made transfers of federal funds between states, and dealt with any payments or receipts involving the federal government. It also issued bank notes, or paper currency. Some 80 percent of the Bank was privately owned, but its operations were supervised by Congress and the president. The bank had helped stabilize the financial troubles the nation's economy had experienced during the War of 1812.
Many states, particularly in the South, had opposed the Bank. Small farmers believed that the Bank only helped wealthy business-people. Jackson also questioned the legality

POINTS OF VIEW
States' Rights vs. the Union
The framers ofthe Constitution created a document that was remarkable in its scope. But a few issues were unresolved. One of the most controversial was the matter of states'rights versus the authority ofthe federal
government. Daniel Webster insisted that the interests ofthe Union should prevail. John C. Calhoun believed that the powers ofthe states were greater.
"While the Union lasts we have high, exciting, gratifying [rewarding] prospects spread out before us, for us and our children. God grant that in my day... my eyes shall be turned to behold the
gorgeous ensign [flag] ofthe republic... bearing for its motto ... Liberty and Union, now and forever one and inseparable."

of the Bank. He believed it was an unconstitutional extension of the power of Congress. The states, he thought, should have the power to control the banking system.
Some states decided to take action. Maryland tried to pass a tax that would limit the Bank's operations. James McCulloch, cashier of the Bank's branch in Maryland, refused to pay this tax. The state took him to court, and the resulting case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In McCulloch v. Maryland, the Court ruled that the national bank was constitutional.
Nicholas Biddle, the Bank's director, decided to push for a bill to renew the Bank's charter in 1832. Jackson campaigned for the bill's defeat. "I will kill it," he promised. True to his word, Jackson vetoed the legislation when Congress sent it to him.
Congress could not get the two-thirds majority needed to override Jackson's veto. Jackson also weakened the Bank's power by moving most of its funds to state banks. In many cases, these banks used the funds to offer easy credit terms to people buying land. While this practice helped expansion in the West, it also led to inflation.
In the summer of 1836 Jackson tried to slow this inflation. He ordered Americans to use only gold or silver—instead of paper state-bank notes—to buy government-owned land. This policy did not help the national economy as Jackson had hoped. Jackson did improve the economy by lowering the national debt. However, his policies opened the door for approaching economic troubles.

Shortly after Van Buren took office, the country experienced the Panic of 1837, a severe economic depression. Jackson's banking policies and his unsuccessful plan to curb inflation contributed to the panic. But people blamed Van Buren.
In 1840 the Whigs united against the weakened Van Buren to stand behind one candidate, William Henry Harrison, an army general. Harrison won in an electoral land-

W TAKING NOTES 1
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the steps Andrew Jackson and the U.S. government took toward Indian removal.
I BUILDING BACKGROUND
President Andrew Jackson had become I famous as an American Indian fighter. He had no sympathy with Native Americans' claim to the lands where they had always lived. With public support, he reversed the government's pledge to respect Indian land claims. The result was the brutal removal ofthe southeastern peoples to empty lands in the West
Indian Removal Act
Native Americans had long lived in settlements stretching from Georgia to Mississippi. However, President Jackson and other political leaders wanted to open this land to settlement by American farmers. Under pressure from Jackson, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830, authorizing the removal of Native Americans who lived east of the Mississippi River to lands in the West.
Congress then established Indian Territory—U.S. land in what is now Oklahoma—and planned to move Native Americans there. Some supporters of this plan, like John C. Calhoun, argued that removal to Indian Territory would protect Indians from further conflicts with American settlers. "One of the greatest evils to which they are subject is that incessant [constant] pressure of our population," he noted. "To guard against this evil. . . there ought to be the strongest... assurance that the country given [to] them should be theirs." To manage Indian removal to western lands, Congress approved the creation of a new government agency, the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
332 CHAPTER 10
During the Trail of Tears, thousands of Cherokee died from disease, starvation, and harsh weather. They were forced to walk hundreds of miles to their new land in the West. Other Native Americans were also moved, with similar results.
What can you see in this painting that indicates this was a difficult journey?
HISTORY
The Choctaw were the first Indians sent to Indian Territory. The Mississippi legislature abolished the Choctaw government and then forced the Choctaw leaders to sign the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. This treaty gave more than 7.5 million acres of their land to the state. The Choctaw moved to Indian Territory during a disastrous winter trip. Federal officials in charge of the move did not provide enough food or supplies to the Choctaw, most of whom were on foot. About one-fourth of the Choctaw died of cold, disease, or starvation.
News of the Choctaw's hardships caused other Indians to resist removal. When the Creek resisted in 1836, federal troops moved in and captured some 14,500 of them. They led the Creek, many in chains, to Indian Territory. One Creek woman remembered the trip being filled with "the awful silence that showed the heartaches and sorrow at being taken from the homes and even separation from loved ones." The Chickasaw, who lived in upper Mississippi, negotiated a treaty for better supplies on their trip to Indian Territory. Nevertheless, many Chickasaw lives were also lost during removal.

council, and a court system. All of these were
headed by a principal chief.
A
Cherokee named Sequoya used 86 characters to represent Cherokee syllables to create a writing system for their own complex language. In 1828 the Cherokee began publishing a newspaper printed in both English and Cherokee. The adoption of white culture did not protect the Cherokee.

Members of the
Cherokee Nation of northeastern Oklahoma are descendants of the Cherokee who were removed to Indian Territory. The group's population is almost 300,000 and is the largest tribal nation in the United States. Members of the Eastern Band of

were ignored. Georgia leaders began preparing for the Cherokee's removal. When they refused to move, the Georgia militia began attacking Cherokee towns. In response, the Cherokee sued the state. They said that they were an independent nation and claimed that the government of Georgia had no legal power over their lands.
In 1832 the Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice John Marshall, agreed. In Worcester v. Georgia the Court ruled that the Cherokee nation was a distinct community in which the laws of Georgia had no force. The Court also stated that only the federal government, not the states, had authority over Native Americans.
Georgia, however, ignored the Court's ruling, and President Jackson took no action to make Georgia follow the ruling. "John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it," Jackson supposedly said. By not
enforcing the Court's decision, Jackson violated his presidential oath to uphold the laws of the land. However, most members of Congress and American citizens did not protest the ways Jackson removed Native Americans.
In the spring of 1838, U.S. troops began to remove all Cherokee to Indian Territory. A few were able to escape and hide in the mountains of North Carolina. After the Cherokee were removed, Georgia took their .businesses, farms, and property.
The Cherokee's 800-mile forced march became known as the Trail of Tears. During the march, the Cherokee suffered from disease, hunger, and harsh weather. Almost one-fourth of the 18,000 Cherokee died on the march.

Other Native
Americans Resist
Other Native Americans decided to fight U.S. troops to avoid removal. Chief Black Hawk, a leader of Fox and Sauk Indians, led his people in a struggle to protect their lands in Illinois. By 1832, however, the Sauk forces were running out of food and supplies, and by 1850 they had been forced to leave.
In Florida, Seminole leaders were forced to sign a removal treaty that their followers decided to ignore. A leader named Osceola called upon his people to resist with force, and the Second Seminole War began. Osceola was captured and soon died in prison. His followers, however, continued to fight. Some 4,000 Seminole were removed and hundreds of others killed. Eventually, U.S. officials decided to give up the fight. Small groups of Seminole had resisted removal, and their descendants live in Florida today.

Trail of Tears, 1838-39 J In 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act into law. As its name implies, the purpose of the act was to remove Native Americans from land that white settlers wanted for themselves. Five tribes were forced to leave their traditional lands and walk to a territory west of the Mississippi River. The land in the new Indian Territory was land white settlers did not want. It was poor and not good for farming. The poor land made life very difficult for newly arrived Indians. Many died from malnutrition and disease. Within 10 years, about 60,000 Indians had been relocated.

Solving Problems
Define the Skill J
Problem solving is a process for finding workable solutions to difficult situations. The process involves asking questions, identifying and evaluating information, comparing and contrasting, and making judgments. Problem solving is useful in studying history because it helps you better understand problems people faced at certain points in time and how they dealt with those difficulties.
The ability to understand and evaluate how people solved problems in the past also can help in solving similar problems today. The skill can also be applied to many other kinds of difficulties besides historical ones. It is a method for thinking through almost any situation.
Learn the Skill
Using the following steps will enable you to better understand and solve problems.
1.	Identify the problem. Ask questions of yourself and others to make sure you know exactly what the situation is and understand why it is a problem.
2.	Gather Information. Ask questions and conduct research to learn more about the problem, such as its history, what caused it, what contributes to it, and other factors.
3.	List options. Based on the information you have gathered, identify possible options for solving the problem that you might consider.
Be aware that your final solution will probably be better and easier to reach if you have
as many options as possible to consider.
4.	Evaluate the options. Weigh each option you are considering. Think of and list the advantages it has as a solution, as well as its potential disadvantages.
5.	Choose and implement a solution. After comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each possible solution, choose the one that seems best and apply it.
6.	Evaluate the solution. Once the solution has been tried, evaluate its effectiveness in solving the problem. This step will tell you if the solution was a good one, or if another of the possible solutions should be tried instead.
[ Practice the Skill
One of the most challenging situations that President Jackson faced was the nullification crisis. You can use the problem-solving skills to better understand this problem and to evaluate his solution for it. Review the information about the nullification crisis in this chapter. Then answer the questions below.
1.	What was the specific problem that Jackson faced? Why was it a problem?
2.	What event led to the problem? What earlier circumstances and conditions contributed to it?
3.	List possible solutions to the problem that you would have considered if you had been president, along with advantages and disadvantages.
4.	Jackson threatened to send troops to South Carolina to enforce federal law. Do you think his solution was the best one? Explain why, or if not, what solution would have been better.

FOCUS on Reading A good way to learn what people in the past thought is to read what they wrote. However, most documents will only tell you one side of the story. By comparing writings by different people, you can learn a great deal about various sides of a historical issue or debate.
Comparing Texts When you compare historical texts, you should consider two things: who wrote the documents and what the documents were meant to achieve. To do this, you need to find the writers' main point or points.

But are we perfectly sure that we should be free from injury in a state of war with Mexico? Have we any security that countless numbers of foreign vessels under the authority and flag of Mexico would not prey upon our defenceless commerce in the Mexican gulf, on the Pacific ocean, and on every other sea and ocean? What commerce, on the other hand, does Mexico offer as an indemnity for our losses to the gallantry and enterprise of our countrymen?

Comparing Texts When you compare historical texts, you should consider two things: who wrote the documents and what the documents were meant to achieve. To do this, you need to find the writers' main point or points.

Foreign Policy
The proof is clear and satisfactory to my mind, that Texas once constituted a part of the territory of the United States, the title to which I regard to have been as indisputable as that to any other portion of our territory.
—James Polk, April23,1844
But are we perfectly sure that we should be free from injury in a state of war with Mexico? Have we any security that countless numbers of foreign vessels under the authority and flag of Mexico would not prey upon our defenceless commerce in the Mexican gulf, on the Pacific ocean, and on every other sea and ocean? What commerce, on the other hand, does Mexico offer as an indemnity for our losses to the gallantry and enterprise of our countrymen?

If YOU were there...
You live in Ohio in 1840. A few months ago, you and your family heard stories about a wonderful land in the Northwest, with sparkling rivers and fertile valleys. You all decide to pull up stakes and head West. You travel to Independence, Missouri, planning to join a wagon train on the Oregon Trail. In Missouri, you're surprised to find hundreds of other people planning to make the trip.
What would you expect your journey West to be like?
BUILDING BACKGROUND
Many Americans in the Jacksonian Era were restless, curious, and eager to be on the move. The American West drew a variety of settlers. Some looked for wealth and adventure. Others, like this family on its way to the Northwest, dreamed of rich farmland and new homes. Americans Move West
In the early 1800s, Americans pushed steadily westward, moving even beyond the territory of the United States. They traveled by canoe and flatboat, on horseback, and by wagon train. Some even walked much of the way. The era of westward expansion lasted until the late 1800s.
The rush to the West occurred, in part, because of a hat. The "high hat," made of water-repellent beaver fur, was popular in the United States and Europe. While acquiring fur for the hats, French, British, and American companies gradually killed off the beaver population in the East. Companies moved west in search of more beavers. Most of the first non-Native Americans who traveled to the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest were fur traders and trappers.
American merchant John Jacob Astor created one of the largest fur businesses, the American Fur Company. His company bought skins from western fur traders and trappers who became known as mountain men. These adventurers were some of the first easterners to explore and map the Rocky Mountains and lands west of them. Mountain men lived lonely and often dangerous lives. They trapped animals on their own, far from towns and settlements. Mountain men such as Jedediah Smith, Manuel Lisa, Jim Bridger, and Jim

Beckwourth survived many hardships during their search for wealth and adventure. To survive on the frontier, mountain men adopted Native American customs and clothing. In addition, they often married Native American women. The Indian wives of trappers often worked hard to contribute to their success.
Pioneer William Ashley saw that frequently bringing furs out of the Rocky Mountains was expensive. He asked his traders to stay in the mountains and meet once a year to trade and socialize. This practice helped make the fur trade more profitable. The yearly meeting was known as the rendezvous. At the rendezvous, mountain men and Native American trappers sold their fur to fur-company agents. It was thus important to bring as many furs as possible. One trapper described the people at a typical rendezvous in 1837. He saw Americans, Canadian French, some Europeans, and "Indians, of nearly every tribe in the Rocky Mountains."
The rendezvous was filled with celebrating and storytelling. At the same time, the meeting was also about conducting business. Western artist Alfred Jacob Miller described how trade was begun in the rendezvous camp.
^The Fur Company's great tent is raised; the Indians erect their picturesque [beautiful] white lodges; the accumulated [collected] furs of the hunting season are brought forth and the Company's tent is a... busy place.
—Alfred Jacob Miller, quoted In The Fur Trade of the American West, by David J. Wlshart
In 1811, John Jacob Astor founded a furtrading post called Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River. Astoria was one of the first American settlements in what became known as Oregon Country. American Indians occupied the region, which was rich in forests, rivers, and wildlife. However, Britain, Russia, Spain, and the United States all claimed the land. The United States based its claim on
EXPANDING WEST 3<
the exploration of merchant captain Robert Gray, who had reached the mouth of the Columbia River in 1792.
Recognizing the huge economic value of the Pacific Northwest, the United States made treaties in which Spain and Russia gave up their claims to various areas. The United States also signed treaties w?1' Britain allowing both countries to occupy Oregon Country, the Columbia River, and its surrounding lands.
By the 1840s, the era of American fur trading in the Pacific Northwest was drawing to a close. The demand for beaver furs had fallen because fashions changed. Too much trapping had also greatly reduced the number of beavers. Some mountain men gave up their work and moved back east. Their daring stories, however, along with the treaties made by the U.S. government, inspired other Americans to move West. Lured by rich resources and a mild climate, easterners poured into Oregon Country in the 1840s. These new settlers soon replaced the mountain men on the frontier.
The Oregon Trail
Many settlers moving to Oregon Country and other western areas followed the 2,000-mile-long Oregon Trail, which stretched from places such as Independence, Missouri, or Council Bluffs, Iowa, west into Oregon Country. The trail followed the Platte and Sweetwater Rivers over the Plains. After it crossed the Rocky Mountains, the trail forked. The northern branch led to the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The other branch went to California and became known as the California Trail.
Traveling the trail challenged the strength and determination of pioneer families. The journey usually began after the rainy season ended in late spring and lasted about six months. The cost, about $600 for a family of four, was high at a time when a typical worker usually made about $1.50 per day. Young families made up most groups of settlers. They gathered in wagon trains for the trip. There could be as few as 10 wagons or as many as several dozen in a wagon train.
The wagons were pulled by oxen, mules, or horses. Pioneers often walked to save their animals' strength. They kept up a tiring pace, traveling from dawn until dusk. Settler Jesse Applegate recalled the advice he received from one experienced Oregon pioneer: "Travel, travel, TRAVEL . . . Nothing is good that causes a moment's delay."
Some pioneers brought small herds of cattle with them on the trail. They faced severe hardships, including shortages of food, supplies, and water. Rough weather and geographic barriers, such as rivers and mountains, sometimes forced large numbers of pioneers to abandon their wagons. In the early days of the Oregon Trail, many Native Americans helped the pioneers, acting as guides and messengers. They also traded goods for food. Although newspapers sometimes reported Native American "massacres" of pioneers, few settlers died from Indian attacks.
The settlers who arrived safely in Oregon and California found generally healthy
348 CHAPTER 11
and pleasant climates. By 1845 some 5,000 settlers occupied the Willamette Valley.
The Santa Fe Trail
The Santa Fe Trail was another important path west. It led from Independence, Missouri, to Santa Fe, New Mexico. It followed an ancient trading route first used by Native Americans. American traders loaded their wagon trains with cloth and other manufactured goods to exchange for horses, mules, and silver from Mexican traders in Santa Fe.
The long trip across blazing deserts and rough mountains was dangerous. But the lure of high profits encouraged traders to take to the trail. One trader reported a 2,000 percent profit on his cargo. The U.S. government helped protect traders by sending troops to ensure that Native Americans were not a threat.
three communities eventually failed, and an anti-Mormon mob murdered Smith in 1844. Following Smith's murder, Brigham Young became head of the Mormon Church. Young chose what is now Utah as the group's new home, and thousands of Mormons took the Mormon Trail to the area near the Great Salt Lake, where they prospered. By 1860 there were about 40,000 Mormons in Utah.

Mormons Travel West
One large group of settlers traveled to the West in search of religious freedom. In 1830 a young man named Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in western New York. The members of Joseph Smith's church became known as Mormons. Smith told his followers that he had found and translated a set of golden tablets containing religious teachings. The writings were called the Book of Mormon.
Church membership grew rapidly, but certain beliefs and practices caused Mormons to be persecuted. For example, beginning in the 1850s some Mormon men practiced polygamy—a practice in which one man is married to several women at the same time. This practice was outlawed by the church in 1890.
In the early 1830s Smith and his growing number of converts left New York. They formed new communities, first in Ohio, then in Missouri, and finally in Illinois. All

I TAKING NOTES
Use the annotation tools in your eBook to take notes on the events that led to the independence of Texas.
American Settlers Move to Texas
Mexico had a long, unprotected border that stretched from Texas to California. Mexico's Spanish rulers worried constantly about attacks from neighbors. They also were concerned about threats from within Mexico.
Their fears were justified. Mexicans moved to overthrow Spanish rule in the early 1800s. In September 1810 Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Mexican priest, led a rebellion of about 80,000 poor Indians and mestizos, or people of Indian and Spanish ancestry. They hoped that if Mexico became independent from the Spanish monarchy, their lives would improve.
Hidalgo's revolt failed, but the rebellion he started grew. In 1821 Mexico became independent. In 1824 it adopted a republican constitution that declared rights for all Mexicans. The new Mexican government contracted with empresarios, or agents, to bring settlers to Texas. They paid the agents in land.
350 CHAPTER 11
In 1821 one young agent, Stephen F. Austin, started a Texas colony on the lower Colorado River. The first 300 families became known as the Old Three Hundred. Austin's successful colony attracted other agents, and American settlers flocked to the region. The Anglo-American settlers became known as Texians and were often Protestant. The Mexican residents were called Tejanos, and were usually Catholic. The two groups lived in separate communities, but eventually Texas developed a culture that was distinct from the rest of Mexico as well as the United States.
In exchange for free land, settlers had to obey Mexican laws. But some settlers often explicitly ignored these laws. For example, despite the ban on slavery, many brought slaves. Concerned that it was losing control of the growing American population, Mexico responded. In 1830, it banned further settlement by Americans. Angry about the new law, many Texans began to think of gaining independence from Mexico.
Meanwhile, Mexico had come under the rule of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. He soon suspended Mexico's republican constitution and turned his attention to the growing unrest in Texas.

Texans Revolt against Mexico
In October 1835 the Mexican army tried to remove a cannon from the town of Gonzales, Texas. Rebels stood next to the cannon. Their flag read, "Come and take it." In the following battle, the rebels won. The Texas Revolution, also known as the Texas War for Independence, had begun.
Texas Independence
On March 2, 1836, Texans declared their independence from Mexico and adopted a constitution. The new Republic of Texas was bom. Both the declaration and the constitution were modeled after the U.S. documents. The Texas constitution, however, made slavery legal.
Delegates to the new Texas government chose politician David Bumet as president and Lorenzo de Zavala as vice president. Another revolutionary, Sam Houston, was named to head the Texas army. Austin went to the United States to seek money and troops.

Battle at the Alamo
The Texans' actions angered the Mexican government. Santa Anna began assembling a force of thousands to stop the rebellion. The force included both Texians and Tejanos.
A hastily created army of Texas volunteers had been clashing with Mexican troops for months. Under Edward Burleson, a Texian force took the town of San Antonio. It then occupied the Alamo, a former mission near San Antonio that became an important battle site in the Texas Revolution. Texas settler Jim Bowie and volunteers from the United States, including frontiersman Davy Crockett joined the Alamo's defense.
The rebels, numbering about 200, hoped for reinforcements from the army that Sam Houston was assembling. For almost two weeks, from February 23 to March 6, 1836, the Texans held out against the large Mexican force. Colonel William Travis managed to get a message to other Texans through enemy lines:
I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism, and everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid with all dispatch [speed]... VICTORY OR DEATH."
—William Travis, from a letter written at the Alamo, 1836
Before dawn on March 6, the Mexican army attacked. Despite heavy losses, the army overcame the Texans. All the defenders of the Alamo were killed, though some civilians survived. Following a later battle, at Goliad, Santa Anna ordered the execution of 350 prisoners who had surrendered. Texans were enraged by the killings.
Battle of San Jacinto
Santa Anna now chased the untrained forces of Sam Houston. Outnumbered, the Texans fled east. Finally, they reorganized at the San Jacinto River, near Galveston Bay. There, the Texans took a stand.
Santa Anna was confident of victory, but he was careless in choosing the site for his camp. On the afternoon of April 21, 1836, while Mexican troops were resting, Houston's forces swarmed the camp, shouting, "Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!"
The fighting ended swiftly. Santa Anna's army was destroyed. In the Battle of San Jacinto, the Texans captured Santa Anna and forced him to sign a treaty giving Texas its independence.

An Independent Nation
Sam Houston was the hero of the new independent nation of Texas. The republic created a new town named Houston and made it the capital. Voters elected Sam Houston as president. Stephen F. Austin became secretary of state.
To increase the population, Texas offered land grants. American settlers came from nearby southern states, often bringing slaves with them to help grow and harvest cotton.
Most Texans hoped that the United States would annex, or take control of, Texas, making it a state. Some in Congress wanted to annex Texas, but President Andrew Jack-son did not pursue the issue. Although he wanted to annex the area, he was concerned that admitting Texas as a slave state would upset the fragile balance of free and slave states. The president also did not want to have a war with Mexico over Texas.
Finally, Jackson did recognize Texas as an independent nation. France did so in 1839. Britain, which wanted to halt U.S. expansion, recognized Texas in 1840.
The Mexican government, however, did not recognize Santa Arma's forced handover of Texas. For this reason, in 1837 the
Jfcaw*
republic organized the Texas Rangers to guard its long frontier from Mexican and Native American attacks. Finally, in 1844 Texas and Mexico signed an armistice. Mexico never recognized Texas' independence, however.

Manifest Destiny
We have it in our power to start the world over again.
—Thomas Paine, from his pamphlet Common Sense
Americans had always believed they could build a new, better society founded on democratic principles. In 1839 writer John O'Sullivan noted, "We are the nation of human progress, and who will, what can, set limits to our onward march?"
Actually, there was one limit: land. From the beginnings of the colonies, Americans had been moving west in search of land and economic opportunity. At the end of the Revolution, the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the method for dividing and governing new territories. By the 1840s the United States had a booming economy and population. Barely 70 years old, the nation needed even more room for farms, ranches, businesses, and ever-growing families. Americans looked West to what they saw as a vast wilderness, ready to be taken. The regions of Oregon, New Mexico, and Texas were being settled by Americans, and the national government worked to annex those lands to the United States.
354 CHAPTER 11
SgaB»Ky-K!®»?SB
Some people believed it was America's manifest destiny, or obvious fate, to settle land all the way to the Pacific Ocean in order to spread democracy. O'Sullivan coined the term in 1845. He wrote that it was America's "manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole continent which Providence [God] has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty..."
In the 1840s and 1850s, manifest destiny was tied up with the slavery issue. If America expanded, would slavery be allowed in the new territories? Several presidents became involved in the difficult issue. Among them was President John Tyler. A pro-slavery Whig, Tyler wanted to increase the power of the southern slave states by annexing Texas. His fellow Whigs disagreed.
In 1844, the Whig Party passed up Tyler and chose Senator Henry Clay as its presidential candidate. At first opposing annexation, Clay changed his mind due to pressure from southern politicians. The Democratic Party chose former Tennessee governor James K. Polk to oppose Clay. Both candidates strongly favored acquiring Texas and Oregon.
Southerners feared the loss of Texas, a
possible new slave state. Others worried that
Texas might become an ally of Britain. These concerns helped Polk narrowly defeat Clay.
Acquiring New Territory
President Polk quickly set out to fulfill his promise to annex Oregon and Texas. Russia and Spain had given up their claims to Oregon Country. Britain and the United States had agreed to occupy the territory together.
As more Americans settled there, they began to ask that Oregon become part of the United States. Polk wanted to protect these settlers' interests. Some politicians noted that Oregon Country would provide a Pacific port for the growing U.S. trade with China.
Meanwhile, Britain and the United States disagreed over how to draw the United States-Canadian border. American expansionists cried, "Fifty-four forty or fight!" This slogan referred to 54°40' north latitude, the line to which Americans wanted their northern territory to extend.
Neither side really wanted a war, though. In 1846 Great Britain and the United States signed a treaty that gave the United States all Oregon land south of the forty-ninth parallel. This treaty drew the border that still exists today. Oregon became an organized U.S. territory in February 1848.
EXPANDING WEST 351
By March 1845, Congress had approved the annexation of Texas and needed only the support of the Republic of Texas. Americans continued to pour into Texas. Texas politicians hoped that joining the United States would help solve the republic's financial and military problems. The Texas Congress approved annexation in June 1845. Texas became part of the United States in December. This action angered the Mexican government, which considered Texas to be a "stolen province."
The Mexican Borderlands
Though it had lost Texas, Mexico still had settlements in other areas of the present-day Southwest to govern. New Mexico, with its capital at Santa Fe, was the oldest settled area and had the most people. Mexico also had settlements in present-day Arizona, Nevada, and California.
During early Spanish rule, the mission system had dominated much of the present-day American Southwest. Over time, it had become less important there, especially in
History Close-up
New Mexico, where settlers lived in small villages. In California, however, missions remained the focus of everyday life. Missions under later Spanish rule carried out huge farming and ranching operations using the labor of Native Americans. Some of the Indians came willingly to the missions. Others were brought by force. Usually, they were not allowed to leave the mission once they had arrived. They had to adopt the clothing, food, and religion of the Spaniards. As a result, some Native American groups moved and settled in different areas to avoid being controlled by the missions. One effect of these migrations was more conflicts over land.
Missions often sold their goods to local pueblos, or towns, that arose near the missions and presidios. One wealthy California settler, Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, remembered the early days.
^We were the pioneers of the Pacific coast, building towns and missions while General [George] Washington was carrying on the war of the Revolution/'
—Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, quoted in Eyewitnesses and Others
Ranch Life
Spanish and Mexican vaqueros, or cowboys, were expert horse riders. They used their horses to herd cattle on the ranches of the Spanish Southwest.
After winning independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico began to change old Spanish policies toward California and Texas. By the 1830s, Mexico ended the mission system in the region. In California, mission lands were broken up, and huge grants were given to some of the wealthiest settlers, including Vallejo. They created vast ranchos, or ranches, with tens of thousands of acres of land. Vaqueros, or cowboys, managed the large herds of cattle and sheep. Cowhides were so valuable that they were called "California banknotes." Hides were traded for household items and luxury goods with ship captains from the eastern United States. Some settlers also made wine and grew citrus fruits.
Although they had been freed from the missions, for most California Indians the elements of life changed very little. They continued to herd animals and do much of the hard physical labor on ranches and farms. Some, however, ran away into the wilderness or to the nearby towns of San Diego and Los Angeles.
The Californios
Because of the great distance between California and the center of Mexico's government, by the early 1820s California had only around 3,200 colonists. These early California settlers, called Californios, felt little connection to their faraway government.
Californios developed a lasting reputation for hospitality and skilled horse riding. In Two Years Before the Mast, American novelist Richard Henry Dana Jr. wrote about his encounters with Californio culture. He described, for example, what happened after a Californio served a feast to Dana and a friend.
^We took out some money and asked him how much we were to pay. He shook his head and crossed himself, saying that it was charity—that the Lord gave it to us."
—Richard Henry Dana Jr., from Two Years Before the Mast
In addition to traders and travelers, a
small number of settlers also arrived from

He was soon put in charge of Mexico's efforts to increase settlement in northern California. Vallejo eventually became the richest man in California, owning enormous amounts of land and livestock. He welcomed American rule of California, believing it would result in self-government for Californios. He eventually lost most of his wealth fighting Anglos who claimed his land. Vallejo served at the state constitutional convention as well as in the first state senate.
Analyzing Why did Vallejo encourage American rule of California?
the United States. They were called Anglos by the Californios. Although there were few Anglo settlers in California, their calls for independence increased tensions between Mexico and the United States.

Mexican-American War
Diplomatic relations between Mexico and the United States became increasingly strained. U.S. involvement in California and Texas contributed to this tension.
Conflict Breaks Out
Mexico had long insisted that its northern border lay along the Nueces River and refused to accept the U.S. annexation of Texas. The United States said the border was farther south, along the Rio Grande. In June 1845 President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to lead an army into the disputed region.
EXPANDING WEST 35'
Polk sent diplomat John Slidell to Mexico City to try to settle the border dispute. Slidell came with an offer to buy New Mexico and California for $30 million. Mexican officials refused to speak to him.
In March 1846, General Taylor led his troops to the Rio Grande. He camped across from Mexican forces stationed near the town of Matamoros, Mexico. In April, the Mexican commander told Taylor to withdraw from Mexican territory. Taylor refused. The two sides clashed, and several U.S. soldiers were killed.
In response, Polk said to Congress:
^Mexico has passed the boundary of the United States, has invaded our territory, and shed American blood upon the American soil.. .The two nations are now at war/'
K.
Polk, from his address to Congress, May 11,1846 Polk's war message was persuasive. Two days later, Congress declared war on Mexico.
War Begins
At the beginning of the war with Mexico, the U.S. Army had better weapons and equipment. Yet it was greatly outnumbered and poorly prepared. The government put out a call for 50,000 volunteers. About 200,000 responded. Many were young men who thought the war would be a grand adventure in a foreign land.
On the home front, many Americans supported the war. However, many Whigs thought the war was unjustified and avoidable. Northern abolitionists also opposed the conflict. They feared the spread of slavery into southwestern lands.
While Americans debated the war, fighting proceeded. General Taylor's soldiers won battles south of the Nueces River. Taylor then crossed the Rio Grande and occupied Matamoros, Mexico. While Taylor waited for more men, Polk ordered General Stephen Kearny to attack New Mexico. On August 18, 1846, Kearny took Santa Fe, the capital city, without a fight. He claimed the entire province of New Mexico for the United States and marched west to California, where another conflict with Mexico was already under way.
The Bear Flag Revolt
In 1846, only about 500 Americans lived in the huge province of California, in contrast to about 12,000 Californios. Yet, in the spirit of manifest destiny, a small group of American settlers seized the town of Sonoma, north of San Francisco, on June 14. Hostilities began between the two sides when the Americans took some horses that were intended for the Mexican militia. In what became known as the Bear Flag Revolt, the Americans declared California to be an independent nation. Above the town, the rebels hoisted a hastily made flag of a grizzly bear facing a red star. Californios laughed at the roughly-made bear, thinking it "looked more like a pig than a bear."
John C. Fremont, a U.S. Army captain, was leading a mapping expedition across the Sierra Nevada when he heard of the possible war with Mexico. Fremont went to Sonoma and quickly joined the American settlers in their revolt against the Californios. Because war had already broken out between the United States and Mexico, Fremont's actions were seen as beneficial to the American cause in the region. His stated goal, however, was Californian independence, not to annex California to the United States. During the revolt, several important Californios were taken prisoner, including Mariano Vallejo. Governor Vallejo and his brother were held at an Anglo settlement for two months without any formal charges being brought against them. Long after his release, Vallejo wrote a history of California that included an account of his time as a bear flag prisoner.
But the bear flag was quick to fall. In July, U.S. naval forces came ashore in California and raised the stars and stripes. Kearny's army arrived from the East. The towns of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco fell rapidly. In August, U.S. Navy commodore Robert Stockton claimed California for the United States. Some Californios continued to resist until early 1847, when they surrendered.

War's End
In Mexico General Taylor finally got the reinforcements he needed. He drove his forces deep into enemy lands. Santa Anna, thrown from office after losing Texas, returned to power in Mexico in September 1846. He quickly came after Taylor.
The two armies clashed at Buena Vista in February 1847. After a close battle with heavy casualties on both sides, the Mexican Army retreated. The next morning, the cry went up: "The enemy has fled! The field is ours!"
Taylor's success made him a war hero back home. The general's popularity troubled President Polk, and when Taylor's progress stalled, Polk gave the command to General Winfield Scott. A beloved leader, he was known by his troops as "Old Fuss and Feathers" because of his strict military discipline.
Scott sailed to the port of Veracruz, where the strongest fortress in Mexico was located. On March 29, after an 88-hour artillery attack,
Veracruz fell. Scott moved on to the final goal, Mexico City, the capital. Taking a route similar to one followed by Spanish conquistador Heman Cortes in 1519, the Americans pushed 200 or so miles inland. Santa Anna tried to stop the U.S. forces at Cerro Gordo in mid-April, but failed. By August 1847, U.S. troops were at the edge of Mexico City.
After a truce failed, Scott ordered a massive attack on Mexico City. Mexican soldiers and civilians fought fierce battles in and around the capital. At a military school atop the steep, fortified hill of Chapultepec, young Mexican cadets bravely defended their hopeless position. At least one soldier jumped to his death rather than surrender to the invading forces. Finally, on September 14, 1847, Mexico City fell. Santa Anna soon fled the country.

360 CHAPTER 11
American Settlement in the Mexican Cession
The war ended after Scott took Mexico City. In February 1848, the United States and Mexico signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which officially ended the war and forced Mexico to turn over much of its northern territory to the United States. Known as the Mexican Cession, this land included the present-day states of California, Nevada, and Utah. In addition, it included most of Arizona and New Mexico and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. The United States also won the area claimed by Texas north of the Rio Grande. The Mexican Cession totaled more than 500,000 square miles and increased the size of the United States by almost 25 percent.
Agreements and Payments
In exchange for this vast territory, the United
States agreed to pay Mexico $15 million. In
addition, the United States assumed claims of
more than $3 million held by American citizens against the Mexican government. The treaty also addressed the status of Mexicans in the Mexican Cession. The treaty provided that they would be "protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property, and secured in the free exercise of their religion." The Senate passed the treaty in March 1848.
After the war with Mexico, some Americans wanted to guarantee that any southern railroad to California would be built completely on American soil. James Gadsden, U.S. minister to Mexico, negotiated an important agreement with Mexico in December 1853. Under the terms of the Gadsden Purchase, the U.S. government paid Mexico $10 million. In exchange, the United States received the southern parts of what are now Arizona and New Mexico. With this purchase, the existing boundary with Mexico was finally fixed.
Surge of American Settlers
After the Mexican-American War, a flood of Americans moved to the Southwest. American newcomers struggled against longtime residents to control the land and other valuable resources, such as water and minerals. Most Mexicans, Mexican Americans, and Native Americans faced legal, economic, and social discrimination. As a result, they found it difficult to protect their rights.
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo promised to protect Mexican American residents' property rights. Yet differences between Mexican and U.S. land laws led to great confusion. The U.S. government often made Mexican American landowners go to court to prove that they had titles to their land. Landowners had to pay their own travel costs as well as those of witnesses and interpreters. They also had to pay attorneys' and interpreters' fees. These legal battles often bankrupted land-owners. New settlers also tended to ignore Mexican legal concepts, such as community property or community water rights.

THE IMPACT
TODAY
Mexican holidays like Cinco de Mayo and Dia de los Muertos are still popular holidays in the Southwest.
White settlers also battled with American Indians over property rights. In some areas, new white settlers outnumbered Native Americans. Anglo settlers often tried to take control of valuable water resources and grazing lands. In addition, settlers rarely respected Indian holy places. Native American peoples such as the Navajo and the Apache tried to protect their land and livestock from the settlers. Indians and settlers alike attacked one another to protect their interests.
Cultural Encounters
Despite conflicts, different cultures shaped one another in the Southwest. In settlements with large Mexican populations, laws were often printed in both English and Spanish. Names of places—such as San Antonio, San
Diego, and Santa Barbara—show Hispanic heritage. Other place-names, such as Taos and Tesuque, are derived from Native American words. Communities throughout the Southwest regularly celebrated both Mexican and American holidays.
Mexican and Native American knowledge and traditions also shaped many local economies. Mexican Americans taught Anglo settlers about mining in the mountains. Many ranching communities were first started by Mexican settlers. They also introduced new types of saddles and other equipment to American ranchers. Adobe, developed by the Anasazi Indians, was adopted from the Pueblo people by the Spanish. It is still commonly used by American residents in New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
362 CHAPTER 11
Trade also changed the Southwest. For example, the Navajo created handwo-ven woolen blankets to sell to Americans. Americans in turn brought manufactured goods and money to the Southwest. Due to exchanges like these, the economies of many Mexican American and Native American communities in the Southwest began to change.
Water Rights
Eastern water-use laws commonly required owners whose land bordered streams or rivers to maintain a free flow of water. These restrictions generally prevented landowners from constructing dams because doing so would infringe upon the water rights of neighbors downstream.
In the typically dry climate of the West, large-scale agriculture was not possible without irrigation. Dams and canals were
required to direct scarce water to fields. This need conflicted with the accepted eastern tradition of equal access to water.
Brigham Young established a strict code regulating water rights for the Mormon community. In any dispute over water use, the good of the community would outweigh the interests of individuals. Young's approach stood as an example for modem water laws throughout the West.

BUILDING BACKGROUND
At the end of the Mexican-American War, the United States gained control of Mexican territories in the West, including all of the present-day state of California. American settlements in California increased slowly at first. Then, the discovery of gold brought quick population growth and an economic boom. flAKINCI^b
Use the annotation tools in your eBook to take notes on the California gold rush.
Discovery of Gold Brings Settlers
In the 1830s and 1840s, Americans who wanted to move to California started up the Oregon Trail. At the Snake River in present-day Idaho, the trail split. People bound for California took the southern route, which became known as the California Trail. This path ran through the Sierra Nevada mountain range. American emigrants and traders on the California Trail tried to cross these mountains before the season's first snows.
Although many Americans traveled along the California Trail, few actually settled in California. American merchants were usually more interested in trading goods made in factories than in establishing settlements. They traded for gold and silver coins, hides, and tallow (animal fat used to make soap and candles) from Mexico. California became a meeting ground for traders from Mexico and the United States.
Before the Mexican-American War, California's population consisted mostly of Mexicans and Native Americans. When Mexico
364 CHAPTER 11
controlled California, Mexican officials did not want many Americans to settle there. However, in 1839 they did give Swiss immigrant John Sutter permission to start a colony. Sutter's Fort, located near the Sacramento River, soon became a popular rest stop for many American emigrants. These new arrivals praised Sutter's hospitality and helpfulness. By the mid-1840s some Anglo Californians were publishing newspaper advertisements and guidebooks encouraging other settlers to move West.
The Donner party was a group of western travelers who went to California but were stranded in the Sierra Nevada Mountains during winter. The party began its journey West in the spring of 1846. Trying to find a shortcut, the group left the main trail and got lost. When the Donner party reached the Sierra Nevada Mountains, they became trapped by heavy snows. They were stuck and had almost no food.
A rescue party found the starving and freezing group in February 1847. Of the original 87 travelers, 42 had died.
Gold in California
In January 1848, Sutter sent a carpenter named James Marshall to build a sawmill beside a nearby river. While working near Sutter's Mill, Marshall glanced at the ground. "I reached my hand down and picked it up; it made my heart thump, for I was certain it was gold."
Sutter and Marshall agreed to keep the discovery a secret. However, when they examined the work site the next day, they met a Spanish-speaking Native American worker holding a nugget and shouting, "Oro |gokl|! Oro! Oro!"
Sutter's workers soon quit to search for gold. Stories of the discovery rapidly spread across the country. President Polk added to the national excitement by confirming the California gold strike in his farewell message to Congress in December 1848. In 1849 about 80,000 gold-seekers came to California, hoping to strike it rich. These gold-seeking migrants to California were called forty-niners. As one Iowa woman who

left to find gold recalled, "At that time the 'gold fever' was contagious, and few, old or young, escaped the malady [sickness]." Nearly 80 percent of the forty-niners were Americans, while the rest came from all over the world.
Most forty-niners braved long and often dangerous journeys to reach California. Many easterners and Europeans arrived via sea routes. Midwestern gold-seekers usually traveled West in wagon trains. Most forty-niners first arrived in San Francisco. This port town became a convenient trade center and stopping point for travelers. As a result, its population increased from around 800 in March 1848 to more than 25,000 by 1850.
Staking a Claim
Few of the forty-niners had any previous gold-mining experience. The work was difficult and time-consuming. The forty-niners would prospect, or search for gold, along the banks of streams or in shallow surface mines.
The early forty-niners worked an area that ran for 70 miles along rivers in northern California.
The first person to arrive at a site would "stake a claim." Early miners frequently banded together to prospect for gold. The miners agreed that each would keep a share of whatever gold was discovered. When one group abandoned a claim, more recent arrivals often took it over, hoping for success. Sometimes, two or more groups arrived in an area at the same time. In the early gold-rush days, before courts were established, this competition often led to conflict. Occasionally, violent disputes arose over competing claims.
Mining methods varied according to the location. The most popular method, placer (pLA-suhr) mining, was done along rivers and streams. Placer miners used pans or other devices to wash gold nuggets out of loose rock and gravel. To reach gold deposits buried in
366 CHAPTER 11
Why might people leave their homes and travel long distances in search of gold?
the hills, miners had to dig shafts and tunnels. These tasks were usually pursued by mining companies, rather than by individuals.
In 1853 California's yearly gold production peaked at more than $60 million. Individual success stories inspired many miners. One lucky man found two and a half pounds of gold after only 15 minutes of work. Two African American miners found a rich gold deposit that became known as Negro Hill in honor of their discovery. The vast majority of miners, however, did not become rich. Forty-niner Alonzo Delano commented that the "lean, meager [thin], worn-out and woebegone [sorrowful] miner.. .might daily be seen at almost every point in the upper mines."
Life in the Mining Camps
Mining camps sprang up wherever enough
people gathered to look for gold. These
camps had colorful names, such as Hang-
town or Poker Flat.
Miners in the camps came from many cultures and backgrounds. Most miners were young, unmarried men in search of adventure. Only around 5 percent of gold-rush immigrants were women or children. The hardworking women generally made good money by cooking meals, washing clothes, and operating boardinghouses. One such woman, Catherine Haun, recalled her first home in California.
** We were glad to settle down and go housekeeping in a shed that was built in a day of lumber purchased with the first fee... For neighbors, we had a real live saloon. I never have received more respectful attention than I did from these neighbors/'
—Catherine Haun, quoted in Ordinary Americans, edited by Linda R. Monk
Haun's husband was a lawyer. He concluded that he could make more money practicing law than he could panning for gold. He was one of many people who made a good living supplying miners with food, clothing, equipment, and other services. Miners paid high prices for basic necessities because the large amounts of gold in circulation caused severe inflation in California. A loaf of bread, for example, might cost 5 cents in the East, but it would sell for 50 to 75 cents in San Francisco. Eggs sometimes sold for $1 apiece.
Some settlers took full advantage of these conditions for free enterprise. Biddy Mason and her family, for instance, had arrived in California as slaves. A Georgia slaveholder had brought them during the gold-rush years. Mason quickly discovered that most Californians opposed slavery, particularly in the gold mines. She and her family gained their freedom and moved to the small village of Los Angeles. There she saved money until she could purchase some land. Over time, Mason's property increased in value from $250 to $200,000. She became one of the wealthiest landowners in California, a community leader, and a well-known supporter of charities.

THE IMPACT
TODAY
Today California is the nation's most populous state.
Immigrants to California
The lure of gold in California attracted miners from around the world. Many were from countries that had seen few immigrants to the United States in the past. They were drawn to California by the lure of wealth. For example, famine and economic hardship in southeastern China caused many Chinese men to leave China for America. Most hoped to find great wealth, and then return home to China. These immigrants were known in Chinese as gam saan haak, or "travelers to Gold Mountain." Between 1849 and 1853 about 24,000 Chinese men moved to California. "From far and near we came and were pleased," wrote merchant Lai Chun-chuen in 1855.
Chinese immigrants soon discovered that many Americans did not welcome them, however. In 1852, California placed a high monthly tax on all foreign miners. Chinese miners had no choice but to pay this tax if they wanted to prospect for gold in California. Some Chinese workers were the targets of violent attacks. If the Chinese
miners dared to protest the attacks, the legal system favored Americans over immigrants.
Despite such treatment, many Chinese immigrants still worked in the gold mines. Some looked for other jobs. Others opened their own businesses. A newspaper reported Chinese working as "ploughmen, laundry-men, placer miners, woolen spinners and weavers, domestic servants, cigar makers, [and] shoemakers."
In 1849 alone, about 20,000 immigrants arrived in California not only from China but also from Europe, Mexico, and South America. Like most Americans who sought gold, these new arrivals intended to return home after they had made their fortunes. However, many decided to stay. Some began businesses. For example, Levi Strauss, a German Jewish immigrant, earned a fortune by making tough denim pants for miners.

Impact on California
During the Spanish and Mexican periods of settlement, California's population grew slowly. The arrival of the forty-niners changed .this dramatically.
Population Boom
California's population explosion made it eligible for statehood only two years after being acquired by the United States. In 1850 California became the 31st state.
However, fast population growth had negative consequences for many Californios and California Native Americans. One early observer of the gold rush described why.
^The Yankee regarded every man but [his own kind] as an interloper [trespasser], who had no right to come to California and pick up the gold of'free and enlightened citizens.'"

Economic Growth
In addition to rapid population growth, a flood of new businesses and industries transformed California's economy. Gold mining remained an important part of the state's early economy. But Californians soon discovered other ways to make a living. Farming and ranching, for example, became industries for those willing to do the necessary hard labor. The rich soil of California still supports one of the largest agricultural economies in the United States.
California faced an obstacle to growth, though. The state was isolated from the rest of the country. It was difficult to bring in and ship out goods. The answer to the isolation problem was to bring the railroad all the way to California. Californians would have to wait almost 20 years for that. Completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 at last gave Californians the means to grow a stronger economy.

Water Rights Water was critical in the dry West. Bitter disputes arose over who had the water rights to streams. Gold rush miners developed a simple system: whoever used the water first owned the rights to it. In other parts of the West, the community as a whole had a right to use the water source.
In the 1830s, a new
dream began to shape
the American mind—manifest destiny. Manifest destiny was the belief that the United States should extend all the way to the Pacific Ocean. By 1850, that dream had become a reality. In 1845, the United States annexed Texas. In 1848, it acquired Oregon and the huge Mexican Cession. By 1853, with the Gadsden Purchase, the United States had taken the basic shape it still has today.

Identifying Causes and Effects
A cause is an action or a situation that makes something else happen. What happens is called an effect. For example, if you stay up too late watching TV (cause), you might find yourself nodding off in class (effect). Often an event or situation will have several causes as well as several effects. In those cases, we may look at the order in which the causes or effects occurred, or we may look at their relative importance. Researching and Organizing
For this paper, you will write about the causes or the effects of the War of 1812. Gather information from the chapter in this textbook, an encyclopedia, or another source recommended by your teacher.
■	Look for two or three reasons (causes) why the War of 1812 (the event or situation) occurred.
■	At the same time, consider the war as a cause. Look for two or three effects of the war.
Then choose whether to write about the causes or the effects.

3. Evaluate and Revise
Evaluating
Drawing clear, logical connections is the key to writing about causes and effects. Use these questions to evaluate and revise your paper.
Evaluation Questions for an Explanation of Causes or Effects
Does the introduction begin with an interesting quotation or fact?
Does the introduction identify the event [the war] and the causes or events to be discussed?
Is each cause or effect explained in its own paragraph?
Do facts and examples help to explain each cause or effect and connect it to the event [the war]?
■	Are you using correct grammar, spelling, sentence structure, punctuation, and appropriate citation of your sources?
■	Are the causes or effects organized clearly—by chronological order or order of importance?
■	Does the conclusion summarize the causes or effects and their importance?
Recognizing False Cause-and-Effect In planning your essay, be careful to avoid false cause-and-effect relationships. The fact that one thing happened before or after another doesn't mean one caused the other. For example, the fact that James Madison was elected in 1808, just four years before the War of 1812, does not mean his election caused the War of 1812.
Revising
Make sure the connections between the war and its causes or effects are clear by sharing your paper with a classmate. If your classmate is confused, add background information. If he or she disagrees with your conclusions, add evidence or rethink your reasoning.
Using Transitions Here are some transitional words and phrases that show cause or effect relationships: because, as a result, therefore, for, since, so, consequently, for this reason.
4. Proofread and Publish
Proofreading
Some transitional words and phrases need to be set off from the sentence with commas. Here are two examples:
■	The Louisiana Territory was a huge region of land. As a result, the size of the United States almost doubled when the land was purchased.
■	Jefferson wanted to know more about the land he had purchased. Therefore, he asked Congress to fund an expedition.
Check your paper to see if you need to add commas after or around any transitional words or phrases.

If YOU were there...
You live in a small Pennsylvania town in the 1780s. Your father is a blacksmith, but you earn money for the family, too. You raise sheep and spin their wool into yarn. Your sisters knit the yarn into warm wool gloves and mittens. You sell your products to merchants in the city. But now you hear that someone has invented machines that can spin thread and make cloth.
Would you still be able to earn the same amount of money for your family? Why?
I BUILDING BACKGROUND
In the early 1700s making goods depend-I ed on the hard work of humans and animals. It had been that way for ( hundreds of years. Then new technology brought a change so radical , ( that it is called a revolution. It began in Great Britain and soon spread to j | the United States.	j
The Industrial Revolution
At the beginning of the 1700s, the majority of people in Europe and the United States were farmers. They made most of what they needed by hand. For example, female family members usually made clothing. First, they used a spinning wheel to spin raw materials, such as cotton or wool, into thread. Then they used a hand loom to weave the thread into cloth.
Some families produced extra cloth to sell to merchants, who sold it for a profit. In towns, a few skilled workers made goods by hand in their own shops. These workers included blacksmiths, carpenters, and shoemakers. Their ways of life had stayed the same for generations.
A
Need for Change By the mid-1700s, however, changes in Great Britain led to a greater demand for manufactured goods. As agriculture and roads
384 CHAPTER 12
© After the thread was spun, it moved to the loom to be woven into cloth. Workers called spoolers watched the looms and made sure that the spools of thread were
improved, cities and populations grew. Overseas trade also expanded. Traditional manufacturing methods did not produce enough goods to meet everyone's needs.
People began creating ways to use machines to make things more efficient. These developments led to the Industrial Revolution, a period of rapid growth in using machines for manufacturing and production that began in the mid-1700s.
Textile Industry
The first important breakthrough of the Industrial Revolution took place in how textiles, or cloth items, were made. Before the Industrial Revolution, spinning thread took much more time than making cloth. Several workers were needed to spin enough thread to supply a single weaver.
In 1769 Englishman Richard Arkwright invented a large spinning machine called a water frame. The water frame could produce dozens of cotton threads at the same time. It lowered the cost of cotton cloth and increased the speed of textile production.
The water frame used flowing water as its source of power. Merchants began to build large textile mills, or factories, near rivers and streams. The mills were filled with spinning machines. Merchants began hiring people to work in the mills.
Additional improvements also speeded up the spinning process. Britain soon had the world's most productive textile manufacturing industry.

THE NORTH 31
New Machines and Processes
New machines encouraged the rise of new processes in business and manufacturing. As the machines used to make products became more efficient, the processes involved changed dramatically.
Slater and His Secrets
The new textile machines allowed Great Britain to produce cloth more quickly and inexpensively than other countries could. To protect British industry, the British Parliament had made it illegal for skilled mechanics or machine plans to leave the country. Disguised as a farmer, Samuel Slater, a skilled British mechanic, immigrated to the United States after carefully memorizing the designs of textile mill machines. Soon after arriving, he sent a letter to Moses Brown, who owned a textile business in New England. Slater claimed he could improve the way textiles were manufactured in the United States.
Brown had one of his workers test Slater's knowledge of machinery. Slater passed. Brown's son, Smith Brown, and son-in-law, William Almy, formed a partnership with Slater. In 1793 they opened their
first mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The production of cotton thread by American machines had begun. Slater ran the mill and the machinery. He was confident that his new machines would work well.
If I do not make as good yarn as they do in England, I will have nothing for my services, but will throw the whole of what I have attempted over the bridge/'
—Samuel Slater, quoted in The Ingenious Yankees, by Joseph and Francis Gies
Slater's machines worked, and the Pawtucket mill became a success. Slater's wife also invented a new cotton thread for sewing. In 1798 Slater formed his own company to build a mill. By the time he died in 1835, he owned all or part of 13 textile mills.
Other Americans began building textile mills. Most were located in the Northeast. In New England in particular, merchants had the money to invest in new mills. More important, this region had many rivers and streams that provided a reliable supply of power. Fewer mills were built in the South, partly because investors in the South concentrated on expanding agriculture. There, agriculture was seen as an easier way to make money.
Elements of Mass Production
CONNECT TO ECONOMICS
Mass-production techniques allow manufacturers to efficiently create more goods for the marketplace. Mass production requires the use of interchangeable parts, machine tools, and the division of labor. Why are interchangeable parts important?
Interchangeable Parts
Eli Whitney developed the idea of using interchangeable parts. Interchangeable, or identical, parts are needed so each part does not have to be custom-made by hand.
386 CHAPTER 12
A
Manufacturing Breakthrough Despite these great changes, most manufacturing was still done by hand. In the late 1790s the U.S. government worried about a possible war with France, so it wanted more muskets for the army. Skilled workers made the parts for each weapon by hand. No two parts were exactly alike, and carefully fitting all the pieces together took much time and skill.
As a result, American gun makers could not produce the muskets quickly enough to satisfy the government's demand. Factories needed better technology, the tools used to produce items or to do work.
In 1798 inventor Eli Whitney tried to address some of these problems. Whitney gave officials a proposal for mass-producing guns for the U.S. government using water-powered machinery. Whitney explained the benefits of his ideas.
^1 am persuaded that machinery moved by water [and] adapted to this business would greatly reduce the labor and facilitate [ease] the manufacture of this article.
—Eli Whitney, quoted in Technology in America, edited by Carroll W. Pursell
Whitney also came up with the idea of using interchangeable parts—parts of a machine that are identical. Using interchangeable parts made machines easier to assemble and broken parts easier to replace. Whitney promised to build 10,000 muskets in two years. The federal government gave him money to build his factory, and in 1801 Whitney was called to Washington, D.C., to give a demonstration.
Whitney stood before President John Adams and his secretary of war. He had an assortment of parts for 10 guns. He then randomly chose parts and quickly assembled them into muskets. To the audience's amazement, he repeated the process several times.
Whitney's Influence
Whitney had proven that American inventors could improve upon the new British technology. Machines that produced matching parts soon became standard in industry. Interchangeable parts sped up mass production, the efficient production of large numbers of identical goods.

Summarizing How did Eli Whitney influence American manufacturing?
THE NORTH 387
Linking to Today
Modern Manufacturing
The word manufacture comes from Latin words that mean "to make by hand." Yet in modern manufacturing, machines—not human hands—do most of the work.
A key feature of modern manufacturing is the assembly line. An assembly line is a long conveyer belt. As the product moves along the belt, or "down the line," workers assemble it. Often, the workers use machines to help them. On a growing number of assembly lines, there are no workers at all: the product is assembled by computer-controlled robots.
Although a far cry from Eli Whitney's factory, modern factories use the same elements of mass production that Whitney did more than 200 years ago.
How do interchangeable parts help the modern assembly line work?
Manufacturing Grows Slowly
Despite the hard work of people such as Samuel Slater and Eli Whitney, manufacturing in the United States grew slowly. Many businesspeople were eager to make their fortune in the new capitalist economy, free from the restrictive British policies of the colonial era, but there were several reasons it was difficult. In 1810 Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin suggested some reasons why there were so few factories in the United States.
" [The reasons include]... the superior attractions of agricultural pursuits [farming],... the abundance of land compared with the population, the high price of labor, and the want [lack] of sufficient capital [investment]/'
—Albert Gallatin, quoted in Who Built America?
by Bruce Levine et al.
Gallatin and others believed that few people would choose to work in a factory if they could own their own farm instead. In Great Britain, on the other hand, land was more scarce and more expensive than in the United States. As a result, fewer people were able to own farms. British factory workers
generally were willing to work for lower wages than factory workers in the United States were.
Because British manufacturers had plenty of factory workers with technical skills, they could produce large amounts of goods less expensively than most American businesses could. As a result, they could charge lower prices for the goods. Lower British prices made it difficult for many American manufacturers to compete with British companies. This situation in turn discouraged American investors from spending the money needed to build new factories and machinery. The new free market economy had not yet reached a balance between the needs of workers, business owners, and consumers that would result in a growing economy. As a result, only a few industries had found a place in the American economy. These included cotton goods, flour milling, weapons, and iron production.
These circumstances began to change around the time of the War of 1812. Since the 1790s, wars between European powers had interfered with U.S. trade. American customers were no longer able to get all the manufactured goods they were used to buying from
388 CHAPTER 12
British and European manufacturers. Then, during the War of 1812, British ships blockaded eastern seaports, preventing foreign ships from delivering goods. Americans began to buy the items they needed from American manufacturers instead of from foreign suppliers. As profits for American factories grew, manufacturers began to spend more money expanding their factories. State banks and private investors began to lend money to manufacturers for their businesses.
At the same time, many Americans began to realize that the United States had been relying too heavily on foreign goods. If the United States could not meet its own needs, it might be weak and open to attack. Former president Thomas Jefferson, who had once opposed manufacturing, changed his mind. He, too, realized that the United States was too dependent on imports.
^To be independent for the comforts of life we must fabricate [make] them ourselves. We must now place the manufacturer by the side of the agriculturalist [farmer]/'
—Thomas Jefferson, from The Writings of Thomas Jefferson, edited by P. L. Ford
In February 1815, New Yorkers celebrated the end of the War of 1812 and the return of free trade. The streets were decorated and filled with merchants whose ships were loaded with goods. "With Peace and Commerce, America Prospers," declared one display. Eager businesspeople prepared to lead the United States into a period of industrial growth. They urged northern politicians to pass higher tariffs on foreign goods to protect American companies. Many southerners, however, feared that tariffs might harm their economy by making imported goods too expensive.

BUILDING BACKGROUND
As factories and mills were established, the way people worked changed drastically. One dramatic change was the opportunity that factory work gave to young women. For young women in farm families, it was almost the only chance they had to earn their own money and a measure of independence. hmhsocialstudies.com

Mills Change Workers' Lives
Workers no longer needed the specific skills of craftspeople to run the machines of the new mills. The lives of workers changed along with their jobs. Resistance to these changes sometimes sparked protests.
Many mill owners in the United States could not find enough people to work in factories because other jobs were available. At first, Samuel Slater and his two partners used apprentices—young men who worked for several years to learn the trade. However, they often were given only simple work. For example, their jobs might include feeding cotton into the machines and cleaning the mill equipment. They grew tired of this work and frequently left. Apprentice James Horton, for example, ran away from Slater's mill. "Mr. Slater ... keep me always at one thing...," Horton complained. "I might have stayed there until this time and never knew nothing."
Eventually, Slater began to hire entire families who moved to Pawtucket to work in the mills. This practice allowed Slater to fill his labor needs at a low cost. Children as well as adults worked in the mills.

SKILL!
Analyzing Primary sources On most farms children worked to help their families. Therefore, few people complained about the hiring of children to work in factories. H. Humphrey, an author of books on raising children, told parents that children needed to be useful. Humphrey wrote, "If he [a child] will not study, put him on to a farm, or send him into the shop, or in some other way provide regular employment for him." The machines made many tasks in the mill simple enough for children to do. Mill owners profited because they paid children low wages. Adults usually earned as much in a day as most children did in a week.
To attract families to his mill, Slater built housing for the workers. He also provided them with a company store where they could buy necessities. In addition, he started the practice of paying workers with credit at the company store. Instead of paying the full price for an item all at once, small payments could be made over a period of time. This practice allowed Slater to reinvest his money in his business.
Slater's strategy of hiring families and dividing factory work into simple tasks became known as the Rhode Island system. Mill
owners throughout the Northeast copied Slater's methods. Owners advertised with "Men with growing families wanted." They also sent recruiters to poor communities to find new workers. For many people, the chance to work in a factory was a welcome opportunity to earn money and to learn a new skill.
One of the earliest of the mill towns, Slatersville, was named after Samuel Slater. The town was built by Slater and his brother John. It included two houses for workers and their families, the owner's house, the company store, and the Slatersville Mill. The mill was the largest and most modem industrial building of its time.
The mills employed not only the textile workers who operated the machinery but also machine part makers and dam builders. Although the company store sold food and necessary items to workers, mill towns supported the same variety of businesses any other town needed to thrive. These included tailors and dressmakers, butchers, and other small workshops.

The Lowell System
Not all mill owners followed this system. Francis Cabot Lowell, a businessman from New England, developed a very different approach. His ideas completely changed the textile industry in the Northeast.
The Lowell system was based on water-powered textile mills that employed young, unmarried women from local farms. The system included a loom that could both spin thread and weave cloth in the same mill. Lowell constructed boardinghouses for the women. Boardinghouse residents were given a room and meals along with their jobs.
With financial support from investors of the Boston Manufacturing Company, Lowell's first textile mill opened in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1814. "From the first starting of the first power loom there was not... doubt about the success," wrote one investor. In 1822, the company built a larger mill in a Massachusetts town later named Lowell. Visitors to Lowell were amazed by the clean factories and neatly kept boardinghouses as well as the new machinery.
The young millworkers soon became known as Lowell girls. The mills paid them between $2 and $4 each week. The workers paid $1.25 for room and board. These wages were much better than those women could earn per week in other available jobs, such as domestic work.
Many young women came to Lowell from across New England. They wanted the chance to earn money instead of working on the family farm. "I must of course have something of my own before many more years have passed over my head," wrote one young woman. The typical Lowell girl worked at the mills for about four years.
Unlike other factory workers, the Lowell girls were encouraged to use their free time to take classes and form women's clubs. They even wrote their own magazine, the Lowell Offering. Lucy Larcom, who started working at Lowell at age 11, later praised her fellow workers.

Girls must shout to be heard above the noise of the power looms. Visitors to the mill routinely referred to the sound of the machines as "deafening."
Girls had to keep their hair pulled back so it did not get caught in the machines, resulting in serious injury—or death.
This girl is straightening threads as they enter the power loom, a job that cut her hands.

Windows were rarely opened, to prevent air from blowing the threads. The result is a hot, stuffy room.
The air is dirty and causes breathing problems. One visitor remarked, "The atmosphere... is charged with cotton filaments and dust, which... are very injurious to the lungs."

MAGAZINE ARTICLE
Sarah G. Bagley and Workers' Rights
Lowell girl Sarah G. Bagley wrote magazine articles and made speeches about working in the mills. She organized workers to help change conditions.
Bagley says that mill girls work to help their family members.
Bagley believes that most mill girls would leave their jobs if they could.
//IS anyone such a fool as to suppose that out of six thousand factory girls in Lowell, sixty would be there if they could help it? Whenever I raise the point that it is immoral to shut us up in a close room twelve hours a day in the most monotonous and tedious of employment I am told that we have come to the mills voluntarily and we can leave when we will. Voluntarily!..
. the whip which brings us to Lowell is necessity. We must have money; a father's debts are to be paid, an aged mother to be supported, a brother's ambition to be aided and so the factories are supplied. Is this to act from free will?... Is this freedom? To my mind it is slavery//

—Lucy Larcom, from A New England Girlhood Mill life was hard, however. The work-
day was between 12 and 14 hours long, and daily life was carefully controlled. Ringing bells ordered workers to breakfast or lunch. Employees had to work harder and faster to keep up with new equipment. Cotton dust also began to cause health problems, such as chronic cough, for workers.
THE IMPACT
TODAY
READING CHECK .
In the 1950s, labor union membership reached its peak; about 40 percent of the workforce belonged to unions. Today only about 11 percent of the working population belongs to a labor union.
Contrasting How was the Lowell system different from the Rhode Island system?
Workers Organize
Factories continued to spread in the 1800s. Craftspeople, who made goods by hand, felt threatened. Factories quickly produced low-priced goods. To compete with factories, shop owners had to hire more workers and pay them less. Shoemaker William Frazier complained about the situation in the mid-1840s. "We have to sit on our seats from twelve to sixteen hours per day, to earn one dollar."
The wages of factory workers also went down as people competed for jobs. A wave of immigration in the 1840s brought people from other, poorer countries. They were willing to work for low pay. More immigrants came to the Northeast, where the mills were located, than to the South. Competition for jobs also came from people unemployed during the financial Panic of 1837. For example, about 50,000 workers in New York City alone lost their jobs.
The Beginning of Trade Unions
Facing low wages and the fear of losing their jobs, skilled workers formed trade unions, groups that tried to improve pay and working conditions. Eventually, unskilled factory workers also formed trade unions. Most employers did not want to hire union workers. Employers believed that the higher cost of union employees prevented competition with other manufacturers.
Sometimes labor unions staged protests called strikes. Workers on strike refuse to work until employers meet their demands. Most early strikes were not successful, however. Courts and police usually supported companies, not striking union members.
394 CHAPTER 12
Labor Reform Efforts
A strong voice in the union movement was that of millworker Sarah G. Bagley. She founded the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association in 1844 and publicized the struggles of factory laborers. The association's two main goals were to influence an investigation of working conditions by the Massachusetts state legislature and to obtain a 10-hour workday. Members of the association passed out pamphlets and circulated petitions.
President Martin Van Buren had granted a 10-hour workday in 1840 for many federal employees. Bagley wanted this rule to apply to employees of private businesses. These men and women often worked 12 to 14 hours per day, six days per week.
Many working men and women supported the 10-hour-workday campaign, despite the opposition of business owners. In 1845 Sarah Bagley was elected vice president of the New England Working Men's Association. She was the first woman to hold such a high-ranking position in the American labor movement.
Over time, the unions achieved some concrete legal victories. Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and a few other states passed 10-hour-workday laws.
For factory workers in other states, long hours remained common. One witness described how children were "summoned by the factory bell before daylight" and worked until eight o'clock at night "with nothing but [a] recess of forty-five minutes to get their dinner." Union supporters continued to fight for work reforms such as an end to child labor in factories during the 1800s.

Now there are plans to build a railroad westward from Chicago, 200 miles to the east. The tracks will come through your town! Twice a week, trains will bring goods from the city and take people farther west.
How would the railroad change your life?
I BUILDING BACKGROUND
The Industrial Revolution changed how I goods were made. It brought great changes in the ways that many * Americans lived. But developments in technology led to major changes f in other areas of life, too. Newforms of transportation would bring » remote parts of America closer together. 
Trade and Daily Life
During the 1800s the United States was transformed by a Transportation Revolution—a period of rapid growth in the speed and convenience of travel because of new methods of transportation. The Transportation Revolution created a boom in business across the country, particularly by reducing shipping time and costs. As one foreign observer declared in 1835, "The Americans ... have joined the Hudson to the Mississippi, and made the Atlantic Ocean communicate with the Gulf of Mexico."
These improvements were made possible largely by the invention of two new forms of transportation: the steamboat and steam-powered trains. They enabled goods, people, and information to travel rapidly and efficiently across the United States. Suddenly people across the nation could buy manufactured items and even food products unavailable to them before. This boosted industry and agriculture, which created a need for more labor. In the North this meant that more people could find jobs in factories. In the South, slavery became even more important to support the

economy. Steam-powered ships soon connected the United States with European mar kets, spurring the economy even more.

Finding Main Ideas What benefits did the Transportation Revolution bring to trade and daily life?
Steamboats
American and European inventors had developed steam-powered boats in the late 1700s. However, they were not in wide use until the early 1800s.
Steamboat Era
In 1803 American Robert Fulton tested his first steamboat design in France. Several years later, he tested the first full-sized commercial steamboat, called the Clermont, in the United States. On August 9,1807, the Clermont traveled against the current up the Hudson River without trouble. Demand for steamboat ferry service soon arose.
The steamboat was well suited for river
travel. It could move upriver and did not rely
on wind power. Steamboats increased trade
and profits because goods could be moved quickly and thus more cheaply. More than 500 steamboats were in use in the United States by 1840. By the 1850s, steamboats were also being used to carry people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean.
Gibbons v. Ogden
Increased steamboat shipping led to conflict over waterway rights. In 1819 Aaron Ogden sued Thomas Gibbons for operating steamboats in New York waters that Ogden said he owned. Gibbons did not have a license to operate in New York, but argued that his federal license gave him the right to use New York waterways.
In the case of Gibbons v. Ogden, which reached the Supreme Court in 1824, the Court reinforced the federal government's authority to regulate trade between the states by ending monopolistic control over waterways in several states. The ruling freed up waters to even greater trade and shipping. Almost

What the steamboat did for water travel, the train did for overland travel. Steam-powered trains had first been developed in Great Britain in the early 1800s. However, they did not become popular in the United States until the 1830s. In 1830 Peter Cooper built a small but powerful locomotive called the Tom Thumb. He raced the locomotive against a horse-drawn railcar. Eyewitness John Latrobe later described the race, in which Tom Thumb had a slow start and fell behind. Latrobe wrote, "The pace increased, the passengers shouted, the engine gained on the horse ... then the engine passes the horse, and a great hurrah hailed the victory." Unfortunately for Coo-
per, victory was spoiled when Tom Thumb broke down and lost the race near the end.
Despite the defeat, the contest showed the power and speed of even a small locomotive. Railroad fever soon spread. By 1840 railroad companies had laid about 2,800 miles of track—more than existed in all of Europe. French economist Michel Chevalier described Americans as having "a perfect passion for railroads."
As more railroads were built, engineers and mechanics overcame many tough challenges. Most British railroads, for example, ran on straight tracks across flat ground. In the United States, however, many railroads had to run up and down steep mountains, around tight curves, and over swift rivers. Railroad companies also built the tracks quickly and often with the least expensive materials available. As time went on, engineers and mechanics built heavier, faster, and more powerful steam locomotives.
By 1860 about 30,000 miles of railroad linked almost every major city in the eastern United States. As a result, the economy surged forward. For example, American loco-
The Steam Train
CONNECT TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Boiling water produces steam, which pushes pistons back and forth in a steam engine. These pistons are connected to rods that rotate the wheels of the locomotive.
Why does the train have a firebox?
As steam follows the path of the white arrows into the cylinder, the pressure pushes the piston in the direction of the large blue arrow. Connecting rods turn the wheel half a turn.
Q
When the small valve rod moves, the other valve is blocked, pushing steam into the other side of the cylinder. The pressure moves the piston in the direction of the large blue arrow and the wheel completes a turn. 398 CHAPTER 12
motives hauled more freight than those in any other country. The railroad companies quickly became some of the most powerful businesses in the nation. As the railroad system grew, manufacturers and farmers could send their goods to distant markets.
In addition to their tremendous economic impact, the railroads made a powerful impression on the senses of passengers and observers. Trains were the fastest form of transportation most people had ever experienced. While wagons often traveled less than 2 miles per hour, locomotives averaged about 20 miles per hour. Writer George Templeton Strong of New York City described the thrill of a steam train passing by in the night:
^Whizzing and rattling and panting, with its fiery furnace gleaming in front, its chimney vomiting fiery smoke above, and its long train of cars rushing along behind like the body and tail of a
gigantic dragon—... and all darting forward at the rate of twenty miles an hour. Whewl"
—George Templeton Strong, quoted in The Market Revolution by Charles Sellers
Riding on the early trains was often an adventure, but it could also be quite dangerous. Engineers trying to stay on time sometimes traveled too fast. English citizen Charles Richard Weld was on a railroad car that flew off the tracks. To his amazement, the other passengers did not complain about the accident. Instead, they praised the engineer for trying to keep on schedule!
Passengers accepted such risks because the railroads reduced travel time dramatically. Railroads also helped tie communities together. In 1847 Senator Daniel Webster spoke for many people in the United States when he declared that the railroad "towers above all other inventions of this or the preceding age."

TODAY
In 1883 four standard time zones were introduced in the United States to help railroads offer uniform train schedules. Today travelers might cross one or more time zones in a single airplane flight.

Transportation Revolution Brings Changes
The Transportation Revolution brought many changes to America. Steamboats and railroads made getting goods to distant markets much easier and less costly. International markets expanded, and Europe began to rely on southern cotton for its textile industry. People in all areas of the nation now had access to products made and grown far away. More than ever before, there was a national economy. The wealth, however, was centered in the North. The structure of the economy adjusted with the increase in availability of goods. The relationship between customers, business owners, and workers changed as people had more money to buy an increased selection of items. Both factory and agricultural workers were able to call for higher wages.
Railroads contributed to the expansion of the borders of the nation and guided
population growth. Towns sprang up at railroad junctions. Those towns that did not have railroads nearby suffered. Cities grew as trains brought new residents and raw materials for industry and construction. The growing prosperity of the nation, especially in the North, encouraged Americans to take pride in their country.
A
New Fuel The Transportation Revolution also increased the use of certain natural resources that had not been important until then. Throughout the early Transportation Revolution, wood was the primary source of fuel for trains and steamboats, as well as for cooking, light, and heat. As faster locomotives were built, coal replaced wood as the main source of power. A half ton of coal produces as much energy as two tons of wood but at half the cost. Coal also became popular for heating homes. Railroads transported the coal from mines to towns and cities.
400 CHAPTER 12
As the demand for coal increased, a coalmining industry developed in many states, including Pennsylvania, western Virginia, and Illinois. Coal mining changed the landscape in a number of ways. New towns, such as Coal City and Carbondale in Illinois, sprang up in places where coal deposits could be mined. Miners made deep gashes in the earth removing the coal.
Later, in the 1870s, the demand for coal increased as the demand for steel grew. Steel is made through a smelting process—heating iron ore to very high temperatures. Coal was used to fire the furnaces. Steel, which is much stronger than iron, was increasingly used to build factories and the machines they produced. Steel was also used to make the rails that trains ride on.
The growing market for steel helped fuel the need for more railroads. Railroads transported steel to places where new factories were being built. Railroads also brought new steel farming tools and machines to farmers in the Midwest. Using the new equipment, farmers produced more crops. Railroads then transported their harvests to markets.
Effects of Railroads
The railroads also played a role in the growth of other businesses. The logging industry expanded as people in the growing towns and cities needed wood for houses and furniture. Lumber items became the primary product of New England. Settlers spreading out across the Midwest cut down trees and plowed up prairies to make farmland. Deforestation, or cutting down and removing trees, took place on a large scale.
Railroads also caused cities to grow. Some cities became transportation hubs. Chicago was one such city. Its location on Lake Michigan made it an ideal transportation hub, linking the Midwest to the East and South.

Telegraph Speeds Communication
In 1832 Samuel F. B. Morse perfected the telegraph—a device that could send information over wires across great distances. To develop the telegraph, Morse studied electricity and magnetism. In time, Morse put the work of other scientists together in a practical machine.

402 CHAPTER 12
The telegraph sent pulses, or surges, of electric current through a wire. The telegraph operator tapped a bar that controlled the length of each pulse. At the other end of the wire, these pulses were changed into clicking sounds. A short click was called a dot. A long click was called a dash. Morse's partner, Alfred Lewis Vail, developed a system known as Morse code—different combinations of dots and dashes that represent each letter of the alphabet. For example, dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot is the distress signal called SOS.
Several years passed before Morse was able to connect two locations with telegraph wires. People doubted his machine. Some did not think that he was reading messages sent from miles away.
Morse's break came during the 1844 Democratic National Convention. A telegraph wired news of the presidential candidate's nomination to politicians in Washington. The waiting politicians responded, "Three cheers for the telegraph!" Telegraphs were soon sending and receiving information for businesses, the government, newspapers, and private citizens.
The telegraph grew with the railroad. Telegraph companies strung their wires on poles along railroads across the country. They established telegraph offices in many train stations. Thousands of miles of telegraph line were added every year in the 1850s. The first transcontinental line was finished

Samuel F. B. Morse
(1791-1872)
Like steamboat creator Robert Fulton, Samuel F. B. Morse began his career as a painter rather than as an inventor. In 1832 Morse was a widower struggling to raise his three children alone. He became interested in the idea of sending messages electrically. Morse hoped he could invent a device that would earn enough to support his family. Eventually, the telegraph made Morse extremely wealthy.
Drawing Conclusions What motivated Morse to invent the telegraph?
in 1861. By the time he died in 1872, Morse was famous across the United States.
With the spread of telegraph lines, people could relay information and news more quickly. The economy of the nation became even more unified as businesses used the telegraph to conduct financial transactions with distant partners. Cities, especially in the West, grew rapidly because of the increased economic opportunities available to distant businesses. The territories of the United States began filling with people farther and farther west.

Identifying Cause and Effect
What effect did the telegraph have on cross-country communications?
Steam-Powered Factories
During the Industrial Revolution, factories began to rely on steam power instead of waterpower. This shift brought major changes to the nation's industries. Water-powered factories had to be built near streams or waterfalls. In contrast, steam power allowed business owners to build factories almost anywhere. Yet the Northeast was still home to most of the nation's industry. By 1860 New England alone had as many factories as the entire South did.
Some companies decided to build their factories closer to cities and transportation centers. This provided easier access to workers, allowing businesses to lower wages. Being closer to cities also reduced shipping costs. Cities soon became the center of industrial growth. People from rural areas and foreign countries flocked to the cities for jobs.
Factory workers improved the designs of many kinds of machines. Mechanics invented tools that could cut and shape metal, stone, and wood with great precision. By the 1840s this new machinery was able to produce interchangeable parts. Within a short period of time, the growing machine-tool industry was even making customized equipment.
New businesses were also aided by government policies that favored free trade. There was little regulation of businesses, and taxes were designed to benefit business owners. Many Americans supported these governmental policies because they want-

ed to benefit from the growing economy themselves. Thousands of new businesses were established, many to market the new inventions that were being introduced every day. Although these businesses often failed, they spurred technological innovation and entrepreneurship.
Finding Main Ideas What
changes resulted from the shift to steam power?
Improved Farm Equipment
During the 1830s, technology began transforming the farm as well as the factory. In 1837 blacksmith John Deere saw that friends in Illinois had difficulty plowing thick soil with iron plows. He thought a steel blade might work better. His design for a steel plow was a success. By 1846 Deere was selling 1,000 plows per year.
In 1831 Cyrus McCormick developed a new harvesting machine, the mechanical reaper, which quickly and efficiently cut down wheat. He began mass producing his reapers in a Chicago factory. McCormick used new methods to encourage sales. His company advertised, gave demonstrations, and provided a repair and spare parts department. He also let customers buy on credit.
The combination of Deere's plow and McCormick's reaper allowed Midwestern farmers to plant and harvest huge crop fields. By 1860, U.S. farmers were producing more than 170 million bushels of wheat and more than 800 million bushels of corn per year.

Summary and Preview New machines I and inventions changed the way Americans lived and did business in the early 1800s. In the next chapter you will learn how agri- cultural changes affected the South.
New inventions, such as cell phones, laptop computers, and wireless Internet, continue to make life easier and more convenient for people today.
The sewing machine, first invented by Elias Howe, a factory apprentice in Lowell, Massachusetts, was one of these conveniences. Isaac Singer then made improvements to Howe's design. Like McCormick, Singer allowed customers to buy his machines on credit and provided service. By 1860 Singer's company was the world's largest maker of sewing machines.
Other advances improved on everyday items. In the 1830s, iceboxes cooled by large blocks of ice became available. Iceboxes stored fresh food safely for longer periods. Iron cookstoves began replacing cooking fires and stone hearths.
Companies also began to mass produce earlier inventions. This allowed many families to buy household items, such as clocks, that they could not afford in the past. For example, a clock that cost $50 in 1800 was

Bias
[ Define the Skill
Everyone has firmly held beliefs. However, when we let our beliefs automatically slant or shape our point of view on topics, we may be showing bias. Bias is a fixed idea or opinion about someone or something. Some bias is based on a set of ideas about a group to which the person or thing belongs. This type of bias is called a stereotype. If the group is defined by race, religion, age, gender, or similar characteristics, the bias is known as prejudice.
Learn the Skill
Not all beliefs are biases, even if those beliefs are strongly held. Biases are beliefs that have little or no evidence to support them. The more unreasonable a person's view is in light of facts and evidence, the more likely it is that the belief is a bias.
Another characteristic of bias is the person's reluctance to question his or her belief if it is challenged by evidence. Sometimes people stubbornly cling to views that overwhelming evidence proves wrong. This is why bias is defined as a "fixed" idea or opinion. One of the most damaging effects of bias, and a good reason for trying to avoid it, is that it can prevent us from learning new things.
Bias sometimes appears in written, oral, and visual material. Authors may include bias accidentally or in order to sway people's opinions on a topic. To recognize bias in a source, you can follow the steps below.
1.	Identify the author or creator of the source. Consider the author's background and determine if he or she is an authority on the topic.
2.	Identify the author's purpose, point of view, and frame of reference. Information about the author and the source may help you determine the source's reliability and validity.
3.	Examine the language used in the source.
Look for stereotypes and opinions in the source. Sources that lack objectivity and specific facts may be biased.
4.	Determine if the source is valid and reliable. Compare the source with other information on the topic to determine whether the source contains more facts or more opinions.
Practice the Skill

Cotton had been grown in the New World for centuries, but it had not been a very profitable crop. Before cotton could be spun into thread for weaving into cloth, the seeds had to be removed from the cotton fibers.
Long-staple cotton, also called black-seed cotton, was fairly easy to process. Workers could pick the seeds from the cotton with relative ease. But long-staple cotton grew well in only a few places in the South. More common was short-staple cotton, which was also known as green-seed cotton. Removing the seeds from this cotton was difficult and time consuming. A worker could spend an entire day picking the seeds from a single pound of short-staple cotton.

Growth of the Cotton Industry
If YOU were there...
You are a field-worker on a cotton farm in the South in about 1800. Your job is to separate the seeds from the cotton fibers. It is dull, tiring work because the tiny seeds are tangled in the fibers. Sometimes it takes you a whole day just to clean one pound of cotton! Now you hear that someone has invented a machine that can clean cotton 50 times faster than by hand.
How might this machine change your life?

BUILDING BACKGROUND
Sectional differences had always existed between different regions of the United States. The revolutionary changes in industry and transportation deepened the differences between North and South. The South remained mainly agricultural. New technology helped the region become the Cotton Kingdom. Reviving the South's Economy
Before the American Revolution, three crops dominated southern agriculture—tobacco, rice, and indigo. These crops, produced mostly by enslaved African Americans, played a central role in the southern economy and culture.
After the American Revolution, however, prices for tobacco, rice, and indigo dropped. When crop prices fell, the demand for and the price of slaves also went down. In an effort to protect their incomes, many farmers tried, with little success, to grow other crops that needed less labor. Soon, however, cotton would transform the southern economy and greatly increase the demand for slave labor.
Cotton Becomes Profitable
Cotton had been grown in the New World for centuries, but it had not been a very profitable crop. Before cotton could be spun into thread for weaving into cloth, the seeds had to be removed from the cotton fibers.
414 CHAPTER 13
Cotton Gin
CONNECT TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Eli Whitney's cotton gin enabled workers to easily remove seeds from cotton fibers. The result was a dramatic increase in cotton production in the South.
How did the cotton gin remove seeds from cotton fibers?
o The operator turned the crank.
Q
The crank turned a roller with teeth that stripped the seeds away from the cotton fiber. Q
Brushes on a second roller lifted the seedless cotton off the teeth of the first cylinder and dropped it out of the machine. © A belt connected the rollers so that they would both turn when the crank was turned.
Long-staple cotton, also called black-seed cotton, was fairly easy to process. Workers could pick the seeds from the cotton with relative ease. But long-staple cotton grew well in only a few places in the South. More common was short-staple cotton, which was also known as green-seed cotton. Removing the seeds from this cotton was difficult and time consuming. A worker could spend an entire day picking the seeds from a single pound of short-staple cotton.
By the early 1790s the demand for American cotton began increasing rapidly. For instance, in Great Britain, new textile factories needed raw cotton that could be used for
making cloth, and American cotton producers could not keep up with the high demand for their cotton. These producers of cotton needed a machine that could remove the seeds from the cotton more rapidly.
Eli Whitney's Cotton Gin
Northerner Eli Whitney finally patented such a machine in 1793. The year before, Whitney had visited a Georgia plantation owned by Catherine Greene where workers were using a machine that removed seeds from long-staple cotton. This machine did not work well on short-staple cotton, and Greene asked Whitney if he could improve it. By the next spring, Whitney had perfected his design for the cotton gin, a machine that removes seeds from short-staple cotton. ("Gin" is short for engine.) The cotton gin used a hand-cranked cylinder with wire teeth to pull cotton fibers from the seeds.
THE IMPACT
TODAY
The same patent law that protected Whitney's invention of the cotton gin protects the rights of inventors today.
Whitney hoped to keep the design of the gin a secret, but the machine was so useful that his patent was often ignored by other manufacturers. Whitney described how his invention would improve the cotton business.
THE SOUTH 4
'^One man will clean ten times as much cotton as he can in any other way before known and also clean it much better than in the usual mode [method]. This machine may be turned by water or with a horse, with the greatest ease, and one man and a horse will do more than fifty men with the old machines/^
—Eli Whitney, quoted in Eli Whitney and the Birth of American Technology by Constance McLaughlin Green
Whitney's gin revolutionized the cotton industry. Planters—large-scale farmers who held more than 20 slaves—built cotton gins that could process tons of cotton much faster than hand processing. A healthy crop almost guaranteed financial success because of high demand from the textile industry.

Drawing Conclusions
What effects did the cotton gin have on the southern economy?
The Cotton Boom
Whitney's invention of the cotton gin made cotton so profitable that southern fanners abandoned other crops in favor of growing cotton. The removal of Native Americans opened up more land, while the development of new types of cotton plants helped spread cotton production throughout the South as far west as Texas. This area of high cotton production became known as the cotton belt.
Production increased rapidly—from about 2 million pounds in 1791 to roughly a billion pounds by 1860. As early as 1840, the United States was producing more than half of the cotton grown in the entire world. The economic boom attracted new settlers, built up wealth among wealthy white southerners, and firmly put in place the institution of slavery in the South.
Cotton Belt
Cotton had many advantages as a cash crop. It cost little to market. Unlike food staples, harvested cotton could be stored for a long time. Because cotton was lighter than other staple crops, it also cost less to transport long distances.
Farmers eager to profit from growing cotton headed west to find land. Farmers also began to apply scientific methods to improve crop production. Cotton had one disadvantage as a crop—it rapidly used up the nutrients in the soil. After a few years, cotton could make the land useless for growing anything. Some agricultural scientists recommended crop rotation—changing the crop grown on a particular plot of land every few years. Different crops needed different nutrients, so crop rotation would keep the land fertile longer. Other agricultural scientists began to study soil chemistry, in an effort to keep the land rich and productive.
As the cotton belt grew, farmers continued trying to improve the crop. Agricultural scientists worked at crossbreeding short-staple cotton with other varieties. As a result, new, stronger types of cotton were soon growing throughout the cotton belt. This led to expansion of the cotton industry through the 1860s.
The cotton boom involved much more than growing and harvesting cotton. Harvested cotton had to be ginned, pressed into bales, and then shipped to market or to warehouses. Special agents helped do everything from marketing cotton to customers to insuring crops against loss or damage. Factories were built to produce items needed by cotton farmers, such as ropes to bale cotton.
Growing and harvesting cotton required many field hands. Rather than pay wages to free workers, planters began to use more slave labor. Congress had made bringing slaves into the United States illegal in 1808. However, the growing demand for slaves led to an increase in the slave trade within the United States.
Cotton Trade
In an 1858 speech before the U.S. Senate, South Carolina politician James Henry Hammond declared, "Cotton is King!" Without cotton, Hammond claimed, the global economy would fail. He believed that southern cotton was one of the most valuable resources in the world. Southern cotton was used to make cloth in England and the North. Many southerners shared Hammond's viewpoints about cotton. Southerner David Christy declared, "King cotton is a profound [leamed] statesman, and knows what measures will best sustain [protect] his throne."
The cotton boom made the South a major player in world trade. Great Britain became the South's most valued foreign trading partner. Southerners also sold tons of cotton to the growing textile industry in the northeastern United States. This increased trade led to the growth of major port cities in the South, including Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and New , Orleans, Louisiana.
In these cities, crop brokers called factors managed the cotton trade. Farmers sold their cotton to merchants, who then made deals with the factors. Merchants and factors also arranged loans for farmers who needed to buy supplies. They often advised farmers on how to invest profits. Once farmers got their cotton to the port cities, factors arranged for transportation aboard trading ships.
However, shipping cotton by land to port cities was very difficult in the South. The few major road projects at the time were limited to the Southeast. Most southern farmers had to ship their goods on the region's rivers. On the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, flatboats and steamboats carried cotton and other products to port. Eventually, hundreds of steamboats traveled up and down the mighty Mississippi River each day.

i The South's Cotton Economy
Eli Whitney's cotton gin began the cotton boom. Soon, the Cotton Kingdom stretched across the South. For the cotton planters to succeed, they had to get their cotton to market.

Enslaved African Americans did most of the planting, harvesting, and processing of cotton.
Other Crops and Industries
Some leaders worried that the South was depending too much on cotton. They wanted southerners to try a variety of cash crops and investments. These leaders wanted the South to become more self-sufficient, instead of relying on the North and foreign countries for basic items. In addition to a more successful economy, this kind of variety would make the South less susceptible to tariff policies.

Food and Cash Crops
One such crop was corn, the primary southern food crop. By the late 1830s the top three corn-growing states in the nation were all in the South. The South's other successful food crops included rice, wheat, and sugarcane.
Production of tobacco, the South's first major cash crop, was very time consuming because tobacco leaves had to be cured, or dried, before they could be shipped to market. In 1839 a slave discovered a way to improve the drying process. The faster curing process increased tobacco production.
Partly as a result of the cotton boom, hemp and flax also became major cash crops. Their fibers were used to make rope and sackcloth used to bundle cotton into bales.
Industry
Many of the first factories in the South were built to serve farmers' needs by processing crops such as sugarcane. In 1803 the nation's first steam-powered sawmill was built in Donaldsonville, Louisiana. This new technology enabled lumber companies to cut, sort, and clean wood quickly.
By the 1840s, entrepreneurs in Georgia began investing in cotton mills. In 1840, there were 14 cotton mills; by the mid-1850s, there were more than 50. A few mill owners followed the model established by Francis Cabot Lowell. However, most built small-scale factories on the falls of a river for waterpower. A few steam-powered mills were built in towns without enough waterpower.
Southerners such as Hinton Rowan Helper encouraged industrial growth in the South.
^We should... keep pace with the progress of the age. We must expand our energies, and acquire habits of enterprise and industry; we should rouse ourselves from the couch of lassitude [laziness] and inure [set] our minds to thought and our bodies to action/'
— Hinton Rowan Helper, The Impending Crisis of the South: How to Meet It
418 CHAPTER 13
Textile mills in Great Britain were the largest foreign buyers of southern cotton.
Joseph R. Anderson followed Helper's advice. In 1848 Anderson became the owner of the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, Virginia—one of the most productive iron works in the nation. It was the only factory to produce bridge materials, cannons, steam engines, and other products.
Industry, however, remained a small part of the southern economy. Southern industry faced stiff competition from the North and from England, both of which could produce many goods more cheaply. And as long as agricultural profits remained high, southern investors preferred to invest in land.

w TAKING NOTES
BUILDING BACKGROUND
Although the South had some industry, agriculture was the heart of the southern economy. Cotton was king. As a result, wealthy plantation families were the most prominent social class in southern society. Small farmers, however, made up the largest part of the population. Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the different segments of southern society.
Southern Society and Culture
Popular fiction often made it seem that all white southerners had many slaves and lived on large plantations. Many fiction writers wrote about wealthy southern families who had frequent, grand parties. The ideal image of the Antebellum (before the war) South included hospitality and well-treated slaves on beautiful plantations that almost ran themselves.
This romantic view was far from the reality. During the first half of the 1800s, only about one-third of white southern families had slaves. Fewer families had plantations. Despite their small numbers, these planters had a powerful influence over the South. The economy of the South was dependent on agriculture, and most of the agricultural production relied on slave plantations. Many plantation owners served as political leaders. They led a society made up of many different kinds of people, including yeomen farmers, poor whites, slaves, and free African Americans. Each of these segments of society contributed to the economic success of the South.
420 CHAPTER 13
Planters
As the wealthiest members of southern society, planters also greatly influenced the economy. Some showed off their wealth by living in beautiful mansions. Many others chose to live more simply. A visitor described wealthy planter Alexander Stephens's estate as "an old wooden house" surrounded by weeds. Some planters saved all of their money to buy more land and slaves.
Male planters were primarily concerned with raising crops and supervising slave laborers. They left the running of the plantation household to their wives. The planter's wife oversaw the raising of the children and supervised the work of all slaves within the household. Slave women typically cooked, cleaned, and helped care for the planter's children. Wives also took on the important

social duties of the family. For example, many southern leaders discussed political issues at the dances and dinners hosted by their wives.
Planters often arranged their children's marriages based on business interests. Lucy Breckinridge, the daughter of a wealthy Virginia planter, was married by arrangement in 1865. Three years earlier, she had described in her journal how she dreaded the very thought of marriage. "A woman's life after she is married, unless there is an immense amount of love, is nothing but suffering and hard work." How Breckinridge's life in her own arranged marriage would have turned out cannot be known. She died of typhoid fever just months after her wedding.
African American in this picture be different from that of staves in the South?

Yeomen and Poor Whites
Most white southerners were yeomen, owners of small farms. Yeomen owned few slaves or none at all. The typical farm averaged 100 acres. Yeomen took great pride in their work. In 1849 a young Georgia man wrote, "I desire above all things to be a 'Farmer.' It is the most honest, upright, and sure way of securing all the comforts of life."
Yeoman families, including women and children, typically worked long days at a variety of tasks. Some yeomen held a few slaves but worked alongside them.
The poorest of white southerners lived on land that could not grow cash crops. They survived by hunting, fishing, raising small gardens, and doing odd jobs for money.
Religion and Society
Most white southerners shared similar religious beliefs. Because of the long distances between farms, families often saw their neighbors only at church events, such as revivals or socials. Rural women often played volunteer roles in their churches. Wealthy white southerners thought that their religion justified their position in society and the institution of
slavery. They argued that God created some people, like themselves, to rule others. This belief opposed many northern Christians' belief that God was against slavery.
Urban Life
Many of the largest and most important cities in the South were strung along the Atlantic coast and had begun as shipping centers. Although fewer in number, the southern cities were similar to northern cities. City governments built public water systems and provided well-maintained streets. Public education was available in a few places. Wealthy residents occasionally gave large sums of money to charities, such as orphanages and public libraries. Southern urban leaders wanted their cities to appear as modern as possible.
As on plantations, slaves did much of the work in southern cities. Slaves worked as domestic servants, in mills, in shipyards, and at skilled jobs. Many business leaders held slaves or hired them from nearby plantations.

422 CHAPTER 13
Free African Americans and Discrimination
Although the vast majority of African Americans in the South were enslaved, more than 250,000 free African Americans lived in the region by 1860. Some were descendants of slaves who were freed after the American Revolution. Others were descendants of refugees from Toussaint L'Ouverture's Haitian Revolution in the late 1790s. Still others were former slaves who had run away, been freed by their slaveholder, or earned enough money to buy their freedom.
Free African Americans lived in both rural and urban areas. Most lived in the countryside and worked as paid laborers on plantations or farms. Free African Americans in cities often worked a variety of jobs, mostly as skilled artisans. Some, like barber William Johnson of Natchez, Mississippi, became quite successful in their businesses. Frequently, free African Americans, especially those in the cities, formed social and economic ties with one another. Churches often served as the center of their social lives.
Free African Americans faced constant discrimination from white southerners. Many
governments passed laws limiting the rights of free African Americans. Most free African Americans could not vote, travel freely, or hold certain jobs. In some places, free African Americans had to have a white person represent them in any business transaction. In others, laws restricted where they were allowed to live or conduct business.
Many white southerners argued that free
African Americans did not have the ability to take care of themselves, and they used this belief to justify the institution of slavery. "The status of slavery is the only one for which the African is adapted," wrote one white Mississippian. To many white southerners, the very existence of free African Americans threatened the institution of slavery.

What questions will you ask in your interviews?
B BUILDING BACKGROUND
While most white southern families were I not slaveholders, the southern economy depended on the work of 1 slaves. This was true not only on large plantations but also on smaller farms and in the cities. Few chances existed for enslaved African Americans to escape their hard lives.

Working in the Planter's Home
Some slaves worked as butlers, cooks, or nurses in the planter's home. These slaves often had better food, clothing, and shelter than field hands did, but they often worked longer hours. They had to serve the planter's family 24 hours a day.
Working at Skilled Jobs
On larger plantations, some enslaved African Americans worked at skilled jobs, such as blacksmithing or carpentry. Sometimes planters let these slaves sell their services to other people. Often planters collected a portion of what was earned but allowed slaves to keep the rest. In this way, some skilled slaves earned enough money to buy their freedom from their slaveholders. For example, William Ellison earned his freedom in South Carolina by working for wages as a cotton gin maker. For years, he worked late at night and on Sundays. He bought his freedom with the money he earned. Eventually, he was also able to buy the freedom of his wife and daughter.
Slaves and Work
Most enslaved African Americans lived in rural areas where they worked on farms and plantations. Enslaved people on small farms usually did a variety of jobs. On large plantations, most slaves were assigned to specific jobs, and most worked in the fields. Most slaveholders demanded that slaves work as much as possible. Supervisors known as drivers, who were sometimes slaves themselves, made sure that slaves followed orders and carried out punishments.
Working in the Field
Most plantation owners used the gang-labor system. In this system, all field hands worked on the same task at the same time. They usually worked from sunup to sundown. Former slave Harry McMillan had worked on a plantation in South Carolina. He recalled that the field hands usually did not even get a break to eat lunch. "You had to get your victuals [food] standing at your hoe," he remembered.
Men, women, and even children older than about 10 usually did the same tasks. Sickness and poor weather rarely stopped the work. "The times I hated most was picking cotton when the frost was on the bolls [seed pods]," recalled former Louisiana slave Mary Reynolds. "My hands git sore and crack open and bleed."

Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the slave system.
Life Under Slavery
Generally, slaveholders viewed slaves as property, not as people. Slaveholders bought and sold slaves to make a profit. The most common method of sale was at an auction. The auction itself determined whether families would be kept together or separated. Sometimes a buyer wanted a slave to fill a specific job, such as heavy laborer, carpenter, or blacksmith. The buyer might be willing to pay for the slave who could do the work, but not for that slave's family. Families would then be separated with little hope of ever getting back together.
Slave traders sometimes even kidnapped free African Americans and then sold them into slavery. For example, Solomon Northup,
a free African American, was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. He spent 12 years as a slave until he finally proved his identity and gained his release.
Living Conditions
Enslaved people often endured poor living conditions. Planters housed them in dirt-floor cabins with few furnishings and often leaky roofs. The clothing given to them was usually simple and made of cheap, coarse fabric. Some slaves tried to brighten up their

clothing by sewing on designs from discarded scraps of material. In this way, they expressed their individuality and personalized the clothing assigned to them by the planters.
Likewise, many slaves did what they could to improve their small food rations. Some planters allowed slaves to keep their own gardens for vegetables, and chickens for eggs.
Other slaves were able to add a little variety to their diet by fishing or picking wild berries.
Punishment and Slave Codes
Some planters offered more food or better living conditions to encourage slaves' obedience. However, most slaveholders used punishment instead.
Some would punish one slave in front of others as a warning to them all.
Harry McMillan recalled some of the punishments he had witnessed.
^The punishments were whipping, putting you in the stocks [wooden frames to
lock people in] and making you wear irons and a chain at work. Then they had a collar to put round your neck with two horns, like cows' horns, so that you could not lie down... Sometimes they dug a hole like a well with a door on top.
This they called a dungeon keeping you in it two or three weeks or a month, or sometimes till you died inthere/^
—Harry McMillan, quoted in Major Problems in the History of the American South, Volume I, edited by Paul D. Escott and David R. Goldfield
To further control slaves' actions, many states passed strict laws called slave codes. Some laws prohibited slaves from traveling far from their homes. Literacy laws in most southern states prohibited the education of slaves. Alabama, Virginia, and Georgia had laws that allowed the fining and whipping of anyone caught teaching enslaved people to read and write.

Slave Culture
Many enslaved Africans found comfort in their community and culture. They made time for social activity, even after exhausting workdays, in order to relieve the hardship of their lives. Although they were forced to immigrate to the United States, their culture is one of the foundations of the current national identity, especially in the worlds of music and religion.
Family and Community
Family was the most important aspect of slave communities, and many slaves feared separationmorethantheyfearedpunishment. Josiah Henson never forgot the day that he and his family were auctioned. His mother begged the slaveholder who bought her to buy Josiah, too. The slaveholder refused, and Henson's entire family was separated.

hoping to reach the freedom of the North. A failed escape attempt, however, could result in a cruel whipping—or worse.
r | .1 What different aspects of slavery are shown in these pictures?
Enslaved parents kept their heritage alive by passing down family histories as well as African customs and traditions. They also told folktales, or stories with a moral, to teach lessons about how to survive under slavery. Folktales often included a clever animal character called a trickster. The trickster—which often represented slaves—defeated a stronger animal by outwitting it. Folktales reassured slaves that they could survive by outsmarting more powerful slaveholders.
Religion
Religion also played an important part in slave culture. By the early 1800s many slaves were Christians. They came to see themselves, like the slaves in the Old Testament, as God's chosen people, much like the Hebrew slaves in ancient Egypt who had faith that they would someday live in freedom.
THE IMPACT
TODAY
Some slaves sang spirituals, emotional Christian songs that blended African and European music, to express their religious beliefs. For example, "The Heavenly Road" reflected slaves' belief in their equality in the eyes of God.
The musical influence of these inspirational slave songs can be heard today in gospel music.
^Come, my brother, if you never did pray, I hope you pray tonight;
For I really believe I am a child of God As I walk on the heavenly road/^
—Anonymous, quoted in Afro-American Religious History, edited by Milton C. Sernett
Slaves blended some aspects of their traditional African religions with those of the Christianity that the slaveholders followed. They worshipped in secret, out of sight of slaveholders. Some historians have called slave religion the invisible institution.

Seeds of Rebellion
Maintaining their own religious beliefs and practices was only one way in which enslaved people resisted slaveholders' attempts to control them completely. In small ways, slaves rebelled against the system daily. Sometimes they worked slower to protest long hours in the fields. Other times they ran away for a few days to avoid an angry slaveholder. Some slaves tried to escape permanently, but most left only for short periods, often to go and visit relatives.
Gaining freedom by escaping to the North was hard. If discovered, slaves were captured and sent back to their slaveholders, where they faced certain punishment or death. However, thousands of enslaved people succeeded in escaping.

Slave Uprisings
Although violent slave revolts were relatively rare, white southerners lived in fear of them. Two planned rebellions were stopped before they began. Gabriel Prosser planned a rebellion near Richmond, Virginia, in 1800. Denmark Vesey planned one in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1822. Local authorities executed most of those involved in planning these rebellions. Though Vesey was executed as the leader of the Charleston conspiracy, several accounts written after his death by anti-slavery writers claimed he was a hero.
The most violent slave revolt in the country occurred in 1831 and is known as Nat Turner's Rebellion. Nat Turner, a slave from Southampton County, Virginia, believed that God had told him to end slavery. On an August night in 1831, Turner led a group of slaves in a plan to kill all of the slaveholders and their families in the county. First, they
428 CHAPTER 13
attacked the family that held Turner as a slave. Soon they had killed about 60 white people in the community.
More than 100 innocent slaves who were not part of Turner's group were killed in an attempt to stop the rebellion. Turner himself led authorities on a chase around the countryside for six weeks. He hid in caves and in the woods before he was caught and brought to trial. Before his trial, Turner made a confession. He expressed his belief that the revolt was justified and worth his death: "I am willing to suffer the fate that awaits me." Turner was executed on November 11, 1831. After the rebellion, many states strengthened their slave codes. The new codes placed stricter control on enslaved people. Despite resistance, slavery continued to spread.

In 1831 a white southerner who had escaped the rebellion wrote a letter describing the mood of the area where Nat Turner had killed slaveholders.
//The oldest inhabitants of our county have never experienced such a distressing [terrible] time, as we have had since Sunday night last. The [slaves], about fifteen miles from this place, have massacred from 50 to 75 women and children, and some 8 or 10 men. Every house, room and corner in this place is full of women and children, driven from home, who had to take to the woods, until they could get to this place.

Interpreting and Creating Charts and Graphs
Define the Skill
Graphs and charts are drawings that classify and display mathematical data in a clear, visual format. There are three basic types of graphs. Line graphs and bargraphs plot changes in quantities over time. Bar graphs are also used to compare quantities within a category at a particular time. Pie charts have a similar use. The circle represents the whole of something, and the slices are a proportion of the whole.
Being able to interpret charts and graphs accurately lets you see and understand some relationships more easily than in tables or in written explanations. This is especially true if the information is detailed or the relationships are complicated.
[ Learn the Skill
The following guidelines will help you interpret data that is presented as a graph or chart.
1.	Read the title to identify the subject and purpose. Remember what each type is designed to indicate. Also note how the subject relates to any printed material that accompanies it.
2.	Study the parts. Pay close attention to the labels. Note the units of measure. Identify the categories used. If there are different colors on bars or lines in the graph, determine what those colors represent.
3.	Analyze the data. Note any increases or decreases in quantities. Look for trends, changes, and other relationships in the data.
4.	Apply the information. Use the results of your analysis to draw conclusions. Ask yourself what
generalizations can be made about the trends, changes, or relationships shown.
5.	To create a chart or graph, research the information you want to include. Then draw the chart based on the data you find, using labels, colors, and a title that explain the data.
The graph below is a double-line graph. It shows both changes and relationships over time. This type of graph allows you to see how changes in one thing compare with changes in something else. Apply the guidelines to interpret the graph and answer the questions that follow.

Focus on Themes The mid-1800s was a time of change in America. Society and culture changed for several reasons: thousands of immigrants arrived in America; women began to work hard for equal rights; and the North and South debated more and
more over the slavery issue. Religious beliefs helped shape people's views toward abolition—the move to end slavery—and women's suffrage—the move to give women the right to vote. This chapter discusses these issues.


Recognizing Implied Main Ideas
FOCUS
On Reading When you read, you will notice that not every paragraph has a main idea sentence. Sometimes the main idea is implied. Implied Main Ideas While main ideas give a basic structure to a paragraph, supporting details help convince the reader of the author's point. Main ideas can be presented in a sentence or simply implied. Usually, a paragraph without a main idea sentence will still have an implied main idea that ties the sentences together.
Notice how one reader found the main idea of the following paragraph.

Cities during this time were compact and
crowded. Many people lived close enough to their jobs that they could walk to work. Wagons carried goods down streets paved
with stones, making a noisy, busy scene.
One observer noted that the professionals
in New York City always had a "hurried
walk." (p. 440)
This description of cities makes it sound like cities had too many people.
This sentence describes cities as loud and busy.
This quote makes it sound like people in cities were always in a rush. I think the main idea is something like “Cities were crowded, loud, and fast-paced.”

If YOU were there...
It is 1850, and you are a German immigrant standing on the deck of a steamboat, crossing Lake Erie. Other immigrants are on board, but they are strangers to you. Soon, you will arrive at your new home in Cleveland, Ohio. You've been told that other Germans have settled there. You hope to find friends and work as a baker. Right now, America seems very big and very strange.
What would you expect from your new life in America?
Building Background The revolutions in industry, transportation, and technology were not the only major changes in the United States in the mid-1800s. Millions of immigrants, mostly from Europe, swelled the population. Some settled in the rich farmland of the Midwest, while others moved to cities.
Millions of Immigrants Arrive
In the mid-1800s, large numbers of immigrants crossed the Atlantic Ocean to begin new lives in the United States. More than 4 million of them settled in the United States between 1840 and 1860, most from Europe. More than 3 million of these immigrants arrived from Ireland and Germany. Many of them were fleeing economic or political troubles in their native countries.
Fleeing the Irish Potato Famine
Most immigrants from the British Isles during that period were Irish. In the mid-1840s, potato blight, a disease that causes rot in potatoes, left many families in Ireland with little food. More than a million Irish people died of starvation and disease. Even more fled to the United States.
Most Irish immigrants were very poor. Many settled in cities in Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. They worked at unskilled jobs in the cities or on building canals and
438 CHAPTER 14


railroads. Irish women often worked as domestic servants for wealthy families, laboring 16 or more hours per day. In 1849 a Boston health committee reported that low wages forced most Irish immigrants to live in poor housing.
Still, many immigrants enjoyed a new feeling of equality. Patrick Dunny wrote home to his family about this situation.
^People that cuts a great dash [style] at home... think it strange [in the United States] for the humble class of people to get as much respect as themselves/'
—Patrick Dunny, quoted in Who Built America?
by Bruce Levine etal.
A
Failed German Revolution Many Germans also came to the United States during this time. In the early 1800s, many Germans came to the United States to escape religious persecution. Then in 1848 some Germans staged a revolution against harsh
rule. Some educated Germans fled to the United States to escape persecution caused by their political activities. Most German immigrants, however, were working class, and they
■	came for economic reasons. The United States seemed to offer both greater economic opportunity and more freedom from government
■	control. While most Irish immigrants were
Catholics, German immigrant groups included Catholics, Jews, and Protestants.
German immigrants were more likely than the Irish to become farmers and live in rural areas. They moved to midwestem states where more land suited to agriculture was available. Unlike the Irish, a high percentage of German immigrants arrived in the United States with money. Despite their funds and skills, German immigrants often were forced to take low-paying jobs. Many German immigrants worked as tailors, seamstresses, bricklayers, servants, clerks, cabinetmakers, bakers, and food merchants.
THE IMPACT
TODAY
Many immigrants still come to the United States today. The United States has granted permanent resident status to an average of 1 million immigrants each year since 2000.

FOCUS ON
Reading What is the main idea of the paragraph to the right? Anti-Immigration Movements
Industrialization and the waves of people from Europe greatly changed the American labor force. While many immigrants went to the Midwest to get farmland, other immigrants filled the need for cheap labor in towns and cities. Industrial jobs in the Northeast attracted many people.
Yet a great deal of native-born Americans feared losing their jobs to immigrants who might work for lower wages. Some felt implicitly threatened by the new immigrants' cultures and religions. For example, before Catholic immigrants arrived, most Americans were Protestants. Conflicts between Catholics and Protestants in Europe caused American Protestants to mistrust Catholic immigrants. Those Americans and others who opposed immigration were called nativists.
In the 1840s and 1850s some nativists became politically active. An 1844 election flyer gave Americans this warning.
^Look at the... thieves and vagabonds [tramps] roaming our streets... monopolizing [taking] the business which properly belongs to our own native and true-born citizens. „
—Election flyer, quoted in Who Built America?
by Bruce Levine etal.
In 1849 nativists founded a political organization, the Know-Nothing Party, that supported measures making it difficult for foreigners to become citizens or hold office. Its members wanted to keep Catholics and immigrants out of public office. They also wanted to require immigrants to live in the United States for 21 years before becoming citizens. Know-Nothing politicians had some success getting elected during the 1850s. Later, disagreements over the issue of slavery caused the party to fall apart. As the immigrants assimilated to life in the United States, nativist complaints became less common.
Understanding Cause and
Effect Why did the Know-Nothing Party try to limit the rights of immigrants?
READING CHECK
Rapid Growth of Cities
The Industrial Revolution led to the creation of many new jobs in American cities. These city jobs drew immigrants from many nations as well as migrants from rural parts of the United States. The Transportation Revolution helped connect cities and made it easier for people to move to them. As a result of these two trends, American cities grew rapidly during the mid-1800s. Cities in the northeastern and Middle Atlantic states grew the most. By the mid-1800s, three-quarters of the country's manufacturing jobs were in these areas.
The rise of industry and the growth of cities changed American life. Those who owned their own businesses or worked in skilled jobs benefited most from those changes. The families of these merchants, manufacturers, professionals, and master craftspeople made up a growing social class. This new middle class was a social and economic level between the wealthy and the poor. Those in the new middle class built large, dignified homes that demonstrated their place in society.
In the growing cities, people found entertainment and an enriched cultural life. Many enjoyed visiting places such as libraries and clubs, or attending concerts or lectures. In the mid-1800s people also attended urban theaters. Favorite pastimes included bowling, boxing, and playing cards. The rules of baseball were formalized in 1845, and the game became increasingly popular.
Cities during this time were compact and crowded. Many people lived close enough to their jobs that they could walk to work. Wagons carried goods down streets paved with stones, making a noisy, busy scene. One observer noted that the professionals in New York City always had a "hurried walk."

Many city residents, particularly immigrants, lived in crowded, unsafe conditions. Many immigrants and other poor city dwellers
toilil worked long hours in factories at dangerous jobs.
Women—and frequently children-—labored all day in small rooms making clothing to be sold to the wealthy.
City streets were crowded with people buying, selling, and transporting goods.
The first floor of the building served many purposes— living quarters, kitchen, and work space. Here, garments were finished for sale.

IN AMERICA 44
Urban Problems
American cities in the mid-1800s faced many challenges due to rapid growth. Because public and private transportation was limited, city residents had to live near their workplaces. In addition, there was a lack of safe housing. Many city dwellers, particularly immigrants, could afford to live only in tenements—poorly designed apartment buildings that housed large numbers of people. These structures were often dirty, overcrowded, and unsafe.
Public services were also poor. The majority of cities did not have clean water, public health regulations, or healthful ways to get rid of garbage and human and animal waste. Under these conditions, diseases spread easily, and epidemics were common. In 1832 and 1849, for example, New York City suffered cholera epidemics that killed thousands.
City life held other dangers. As urban areas grew, they became centers of criminal activity. Most cities—including New York, Boston, and Philadelphia—had no permanent or organized force to fight crime. Instead, they relied on volunteer night watches, which offered little protection. Some of the violence was often
between various ethnic or racial groups, who had different economic and social goals. Immigrants often came from a mix of social classes, which also led to conflict among groups. Differences in political goals and opinions also led to disagreements between groups.
Fire was another constant and serious danger in crowded cities. There was little organized fire protection. Most cities were served by volunteer fire companies. Firefighters used hand pumps and buckets to put out fires. In addition, there were not enough sanitation workers and road maintenance crews. These shortages and flaws caused health and safety problems for many city residents.

expressing a quality or idea without reference to an actual thing
Emerson was a popular writer and thinker who argued that Americans should disregard institutions and follow their own beliefs. "What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think," he wrote in an essay called "Self-Reliance." Fuller edited the famous transcendentalist publication The Dial. Thoreau advised even stronger self-reliance and simple living away from society in natural settings. He wrote his book Walden after living for two years at Walden Pond. He also wrote the essay Civil Disobedience after spending a night in jail. He had been arrested for refusing to pay a tax, in protest of the Mexican-American War and its role in the spread of slavery.
Some transcendentalists formed a community at Brook Farm, Massachusetts, in the 1840s. It was one of many experiments with utopian communities, groups of people who tried to form a perfect society. People in utopian communities pursued abstract spirituality and cooperative lifestyles. Communities sprang up in New Harmony, Oneida, and elsewhere. However, few lasted for long.

Drawing Inferences
Why did utopian communities last a short time?
American Romanticism
Ideas about the simple life and nature also inspired painters and writers in the early and mid-1800s. Some joined the Romantic movement that had begun in Europe. Romanticism involved a great interest in nature, an emphasis on individual expression, and a rejection of many established rules. These painters and writers felt that each person brings a unique view to the world. They believed in using emotion to guide their creative output. Some Romantic artists, like Thomas Cole, painted the American landscape. Their works showed the beauty and wonder of nature in the United States. Their images contrasted with the huge cities and corruption of nature that many Americans saw as typical of Europe. American Romanticism allowed Americans to see themselves both as part of a European tradition of culture and as a new, unique culture.
Many female writers, like Ann Sophia Stephens, wrote historical fiction that was popular in the mid-1800s. New England writer Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote The Scarlet Letter during that period. One of the greatest classics of Romantic literature, it explored Puritan life in the 1600s. Hawthorne's friend Herman

Poe, also a short story writer, became famous for a haunting poem called "The Raven." Other gifted American poets included Emily Dickinson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Walt Whitman. Most of Dickinson's short, thoughtful poems were not published until after her death. Longfellow, the best-known poet of the mid-1800s, wrote popular story-poems, like The Song of Hiawatha. Whitman praised American individualism and democracy in his simple, unrhymed poetry. In his poetry collection Leaves of Grass, he wrote, "The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem."

Listen my children and you shall hear Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
Hardly a man is now alive
Who remembers that famous day and year. O

He said to his friend, "If the British march By land or sea from the town to-night,
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch Of the North Church tower as a signal light,— One if by land, and two if by sea;
And I on the opposite shore will be,
Ready to ride and spread the alarm Through every ... village and farm,
For the country folk to be up and to arm." ©
Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street Wanders and watches with eager ears,
Till in the silence around him he hears The muster of men at the barrack door,
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
And the measured tread of the grenadiers, Marching down to their boats on the shore. ©
446 CHAPTER 14
from Little Women
by Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888)
Guided Reading
About the Reading Little Women is a novel about four sisters living in a small New England town before the Civil War. Still popular with young people today, Little Women describes a family much like the one Louisa May Alcott grew up in. Alcott based the main character, Jo March, on herself. Like Alcott, Jo was different from most women of her time. She was outspoken, eager for adventure, and in conflict with the role her society expected her to play.
AS YOU READ J
Try to understand how Jo is different from Aunt March.
Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her offer was declined ...
The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo at a friend's,... she proposed to take her for a companion. O This did not suit Jo at all, but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared, and to everyone's surprise, got on remarkably well with her irascible relative ...
I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books, which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died ... The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and, best of all, the wilderness of books, in which she could wander where she liked, made the library a region of bliss to her ... ©
Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid. What it was she had no idea, as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and, meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, mn, and ride as much as she liked. © A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training she received at Aunt March's was just what she needed, and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual "Josy-phine!"

NEW MOVEMENTS IN
AMEf ICA 44' History and Geography
During the first half of the nineteenth century, daily life changed dramatically , because of new inventions, scientific discoveries, and technological advances. These developments affected the way people interacted with each other and acquired the basics of life.
Basic goods such as meat, flour, gloves, clocks, candles, and soap began to be manufactured outside of the home and sold to distant markets. Specific cities sometimes became known for particular items. The steamboats and railroads of the Transportation Revolution made these goods less expensive to ship, and therefore less expensive to buy.
People across the nation began to have the same products, leading to an increased sense that all Americans had access to the same quality of products.
Scientific Discoveries The first use of anesthetics improved medical care. Before safe painkillers were developed, many surgeries were impossible because of the severe pain they would cause. The first use of an anesthetic occurred in 1842, during a dental extraction. In 1844 the hypodermic syringe was invented, leading to better treatment of a variety of illnesses. Changes in medical care brought about by scientific discoveries continue to today, and they continue to improve daily life. Doctors today are able to perform organ transplants because of modern anesthetics, leading to longer lives for many.

Mass Production of
Everyday Goods Items that were once produced locally or by individual households became mass produced and sold across the nation. Soap, clocks, candles,clothing, furniture, needles, silverware, shoes, hats, door hinges and handles, guns—almost every basic item found in daily life began to be mass produced. It changed the way Americans made their livings and spent their free time.

TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to list the important events of the reform movements.
BDING BACKGROUND
Along with changes in American culture, I es were also taking place in American society. A religious revival the country. Reform-minded men and women tried to improve all aspects of society, from schools to taverns. Reforms in education opened up new opportunities for young women.	ij
Second Great Awakening
During the 1790s and early 1800s, some Americans took part in a Christian renewal movement called the Second Great Awakening. It swept through towns across upstate New York and through the frontier regions of Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and South Carolina. By the 1820s and 1830s, this new interest in religion had spread to New England and the South.
Charles Grandison Finney was one of the most important leaders of the Second Great Awakening. After experiencing a dramatic religious conversion in 1821, Finney left his career as a lawyer and began preaching. He challenged some traditional Protestant beliefs, telling congregations that each individual was responsible for his or her own salvation. He also believed that sin was avoidable. Finney held revivals, emotional prayer meetings that lasted for days. Many people converted to Christianity during these revivals. Finney told new converts to prove their faith by doing good deeds.
Finney's style of preaching and his ideas angered some traditional ministers, like Boston's Lyman Beecher. Beecher wanted to prevent Finney from holding revivals in his city. "You mean to
448 CHAPTER 14
carry a streak of fire to Boston. If you attempt it, as the Lord liveth, I'll meet you . . . and fight every inch of the way." Despite the opposition of Beecher and other traditional ministers, Finney's appeal remained powerful. Also, the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of religion prevented the government from passing laws banning the new religious practices. Ministers were therefore free to spread their message of faith and salvation to whoever wished to listen.
Due to the efforts of Finney and his followers, church membership across the country grew a great deal during the Second Great Awakening. Many new church members were women and African Americans. The African Methodist Episcopal Church spread across the Middle Atlantic states. Although the movement had begun in the Northeast and on the frontier, the Second Great Awakening renewed some people's religious faith throughout America.
Drawing Conclusions
What impact did the Second Great Awakening have on religion in America?
READING CHECK .
Social Reformers Speak Out
Renewed religious faith often led to movements to fix the problems of urban growth. One solution was political action. For example, in 1844 New York City created the first city police force.
Members of the growing middle class, especially women, often led the efforts. Many of the women did not work outside the home and hired servants to care for their households. This gave them time to work in reform groups. The 1830s to the 1850s were an era of many reform movements.
Temperance Movement
Many social reformers worked to prevent alcohol abuse. They believed that Americans drank too much. In the 1830s, on average, an American consumed seven gallons of alcohol per year. Countless Americans thought that alcohol abuse caused social problems, such as family violence, poverty, and criminal behavior.
Americans' worries about the effects of alcohol led to the growth of a temperance movement. This reform effort urged people to use self-discipline to stop drinking hard liquor.
Reform Movements
Reform movements in America included religious meetings called revivals, where preachers urged huge crowds of people to seek salvation. The
temperance movement, an effort to convince people to avoid drinking alcohol, promoted posters like the one shown here.
How might the scenes in this poster encourage people to stop drinking?

Reformers asked people to limit themselves to beer and wine in small amounts. Groups like the American Temperance Society and the American Temperance Union helped to spread the message. Minister Lyman Beecher spoke widely about the evils of alcohol. He claimed that people who drank alcohol were "neglecting the education of their families— and corrupting their morals."
THE IMPACT
TODAY
McGuffey's Readers were among the first "graded" textbooks. Organizing classes by grades was a new idea that is standard practice today.
Prison Reform
Another target of reform was the prison system. Dorothea Dix was a middle-class reformer who visited prisons throughout Massachusetts beginning in 1841. Dix reported that mentally ill people frequently were jailed with criminals. They were sometimes left in dark cells without clothes or heat and were chained to the walls and beaten. Dix spoke of what she saw to the state legislature.
In response, the Massachusetts government built facilities for the mentally ill. Dix's work had a nationwide effect. Eventually, more than 100 state hospitals were built to give mentally ill people professional care.
Prisons also held runaway children and orphans. Some had survived only by begging or stealing, and they got the same punishment as adult criminals. Boston mayor Josiah Quincy asked that young offenders receive different punishments than adults. In the 1820s, several state and local governments founded reform schools for children who had been housed in prisons. There, children lived under strict rules and learned useful skills.
Some reformers also tried to end the overcrowding and cruel conditions in prisons. Their efforts led to the creation of houses of correction. These institutions did not use punishment alone to change behavior. They also offered prisoners education.

Summarizing How did
reformers change the punishment of criminals?
Improvements in Education
Another challenge facing America in the early 1800s was poor public education. During this era, childhood was beginning to be viewed as a separate stage of life in which education was of the utmost importance in creating responsible citizens. However, many children worked in factories or on farms to help support their families. If children could read the Bible, write, and do simple math, that was often considered to be enough.
Education in the Early 1800s
The availability of education varied widely. New England had the most schools, while the South and West had the fewest. Few teachers were trained. Schoolhouses were small, and students of all ages and levels worked in one room.
McGuffey's Readers were the most popular textbooks. William Holmes McGuffey, an educator and minister, put selections from British and American literature in them as well as instruction in moral and social values.
Social background and wealth affected the quality of education. Rich families sent children to private schools or hired tutors. However, poor children had only public schools. Girls could go to school, but parents usually thought that girls needed little education and kept them home. Therefore, few girls learned to read.
Common-School Movement People in the common-school movement wanted all children taught in a common place, regardless of background. Horace Mann was a leader of this movement.
In 1837 Mann became Massachusetts's first secretary of education. He convinced the state to double its school budget and raise teachers' salaries. He lengthened the school year and began the first school for teacher training. Mann's success set a standard for education reform throughout the country.
450 CHAPTER 14
Women's Education
Education reform created greater opportunities for women. Catharine Beecher started an all-female academy in Hartford, Connecticut. The first college-level educational institution available to women was the Troy Female Seminary, opened by Emma Willard in 1821. Several other women's colleges opened during the 1830s, including Mount Holyoke College. The first medical college for women, who were barred from men's medical schools, opened in Boston in 1848.
Teaching People with Disabilities
Efforts to improve education also helped people with disabilities. In 1831 Samuel Gridley Howe opened the Perkins School for the Blind in Massachusetts. Howe traveled widely, talking about teaching people with visual impairment. Thomas Gallaudet improved the education and lives of people with hearing impairments. He founded the first free American school for hearing-impaired people in 1817.

Horace Mann's achievements?

Horace Mann
1796-1859
Born in Franklin, Massachusetts, Mann had little schooling, but he educated himself well enough at the local library to get into Brown University and attend law school. Despite a busy law practice, he served in the Massachusetts legislature for 10 years. He was also an outspoken advocate for public education. In 1837
the state created the
post of secretary of
education for him. His
achievements in that office
made him famous. He later
served in the U.S. House of
Representatives and as president of Antioch College in Ohio. His influence on education is reflected by the fact that many American schools are named for him.

SPEECH
Horace Mann to the Board of Education
In a speech to the newly created Massachusetts Board of Education, Horace Mann, the board's first secretary, described the purpose of the public school system.
//[T]here should be a free district school, sufficiently safe, and sufficiently good, for all of the children...where they may be well instructed in the rudiments [basics] of knowledge, formed to propriety of demeanor [good behavior], and imbued [filled] with the principles of duty... It is on this common platform, that a general acquaintanceship [friendship] should be formed between the children of the same neighborhood. It is here, that the affinities [qualities] of a common nature should unite them together/^

African American
Communities
Free African Americans usually lived in segregated, or separate, communities in the North. Most of them lived in cities such as New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. Community leaders were often influenced by the Second Great Awakening and its spirit of reform.
Founded by former slave Richard Allen, the Free African Religious Society became a model for other groups that pressed for racial equality and the education of blacks. In 1816 Allen became the first bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, or AME Church. This church broke away from white Methodist churches after African Americans were treated poorly in some white congregations.
Other influential African Americans of the time, such as Alexander Crummel, pushed for the creation of schools for black Americans. The New York African Free School in New York City educated hundreds of children, many of whom became brilliant scholars and impor-
tant African American leaders. Philadelphia also had a long history of educating African Americans. This was largely because Philadelphia was a center of Quaker influence, and the Quakers believed strongly in equality. The city ran seven schools for African American students by the year 1800. In 1820 Boston followed Philadelphia's lead and opened a separate elementary school for African American children. The city began allowing them to attend school with whites in 1855.
African Americans rarely attended college because few colleges would accept them. In 1835 Oberlin College became the first to do so. Harvard University soon admitted African Americans, too. Several African American colleges were founded beginning in the 1840s. In 1842 the Institute for Colored Youth opened in Philadelphia. Avery College, also in Pennsylvania, was founded in 1849.
While free African Americans had some opportunities to attend school in the North and Midwest, few had this chance in the South. Laws in the South barred most

I BUILDING BACKGROUND
The early 1800s brought many I movements for social reform in the United States. Perhaps the most . important and far-reaching was the movement for the abolition of
slavery. While reformers worked to end slavery, many also took risks to ; help slaves to escape.	j
Americans Oppose Slavery
Some Americans had opposed slavery since before the country was founded. Benjamin Franklin was the president of the first antislavery society in America, the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery. In the 1830s, Americans took more organized action supporting abolition, or a complete end to slavery. Differences among Abolitionists
Abolitionists came from many different backgrounds and opposed slavery for various reasons. The Quakers were among the first groups to challenge slavery on religious grounds. Other religious leaders gave speeches and published pamphlets that moved many Americans to support abolition. In one of these, abolitionist Theodore Weld wrote that "everyman knows that slavery is a curse." Other abolitionists referred to the Declaration of Independence. They reminded people that the American Revolution had been fought in the name of liberty and other "unalienable rights."
454 CHAPTER 14
Antislavery reformers did not always agree on the details, however. They differed over how much equality they thought African Americans should have. Some believed that African Americans should receive the same treatment as white Americans. In contrast, other abolitionists were against full political and social equality.
Some abolitionists wanted to send freed African Americans to Africa to start new colonies. They thought that this would prevent conflicts between the races in the United States. In 1817 a minister named Robert Finley started the American Colonization Society, an organization dedicated to establishing colonies of freed slaves in Africa. Five years later, the society founded the colony of Liberia on the west coast of Africa. About 12,000 African Americans eventually settled in Liberia. However, many abolitionists who once favored colonization later opposed it. Some African Americans also opposed it. David Walker was one such person. In his 1829 essay, Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World, Walker explained his opposition to colonization.
^The greatest riches in all America have arisen from our blood and tears: and they [whites] will drive us from our property and homes, which we have earned with our blood/'
—David Walker, quoted in From Slavery to Freedom by John Hope Franklin and Alfred A. Moss Jr.
Spreading the Abolitionist Message
Abolitionists found many ways to further their cause. Some went on speaking tours or wrote pamphlets and newspaper articles. John Greenleaf Whittier wrote abolitionist poetry and literature. William Lloyd Garrison published an abolitionist newspaper, the Liberator, beginning in 1831. In 1833 he also helped found the American Anti-Slavery Society. Its members wanted immediate emancipation and racial equality for African Americans. Garrison later became its president.
Both the Liberator and the Anti-Slavery Society relied on support from free African Americans. Society members spread

a
antislavery literature and petitioned Congress to end federal support of slavery. In 1840 the American Anti-Slavery Society split. One group wanted immediate freedom for enslaved African Americans and a bigger role for women. The others wanted gradual emancipation and for women to play only minor roles in the movement.
Angelina and Sarah Grimke, two white southern women, were antislavery activists of the 1830s. They came from a South Carolina slaveholding family but disagreed with their parents' support of slavery. Angelina Grimke tried to recruit other white southern women in a pamphlet called Appeal to the Christian Women of the South in 1836.
** I know you do not make the laws, but... if you really suppose you can do nothing to overthrow slavery you are greatly mistaken.. .Try to persuade your husband, father, brothers, and sons that slavery is a crime against God and man."
—Angelina Grimke, quoted in The Grimke Sisters from South Carolina, edited by Gerda Lerner
This essay was very popular in the North. In 1839 the Grimke sisters wrote American Slavery As It Is. The book was one of the most important antislavery works of its time.
NEW MOVEMENTS IN AMERICA
African American Abolitionists
Many former slaves were active in the antislavery cause. Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery when he was 20 and went on to become one of the most important African American leaders of the 1800s. Douglass secretly learned to read and write as a boy, despite a law against it. His public-speaking skills impressed members of the Anti-Slavery Society. In 1841 they asked him to give regular lectures.
At a Fourth of July celebration in 1852, he captured the audience's attention with his powerful voice.
^The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common.. .This Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn/'
—Frederick Douglass, quoted in From Slavery to Freedom by John Hope Franklin and Alfred A. Moss Jr.
In addition to his many speaking tours in the United States and Europe, Douglass published a newspaper called the North Star and wrote several autobiographies. His autobiographies were intended to show the injustices of slavery.
Another former slave, Sojourner Truth, also contributed to the abolitionist cause. She claimed God had called her to travel through the United States and preach the truth about slavery and women's rights. With her deep voice and quick wit, Truth became legendary in the antislavery movement for her fiery and dramatic speeches.
Other African Americans wrote narratives about their experiences as slaves to expose the cruelties that many slaves faced. In 1861 Harriet Jacobs published Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, one of the few slave narratives by a woman. William Wells Brown wrote an antislavery play as well as a personal narrative in the form of a novel called Clotel.

READING CHECK ,
The Underground Railroad
By the 1830s, a loosely organized group had begun helping slaves escape from the South. Free African Americans, former slaves, and a few white abolitionists worked together. They created what became known as the Underground Railroad. The organization was not an actual railroad but was a network of people who arranged transportation and hiding places for fugitives, or escaped slaves.
Fugitives would travel along "freedom trails" that led them to northern states or sometimes into Canada. At no time did the Railroad have a central leadership. No one person, or group of people, was ever officially in charge. Despite the lack of any real structure, the Underground Railroad managed to achieve dramatic results.
Often wearing disguises, fugitives moved along the "railroad" at night, led by people known as conductors. Many times, the fugitives had no other guideposts but the stars. They stopped to rest during the day at "stations," often bams, attics, or other places on property owned by abolitionists known as station masters.
The station masters hid and fed the fugitives.
Harriet Tubman was a courageous conductor on the Underground Railroad.

The most famous and daring conductor on the Underground Railroad was Harriet Tubman. When Tubman escaped slavery in 1849, she left behind her family. She swore that she would return and lead her whole family to freedom in the North. Tubman returned to the South 19 times, successfully leading her family and more than 300 other slaves to freedom. At one time the reward for Tubman's capture reportedly climbed to $40,000, a huge amount of money at that time.

_______________ Drawing Inferences
Why were the operations of the Underground Railroad kept secret?
Opposition to Ending Slavery
Although the North was the center of the abolitionist movement, many white northerners agreed with the South and supported slavery. Others disliked slavery but opposed equality for African Americans.
Newspaper editors and politicians warned that freed slaves would move north and take jobs from white workers. Some workers feared
losing jobs to newly freed African Americans, whom they believed would accept lower wages. Abolitionist leaders were threatened with violence as some northerners joined mobs. Such a mob killed abolitionist Elijah Lovejoy in 1837 in Alton, Illinois.
The federal government also obstructed abolitionists. Between 1836 and 1844, the U.S. House of Representatives used what was called a gag rule. Congress had received thousands of antislavery petitions. Yet the gag rule forbade members of Congress from discussing them. This rule violated the First Amendment right of citizens to petition the government. But southern members of Congress did not want to debate slavery. Many northern members of Congress preferred to avoid the issue.
Eventually, representative and former president John Quincy Adams was able to get the gag rule overturned. His resolution to enact a constitutional amendment halting the expansion of slavery never passed, however.

interfere with their way of life. After Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831, when Turner led some slaves to kill slaveholders, open talk about slavery disappeared in the South. It became dangerous to voice antislavery sentiments in southern states. Abolitionists like the Grimke sisters left rather than air unpopular views to hostile neighbors. Racism, fear, and economic dependence on slavery made emancipation all but impossible in the South.

Free Blacks in the North Slavery had been allowed in the northern colonies, but by 1804 the last northern state had abolished the practice. Free African Americans in the North, however, experienced racism and social and economic segregation.
Free blacks had some access to formal education, especially in the cities, but were barred from most white schools. Often, they created their own towns and communities that provided their own jobs, goods, churches, and services. While they were legally able to participate in the political life of the North, few of them gained political influence.
will

The experiences of African Americans in the North and in the South were drastically different. Although there were free blacks in the South, their lives were overshadowed by the slavery in the region. Each of these three groups—slaves, free blacks in the North, and free blacks in the South—had different economic, social, and political lives.

Slaves in the South Almost all African Americans in the South were slaves. Their labor was crucial to the agricultural economy of the region. Their daily activities were dictated by owners, but their food, music, and spirituality showed influences of their ancestors'African origins. They were given no voice in the government of the region, and numerous laws restricted their freedom. RRI

Free Blacks in the South Free blacks in the South struggled with extreme racism, but sometimes owned businesses or farms. Even in the cities, their access to education and opportunities were limited. Former slaves often left the region, but many more stayed in the South. Sometimes this was because of family ties or because their former owners gave them land upon freeing them.
More free blacks lived in the South than in the North, but those that were former slaves often left the region. Southern states had many laws that limited the lives and opportunities of free blacks, including access to political power. As in the North, they often formed their own communities and neighborhoods.

Frederick Douglass
As a freed slave, how would you help people still enslaved?
When did he live? 1817-1895
Where did he live? Frederick Douglass was bom in rural Maryland. At age six he was sent to live in Baltimore, and at age 20 he escaped to New York City. For most of his life, Douglass lived in Rochester, New York, making his home into a stop along the Underground Railroad. He traveled often, giving powerful antislavery speeches to audiences throughout the North and in Europe.

I BUILDING BACKGROUND
Women were active in the movements I to reform prisons and schools. They fought for temperance and worked for abolition. But with all their work for social change, women still lacked many rights and opportunities of their own. Throughout the 1800s, the women's rights movement gradually became stronger and more organized.
1.	Influenced by the abolition movement, many women struggled to gain equal rights for themselves.
2.	Calls for women's rights met opposition from men and women.
3.	The Seneca Falls Convention launched the first organized women's rights movement
in the United States.
Reformers sought to improve women's rights in American society.
V
Women's Struggle for Equal Rights
Fighting for the rights of African Americans led many female abolitionists to fight for women's rights. In the mid-1800s, these women found that they had to defend their right to speak in public, particularly when a woman addressed both men and women. For example, members of the press, the clergy, and even some male abolitionists criticized the Grimke sisters. These critics thought that the sisters should not give public speeches. They did not want women to leave their traditional female roles. The Grimkes protested that women had a moral duty to lead the antislavery movement.
Early Writings for Women's Rights
In 1838 Sarah Grimke published a pamphlet arguing for equal rights for women. She titled it Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Women.
** I ask no favors for my sex... All I ask our brethren [brothers] is that they will take their feet from off our necks, and permit us to stand upright on that ground which God designed us to occupy
—Sarah Grimke, quoted in The Grimke Sisters from South Carolina, edited by Gerda Lerner

W MOVEMENTS IN AMERICA 4C
Sarah Grimke also argued for equal educational opportunities. She pointed out laws that negatively affected women. In addition, she demanded equal pay for equal work.
Sarah Grimke never married. She explained that the laws of the day gave a husband complete control of his wife's property. Therefore, she feared that by marrying, she would become more like a slave than a wife. Her sister, Angelina, did marry, but she refused to promise to obey her husband during their marriage ceremony. She married Theodore Weld, an abolitionist. Weld agreed to give up his legal right to control her property after they married. For the Grimkes, the abolitionist principles and women's rights principles were identical.
In 1845 the famous transcendental-ist Margaret Fuller published Woman in the Nineteenth Century. This book used well-known sayings to explain the role of women in American society. Fuller used democratic and transcendentalist principles to stress the importance of individualism to all people, especially women. The book influenced many leaders of the women's rights movement.
Sojourner Truth
Sojourner Truth was another powerful supporter of both abolition and women's rights.
She had been bom into slavery in about 1797. Her birth name was Isabella Baumfree. She took the name Sojourner Truth because she felt that her mission was to be a sojourner, or traveler, and spread the truth. Though she never learned to read or write, she impressed many well-educated people. One person who thought highly of her was the author Harriet Beecher Stowe. Stowe said that she had never spoken "with anyone who had more ... personal presence than this woman." Truth stood six feet tall and was a confident speaker.
In 1851 Truth gave a speech that is often quoted to this day.
"That man over here says that women need to be helped into carriages and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place... Look at me! I have ploughed and planted and... no man could head [outwork] me. And ain't I a woman?"
—Sojourner Truth, quoted in A History of Women in America by Carol Hymowitzand Michaele Weissman
Truth, the Grimke sisters, and other supporters of the women's movement were determined to be heard.

462 CHAPTER 14
Opposing the Call for Women's Rights
Publications about women's rights first appeared in the United States shortly after the American Revolution. However, women's concerns did not become a national issue with strong opposition for many more years.
The Movement Grows
The change took place when women took a more active and leading role in reform and abolition. Other social changes also led to the rise of the women's movement. Women took advantage of better educational opportunities in the early 1800s. Their efforts on behalf of reform groups helped them leam how to organize more effectively and to work together.
Another benefit of reform-group work was that some men began to fight for women's rights. Many activists, both men and women, found it unacceptable that women were not allowed to vote or sit on juries. They were also upset that married women in many states had little or no control over their own property.
Opposition to Women's Rights
Like the abolitionist movement, the struggle for women's rights faced opposition. Many people did not agree with some of the goals of
READING CHECK
the women's rights movement. Some women believed that they did not need new rights. They said that women were not unequal to men, only different. Some critics believed that women should not try to work in public for social changes. Women were welcome to work for social change, but only from within their homes. "Let her not look away from her own little family circle for the means of producing moral and social reforms," wrote T. S. Arthur. His advice appeared in a popular women's magazine called The Lady at Home.
Some people also thought that women lacked the physical or mental strength to survive without men's protection. They believed that a woman should go from the protection of her father's home to that of her husband's. They also thought that women could not cope with the outside world; therefore, a husband should control his wife's property. Despite opposition, women continued to pursue their goal of greater rights.

At the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, 100 people signed the Declaration of Sentiments, a document declaring the rights of women. The wording of the document purposely echoed the

|i The authors use the same words that are in the Declaration of Independence, but include women.
We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men ar>d women are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable1 rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance2 to it, and to 'ns‘st uPQn ^e institution of a new government, lay-ing its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

SKILL
Analyzing Primary sources Why would women want to use the Declaration of Independence as a source for their own declaration?
Seneca Falls Convention
In 1840 Elizabeth Cady Stanton attended the World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England, while on her honeymoon. She discovered that, unlike her husband, she was not allowed to participate. All women in attendance had to sit behind a curtain in a separate gallery of the convention hall. William Lloyd Garrison, who had helped found the American Anti-Slavery Society, sat with them in protest.
The treatment of women abolitionists at the convention angered Stanton and her new friend, Lucretia Mott. Apparently, even many abolitionists did not think that women were equal to men. Stanton and Mott wanted to change this, so they planned to "form a society to advance the rights of women." Eight years passed before Stanton and Mott finally announced the Seneca Falls Convention, the first public meeting about women's rights held in the United States. It opened on July 19,1848, in Seneca Falls, New York.
Declaration of Sentiments
The convention organizers wrote a Declaration of Sentiments. This document detailed beliefs about social injustice toward women. They used the Declaration of Independence as the basis for the language for their Declaration of Sentiments. The authors included 18 charges against men—the same number that had been charged against King George III. The Declaration of Sentiments was signed by some 100 people.
About 240 people attended the Seneca Falls Convention, including men such as abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Many other reformers who also worked in the temperance and abolition movements were present. Several women who participated in the convention worked in nearby factories. One of them, 19-year-old Charlotte Woodward, signed the Declaration of Sentiments. She worked long hours in a factory, making gloves. Her wages were very low, and she could not even keep her earnings. She had to turn her wages over to her father.
464 CHAPTER 14
Women's Rights Leaders
After the convention, the struggle continued. Women's rights activists battled many difficulties and much opposition. Still, they kept working to obtain greater equality for women. Among the many women working for women's rights, three became important leaders: Lucy Stone, Susan B. Anthony, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Each brought different strengths to the fight for women's rights.
Lucy Stone was a well-known spokesperson for the Anti-Slavery Society. In the early years of the women's rights movement, Stone became known as a gifted speaker. Elizabeth Cady Stanton called her "the first who really stirred the nation's heart on the subject of women's wrongs."
Susan B. Anthony brought strong organizational skills to the women's rights movement. She did much to turn the fight for
women's rights into a political movement. Anthony argued that women and men should receive equal pay for equal work. She also believed that women should be allowed to enter traditionally male professions, such as religion and law. Anthony was especially concerned with laws that affected women's control of money and property.
Anthony led a campaign to change laws regarding the property rights of women. She wrote in her diary that no woman could ever be free without "a purse of her own." After forming a network to cover the entire state of New York, she collected more than 6,000 signatures to petition for a new property-rights law. In 1860, due largely to the efforts of Anthony, New York finally gave married women ownership of their wages and property. Other states in the Northeast and Midwest soon created similar laws.
THE IMPACT
TODAY
In the United States, as of the year 2011, women earned about 82 percent as much as men did.
NEW MOVEMENTS IN AMERICA 4<
Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote many of the documents and speeches of the movement, which were often delivered by Anthony. Stanton was a founder and important leader of the National Woman Suffrage Association. This organization was considered one of the more radical groups because of its position that abolition was not a more important cause than women's rights.
Not every battle was won. Other major reforms, such as women's right to vote, were not achieved at this time. Still, more women than ever before became actively involved in women's rights issues. This increased activity was one of the movement's greatest accomplishments.

Accepting Social Responsibility
Define the Skill
A society is an organized group of people who share a common set of activities, traditions, and goals. You are part of many societies—your school, community, and nation are just three. Every society's strength depends on the support and contributions of its members. Social responsibility is the obligation that every person has to the societies in which he or she is a member.
Learn the Skill
As a part of your school, community, and nation, you have obligations to the people around you.
The most obvious is to do nothing to harm your society. You also have a duty to be part of it. At the very least, this means exercising the rights and responsibilities of membership. These include being informed about issues in your society.
Another level of social responsibility is support of change to benefit society. This level of involvement goes beyond being informed about issues to trying to do something about them. If you take this important step, here are some points to consider.
1.	Few efforts to change society have everyone's support. Some people will want things to stay the same. They may treat you badly if you work for change. You must be prepared for this possibility if you decide to take action.
2.	Sometimes efforts to improve things involve opposing laws or rules that need to be changed. No matter how just your cause is, if you break law or rules, you must be willing to accept the consequences of your behavior.
3.	Remember that violence is never an acceptable method for change. People who use force in seeking change are not behaving in a socially responsible manner, even if their cause is good.
This chapter was filled with the stories of socially responsible people. Many of them devoted their lives to changing society for the better. Some did so at great personal risk. Boston abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison barely escaped with his life from a local mob that tried to lynch him because of his views.
Garrison and the other reformers you read about demonstrated the highest level of social responsibility. They saw an issue they believed to be a problem in society, and they worked tirelessly to change it and make society better.
Practice the Skill
Review the "If you were there" scene on page 454. Imagine yourself as that Ohioan. You believe slavery to be wrong. However, you also respect the law, and it is illegal to help an escaped slave. In addition, you know that most of your neighbors do not feel as you do about slavery. They might harm you or your property if you take this stand against it.
1.	Would agreeing to your friend's request help benefit society? Explain why or why not.
2.	Are you willing to risk the anger of your neighbors? Why or why not?
3.	Is the idea of breaking the law or possibly going to jail a factor in your decision? Explain.
4.	Would agreeing to your friend's request be a socially responsible thing to do? Explain why or why not.

On Reading Have you ever read a schoolbook and been overwhelmed by the amount of information it contained? Categorizing events, people, and ideas can help you make sense of the facts you learn in this book. Understanding Categorizing Ideas, people, events, and things can all be categorized in many different ways. For the study of history, some of the most useful ways are by time period and by similarity between events. Categorizing events by the people involved can also be helpful. Within a category, you can make subcategories to further organize the information.

This had been a good strategy, as both men had won. The Whigs decided to choose another war hero.

The Debate oveF Slavery
If YOU were there...
You live in a crowded neighborhood in New York City in 1854.
Your apartment building is home to a variety of people—long-time residents, Irish immigrants, free African Americans. One day federal marshals knock on your door. They claim that one of your neighbors is a fugitive slave. The marshals say you must help them find her. If you don't, you will be fined or even sent to jail.
What would you tell the federal marshals?
BUILDING BACKGROUND
Some reform movements of the 1800s I drew stubborn and often violent opposition. This was especially true ! ofthe abolitionist movement. Pro-slavery supporters fought for laws to j • protect slavery and extend the slave system. These laws were a threat
to African Americans in the North.
New Land Renews Slavery Disputes
The United States added more than 500,000 square miles of land as a result of winning the Mexican-American War in 1848. The additional land caused bitter debate about slavery. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 had divided the Louisiana Purchase into either free or slave regions. It prohibited slavery north of latitude 36°30' but let Missouri become a slave state. In the 1840s President James K. Polk wanted to extend the 36°30' line to the West coast, dividing the Mexican Cession into two parts—one free and one enslaved. Some leaders, including Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan, encouraged popular sovereignty, the idea that political power belongs to the people, who should decide on banning or allowing slavery.
Regional Differences about Slavery
Some northerners wanted to outlaw slavery in all parts of the Mexican Cession. During the war, Representative David Wilmot offered the Wilmot Proviso, a document stating that "neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist in any part of [the] territory."

The northern-controlled House passed the document, but in the Senate, the South had more power. The Wilmot Proviso did not pass. Before this time, politicians had usually supported the ideas of their political parties. However, the Wilmot Proviso spurred a debate that showed growing sectionalism, or favoring the interests of one section or region over the interests of the entire country.
To attract voters, the Democrats and the Whigs did not take a clear position on slavery in the presidential campaign of 1848. In response, antislavery northerners formed a new party, the Free-Soil Party, which supported the Wilmot Proviso. They worried that slave labor would mean fewer jobs for white workers. Party members chose former president Martin Van Buren as their candidate. The new party won 10 percent of" the popular vote, drawing away votes from Democrat Lewis Cass. Whig candidate Zach-" ary Taylor won a narrow victory.
The California Question
The California gold rush caused such rapid population growth that California applied to join the Union as a state instead of as a territory. But would California enter the Union as a free state or a slave state?
Most Californians opposed slavery, which had been illegal when the state was part of Mexico. Also, many forty-niners had come from free states. But if California became a free state, the balance between free and slave states would change, favoring the free states.
In the South, an imbalance was unacceptable. "We are about permanently to destroy the balance of power between the sections," said Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi. He and many other southerners did not want California to enter the Union as a free state.

Compromise of 1850
Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky had helped to settle the Missouri crisis of 1819-20 and the nullification crisis of 1832-33 by proposing compromises. He now had another plan to help the nation maintain peace. His ideas were designed to give both sides things that they wanted:

! The Seventh of March Speech
1.	California would enter the Union as a free state.
2.	The rest of the Mexican Cession would be federal land. In this territory popular sovereignty would decide on slavery.
3.	Texas would give up land east of the upper Rio Grande. In return, the government would pay Texas's debts from when it was an independent republic.
4.	The slave trade—but not slavery— would end in the nation's capital.
5.	A more effective fugitive slave law would be passed.
On March 7, 1850, Daniel Webster spoke on the floor of the Senate in favor of the Compromise of 1850.
I hear with distress and anguish the word "secession." Secession! Peaceable secession! Sir, \% your eyes and mine are never destined to see the miracle. The dismemberment [taking apart] of this vast country without convulsion! The break-ing up of the fountains of the great deep with-

—quoted in Daniel Webster:The Completest Man, edited by Kenneth Shewmaker

Daniel Webster spoke eloquently in support of the compromise.
Clay's plan drew attack, especially regarding California. Senator William Seward of New York defended antislavery views and wanted California admitted "directly, without conditions, without qualifications, and without compromise." However, Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina argued that letting California enter as a free state would destroy the nation's balance. He warned people of issues that would later start the Civil War. Calhoun asked that the slave states be allowed to secede —formally withdraw—from the Union.
In contrast, Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts favored Clay's plan:
I wish to speak today, not as a Massachusetts man, nor as a Northern man, but as an American... I speak today for the preservation of the Union. Hear me for my cause/^
—Daniel Webster, quoted in Battle Cry of Freedom by James M. McPherson
Fugitive Slave Act
The newly passed Fugitive Slave Act made it a crime to help runaway slaves and allowed officials to arrest those slaves in free areas. Slaveholders were permitted to take suspected fugitives to U.S. commissioners, who decided their fate.
Webster criticized northern abolitionists and southerners who talked of secession.
A compromise was enacted that year and seemed to settle most disputes between free and slave states. It achieved the majority of Clay's proposals. With the Compromise of 1850, California was able to enter the Union as a free state. The rest of the Mexican Cession was divided into two territories—Utah and New Mexico—where the question of whether to allow slavery would be decided by popular sovereignty.
Texas agreed to give up its land claims in New Mexico in exchange for financial aid from the federal government. The compromise outlawed the slave trade in the District of Columbia and established a new fugitive slave law.
Analyzing How was Texas affected by the Compromise of 1850?
Details of the Fugitive Slave Act
Slaveholders could use testimony from white witnesses, but enslaved African Americans accused of being fugitives could not testify. Nor could people who hid or helped a runaway slave—they faced six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Commissioners who rejected a slaveholder's claim earned $5 while those who returned suspected fugitives to slaveholders earned $10. Clearly, the commissioners benefited from helping slaveholders.
Reactions to the Fugitive Slave Act
Enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act began immediately. In September 1850—the same month the law was passed—federal marshals arrested African American James Hamlet. They returned him to a slaveholder in

A
Fugitive Slave Convention The Fugitive Slave Act enraged abolitionists. To protest the new law, they held many meetings to publicly denounce it. One such meeting was held in 1850 in the small town of Cazenovia in central New York, a center for abolitionist activity. About 2,000 people—including many former slaves— attended the convention. They listened to speeches, made plans, and raised their voices for freedom. This photo was a point of pride for the delegates, but it also was used by opponents of the movement as a symbol of the poor morals of abolitionists: Not only were whites allowed to mix with African Americans, but women and men were allowed to mix as well.This angered many people.

Thousands of northern African Americans fled to Canada in fear. In the 10 years after Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, some 343 fugitive slave cases were reviewed. The accused fugitives were declared free in only 11 cases.
The Fugitive Slave Act upset northerners, who were uncomfortable with the commissioners' power. Northerners disliked the idea of a trial without a jury. They also disapproved of commissioners' higher fees for returning slaves. Most were horrified that some free African Americans had been captured and sent to the South.
Most northerners opposed to the Act peacefully resisted, but violence did erupt. In 1854 Anthony Burns, a fugitive slave from Virginia, was arrested in Boston. Abolitionists used force while trying to rescue him from jail, killing a deputy marshal. A federal ship was ordered to return Burns to Virginia after his trial. Many people in the North, particularly in Massachusetts, were outraged. The event persuaded many to join the abolitionist cause.

480 CHAPTER 15
Antislavery Literature
Abolitionists in the North used the stories of fugitive slaves like James Hamlet and Anthony Bums to gain sympathy for their cause. Slave narratives also educated people about their hardships.
Fiction also informed people about the evils of slavery. Uncle Tom's Cabin, the antislavery novel written by Harriet Beecher Stowe, spoke out powerfully against slavery. Stowe, the daughter of Connecticut minister Lyman Beecher, moved to Ohio when she was 21. There she met fugitive slaves and learned about the cruelties of slavery. The Fugitive Slave Act greatly angered Stowe. She decided to write a book that would educate northerners about the realities of slavery.
Uncle Tom's Cabin was published in 1852. The main character, a kindly enslaved African American named Tom, is taken from his wife and sold "down the river" in Louisiana. Tom becomes the slave of cruel Simon Legree. In a rage, Legree has Tom beaten to death.
The novel electrified the nation and sparked outrage in the South. Louisa McCord, a famous southern writer, questioned the "foul imagination which could invent such scenes."
Within a decade, more than 2 million copies of Uncle Tom's Cabin had been sold in the United States. The book's popularity caused one northerner to remark that Stowe and her book had created "two millions of abolitionists." Stowe later wrote A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin to answer those who had criticized her book.
The impact of Stowe's book is suggested by her reported meeting with Abraham Lincoln in 1862, a year after the start of the Civil War. Lincoln supposedly said to Stowe that she was "the little lady who made this big war." Her book is still widely read today as a source of information about the harsh realities of slavery.

BUILDING BACKGROUND
The argument over the extension of slavery grew stronger and more bitter. It dominated American politics in the mid-1800s. Laws that tried to find compromises ended by causing more violence. The bloodiest battleground of this period was in Kansas. The Kansas-Nebraska Act heightened tensions in the conflict over slavery.
Election of 1852
Four leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination emerged in 1852. It became clear that none of them would win a majority of votes. Frustrated delegates at the Democratic National Convention turned to Franklin Pierce, a little-known politician from New Hampshire. Pierce promised to honor the Compromise

Drawing Conclusions
What issues determined the outcome of the presidential election of 1852?
The Kansas-Nebraska Act
In his inaugural address, President Pierce expressed his hope that the slavery issue had been put to rest "and that no sectional . . . excitement may again threaten the durability [stability] of our institutions." Less than a year later, however, a proposal to build a railroad to the West coast helped revive the slavery controversy and opened a new period of sectional conflict.
Douglas and the Railroad
Ever since entering Congress in the mid-1840s, Stephen Douglas had supported the idea of building a railroad to the Pacific Ocean. Douglas favored a line running from Chicago. The first step toward building such a railroad would be organizing what remained of the Louisiana Purchase into a federal territory. The Missouri Compromise required that this land be free territory and eventually free states.
Southerners in Congress did not support Douglas's plan, recommending a southern route for the railroad. Their preferred line

ran from New Orleans, across Texas and New Mexico Territory, to southern California. Determined to have the railroad start in Chicago, Douglas asked a few key southern senators to support his plan. They agreed to do so if the new territory west of Missouri was opened to slavery.
Two New Territories
In January 1854, Douglas introduced what became the Kansas-Nebraska Act, a plan that would divide the remainder of the Louisiana Purchase into two territories—Kansas and Nebraska—and allow the people in each territory to decide on the question of slavery. The act would eliminate the Missouri Compromise's restriction on slavery north of the 36° 30 Tine.
Antislavery northerners were outraged by the implications. Some believed the proposal was part of a terrible plot to turn free territory into a "dreary region . . . inhabited by masters and slaves." All across the North, citizens attended protest meetings and sent anti-Nebraska petitions to Congress.
Even so, with strong southern support— and with Douglas and President Pierce pressuring their fellow Democrats to vote for it— the measure passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law on May 30, 1854. Lost amid all the controversy over the territorial bill was Douglas's proposed railroad to the Pacific Ocean. Congress would not approve the construction of such a railroad until 1862.
Kansas Divided
Antislavery and pro-slavery groups rushed their supporters to Kansas. One of the people who spoke out strongly against slavery in Kansas was Senator Seward.
^Gentlemen of the Slave States... I accept [your challenge] in... the cause of freedom. We will engage in competition for... Kansas, and God give the victory to the side which is stronger in numbers as it is in right."

pro-slavery voters crossed the border from Missouri, voted in Kansas, and then returned home. As a result, the new legislature had a huge pro-slavery majority. The members of the legislature passed strict laws that made it a crime to question slaveholders' rights and said that those who helped fugitive slaves could be put to death. In protest, antislavery Kansans formed their own legislature 25 miles away in Topeka. President Pierce, however, only recognized the pro-slavery legislature.

FOCUS ON
Reaping What categories can you use to organize events in Kansas?
Bleeding Kansas
By early 1856 Kansas had two opposing governments, and the population was angry. Settlers had moved to Kansas to homestead in peace, but the controversy over slavery began to affect everyone.
In April 1856, a congressional committee arrived in Kansas to decide which government was legitimate. Although committee members declared the election of the proslavery legislature to be unfair, the federal government did not agree.
Attack on Lawrence
The new pro-slavery settlers owned guns, and antislavery settlers received weapons shipments from friends in the East. Then, violence broke out. In May 1856 a proslavery grand jury in Kansas charged leaders of the antislavery government with treason. About 800 men rode to the city of Lawrence to arrest the antislavery leaders, but they had fled. The posse took its anger out on Lawrence by setting fires, looting buildings, and destroying presses used to print antislavery newspapers. One man was killed in the pro-slavery attack that became known as the Sack of Lawrence.
John Brown's Response
Abolitionist John Brown was from New England, but he and some of his sons had moved to Kansas in 1855. The Sack of Lawrence made him determined to "fight fire with fire" and to "strike terror in the hearts of the pro-slavery people." On the night of May 24, 1856, along Pottawatomie Creek,
486
Brown and his men killed five pro-slavery men in Kansas in what became known as the Pottawatomie Massacre. Brown and his men dragged the pro-slavery men out of their cabins and killed them with swords. The abolitionist band managed to escape capture. Brown declared that his actions had been ordered by God.
Kansas collapsed into civil war, and about 200 people were killed. The events in "Bleeding Kansas" became national front-page stories. In September 1856, a new territorial governor arrived and began to restore order.
Brooks Attacks Sumner
Congress also reacted to the violence of the Sack of Lawrence. Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts criticized pro-slavery people in Kansas and personally insulted Andrew Pickens Butler, a pro-slavery senator from South Carolina. Representative Preston Brooks, a relative of Butler's, responded strongly.
On May 22, 1856, Brooks used a walking cane to beat Sumner unconscious in the Senate chambers. Dozens of southerners sent Brooks new canes, but northerners were out-
raged and called the attacker "Bully Brooks." Brooks only had to pay a $300 fine to the federal court. It took Sumner three years before he was well enough to return to the Senate.

If YOU were there...
You are traveling through Michigan in July 1854. As you pass through the town of Jackson, you see a crowd of several hundred people gathered under the trees. You join them and find that it is a political rally. Antislavery supporters from different parties are meeting to form a new political party. Speakers promise to fight slavery "until the contest be terminated."
How do you think this new party will affect American politics?
The split over the issue of slavery intensified due to political division and judicial decisions.
BUILDING BACKGROUND

TAKING NOTES
Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the effects of political divisions and the Dred Scott case on the debate over slavery.
Political Parties Undergo Change
Democrat Stephen Douglas had predicted that the Kansas-Nebraska Act would "raise a... storm." He was right. The Kansas-Nebraska Act brought the slavery issue back into the national spotlight. Some Whigs, Democrats, Free-Soilers, and abolitionists joined in 1854 to form the Republican Party, a political party united against the spread of slavery in the West.
Democrats were in trouble. Those who supported the Kansas-Nebraska Act were not re-elected. The Whig Party also fell apart when northern and southern Whigs refused to work together. A senator from Connecticut complained, "The Whig Party has been killed off ... by that miserable Nebraska business." Some Whigs and Democrats joined the American Party, also known as the Know-Nothing Party. At the party's convention, delegates argued over slavery, then chose former president Millard Fillmore as their candidate for the election of 1856.
The Democrats knew they could not choose a strong supporter of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, such as President Pierce or Senator Douglas. They nominated James Buchanan of Pennsylvania. Buchanan had a great deal of political experience as Polk's secretary of state. Most

important, he had been in Great Britain as ambassador during the Kansas-Nebraska Act dispute and had not been involved in the debate.
At their first nominating convention, the Republicans chose explorer John C. Fremont as their candidate. He had little political experience, but he stood against the spread of slavery. The public saw Republicans as a single-issue party. They had almost no supporters outside of the free states.
On election day, Buchanan won 14 of the 15 slave states and became the new president. Fremont won 11 of the 16 free states. Fillmore won only one state—Maryland. Buchanan had won the election.

Dred Scott Sues for Freedom
Dred Scott was the slave of Dr. John Emerson,
an army surgeon who lived in St. Louis, Mis-
souri. In the 1830s, Emerson had taken Scott
on tours of duty in Illinois and the Wisconsin
Territory. After they returned to Missouri, the
doctor died, and Scott became the slave of
Emerson's widow. In 1846 Scott sued for his
freedom in the Missouri state courts, arguing
that he had become free when he lived in
free territory. Though a lower court ruled in
Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857)
Background of the Case Born a slave in Virginia, Dred Scott moved with his slaveholder to the free state of Illinois and then to the Wisconsin Territory. After returning to the South, Scott sued for his freedom. He claimed that because he had lived in a state that banned slavery, he was no longer a slave.
The Court's Ruling
The Court ruled that African Americans, whether free or slave, were not considered citizens of the United States, and therefore had no right to sue in federal court. It also decided that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional.
The Court's Reasoning
Chief Justice Roger B. Taney wrote in the majority opinion that the Court did not believe that African Americans were included in the Constitution's definition of citizens and that they "had no rights which the white man was bound to respect." Addressing a side issue in the case, the opinion also stated that
V *
Congress could not outlaw slavery in the territories. This struck down the Missouri Compromise, which had made slavery illegal in territories north of the 36°30' dividing line.
Why It Matters
The Dred Scott case was seen as a setback to abolitionist ideas against slavery. It reduced the status of free African Americans and upheld the view of slaves as property without rights or protection under the Constitution. It also took from Congress the power to ban slavery in its territories, which would aid the spread of slavery in new states. Because of its pro-slavery decision, the reputation of the Court suffered greatly in parts of the North.

his favor, the Missouri Supreme Court overturned this ruling.
Scott's case reached the U.S. Supreme Court 11 years later, in 1857. The justices—a majority of whom were from the South— had three key issues before them. First, the Court had to rule on whether Scott was a citizen. Only citizens could sue in federal court. Second, the Court had to decide if his time living on free soil made him free. Third, the Court had to determine the constitutionality of prohibiting slavery in parts of the Louisiana Purchase.
The Supreme Court's Ruling Chief Justice Roger B. Taney (TAw-nee), himself from a slaveholding family in Maryland, wrote the majority opinion in the Dred Scott decision in March 1857. First, he addressed the issue of Dred Scott's citizenship. Taney
said the nation's founders believed that African Americans "had no rights which a white man was bound to respect." He therefore concluded that all African Americans, whether slave or free, were not citizens under the U.S. Constitution. Thus, Dred Scott did not have the right to file suit in federal court.
Taney also ruled on the other issues before the Court. As to whether Scott's residence on free soil made him free, Taney flatly said it did not. Because Scott had returned to the slave state of Missouri, the chief justice said, "his status, as free or slave, depended on the laws of Missouri."
Finally, Taney declared the Missouri Compromise restriction on slavery north of 36°30' to be unconstitutional. He pointed out that the Fifth Amendment said no one could "be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law." Because slaves were considered property, Congress could not prohibit someone from taking slaves into a federal territory. Under this ruling, Congress had no right to ban slavery in any federal territory.
Most white southerners cheered this decision. It "covers every question regarding slavery and settles it in favor of the South," reported a Georgia newspaper. Another newspaper, the New Orleans Picayune, assured its readers that the ruling put "the whole basis of the... Republican organization under the ban of law."
The ruling stunned many northerners. The Republicans were particularly upset because their platform in 1856 had argued that Congress held the right to ban slavery in the federal territories. Now the nation's highest court had ruled that Congress did not have this right.
Indeed, some northerners feared that the spread of slavery would not stop with the federal territories. Illinois lawyer Abraham Lincoln warned that a future Court ruling, or what he called "the next Dred Scott decision," would prohibit states from banning slavery.

SPEECH
A
House Divided In 1858Abraham Lincoln gave a passionate speech to Illinois Republicans about the dangers of the disagreement over slavery. Some considered it a call for war.
In my opinion, it [disagreement over slavery] will not cease [stop], until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. "A house divided A against itself cannot stand." I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided.**
/	—Abraham Lincoln,
Lincoln expresses confidence that the Union will survive.
We shall lie down pleasantly dreaming that the people of Missouri are on the verge of [close to] making their state free; and we shall awake to the reality, instead, that the Supreme Court has made Illinois a slave state.

Lincoln-Douglas Debates
In 1858 Illinois Republicans nominated Abraham Lincoln for the U.S. Senate. His opponent was Democrat Stephen Douglas, who had represented Illinois in the Senate since 1847. Lincoln challenged Douglas in what became the historic Lincoln-Douglas debates.
In each debate, Lincoln stressed that the central issue of the campaign was the spread of slavery in the West. He said that the Democrats were trying to spread slavery across the nation.

ANALYSIS
SKILLS
Analyzing Primary Sources What do you think Lincoln meant by "crisis"?
Lincoln talked about the Dred Scott decision. He said that African Americans were "entitled to all the natural rights" listed in the Declaration of Independence, specifically mentioning "the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." However, Lincoln believed
that African Americans were not necessarily the social or political equals of whites. Hoping to cost Lincoln votes, Douglas charged that Lincoln "thinks that the Negro is his brother..."
Douglas also criticized Lincoln for saying that the nation could not remain "half slave and half free." Douglas said that the statement revealed a Republican desire to make every state a free state. This, he warned, would only lead to "a dissolution [destruction] of the Union" and "warfare between the North and the South."
At the second debate, in the northern Illinois town of Freeport, Illinois, Lincoln pressed Douglas on the apparent contradiction between the Democrats' belief in popu-

As the disagreements grew, violence increased, though many j Americans hoped to avoid it. But it was too late to keep the nation unified, j The United States broke apart due to the growing conflict over slavery.
Raid on Harpers Ferry
In 1858 John Brown tried to start an uprising. He wanted to attack the federal arsenal in Virginia and seize weapons there. He planned to arm local slaves. Brown expected to kill or take hostage white southerners who stood in his way. He urged abolitionists to give him money so that he could support a small army. But after nearly two years, Brown's army had only about 20 men.
On the night of October 16, 1859, John Brown's raid began when he and his men took over the arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in hopes of starting a slave rebellion. He sent several of his men into the countryside to get slaves to join him. However, enslaved African Americans did not come to Harpers Ferry, fearing punishment if they took part. Instead, local white southerners attacked Brown. Eight of his men and three local men were killed. Brown and some followers retreated to a firehouse.
Federal troops arrived in Harpers Ferry the following night. The next morning, Colonel Robert E. Lee ordered a squad of marines to storm the firehouse. In a matter of seconds, the marines killed two more of Brown's men and captured the rest—including Brown.
Brown was quickly convicted of treason, murder, and conspiracy. Some of his men received death sentences. John A. Copeland, a

The popular song "John Brown's Body" was not originally written about the abolitionist but it was quickly adapted to describe his life and execution. In one verse, the raid on Harpers Ferry is described.
*/He captured Harpers Ferry with his nineteen men so few, /And he frightened Old Virginny till she trembled through and through, /They hung him for a traitor— themselves a traitor crew, /But his soul is marching on. (Chorus)

How do the lyrics of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" demonstrate the cause that the Union soldiers were fighting for?
The song was sung by Union soldiers and supporters as a patriotic symbol. In 1859, abolitionist Julia Ward Howe wrote new lyrics for the song that became even more popular. The song no longer mentioned Brown, but described the religious importance many Unionists found for supporting the war. Named "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," the song became a marching song for the Union military. It is still sung today at many official government events.
/^Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; /He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; /He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword: /His truth is marching on.

"Now, if it is deemed [thought] necessary that I should forfeit [give up] my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle [mix] my blood... with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I say, let it be done/,
—John Brown, quoted in John Brown, 1800-1859 by Oswald Garrison Villard
As expected, the judge ordered Brown to be hanged. The sentence was carried out one month later on December 2,1859.
Many northerners mourned John Brown's death, but some abolitionists criticized his extreme actions. Abraham Lincoln said Brown "agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong." However, Lincoln
continued, "That cannot excuse violence, bloodshed, and treason."
Most southern whites—both slaveholders and non-slaveholders—felt threatened by the actions of John Brown. They worried that a "John Brown the Second" might attack. One South Carolina newspaper voiced these fears; "We are convinced the safety of the South lies only outside the present Union." Another newspaper stated that "the sooner we get out of the Union, the better."

Democrats chose Senator Stephen Douglas. Southern Democrats backed the current vice president, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, who supported slavery in the territories.
Meanwhile, a new political party emerged. The Constitutional Union Party recognized "no political principles other than the Constitution of the country, the Union of the states, and the enforcement of the laws." Their platform was a reaction against the idea of states' rights. Members of this new party met in Baltimore, Maryland, and selected John Bell of Tennessee as their candidate. Bell was a slaveholder, but he had opposed the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854.
Senator William Seward of New York was the Republicans' leading candidate at the start of their convention. But it turned out that Lincoln appealed to more party members. A moderate who was against the spread of slavery, Lincoln promised not to abolish slavery where it already existed.
Douglas, Breckinridge, and Bell each knew he might not win the election. They hoped to win enough electoral votes to prevent Lincoln from winning in the electoral college. But with a unified Republican Party behind him, Lincoln won. Although he received the highest number of votes, he won only about 40 percent of the overall popular vote.
Lincoln won 180 of 183 electoral votes in free states. Douglas had the second-highest number of popular votes, but he won only one state. He earned just 12 electoral votes. Breckinridge and Bell split electoral votes in other slave states.
The election results angered southerners. Lincoln did not campaign in their region and did not carry any southern states, but he became the next president. The election signaled that the South was losing its national political power.

The South Secedes
Lincoln insisted that he would not change slavery in the South. However, he said that slavery could not expand and thus would eventually die out completely. That idea angered many southerners.
Southerners' Reactions
People in the South believed their economy and way of life would be destroyed without slave labor. They reacted immediately. Within a week of Lincoln's election, South Carolina's legislature called for a special convention. The delegates considered secession. Southern secessionists believed that they had a right to leave the Union. They pointed out that each of the original states had voluntarily joined the Union by holding a special convention that had ratified the Constitution. Surely, they reasoned, states could leave the Union by the same process.
Critics of secession thought this argument was ridiculous. President Buchanan said the Union was not "a mere voluntary association of States, to be dissolved
at pleasure by any one of the contracting parties." President-elect Abraham Lincoln agreed, saying, "No State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union." Lincoln added, "They can only do so against [the] law, and by revolution." The states' rights debate over the meaning of the Constitution had reached its tensest moment. Congress worked urgently for yet another compromise to ease the tension.
While the South Carolina representatives were meeting in Charleston to discuss secession, Congress examined a plan to save the Union. Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky proposed a series of constitutional amendments that he believed would satisfy the South by protecting slavery. Crittenden hoped the country could avoid secession and a civil war.
Lincoln disagreed with Crittenden's plan. He believed there could be no compromise about the extension of slavery. Lincoln wrote, "The tug has to come and better now than later." A Senate committee voted on Crittenden's plan, and every Republican rejected it, as Lincoln had requested.

How does this photo show the state of the southern government?
The Confederate States of America
South Carolina elected to dissolve "the union now subsisting [existing] between South Carolina and other States" on December 20, 1860. Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas also seceded to form the Confederate States of America, also called the Confederacy. Its new constitution guaranteed citizens the right to own slaves.
Delegates from seceded states elected Jefferson Davis of Mississippi as president of the Confederacy. Davis had hoped to be the commanding general of Mississippi's troops. He responded to the news of his election with reluctance.
When the southern states seceded, the question of who owned federal property in the South arose. For instance, the forts in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, were federal property. However, Confederate president Davis and the Confederacy were ready to prevent the federal army from controlling the property.
Lincoln Takes Office
President Lincoln was inaugurated on March 4, 1861. In writing his inaugural address, Lincoln looked to many of the nation's founding documents. Referring to the idea that governments receive "their just powers from the consent of the governed," a line from the Declaration of Independence, Lincoln stated, "This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they grow weary of the existing Government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember [take apart] or overthrow it. I can not be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous [wanting] of having the National Constitution amended..."
While he believed that U.S. citizens had the power to change their government through majority consent, he opposed the idea that southern states could leave the
Union because they were unhappy with the government's position on slavery.
He announced in his inaugural address that he would keep all government property in the seceding states. However, he also tried to convince southerners that his government would not provoke a war. He hoped that, given time, southern states would return to the Union.

Assessing Primary and Secondary Sources
Define the Skill
All historical information comes from primary and secondary sources. Primary sources are documents written by someone who witnessed or took part in an event. They include diaries, letters, and artifacts such as paintings. Secondary sources are accounts of events written after the events have occurred. They retell, interpret, and summarize information from primary sources. History books, biographies, and computer software and databases are examples of secondary sources. Some sources, such as interviews and news or media reports, might be either depending on its content.
Historical sources often disagree. One writer's version of an event may be different from another writer's version. You must assess the reliability of a source in order to weigh its value to you as a source of accurate information. You can locate sources in a library, online, in newspapers, or on television.
Learn the Skill
Use these guidelines to analyze and evaluate primary and secondary sources.
1.	Identify the nature of the material. Is it a firsthand, eyewitness account or is it based on information provided by others?
2.	Evaluate the author. If the material is a secondary source, what qualifications does the author have? If the material is a primary source, what was the author's connection to the event?
3.	Determine the audience. Was the source meant to be seen by the public? The intended audience can influence a source's content.
4.	Determine the purpose. Look for evidence of exaggeration, opinion, or bias that may have influenced the account.
5.	Look for documentation. Look for other information or evidence that supports the source's account. Compare sources whenever possible.

Writing
Workshop
Assignment
Write a paper comparing and contrasting one of the following: (1) America before and after the Industrial Revolution, (2) the lives of free blacks in the North with the lives of free blacks in the South.
Using Graphic Organizers
i diagrams help you focus on similarities and differences. Write details the subjects have in common in the overlapping area. Write details that make each subject different in the sections that do not overlap.
Comparing People and Events
One way to learn more about historical figures and events is to compare and contrast them. By studying how the figures or events are alike and different, you can begin to see each one more clearly.
1. Prewrite
Getting Started
"How are they alike?" "How are they different?" Jot down answers to these questions as you research the lives of free blacks or the Industrial Revolution. Group your answers into points of comparison. For example, points of comparison for the lives of free blacks might be work, education, etc. Points of comparison for the Industrial Revolution might be factories or farming.
Organizing Your Information
There are two ways to organize a compare-and-contrast paper.
■	Block Style Say everything you have to say about one subject. Then say everything you have to say about the second subject. Discuss the points of comparison in the same order for each subject.
■	Point-by-Point Style Discuss the points of comparison one at a time. Explain how the subjects are alike and different on one point of comparison, then another, and so on. Discuss the subjects in the same order for each point of comparison.
2. Write
You can use this framework with your notes to help you write your
A
Writer's Framework first draft. Introduction ■	Identify the two subjects and give background information to help readers understand your comparisons. ■	State your big idea, or main purpose, in comparing and contrasting them.	Body ■	Use block or point-by-point organization. ■	Use three points of comparison. ■	Support your points with specific historical facts, details, and examples.	Conclusion	j ■	Restate your big idea.	j ■	Summarize the points you made. ■	Expand on your big idea, perhaps by j relating it to later historical events or other historical figures.	j
502 UNIT 4
3. Evaluate and Revise Evaluating
Use these questions to discover ways to improve your paper.
Evaluation Questions for a Comparison/Contrast Paper
■	Do you introduce both subjects in the first paragraph?
■	Do you state your big idea in the introduction?
■	Do you provide relevant background information in a clear and concise manner?
■	Do you include three points of comparison between the subjects?
■	Do you use either the block style or point-by-point style
to organize your points of comparison?
■	Do you support your points of comparison with appropriate historical facts, details, and examples?
■	Do you restate your big idea and summarize your points?
■	Are you using correct grammar, spelling, sentence structure, punctuation, and appropriate citation of your sources?
Making Meaning Clear
One way to make relationships between ideas clear is to repeat key or similar words and phrases in your writing. For example, you can use similar wording when comparing two historical figures on the same point of comparison.
EXAMPLE
Samuel Slater filled his labor needs by hiring entire families to work in the mills. Francis Lowell filled his labor needs by hiring young, unmarried women to work in the mills.
Revising
As you reread your paper, look for sentences that start with There was or There were. Sentences beginning with There was/There were tend to be weak: The verbs was and were do not convey any action.
Weak
There was a decline in southern agriculture after the American Revolution.
Stronger
Southern agriculture declined after the American Revolution.
4. Proofread and Publish
Proofreading
In a research report, you may be referring to the titles of your sources of information. Check to see whether you have punctuated any titles according to these guidelines.
■	Underlining (if you are writing) or italics (if you are using a computer) for books, movies, TV programs, Internet sites, and magazines or newspapers
■	Quotation marks for magazine articles, newspaper articles, chapters in a book
Publishing
Share your paper with one or more classmates. After reading each other's papers, you can compare and contrast them.

What You Will Learn...
When compromise after compromise failed, the United States was divided by war. The American Civil War tested the strength of the bond between the states. During the Civil War, Americans fought each other on battlefields and in government. Ideas about slavery and sovereignty led many soldiers to fight. Eventually the nation was reunited, but deep scars remained. In the next two chapters, you will learn about the war and the period after when rebuilding the South became a priority.

If YOU were there...
You are a college student in Charleston in early 1861. Seven southern states have left the Union and formed their own government. All-out war seems unavoidable. Your friends have begun to volunteer for either the Union or the Confederate forces. You are tom between loyalty to your home state and to the United States. Would you join the Union or the Confederate army?
BUILDING BACKGROUND
The divisions within the United States reached a breaking point with the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860. Several southern states angrily left the Union to form a new confederation. In border states such as Virginia and Kentucky, people were divided. The question now was whether the United States could survive as a disunified country. Americans Choose Sides
Furious at Lincoln's election and fearing a federal invasion, seven southern states had seceded. The new commander in chief tried desperately to save the Union.
In his inaugural address, Lincoln promised not to end slavery where it existed. The federal government "will not assail [attack] you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors," he said, trying to calm southerners' fears. However, Lincoln also stated his intention to preserve the Union. He believed that saving the Union would help to save democracy. If the Union and its government failed, then monarchs could say that people were unable to rule themselves. As a result, Lincoln refused to recognize secession, declaring the Union to be "unbroken."
Infact, after decades of painful compromises, the Union was badly broken. From the lower South, a battle cry was arising, bom out of fear, rage—and excitement. Confederate officials began seizing branches of the federal mint, arsenals, and military outposts. In a last ditch effort to avoid war between the states, Secretary of State Seward suggested a united effort of threatening war against Spain and France for interfering in Mexico and the Caribbean. In the highly charged atmosphere, it would take only a spark to unleash the heat of war.

would the Union Army need to resupply Fort Sumter?
2.	Place What advantages would a floating battery have?
In 1861, that spark occurred at Fort Sumter, a federal outpost in Charleston, South Carolina, that was attacked by Confederate troops, beginning the Civil War. Determined to seize the fortress—which controlled the entrance to Charleston harbor— the Confederates ringed the harbor with heavy guns. Instead of surrendering the fort, Lincoln decided to send in ships to provide badly needed supplies to defend the fort. Confederate officials demanded that the federal troops evacuate. The fort's commander, Major Robert Anderson, refused.
Before sunrise on April 12,1861, Confederate guns opened fire on Fort Sumter. A witness wrote that the first shots brought "every soldier in the harbor to his feet, and every man, woman, and child in the city of Charleston from their beds." The Civil War had begun.
The fort, although massive, stood little chance. Its heavy guns faced the Atlantic Ocean, not the shore. After 34 hours of cannon blasts, Fort Sumter surrendered. "The last ray of hope for preserving the Union has expired at the assault upon Fort Sumter ..." Lincoln wrote.
Reaction to Lincoln's Call
The fall of Fort Sumter stunned the North. Lincoln declared the South to be in a state of rebellion and asked state governors for 75,000 militiamen to put down the rebellion. States now had to choose: Would they secede, or would they stay in the Union? Democratic Senator Stephen Douglas, speaking in support of Lincoln's call for troops, declared, "There can be no neutrals in this war, only patriots—or traitors."

West Virginia (Separated from Virginia in 1861 and joined the Union in 1863)
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the states north of them rallied to the president's call. The crucial slave states of the Upper South—North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Arkansas—seceded. They provided soldiers and supplies to the South. Mary Boykin Chesnut, whose husband became a Confederate congressman, wrote in her diary:
** I did not know that one could live in such days of excitement... Everybody tells you half of something, and then rushes off.. .to hear the lastnews/^
—Mary Boykin Chesnut, quoted in MaryChesnut's Civil War, edited by C. Vann Woodward
Wedged between the North and the South were the key border states of Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri—slave states that did not join the Confederacy. Kentucky and Missouri controlled parts of important rivers. Maryland separated the Union capital, Washington, D.C., from the North.
People in the border states were deeply divided on the war. The president's own
wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, had four brothers from Kentucky who fought for the Confederacy. Lincoln sent federal troops into the border states to help keep them in the Union. He also sent soldiers into western Virginia, where Union loyalties were strong. West Virginia set up its own state government in 1863.
Northern Resources
Numbers tell an important story about the Civil War. Consider the North's advantages. It could draw soldiers and workers from a population of 22 million. The South had only 5.5 million people to draw from. One of the greatest advantages in the North was the region's network of roads, canals, and railroads. Some 22,000 miles of railroad track could move soldiers and supplies throughout the North. The South had only about 9,000 miles of track.
In the North, the Civil War stimulated economic growth. To supply the military, the
512 CHAPTER 16
production of coal, iron, wheat, and wool increased. Also, the export of com, wheat, beef, and pork to Europe doubled. In the South, the export of resources decreased because of the Union blockade.
Finally, the Union had money. It had a more developed economy, banking system, and a currency called greenbacks. The South had to start printing its own Confederate dollars. Some states printed their own money, too. This led to financial chaos.
Taking advantage of the Union's strengths, General Winfield Scott developed a two-part strategy: (1) destroy the South's economy with a naval blockade of southern ports; (2) gain control of the Mississippi River to divide the South. Other leaders urged an attack on Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital.
The South hoped to wear down the North and to capture Washington, D.C. Confederate president Jefferson Davis also tried to win foreign allies through cotton diplomacy. This was the idea that Great Britain would support the Confederacy because it needed the South's raw cotton to supply its booming textile industry. Cotton diplomacy did not work as the South had hoped. Britain had large supplies of cotton, and it got more from India and Egypt.
READING CHECK
Comparing What advantages did the North and South have leading up to the war?
Resources of the North and South
Southern Resources
The Confederacy had advantages as well. With its strong military tradition, the South put many brilliant officers into battle. Southern farms provided food for its armies. The South's best advantage, however, was strategic. It needed only to defend itself until the North grew tired of fighting.
The North had to invade and control the South. To accomplish this, the Union army had to travel huge distances. For example, the distance from northern Virginia to central Georgia is about the length of Scotland and England combined. Because of distances such as this, the North had to maintain long supply lines.
In addition, wilderness covered much of the South. Armies found this land difficult to cross. Also, in Virginia, many of the rivers ran from east to west. Because of this, they formed a natural defense against an army that attacked from the north to the south. As a result, Northern generals were often forced to attack Confederate troops from the side rather than from the front. Furthermore, because southerners fought mostly on their home soil, they were often familiar with the area.

Preparing for War
The North and the South now rushed to war. Neither side was prepared for the tragedy to come.
Volunteer Armies
Volunteer militias had sparked the revolution that created the United States. Now they would battle for its future. At the start of the war, the Union army had only 16,(XX) soldiers. Within months that number had swelled to a half million. Southern men rose up to defend their land and their ways of life. Virginian Thomas Webber came to fight "against the invading foe [enemy] who now pollute the sacred soil of my beloved native state." When Union soldiers asked one captured rebel why he was fighting, he replied, "I'm fighting because you're down here."
Helping the Troops
Civilians on both sides helped those in uniform. They raised money, provided aid for soldiers and their families, and ran emergency hospitals. Dr. Elizabeth Black-well, the first woman to receive a license to practice medicine, organized a group that pressured President Lincoln to form the U.S. Sanitary Commission in June 1861. The Sanitary, as it was called, was run by clergyman Henry Bellows. Tens of thousands of volunteers worked with the U.S. Sanitary Commission to send bandages, medicines, and food to Union army camps and hospitals. Some 3,000 women served as nurses in the Union army.
Training the Soldiers
Both the Union and Confederate armies faced shortages of clothing, food, and even rifles. Most troops lacked standard uniforms and simply wore their own clothes. Eventually, each side chose a color for their uniforms. The Union chose blue. The Confederates wore gray.
514 CHAPTER 16
The problem with volunteers was that many of them had no idea how to fight. Schoolteachers, farmers, and laborers all had to learn the combat basics of marching, shooting, and using bayonets.
In a letter to a friend, a Union soldier described life in the training camp.
^We have been wading through mud knee deep all winter... For the last two weeks we have been drilled almost to death. Squad drill from 6 to 7 A.M. Company drill from 9 to 11 A.M. Batal-lion Drill from 2 to 41 /2 P.M. Dress Parade from 5 to 51/2 P.M. and non-commissioned officers' school from 7 to 8 in the evening. If we don't soon become a well drilled Regiment, we ought X.o.^
R. R
Shoemaker,! 862 With visions of glory and action, many young soldiers were eager to fight. They would not have to wait long.
Discipline and drill were used to turn raw volunteers into an efficient fighting machine. During a battle, the success or failure of a regiment often depended on its discipline—how well it responded to orders.
Volunteers also learned how to use rifles. Eventually, soldiers were expected to be able
to load, aim, and fire their rifles three times in one minute. The quality of the weapons provided varied greatly. Most soldiers favored the Springfield and Enfield rifles for their accuracy. On the other hand, soldiers often complained about their Austrian and Belgian rifles. A soldier remarked, "I don't believe one could hit the broadside of a barn with them."
The Union army provided the infantry with two-person tents. However, soldiers often discarded these tents in favor of more portable ones. The Confederate army did not usually issue tents. Instead, Confederates often used tents that were captured from the Union army.

North and the SOUth
One of the most basic disagreements that led to the Civil War was whether or not individual states had the legal right to secede. This issue was debated repeatedly . in Congress, state legislatures, the press, and speeches by politicians.The presidents of the two sides, Abraham Lincoln of the Union and Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy, used speeches to explain their governments'goals.
Comparing the Speeches
The speeches of Lincoln and Davis revealed the dramatic difference of opinions between the North and the South. Lincoln spoke of the importance of the Union and the unbreakable bond among states belonging to the government of the United States. Davis's words displayed the view that the idea of states'rights allowed the South to leave the Union because the federal government no longer protected its interests. When Lincoln spoke of liberties and equality, he included those of African Americans. Davis did not touch upon the topics, knowing how divisive the moral issue of slavery was even among Southerners.
f	Ideas	J	Lincoln	1	Davis	|
Liberty	The United States was a nation founded on the belief of liberty for everyone, including African Americans.	The freedom to own slaves was protected under the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, but had been violated by recent Congressional actions.
Equality	Equality was also guaranteed to everyone by the ideals of the nation.	"Equality" was one of the South's ideals, but did not include equality among races.
Union	The Union was an agreement of many states, and all of them had to agree for it to be broken. Preserving it was his primary goal.	The union of states was based on an agreement, and states could choose to leave if they wanted.

SPEECH
Jefferson Davis's Inaugural Address
j In his inauguration speech, Jefferson Davis gave the reasons Southern leaders 5 believed they had a right to secede, and he stated that they would do so peace-l fully if allowed:
/^[The South's right to secede is based on] the American idea that governments rest on the consent of the governed, and that it is the right of the people to alter or abolish them at will whenever they become destructive of the ends for which they were established.... Actuated solely by the desire to preserve our own. rights, and promote our own welfare, the separation by the Confederate States has been marked by no aggression upon others, and followed by no domestic convulsion1. H

He claimed that the liberties guaranteed to citizens and states in the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights had been violated by attempts to limit the spread of slavery. He compared the Constitution of the new government with that of the United States, saying that they were similar. The main difference was the clear protection of slavery in the Confederate constitution.
^/...mutual interest will invite to good will and kind offices on both parts. If,
however, passion or lust of dominion should cloud the judgment or inflame the ambition of those States, we must prepare to meet the emergency and to maintain, by the final arbitrament2 of the sword, the position which we have assumed among the nations of the earth/^
But Davis also spoke of the urgent need for an army and a navy.
Davis'speech only mentions "equality" once, in a list of ideals that he counts as the South's ideals. Davis did not mention equality between the races, even in reference to the lack of equal rights for African Americans. He also did not directly discuss the nature of the Confederate government and union. Even leaders that strongly supported the Confederate cause could not answer whether or not a Southern state would have the rightto secede from the Confederacy if it chose to in the future. The issue would soon become hotly debated in Virginia. Residents of western Virginia wanted to remain part of the Union and seceded from eastern Virginia only a few months after the South's secession. Virginia's legislature fought the action, but the region became the Union state of l/l/esf Virginia the next year.

Lincoln's First Inaugural Address
Lincoln's first inaugural address, on March 4,1861, described his desire to maintain the Union and prevent war with the Southern states. Although slavery was a huge issue in the debate over secession, Lincoln did not say that he would work to free the slaves. He stated that preserving the Union was his primary goal, even if that meant that slavery remained legal.
Lincoln suggested that in a democratic government, the correct course of action for the South was to work toward an amendment to the Constitution instead of rejecting the union. He stated his reasons for disagreeing with Southern leaders on the issue of whether or not secession was legal.
//...no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union [and] that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void...//
Lincoln knew that southern leaders had already considered this argument and that some were calling for armed rebellion. They believed the Constitution protected their liberty to own slaves.
//In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not assail you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors//

He pointed out that because the Union was agreed to by every state, all of them had to agree in order to break it.
Lincoln warned that any revolutionary actions would be met with Union military force.

The first lines are some of the most quoted lines of any American speech. This was the type of nation, one where everyone was entitled to liberty and equality, that the Union troops fought and died for.

After the bloody Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln gave a speech that supported the Union's goal of continuing the fight for the Union.

Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address
By early 1865 the South was near defeat. Lincoln's speech at his second inauguration showed his desire for reconciliation with the South.
He reminded both northerners and southerners that neither side had wanted the war and that each side had taken up arms. Neither side, he implied, was entirely blameless. Lincoln said that the entire country had suffered in the war because it had allowed slavery for so long. He closed his speech with these words:
^With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations/*'

I BUILDING BACKGROUND
The shots fired at Fort Sumter made I the war a reality. Neither the North nor the South was really prepared. Each side had some advantages—more industry and railroads in the ; North, a military tradition in the South. The war in the East centered in i the region around the two capitals: Washington, D.C., and Richmond, j
Virginia.	i
fe---------------------------------------
War in Virginia
The troops that met in the first major battle of the Civil War found that it was no picnic. In July 1861, Lincoln ordered General Irvin McDowell to lead his 35,000-man army from the Union capital, Washington, to the Confederate capital, Richmond. The soldiers were barely trained. McDowell complained that they "stopped every moment to pick blackberries or get water; they would not keep in the ranks." The first day's march covered only five miles.
Bull Run/Manassas
McDowell's army was headed to Manassas, Virginia, an important railroad junction. If McDowell could seize Manassas, he would control the best route to the Confederate capital. Some 22,000 Confederate troops under the command of General Pierre G. T. Beauregard were waiting for McDowell and his troops along a creek called Bull Run. For two days, Union troops tried to find a way around the Confederates. During that time, Beauregard requested assistance, and
516 CHAPTER 16
General Joseph E. Johnston headed toward Manassas with another 10,000 Confederate troops. By July 21,1861, they had all arrived.
That morning, Union troops managed to cross the creek and drive back the left side of the Confederate line. Yet one unit held firmly in place.
"There is Jackson standing like a stone wall!" cried one southern officer. "Rally behind the Virginians!" At that moment, General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson earned his famous nickname.
A steady stream of Virginia volunteers arrived to counter the attack. The Confederates surged forward, letting out their terrifying "rebel yell." One eyewitness described the awful scene.
^There is smoke, dust, wild talking, shouting; hissings, howlings, explosions. It is a new, strange, unanticipated experience to the soldiers of both armies, far different from what they thought it would be."
—Charles Coffin, quoted in Voices of the Civil War by Richard Wheeler
The battle raged through the day, with rebel soldiers still arriving. Finally, the weary Union troops gave out. They tried to make an orderly retreat back across the creek, but the roads were clogged with the fancy carriages of panicked spectators. The Union army scattered in the chaos.
The Confederates lacked the strength to push north and capture Washington, D.C. But clearly, the rebels had won the day. The First Battle of Bull Run was the first major battle of the Civil War, and the Confederates' victory. The battle is also known as the First Battle of Manassas. It shattered the North's hopes of winning the war quickly.
More Battles in Virginia
The shock at Bull Run persuaded Lincoln of the need for a better trained army. He put his hopes in General George B. McClellan. The general assembled a highly disciplined force of 100,000 soldiers called the Army of the Potomac. The careful McClellan spent months training. However, because

he overestimated the size of the Confederate army, McClellan hesitated to attack. Lincoln grew impatient. Finally, in the spring of 1862, McClellan launched an effort to capture Richmond called the "Peninsular Campaign." Instead of marching south for a direct assault, McClellan slowly brought his force through the peninsula between the James and York rivers. More time slipped away.
The South feared that McClellan would receive reinforcements from Washington. To prevent this, Stonewall Jackson launched an attack toward Washington. Although the attack was pushed back, it prevented the Union from sending reinforcements to McClellan.
THE IMPACT
TODAY
Many Americans continue to be fascinated by the Civil War. Some history buffs regularly stage re-enactments of famous battles, complete with uniforms, guns, and bayonets.
THE CIVIL WAR 51
In June 1862, with McClellan's force poised outside Richmond, the Confederate army in Virginia came under the command of General Robert E. Lee. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Lee had served in the Mexican War and had led federal troops at Harpers Ferry. Lee was willing to take risks and make unpredictable moves to throw Union forces off balance.
During the summer of 1862, Lee strengthened his positions. On June 26, he attacked, launching a series of clashes known as the Seven Days' Battles that forced the Union army to retreat from near Richmond. Confederate General D. H. Hill described one failed attack. "It was not war—it was murder," he said. Lee saved Richmond and forced McClellan to retreat.
A frustrated Lincoln ordered General John Pope to march directly on Richmond from Washington. Pope told his soldiers, "Let us look before us and not behind. Success and glory are in the advance."
Jackson wanted to defeat Pope's army before it could join up with McClellan's
larger Army of the Potomac. Jackson's troops met Pope's Union forces on the battlefield in August in 1862. The three-day battle became known as the Second Battle of Bull Run, or the Second Battle of Manassas.
The first day's fighting was savage. Captain George Fairfield of the 7th Wisconsin regiment later recalled, "What a slaughter! No one appeared to know the object of the fight, and there we stood for one hour, the men falling all around." The fighting ended in a stalemate.
On the second day, Pope found Jackson's troops along an unfinished railroad grade. Pope hurled his men against the Confederates. But the attacks were pushed back with heavy casualties on both sides.
On the third day, the Confederates crushed the Union army's assault and forced it to retreat in defeat. The Confederates had won a major victory, and General Robert E. Lee decided it was time to take the war to the North.

Battle of Antietam
Confederate leaders hoped to follow up Lee's successes in Virginia with a major victory on northern soil. On September 4, 1862, some 40,000 Confederate soldiers began crossing into Maryland. General Robert E. Lee decided to divide his army. He sent about half of his troops, under the command of Stonewall Jackson, to Harpers Ferry. There they defeated a Union force and captured the town. Meanwhile, Lee arrived in the town of Frederick and issued a Proclamation to the People of Maryland, urging them to join the Confederates. However, his words would not be enough to convince Marylanders to abandon the Union. Union soldiers, however, found a copy of Lee's battle plan, which had been left at an abandoned Confederate camp. General McClellan learned that Lee had divided his army in order to attack Harpers Ferry. However, McClellan hesitated to attack. As a result, the Confederates had time to reunite.

Biography
Robert E. Lee
(1807-1870)
Robert E. Lee was born into a wealthy Virginia family in 1807. Lee fought in the Mexican-American War, helping to capture Veracruz. When the Civil War began, President Lincoln asked Lee to lead the Union army. Lee declined and resigned from the U.S. Army to become a general in the Confederate army.
Drawing Conclusions How did
Lee's choice reflect the division of the states?
The two armies met along Antietam Creek in Maryland on September 17, 1862. The battle lasted for hours. By the end of the day, the Union had suffered more than 12,000 casualties. The Confederates endured more than 13,000 casualties.
Union officer A. H. Nickerson later recalled, "It seemed that everybody near me was killed." The Battle of Antietam, also known as the Battle of Sharpsburg, was the bloodiest single-day battle of the Civil War—and of U.S. history. More soldiers were killed and wounded at the Battle of Antietam than the deaths of all Americans in the American Revolution, War of 1812, and Mexican-American War combined.
During the battle, McClellan kept four divisions of soldiers in reserve and refused to use them to attack Lee's devastated army. McClellan was convinced that Lee was massing reserves for a counterattack. Those reserves did not exist. Despite this blunder, Antietam was an important victory. Lee's northward advance had been stopped.

Breaking the Union's Blockade
While the two armies fought for control of the land, the Union navy controlled the sea. The North had most of the U.S. Navy's small fleet, and many experienced naval officers had remained loyal to the Union. The North also had enough industry to build more ships. The Confederacy turned to British companies for new ships.

The Union's Naval Strategy
The Union navy quickly mobilized to set up a blockade of southern ports. The blockade largely prevented the South from selling or receiving goods, and it seriously damaged the southern economy.
The blockade was hard to maintain because the Union navy had to patrol thousands of miles of coastline from Virginia to Texas. The South used small, fast ships to outrun the larger Union warships. Most of these blockade runners traveled to the Bahamas or
Nassau to buy supplies for the Confederacy. These ships, however, could not make up for the South's loss of trade. The Union blockade reduced the number of ships entering southern ports from 6,000 to 800 per year.
Clash of the Ironclads
Hoping to take away the Union's advantage at sea, the Confederacy turned to a new type of warship—irondads, or ships heavily armored with iron. The British government neglected to stop these ships from being delivered, in violation of its pledge of neutrality. The Confederates had captured a Union steamship, the Merrimack, and turned it into an ironclad, renamed the Virginia. One Union sailor described the innovation as "a huge half-submerged crocodile." In early March 1862, the ironclad sailed into Hampton Roads, Virginia, an important waterway guarded by Union ships. Before nightfall, the Virginia easily sank two of the Union's wooden warships, while it received minor damage.

The Union navy had already built its own ironclad, the Monitor, designed by Swedish-.born engineer John Ericsson. Ericsson's ship had unusual new features, such as a revolving gun tower. One Confederate soldier called the Monitor "a tin can on a shingle!" Although small, the Monitor carried powerful guns and had thick plating.
When the Virginia returned to Hampton Roads later that month, the Monitor was waiting. After several hours of fighting, neither ship was seriously damaged, but the Monitor forced the Virginia to withdraw. This success saved the Union fleet and continued the blockade. The clash of the ironclads also signaled a revolution in naval warfare. The days of wooden warships powered by wind and sails were drawing to a close.

Union Strategy in the West
While Lincoln fumed over the cautious, hesitant General McClellan, he had no such problems with Ulysses S. Grant. Bold and restless, Grant grew impatient when he was asked to lead defensive maneuvers. He wanted to be on the attack. As a commander of forces in the Union's western campaign, he would get his wish.
The western campaign focused on taking control of the Mississippi River. This strategy would cut off the eastern part of the Confederacy from sources of food production in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. From bases on the Mississippi, the Union army could attack southern communication and transportation networks.
In February 1862, Grant led an assault force into Tennessee. With help from navy gunboats, Grant's Army of the Tennessee took two outposts on key rivers in the west. On February 6, he captured Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. Several days later he took Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River.
Fort Donelson's commander asked for the terms of surrender. Grant replied, "No terms except an unconditional and immediate

surrender can be accepted." The fort surrendered. The North gave a new name to Grant's initials: "Unconditional Surrender" Grant.
Advancing south in Tennessee, General Grant paused near Shiloh Church to await the arrival of the Army of the Ohio. Grant knew that the large rebel army of General A. S. Johnston was nearby in Corinth, Mississippi, but he did not expect an attack. Instead of setting up defenses, he worked on drilling his new recruits.
In the early morning of April 6,1862, the rebels sprang on Grant's sleepy camp. This began the Battle of Shiloh, in which the Union army gained greater control of the Mississippi River valley.
During the bloody two-day battle, each side gained and lost ground. Johnston was killed on the first day. The arrival of the Ohio force helped Grant regain territory and push the enemy back into Mississippi. The armies finally gave out, each with about 10,000 casualties. Both sides claimed victory, but, in fact, the victor was Grant.
The Fall of New Orleans
As Grant battled his way down the Mississippi, the Union navy prepared to blast its way upriver to meet him. The first obstacle was the port of New Orleans, the largest city in the Confederacy and the gateway to the Mississippi River.
Biography
David Farragut
(1801-1870)
David Farragut was born in Tennessee to a Spanish father and an American mother. At age seven Farragut was adopted by a family friend who agreed to train the young boy for the navy. Farragut received his first navy position—midshipman at large—at age nine and commanded his first vessel at 12. He spent the rest of his life in the U.S. Navy. Farragut led key attacks on the southern ports of Vicksburg and New Orleans.
Drawing Inferences How did Farragut help the war effort of the North?
THE CIVIL WAR 52
With 18 ships and 700 men, Admiral David Farragut approached the two forts that guarded the entrance to New Orleans from the Gulf of Mexico. Unable to destroy the forts, Farragut decided to race past them.
The risky operation would take place at night. Farragut had his wooden ships wrapped in heavy chains to protect them like ironclads. Sailors slapped Mississippi mud on the ships' hulls to make them hard to see. Trees were tied to the masts to make the ships look like the forested shore.
Before dawn on April 24, 1862, the warships made their daring dash. The Confederates fired at Farragut's ships from the shore and from gunboats. They launched burning rafts, one of which scorched Farragut's own ship. But his fleet slipped by the twin forts and made it to New Orleans. The city fell on April 29.
Farragut sailed up the Mississippi River, taking Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Natchez, Mississippi. He then approached the city of Vicksburg, Mississippi.
The Siege of Vicksburg
Vicksburg's geography made invasion all but impossible. Perched on 200-foot-high cliffs above the Mississippi River, the city could rain down firepower on enemy ships or on soldiers trying to scale the cliffs. Deep gorges surrounded the city, turning back land assaults. Nevertheless, Farragut ordered Vicksburg to surrender.
^Mississippians don't know, and refuse to learn, how to surrender... If Commodore Farragut... can teach them, let [him] come and try/'
—Colonel James L. Autry, military commander of Vicksburg
Farragut's guns had trouble reaching the city above. It was up to General Grant. His solution was to starve the city into surrender.
General Grant's troops began the Siege of Vicksburg in mid-May 1863, cutting off the city and shelling it repeatedly. As food ran out, residents and soldiers survived by eating horses, dogs, and rats. "We are utterly cut off from the world, surrounded by a circle of fire," wrote one woman. "People do nothing

but eat what they can get, sleep when they can, and dodge the shells."
The Confederate soldiers were also sick and hungry. In late June a group of soldiers sent their commander a warning.
^The army is now ripe for mutiny [rebellion], unless it can be fed. If you can't feed us, you'd better surrender us, horrible as the idea is/'
—Confederate soldiers at Vicksburg to General John C. Pemberton, 1863
On July 4, Pemberton surrendered. Grant immediately sent food to the soldiers and civilians. He later claimed that "the fate of the Confederacy was sealed when Vicksburg fell."

Struggle for the Far West
Early on in the war, the Union halted several attempts by Confederate armies to control lands west of the Mississippi. In August 1861, a Union detachment from Colorado turned back a Confederate force at Glorieta Pass. Union volunteers also defeated rebel forces at Arizona's Pichaco Pass.
Confederate attempts to take the border state of Missouri also collapsed. Failing to seize the federal arsenal at St. Louis in mid-1861, the rebels fell back to Pea Ridge in northwest Arkansas. There, in March 1862, they attacked again, aided by some 800 Cherokee. The Indians hoped the Confederates would give them greater freedom. In addition, slavery was legal in Indian Territory, and some Native Americans who were slaveholders supported the Confederacy. Despite being outnumbered, Union forces won the Battle of Pea Ridge. The Union defense of Missouri held.
Pro-Confederate forces remained active in the region throughout the war. They attacked Union forts and raided towns in Missouri and Kansas, forcing Union commanders to keep valuable troops stationed in the area.

Ulysses S. Grant
(1822-1885)
Ulysses S. Grant was born in April 1822 in New York. Grant attended West Point and fought in the Mexican-American War. He resigned in 1854 and worked at various jobs in farming, real estate, and retail. When the Civil War started, he joined the Union army and was quickly promoted to general. After the Civil War, Grant rode a wave of popularity to become president of the United States.


Grant Moves East Grant's troops met up with their supply boats here and crossed back into Mississippi. In a daring gamble, Grant decided to move without a supply line, allowing his army to move quickly.

528 CHAPTER 16
Emancipation Proclamation
At the heart of the nation's bloody struggle were millions of enslaved African Americans. Abolitionists urged President Lincoln to free them.
In an 1858 speech, Lincoln declared,
"There is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights numerated in the Declaration of Independence—the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Yet as president, Lincoln found emancipation, or the freeing of slaves, to be a difficult issue. He did not believe he had the constitutional power. He also worried about the effects of emancipation.
Lincoln Issues the Proclamation
Northerners had a range of opinions about abolishing slavery.
•	The Democratic Party, which included many laborers, opposed emancipation. Laborers feared that freed slaves would come north and take their jobs at lower wages.
•	Abolitionists argued that the war was pointless if it did not win freedom for African Americans. They warned that the Union would remain divided until the problem was resolved.

Place In which places was slavery still legal after the Emancipation Proclamation?
•	Lincoln worried about losing support for the war. Previous wartime Confiscation Acts that had attempted to free the slaves had been unpopular in the border states.
•	Others, including Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, agreed with Lincoln that the use of slave labor was helping the Confederacy make war. Therefore, as commander in chief, the president could free the slaves in all rebellious states. Freed African Americans could then be recruited into the Union army.
For several weeks in 1862, Lincoln worked intensely, thinking, writing, and rewriting. He finally wrote the Emancipation Proclamation, the order to free the Confederate slaves. The proclamation declared that:
M... all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free."
—Emancipation Proclamation, 1862
The Emancipation Proclamation was a military order that freed slaves only in areas controlled by the Confederacy. In fact, the
THE
Cl 529
proclamation had little immediate effect. It was impossible for the federal government to enforce the proclamation in the areas where it actually applied—the states in rebellion that were not under federal control. The proclamation <LJ not stop slavery in the border states, where the federal government would have had the power to enforce it. The words written in the Emancipation Proclamation were powerful, but the impact of the document was more symbolic than real. It defined what the Union was fighting against, and discouraged Britain from aiding the Confederacy.
Lincoln wanted to be in a strong position in the war before announcing his plan. The Battle of Antietam gave him the victory he needed. He issued the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862. The proclamation went into effect on January 1, 1863.
Reaction to the Proclamation
New Year's Eve, December 31,1862: In "night watch" meetings at many African American churches, worshippers prayed, sang, and gave thanks. When the clocks struck midnight, millions were free. Abolitionists rejoiced. Frederick Douglass called January 1, 1863, "the great day which is to determine the destiny not only of the American Republic, but that of the American Continent."
William Lloyd Garrison was quick to note, however, that "slavery, as a system" continued to exist in the loyal slave states. Yet where slavery remained, the proclamation encouraged many enslaved Africans to escape when the Union troops came near. They flocked to the Union camps and followed them for protection. The loss of slaves crippled the South's ability to wage war.

SKILL! ANALYZING PRIMARY SOURCES
Why did Williams think being soldiers was so important for African Americans?
African Americans
Participate in the War
As the war casualties climbed, the Union needed even more troops. African Americans were ready to volunteer. Not all white northerners were ready to accept them, but eventually they had to. Frederick Douglass believed that military service would help African Americans gain rights.

Once let the black man get upon his person the brass letters, U.S.; ... and a musket on his shoulder and bullets in his pocket, and there is no power on earth which can deny that he has earned the right to citizenship/^
—Frederick Douglass, quoted in The Life and Writings of Frederick Douglass, Vol. 3
Congress began allowing African Americans to volunteer as laborers in July 1862. The War Department also gave contrabands, or escaped slaves, the right to join the Union army in South Carolina. Free African Americans in Louisiana and Kansas also formed their own units. By the spring of 1863, African American army units were proving themselves in combat. They took part in a Union attack on Port Hudson, Louisiana, in May.
One unit stood out above the others. The 54th Massachusetts Infantry consisted mostly of free African Americans. In July 1863 this regiment led a heroic charge on South Carolina's Fort Wagner. The 54th took heavy fire and suffered huge casualties in the failed operation. About half the regiment was killed, wounded, or captured. Edward L. Pierce, a correspondent for the New York Tribune, wrote, "The Fifty-fourth did well and nobly...They moved up as gallantly as any troops could." William Camey, a sergeant in the regiment, became the first African American to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor after he was shot several times while keeping the U.S. flag aloft during the battle. The bravery of the 54th regiment made it the most celebrated African American unit of the war.
About 180,000 African Americans served with the Union army. They received $10 a month, while white soldiers got $13. They were usually led by white officers, some from abolitionist families.
African Americans faced special horrors on the battlefield. Confederates often killed their black captives or sold them into slavery. In the 1864 election, Lincoln suggested rewarding African American soldiers by giving them the right to vote.

THECIVILWAR 53’
Growing Opposition
The deepening shadows in Lincoln's face reflected the huge responsibilities he carried. Besides running the war, he had to deal with growing tensions in the North.
Copperheads
As the months rolled on and the number of dead continued to increase, a group of northern Democrats began speaking out against the war. Led by U.S. Representative Clement L. Vallandigham of Ohio, they called themselves Peace Democrats. Their enemies called them Copperheads, comparing them to a poisonous snake. The name stuck.
Many Copperheads were midwest-erners that sympathized with the South and opposed abolition. They believed the war was not necessary and called for its end. Vallandigham asked what the war had gained, and then said, "Let the dead at Fredericksburg and Vicksburg answer."
Lincoln saw the Copperheads as a threat to support of the war effort. To silence them, he suspended the right of habeas corpus.
Habeas corpus is a constitutional protection against unlawful imprisonment. Ignoring this protection, Union officials jailed their enemies, including some Copperheads, without evidence or trial. Lincoln's action greatly angered Democrats and some Republicans.
Northern Draft
In March 1863, war critics erupted again when Congress approved a draft, or forced military service. For $300, men were allowed to buy their way out of military service. For an unskilled laborer, however, that was nearly a year's wages. Critics of the draft called the Civil War a "rich man's war and a poor man's fight."
In July 1863, riots broke out when African Americans were brought into New York City to replace striking Irish dock workers. The city happened to be holding a war draft at the same time. The two events enraged rioters, who attacked African Americans and draft offices. More than 100 people died.
In this tense situation, the northern Democrats nominated former General George McClellan for president in 1864. They called

Identifying Cause and Effect
Who opposed the war, and how did Lincoln respond to the conflict?
Life for Soldiers and Civilians
Young, fresh recruits in both armies were generally eager to fight. Experienced troops, however, knew better.
On the Battlefield
Civil War armies fought in the ancient battlefield formation that produced massive casualties. Endless rows of troops fired directly at one another, with cannonballs landing amid them. When the order was given, soldiers would attach bayonets to their guns and rush toward their enemy. Men died to gain every inch of ground.
Doctors and nurses in the field saved many lives. Yet they had no medicines to stop infections that developed after soldiers were wounded. Many soldiers endured the horror of having infected legs and arms amputated without painkillers. Infections from minor injuries caused many deaths.
Despite the huge battlefield losses, the biggest killer in the Civil War was not the fighting. It was diseases such as typhoid, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. Nearly twice as many soldiers died of illnesses as died in combat.
Prisoners of War
Military prisoners on both sides lived in unimaginable misery. In prison camps, such as Andersonville, Georgia, and Elmira, New York, soldiers were packed into camps designed to hold only a fraction of their number. Soldiers had little shelter, food, or clothing. Starvation and disease killed thousands of prisoners.

Battlefield Communications
The drummer was an essential member of every Civil War unit. Drummers served army commanders by drumming specific beats that directed troop movements during battle. Different beats were used to order troops to prepare to attack, to fire, to cease fire, and to signal a truce. Drummers had to stay near their commanders to hear orders. This meant that the drummers—some as young as nine years old—often saw deadly combat conditions.
The Civil War gave birth to the Signal Corps, the army unit devoted to communications. Today battlefield communications are primarily electronic. Radio, e-mail, facsimile, and telephone messages, often relayed by satellites, enable orders and other information to be transmitted nearly instantaneously all over the globe.

Life as a Civilian
The war effort involved all levels of society. Women as well as people too young i or too old for military service worked in factories and on farms. Economy in the North boomed as production and prices soared. The
lack of workers caused wages to rise by 43 percent between 1860 and 1865.
Women were the backbone of civilian life. On the farms, women and children performed the daily chores usually done by men. One visitor to Iowa in 1862 reported that he "met more women ... at work in the fields than men." Southern women also managed farms and plantations.
One woman brought strength and comfort to countless wounded Union soldiers. Volunteer Clara Barton organized the collection of medicine and supplies for delivery to the battlefield. At the field hospitals,

Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville
Frustrated by McClellan's lack of aggression, Lincoln replaced him with General Ambrose E. Burnside as leader of the Army of the Potomac. Burnside favored a swift, decisive attack on Richmond by way of Fredericksburg. In November 1862, he set out with 120,000 troops.
Burnside's tactics surprised General Lee. The Confederate commander had divided his force of 78,000 men. Neither section of the Confederate army was in a good position to defend Fredericksburg. However, Burnside's army experienced delays in crossing the Rappahannock River. These delays allowed Lee's army to reunite and entrench themselves around Fredericksburg. Finally, the Union army crossed the Rappahannock and launched a series of charges. These attacks had heavy casualties and failed to break the Confederate line. Eventually, after suffering about 12,600 casualties, Burnside ordered a retreat. The Confederates had about 5,300 casualties.
Soon Burnside stepped down from his position. Lincoln made General Joseph Hooker the commander of the Army of the Potomac. At the end of April 1863, Hooker and his army of about 138,000 men launched a frontal attack on Fredericksburg. Then Hooker
536 CHAPTER 16
ordered about 115,000 of his troops to split off and approach the Confederate's flank, or side. Hooker's strategy seemed about to work. But for some reason he hesitated and had his flanking troops take a defensive position at Chancellorsville. This town was located a few miles west of Fredericksburg.
The following day, Lee used most of his army (about 60,000 men) to attack Hooker's troops at Chancellorsville. Stonewall Jack-son led an attack on Hooker's flank while Lee commanded an assault on the Union front. The Union army was almost cut in two. They managed to form a defensive line, which they held for three days. Then Hooker ordered a retreat.
Lee's army won a major victory. But this victory had severe casualties. During the battle, Lee's trusted general, Stonewall Jackson, was accidentally shot by his own troops. He died a few days later.

Battle of Gettysburg
General Lee launched more attacks within Union territory. As before, his goal was to break the North's will to fight. He also hoped that a victory would convince other nations to recognize the Confederacy.
First Day
In early June 1863, Lee cut across northern Maryland into southern Pennsylvania. His forces gathered west of a small town called Gettysburg. Lee was unaware that Union soldiers were encamped closer to town. He had been suffering from lack of enemy information for three days because his cavalry chief "Jeb" Stuart was not performing his duties. Stuart and his cavalry had gone off on their own raiding party, disobeying Lee's orders.
Another Confederate raiding party went to Gettysburg for boots and other supplies. There, Lee's troops ran right into Union general George G. Meade's cavalry, triggering the Battle of Gettysburg, a key battle that finally turned the tide against the Confederates. The battle began on July 1, 1863, when the
Three Days at Gettysburg
Gettysburg was the largest and bloodiest battle of the Civil War.
In three days, more than 51,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, captured, or went missing. It was an important victory for the Union, and it stopped Lee's plan of invading the North.

Confederate raiding party and the Union forces began exchanging fire. The larger Confederate forces began to push the Union troops back through Gettysburg.
The Union soldiers regrouped along the high ground of Cemetery Ridge and Culp's Hill. General Lee wanted to prevent the Union forces from entrenching themselves. He therefore ordered General Ewell to attack immediately. However, Ewell hesitated and thereby gave the Federals time to establish an excellent defensive position.
In fact, Confederate General James Longstreet thought that the Union position was almost impossible to overrun. Instead of attacking, he felt that the Confederate army should move east, take a strong defensive position themselves, and wait for the Union forces to attack them. However, General Lee was not convinced. He believed that his troops were invincible.
The Confederates camped at Seminary Ridge, which ran parallel to the Union forces. Both camps called for their main forces to reinforce them and prepare for combat the next day.
Second Day
On July 2, Lee ordered an attack on the left side of the Union line. Lee knew that he could win the battle if his troops captured Little Round Top from the Union forces. From this hill, Lee's troops could easily fire down on the line of Union forces. Union forces and Confederate troops fought viciously for control of Little Round Top. The fighting was particularly fierce on the south side of the hill. There the 20th Maine led by Colonel Joshua Chamberlain battled the 15th Alabama led by Colonel William Oates. Later, when describing the conflict, Oates said, "The blood stood in puddles in some places in the rocks." Eventually, the Union forced the Confederates to pull back from Little Round Top.
Then the Confederates attacked Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill. The fighting lasted until nightfall. The assault on Cemetery Hill was unsuccessful. The Confederates did manage to take a few trenches on Culp's Hill. Even so, the Union forces still held a strong defensive position by the day's end.

Pickett's Charge
On the third day of battle, Longstreet again tried to convince Lee not to attack. But Lee thought that the Union forces were severely battered and ready to break. Because of this, he planned to attack the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Such a tactic, he felt, would not be expected. Indeed, General Meade left only about 5,750 troops to defend the center.
For over an hour, the Confederates shelled Cemetery Ridge with cannon fire. For a while, the Union cannons fired back. Then they slacked off. The Confederates assumed that they had seriously damaged the Union artillery. In reality, the Confederate barrage did little damage.
The task of charging the Union center fell to three divisions of Confederate soldiers. General George Pickett commanded the largest unit. In late afternoon, nearly 15,000 men took part in Pickett's Charge. For one mile, the Confederates marched slowly up toward Cemetery Ridge. Showered with cannon and rifle fire, they suffered severe losses. But eventually, some of them almost reached their destination. Then Union reinforcements added to the barrage on the rebels. Soon the

Confederates retreated, leaving about 7,500 casualties on the field of battle. Distressed by this defeat, General Lee rode among the survivors and told them, "It is all my fault."
On the fourth day, Lee began to retreat to Virginia. In all, nearly 75,000 Confederate soldiers and 90,000 Union troops had fought during the Battle of Gettysburg.
General Meade decided not to follow Lee's army. This decision angered Lincoln. He felt that Meade had missed an opportunity to crush the Confederates and possibly end the war.
Aftermath of Gettysburg
Gettysburg was a turning point in the war. Lee's troops would never again launch an attack in the North. The Union victory at Gettysburg took place on the day before Grant's capture of Vicksburg, Mississippi. These victories made northerners believe that the war could be won.
In addition, the Union win at Gettysburg helped to end the South's search for foreign influence in the war. After Gettysburg, Great Britain and France refused to provide aid to the Confederacy. The South's attempt at cotton diplomacy failed.
The Gettysburg Address
On November 19, 1863, at the dedicating ceremony of the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery, President Lincoln gave a speech called the Gettysburg Address, in which he praised the bravery of Union soldiers and renewed his commitment to winning the Civil War. This short but moving speech is one of the most famous in American history. In one of its frequently quoted lines, Lincoln referenced the Declaration of Independence and its ideals of liberty, equality, and democracy. He reminded listeners that the war was being fought for those reasons.
Lincoln rededicated himself to winning the war and preserving the Union. A difficult road still lay ahead.

Union Campaigns Cripple the Confederacy
Lincoln had been impressed with General Grant's successes in capturing Vicksburg. He transferred Grant to the East and gave him command of the Union army. In early 1864, Grant forced Lee to fight a series of battles in Virginia that stretched Confederate soldiers and supplies to their limits.
Wilderness Campaign in the East
From May through June, the armies fought in northern and central Virginia. Union troops launched the Wilderness Campaign—a series of battles designed to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. The first battle took place in early May, in woods about 50 miles outside of Richmond. Grant then ordered General Meade to Spotsylvania, where the fighting raged for five days.
Over the next month, Union soldiers moved the Confederate troops back toward Richmond. However, Grant experienced his worst defeat at the Battle of Cold Harbor in early June, just 10 miles northeast of Richmond. In only a few hours the Union army suffered 7,000 casualties. The battle delayed Grant's plans to take the Confederate capital.
Union forces had suffered twice as many casualties as the Confederates had, yet Grant continued his strategy. He knew he would be getting additional soldiers, and Lee could not. Grant slowly but surely advanced his troops through Virginia. He told another officer, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer."
After Cold Harbor, General Grant moved south of Richmond. He had hoped to take control of the key railroad junction at Petersburg, Virginia. Lee's army, however, formed a solid defense, and Grant could not execute his attack. Grant was winning the war, but he still had not captured Richmond. Facing re-election, Lincoln was especially discouraged by this failure.

Sherman Strikes the South
Lincoln needed a victory for the Union army to help him win re-election in 1864. The bold campaign of General William Tecumseh Sherman provided this key victory. Sherman carried out the Union plan to destroy southern railroads and industries.
In the spring of 1864, Sherman marched south from Tennessee with 100,000 troops. His goal was to take Atlanta, Georgia, and knock out an important railroad link. From May through August, Sherman's army moved steadily through the Appalachian Mountains toward Atlanta. Several times, Sherman avoided defenses set up by Confederate general Joseph Johnston.
In July, Sherman was within sight of
Atlanta. Confederate president Jefferson
Davis gave General John Hood command of
Confederate forces in the region. Hood repeat-
edly attacked Sherman in a final attempt to
save Atlanta, but the Union troops proved stronger. The Confederate troops retreated as Sherman held Atlanta under siege.
Atlanta fell to Sherman's troops on September 2, 1864. Much of the city was destroyed by artillery and fire. Sherman ordered the residents who still remained to leave. Responding to his critics, Sherman later wrote, "War is war, and not popularityseeking." The loss of Atlanta cost the South an important railroad link and its center of industry.
Many people in the North had been upset with the length of the war. However, the capture of Atlanta showed that progress was being made in defeating the South. This success helped to convince Union voters to re-elect Lincoln in a landslide.
Sherman did not wait long to begin his next campaign. His goal was the port city of Savannah, Georgia. In mid-November 1864,

Sherman left Atlanta with a force of about 60,000 men. He said he would "make Georgia howl!"
During his March to the Sea, Sherman practiced total war — destroying civilian and economic resources. Sherman believed that total war would ruin the South's economy and its ability to fight. He ordered his troops to destroy railways, bridges, crops, livestock, and other resources. They burned plantations and freed slaves. The destruction of the South's crops and fields would be felt economically for years after the war.
Sherman's army reached Savannah on December 10,1864. They left behind a path of destruction 60 miles wide. Sherman believed that this march would speed the end of the war. He wanted to break the South's will to fight by marching Union troops through the heart of the Confederacy. In the end, Sherman's destruction of the South led to anger and resentment toward the people of the North that would last for generations.

The South Surrenders
In early January 1865, the Union navy took control of the port at Wilmington, North Carolina, the last major port available to the Confederates. During the height of the battle, six Navy crewmen entered the fort as it was being shelled in order to deliver messages to the commander. The men, including Chilean immigrant Philip Bazaar, were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for their valor in this duty. Then in early April, Sherman closed in on the last Confederate defenders in North Carolina. At the same time, Grant finally broke through the Confederate defenses at Petersburg. On April 2, Lee was forced to retreat from Richmond.
Fighting Ends
By the second week of April 1865, Grant had surrounded Lee's army and demanded the soldiers' surrender. Lee hoped to join other Confederates in fighting in North Carolina, but Grant cut off his escape just west of Richmond. Lee tried some last minute attacks but could not break the Union line. Lee's forces were running low on supplies. General James Longstreet told about the condition of Confederate troops. "Many weary soldiers were picked up ... some with, many without, arms [weapons],—all asking for food."
Trapped by the Union army, Lee recognized that the situation was hopeless. "There is nothing left for me to do but go and see General Grant," Lee said, "and I would rather die a thousand deaths."
On April 9, 1865, Union and Confederate leaders met in the small town of Appomattox Courthouse where Lee surrendered to Grant, thus ending the Civil War.
During the meeting, Grant assured Lee that his troops would be fed and allowed to keep their horses, and they would not be tried for treason. Then Lee signed the surrender documents. The long, bloody war had finally ended. Grant later wrote that he found the scene at Appomattox Courthouse more tragic than joyful.

Grant, Battle Cry of Freedom As General Lee returned to his troops, General Grant stopped Union forces from cheering their victory. "The war is over," Grant said with relief. "The rebels are our countrymen again."
The Effects of the War
The Civil War lasted four years, from 1861 to 1865, and had deep and long-lasting effects. Almost 620,000 Americans lost their lives during the four years of fighting.
The defeat of the South ended slavery there. The majority of former slaves, however, had no homes or jobs. The southern economy was in ruins.
A tremendous amount of hostility remained, even after the fighting had ceased. The war was over, but the question remained: How could the United States be united once more?

Interpreting Political Cartoons
[ Define the Skill J
Political cartoons are drawings that express views on important issues. They have been used throughout history to influence public opinion. The ability to interpret political cartoons will help you understand issues and people's attitudes about them.
Learn the Skill
Political cartoons use both words and images to convey their message. They often contain caricatures or symbolism. A caricature is a drawing that exaggerates the features of a person or object. Symbolism is the use of one thing to represent something else. Cartoonists use these techniques to help make their point clear. They also use titles, labels, and captions to get their message across.
Use these steps to interpret political cartoons.
1.	Read any title, labels, and caption to identify the cartoon's general topic.
2.	Identify the people and objects. Determine if they are exaggerated and, if so, why. Identify any symbols and analyze their meaning.
3.	Draw conclusions about the message the cartoonist is trying to convey.
The following cartoon was published in the
North in 1863. The cartoonist has used symbols to make his point. Lady Liberty, representing the Union, is being threatened by the Copperheads. The cartoonist has expressed his opinion of these people by drawing them as the poisonous snake for which they were named. This cartoon clearly supports the Union's continuing to fight the war.

'A

Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, was a sleepy agricultural town of about 2,400 residents when the Civil War arrived on its doorstep in the early summer of 1863. Many of the town's men were elsewhere, either fighting in the war or guarding their livestock in the countryside. This left mostly women and children to endure the battle. For three terrifying days they hid in basements or in
tightly shuttered houses. Even after the battle finally ended the horrors continued, as the Gettysburg civilians emerged to find a scene of unimaginable death and destruction.

You will read about the political conflicts that emerged as southern leadership worked to gain control of Reconstruction efforts. Throughout the chapter, you will read how the culture of the South changed after the War.


Predicting
FOCUS on Reading When you read a story, you can often predict what might come next in the story's logical progression by understanding what has already happened.
Understanding Predicting Likewise, when you study history, you can use your knowledge of the past to predict a likely outcome of an event. If you see a pattern to historical events, the same pattern could apply to future events. You have learned about
the ways that Americans have moved into new lands and the economic and political changes that have occurred in U.S history. Recognizing a pattern to these changes can give you a better understanding of the past and help you make a prediction about how people responded or might respond to similar occurrences.
Notice how one reader uses prior knowledge to predict what may happen.
By 1870, only small portions of the Great Plains remained unsettled. For s most of the next two decades, this land remained open range. In March , 1889, government officials announced that homesteaders could file claims J on land in what is now the state of Oklahoma. This land had belonged | to Creek and Seminole Indians. Within a month, about 50,000 people ’ rushed to Oklahoma to stake their claims.
In all, settlers claimed more than 2 million acres of former Indian land in the famous Oklahoma land rush and another 9 million over the next several years. This huge wave of pioneers was the last chapter of the ■ westward movement. By the early 1890s, the frontier had largely ceased to exist in the United States.
After reading this section, one reader thought:
I have read about the ways in which previous waves of settlers changed the areas into which they moved. Colonists founded towns and cities, and population increased. New economic opportunities were created. What happened in those regions that might happen in the rest of the United States once the West was settled?
550 CHAPTER 17
You Try It!
The following passage is from the chapter you are getting ready to read. As you read the passage, look for the facts that can help you predict what might happen in the future.
Redeemers set up the poll tax in an effort to deny the vote to African Americans. The poll tax was a special tax people had to pay before they could vote. Some states also targeted African American voters by requiring them to pass a literacy test. A so-called grandfather clause written into law affected men whose fathers or grandfathers could vote before 1867. In those cases, a voter did not have to pay a poll tax or pass a literacy test. As a result, almost every white man could escape the voting restrictions.

Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the different ways the U.S. government attempted to reconstruct the South after the Civil War.
BUILDING BACKGROUND
When the Civil War ended, much of the South lay in ruins. Like the young soldier above, many people returned to destroyed homes and farms. Harvests of corn, cotton, rice, and other crops fell far below normal. Many farm animals had been killed or were roaming free. These were some of the challenges in restoring the nation. Reconstruction Begins
After the Civil War ended in 1865, the U.S. government faced the problem of dealing with the defeated southern states. The challenges of Reconstruction, the process of readmitting the former Confederate states to the Union, lasted from 1865 to 1877.
552 CHAPTER 17
Damaged South
Tired southern soldiers returned home to find that the world they had known before the war was gone. Cities, towns, and farms had been ruined. Because of high food prices and widespread crop failures, many southerners faced starvation. The Confederate money held by most southerners was now worthless. Banks failed, and merchants had gone bankrupt because people could not pay their debts.
Former Confederate general Braxton Bragg was one of many southerners who faced economic hardship. He found that "all, all was lost, except my debts." In South Carolina, Mary Boykin Chesnut wrote in her diary about the isolation she experienced after the war. "We are shut in here ... All RR's [railroads] destroyed—bridges gone. We are cut off from the world."
Lincoln's Plan
President Abraham Lincoln wanted to reunite the nation as quickly and painlessly as possible. He had proposed a plan for readmitting the southern states even before the war ended. Called the Ten Percent Plan, it offered southerners amnesty, or official pardon, for all illegal acts supporting the rebellion. To receive amnesty, southerners had to do two things. They had to swear an oath of loyalty to the United States. They also had to agree that slavery was illegal. Once 10 percent of voters in
a state made these pledges, they could form a new government. The state then could be readmitted to the Union.
Louisiana quickly elected a new state legislature under the Ten Percent Plan. Other southern states that had been occupied by Union troops soon followed Louisiana back into the United States.
Wade-Davis Bill
Some politicians argued that Congress, not the president, should control the southern states' return to the Union. They believed that Congress had the power to admit new states. Also, many Republican members of Congress thought the Ten Percent Plan did not go far enough. A senator from Michigan expressed their views.
^The people of the North are not such fools as to... turn around and say to the traitors, 'all you have to do [to return] is... take an oath that henceforth you will be true to the Government.'"
-Senator Jacob Howard, quoted in Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877, by Eric Foner
Two Republicans—Senator Benjamin
Wade and Representative Henry Davis—had an alternative to Lincoln's plan. Following procedures of the Wade-Davis bill, a state had to meet two conditions before it could rejoin the Union. First, it had to ban slavery. Second, a majority of adult males in the state had to take the loyalty oath.
War destroyed Richmond, Virginia, once the capital of the Confederacy.
Academic
Vocabulary
procedure
a series of steps taken to accomplish a task
Under the Wade-Davis bill, only southerners who swore that they had never supported the Confederacy could vote or hold office. In general, the bill was much stricter than the Ten Percent Plan. Its provisions would make it harder for southern states to rejoin the Union quickly.
President Lincoln therefore refused to sign the bill into law. He thought that few southern states would agree to meet its requirements. He believed that his plan would help restore order more quickly.
Reading check
Contrasting How was the Ten Percent Plan different from the Wade-Davis bill?
Freedom for African
Americans
One thing Republicans agreed on was abolishing slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation had freed slaves only in areas that had not been occupied by Union forces, not in the border states. Many people feared that the federal courts might someday declare the proclamation unconstitutional.
Slavery Ends
On January 31, 1865, at President Lincoln's urging, Congress proposed the Thirteenth Amendment. This amendment made slavery illegal throughout the United States.
554 CHAPTER 17
The amendment was ratified and took effect on December 18, 1865. When abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison heard the news, he declared that his work was now finished. He called for the American Anti-Slavery Society to break up. Not all abolitionists agreed that their work was done, however. Frederick Douglass insisted that "slavery is not abolished until the black man has the ballot [vote]."
Freedom brought important changes to newly freed slaves. Many couples held ceremonies to legalize marriages that had not been recognized under slavery. Many freedpeople searched for relatives who had been sold away from their families years
earlier. Others placed newspaper ads seeking information about their children. Many women began to work at home instead of in the fields. Still others adopted children of dead relatives to keep families together. Church members established voluntary associations and mutual-aid societies to help those in need.
Now that they could travel without a pass, many freedpeople moved from mostly white counties to places with more African Americans. Other freedpeople traveled simply to test their new freedom of movement. A South Carolina woman explained this need. "I must go, if I stay here I'll never know I'm free."
For most former slaves, freedom to travel was just the first step on a long road toward equal rights and new ways of life. Adults took new last names and began to insist on being called Mr. or Mrs. as a sign of respect, rather than by their first names or by nicknames. Freedpeople began to demand the same economic and political rights as white citizens. Henry Adams, a former slave, argued that "if I cannot do like a white man I am not free."
Forty Acres to Farm?
Many former slaves wanted their own land to farm. Near the end of the Civil War, Union general William Tecumseh Sherman had issued an order to break up plantations in coastal South Carolina and Georgia. He wanted to divide the land into 40-acre plots and give them to former slaves as compensation for their forced labor before the war.
Many white planters refused to surrender their land. Some freedpeople pointed out that it was only fair that they receive some of this land because their labor had made the plantations prosper. In the end, the U.S. government returned the land to its original owners. At this time, many freedpeople were unsure about where they would live, what kind of work they would do, and what rights they had. Freedoms that were theirs by law were difficult to enforce.

RECONSTRUCTION 55
Freedmen's Bureau
In 1865 Congress established the Freedmen's Bureau, an agency providing relief for freed-people and certain poor people in the South. The Bureau had a difficult job. At its high point, about 900 agents served the entire South. Bureau commissioner Oliver O. Howard eventually decided to use the Bureau's limited budget to distribute food to the poor and to provide education and legal help for freed-people. The Bureau also helped African American war veterans.
The Freedmen's Bureau played an important role in establishing more schools in the South. Laws against educating slaves meant that most freedpeople had never learned to read or write. Before the war ended, however, northern groups, such as the American Missionary Association, began providing books and teachers to African Americans. The teachers were mostly women who were committed to helping freedpeople. One teacher said of her students, "I never before saw children so eager to learn ... It is wonderful how [they]... can have so great a desire for
knowledge, and such a capacity for attaining [reaching] it."
After the war, some freedpeople organized their own education efforts. For example, Freedmen's Bureau agents found that some African Americans had opened schools in abandoned buildings. Many white southerners continued to believe that African Americans should not be educated. Despite opposition, by 1869 more than 150,000 African American students were attending more than 3,000 schools. The Freedmen's Bureau also helped establish a number of universities for African Americans, including Howard and Fisk universities.
Students quickly filled the new classrooms. Working adults attended classes in the evening. African Americans hoped that education would help them to understand and protect their rights and to enable them to find better jobs. Both black and white southerners benefited from the effort to provide greater access to education in the South.

President Johnson's
Reconstruction Plan
While the Freedmen's Bureau was helping African Americans, the issue of how the South would rejoin the Union was unresolved. Soon, however, Lincoln's dream of peacefully reuniting the country ended tragically.
A
New President On the evening of April 14, 1865, President Lincoln and his wife attended a play at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C. During the play, John Wilkes Booth, a southerner who opposed Lincoln's policies, sneaked into the president's theater box and shot him. Lincoln was rushed to a boardinghouse across the street, where he died early the next morning. Lincoln, his leadership remembered for its honesty, deep intelligence, and high morals, became a symbol for the nation of the struggle of the Civil War.
Vice President Andrew Johnson was sworn into office quickly. Reconstruction had now become his responsibility. He would have to win the trust of a nation shocked at its leader's death. Johnson's plan was similar to Lincoln's. However, he decided that wealthy southerners and former Confederate officials would need a presidential pardon to receive amnesty. Johnson shocked Radical Republicans by eventually pardoning more than 7,000 people by 1866.
New State Governments
Johnson was a Democrat whom Republicans had put on the ticket to appeal to the border states. A former slaveholder, he was a stubborn man who would face a hostile Congress.
Johnson offered a mild program for setting up new southern state governments. First, he appointed a temporary governor for each state. Then he required that the states revise their constitutions. Next, voters elected state and federal representatives. The new state government had to declare that secession was illegal. It also had to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment and refuse to pay Confederate debts.
By the end of 1865, all the southern states except Texas had created new governments. Johnson approved them all and declared that the United States was restored. Newly elected representatives came to Washington from each reconstructed southern state. However, Republicans complained that many new representatives had been leaders of the Confederacy. Congress therefore refused to readmit the southern states into the Union. Clearly, the nation was still divided.

I TAKING NOTES
j. Use the graphic organizer online to take notes on how Republicans in Congress took over Reconstruction and how they changed Reconstruction policies.
Opposition to President Johnson
In 1866 Congress continued to debate the rules for restoring the Union. Meanwhile, new state legislatures approved by President Johnson had already begun passing laws to deny African Americans' civil rights. "This is a white man's government, and intended for white men only," declared Governor Benjamin F. Perry of South Carolina.
Black Codes
Soon, every southern state passed Black Codes, or laws that greatly limited the freedom of African Americans. They required African Americans to sign work contracts, creating working conditions similar to those under slavery. In most southern states, any African Americans who could not prove they were employed could be arrested. Their punishment might be one year of work without pay. African Americans were also prevented from owning guns. In addition, they were not allowed to rent property except in cities.
The Black Codes alarmed many Americans. As one Civil War veteran asked, "If you call this freedom, what do you call slavery?"
558 CHAPTER 17
African Americans organized to oppose the codes. One group sent a petition to officials in South Carolina.
We simply ask... that the same laws which govern white men shall govern black men... that, in short, we be dealt with as others are—in equity [equality] and justice/^
—Petition from an African American convention held in South Carolina, quoted in There Is a River: The Black
Struggle for Freedom in America by Vincent Harding
Radical Republicans
The Black Codes angered many Republicans. They thought the South was returning to its old ways. Most Republicans were moderates who wanted the South to have loyal state
governments. They also believed that African Americans should have rights as citizens. They hoped that the government would not have to force the South to follow federal laws.
Radical Republicans, on the other hand, took a harsher stance. They wanted the federal government to force change in the South. Like the moderates, they thought the Black Codes were cruel and unjust. The Radicals, however, wanted the federal government to be much more involved in Reconstruction. They feared that too many southern leaders remained loyal to the former Confederacy and would not enforce the new laws. Thaddeus Stevens

A harsh critic of President Johnson, Stevens was known for his honesty and sharp tongue. He wanted economic and political justice for both African Americans and poor white southerners. Sumner had been a strong opponent of slavery ’'efore the Civil War. He continued to argue tirelessly for African Americans' civil rights, including the right to vote and the right to fair laws.
Both Stevens and Sumner believed that President Johnson's Reconstruction plan was a failure. Although the Radicals did not control Congress, they began to gain support among moderates when President Johnson ignored criticism of the Black Codes. Stevens believed the federal government could not allow racial inequality to survive.

Comparing and Contrasting
How were Radical Republicans and moderate Republicans similar and different?
Fourteenth Amendment
Urged on by the Radicals in 1866, Congress proposed a new bill. It would give the Freed-men's Bureau more powers. The law would allow the Freedmen's Bureau to use military courts to try people accused of violating African Americans' rights. The bill's supporters hoped that these courts would be fairer than local courts in the South.
Johnson versus Congress
Surprising many members of Congress, Johnson vetoed the Freedmen's Bureau Bill. He insisted that Congress could not pass any new laws until the southern states were represented in Congress. Johnson also argued that the Freedmen's Bureau was unconstitutional.
Republicans responded with the Civil Rights Act of 1866. This act provided African Americans with the same legal rights as white Americans. President Johnson once again used his veto power. He argued that the act gave too much power to the federal government. He also rejected the principle of equal
560 CHAPTER 17
rights for African Americans. Congress, however, overrode Johnson's veto.
Many Republicans worried about what would happen when the southern states were readmitted. Fearing that the Civil Rights Act might be overturned, the Republicans proposed the Fourteenth Amendment in the summer of 1866. The Fourteenth Amendment included the following provisions.
1.	It defined all people born or naturalized within the United States, except Native Americans, as citizens.
2.	It guaranteed citizens the equal protection of the laws.
3.	It said that states could not “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."
4.	It banned many former Confederate officials from holding state or federal offices.
5.	It made state laws subject to federal court review.
6.	It gave Congress the power to pass any laws needed to enforce it.
1866 Elections
President Johnson and most Democrats opposed the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result, civil rights for African Americans became a key issue in the 1866 congressional elections. To help the Democrats, Johnson traveled around the country defending his Reconstruction plan. Johnson's speaking tour was a disaster. It did little to win votes for the Democratic Party. Johnson even got into arguments with people in the audiences of some of his speaking engagements.
Two major riots in the South also hurt Johnson's campaign. On May 1, 1866, a dispute in Memphis, Tennessee, took place between local police and black Union soldiers. The dispute turned into a three-day wave of violence against African Americans. About three months later, another riot took place during a political demonstration in New Orleans. During that dispute, 34 African Americans and three white Republicans were killed.
REAPING CHECK J
Summarizing What issue did the Fourteenth Amendment address, and how did it affect the congressional elections of 1866?
Congress Takes Control of Reconstruction
The 1866 elections gave the Republican Party a commanding two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate. This majority gave the Republicans the power to override any presidential veto. In addition, the Republicans became united as the moderates joined with the Radicals. Together, they called for a new form of Reconstruction.
Reconstruction Acts
In March 1867, Congress passed the first of several Reconstruction Acts. These laws divided the South into five districts. A U.S. military commander controlled each district.
The military would remain in control of the South until the southern states rejoined the Union. To be readmitted, a state had to write a new state constitution supporting the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, the state had to give African American men the right to vote.
Thaddeus Stevens was one of the new Reconstruction Acts' most enthusiastic supporters. He spoke in Congress to defend the acts.

-Thaddeus Stevens, quoted in Sources of the American Republic, edited by Marvin Meyers et al.
President on Trial
President Johnson strongly disagreed with Stevens. He argued that African Americans did not deserve the same treatment as white people. The Reconstruction Acts, he said, used "powers not granted to the federal government or any one of its branches." Knowing that Johnson did not support its Reconstruction policies, Congress passed a law limiting his power. This law prevented the president from removing cabinet officials without Senate approval. Johnson quickly broke the law by firing Edwin Stanton, the secretary of war.
For the first time in United States history, the House of Representatives responded by voting to impeach the president. Impeachment is the process used by a legislative body to bring charges of wrongdoing against a public official. The next step, under Article I of the Constitution, was a trial in the Senate. A two-thirds majority was required to find Johnson guilty and remove him from office.
Although Johnson was unpopular with Republicans, some of them believed he was being judged unfairly. Others did not trust the president pro tempore of the Senate, Benjamin Wade. He would become president if Johnson were removed from office. By a single vote, Senate Republicans failed to convict Johnson. Even so, the trial weakened his power as president.

former New York governor Horatio Seymour as their presidential candidate. The Republicans chose Ulysses S. Grant. As a war hero, Grant appealed to many northern voters. He had no political experience but supported the congressional Reconstruction plan. He ran under the slogan "Let Us Have Peace."
Shortly after Grant was nominated, Congress readmitted seven southern states— Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South Carolina. (Tennessee had already been readmitted in 1866.) Under the terms of readmission, these seven states approved the Fourteenth Amendment. They also agreed to let African American men vote. However, white southerners used violence to try to keep African Americans away from the polls.
Despite such tactics, hundreds of thousands of African Americans voted for Grant and the "party of Lincoln." The New Orleans Tribune reported that many former slaves "see clearly enough that the Republican party [is] their political life boat." African American votes helped Grant to win a narrow victory.

Fifteenth Amendment
After Grant's victory, Congressional Republicans wanted to protect their Reconstruction plan. They worried that the southern states might try to keep black voters from the polls in future elections. Also, some Radical Republicans argued that it was not fair that many northern states still had laws preventing African Americans from voting. After all, every southern state was required to grant suffrage to African American men.
In 1869 Congress proposed the Fifteenth Amendment, which gave African American men the right to vote. Abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison praised what he saw as "this wonderful, quiet, sudden transformation of four millions of human beings from ... the auction block to the ballot-box." The amendment went
into effect in 1870 as one of the last Reconstruction laws passed at the federal level.
The Fifteenth Amendment did not please every reformer, however. Many women were angry because the amendment did not also grant them the right to vote.

New state governments began reforms, but i ' later leaders ended many of them. Some parts of the southern economy ' improved. However, many farmers, like the family above, wentthrough i hard times.
Reconstruction Governments
After Grant became president in 1869, the Republicans seemed stronger than ever. They controlled most southern governments, partly because of the support of African American voters. However, Republican officeholders were unpopular with white southerners.
Carpetbaggers and Scalawags
Some of these office-holders were northern-born Republicans who had moved South after the war. Many white southerners called them carpetbaggers. Supposedly, they had rushed South carrying all their possessions in bags made from carpeting. Many southerners resented these northerners, accusing them—often unfairly— of trying to profit from Reconstruction. Because the South needed both physical and economic rebuilding, there were many business opportunities. Northerners who had not been devastated by the war had more money to invest and could therefore profit from these opportunities.
564 CHAPTER 17
1.	Location Which state had the most African American state legislators?
2.	Region Which states had the least African American representation?
Southern Democrats cared even less for white southern Republicans. They referred to them as scalawags, or greedy rascals. Democrats believed that these southerners had betrayed the South by voting for the Republican Party. Many southern Republicans were small farmers who had supported the Union during the war. Others, like Mississippi governor James Alcorn, were former members of the Whig Party. They preferred to become Republicans rather than join the Democrats.
African American Leaders
African Americans were the largest group of southern Republican voters. During Reconstruction, more than 600 African Americans won election to state legislatures. Some 16 of these politicians were elected to Congress. Other African Americans held local offices in counties throughout the South.
African American politicians came from many backgrounds. Hiram Revels was born free in North Carolina and went to college in Illinois. He became a Methodist minister and served as a chaplain in the Union army. In
1870, after many debates at the national and state levels about his eligibility and citizenship, Revels became the first African American in the U.S. Senate. He took over the seat previously held by Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Revels held a moderate view of the readmission of former Confederates. Education and employment for African Americans were two of his top priorities. Revels helped display the ability of African Americans to take part in governing.
Unlike Revels, Blanche K. Bruce grew up in slavery in Virginia. Bruce became an important Republican in Mississippi and served one term as a U.S. senator. He worked to integrate the military while in office. After completing his term, he became the first president of Alcorn University.
Reconstructed State Governments

many places, however, there was still resistance by whites. Because former Confederates could usually not vote, they struggled to maintain political influence.
Reconstruction governments provided money for many new programs and organizations in the South. Lawmakers hoped that these organizations would help southerners adjust to the new economic and social structure. They helped to establish some of the first state-funded public school systems in the South. They also built new hospitals, prisons, and orphanages and passed laws prohibiting discrimination against African Americans. Many of these programs improved the lives of African Americans and whites in the South, and gave people economic opportunities and access to political offices. However, racism and the dramatically different culture of groups led to conflicting expectations, and sometimes tensions led to violence.
Southern states under Republican control spent large amounts of money. They aided the construction of railroads, bridges, and public buildings. These improvements were intended to help the southern
economy recover from the war. To get the money for these projects, the Reconstruction governments raised taxes and issued bonds. Although some people protested the increased taxes, the improved infrastructure helped the South to increase its trade and production capabilities.
READING CHECK
Summarizing What reforms did Reconstruction state governments carry out?
Ku Klux Kian
As more African Americans took office, resistance to Reconstruction increased among white southerners. Democrats claimed that the Reconstruction governments were corrupt, illegal, and unjust. They also disliked having federal soldiers stationed in their states. Many white southerners disapproved of African American officeholders. One Democrat noted, '"A white man's government' [is] the most popular rallying cry we have." In 1866 a group of white southerners in Tennessee created the Ku Klux Kian. This secret society opposed civil rights, particularly suffrage, for African Americans. The Kian used

violence and tenor against African Americans. The group's membership grew rapidly as it spread throughout the South. Kian members wore robes and disguises to hide their identities. They attacked—and even murdered— African Americans, white Republican voters, and public officials, usually at night.
Local governments did little to stop the violence. Many officials feared the Kian or were sympathetic to its activities. In 1870 and 1871 the federal government took action. Congress passed laws that made it a federal crime to interfere with elections or to deny citizens equal protection under the law.
Within a few years, the Kian was no longer an organized threat. But groups of whites continued to assault African Americans and Republicans throughout the 1870s.
Drawing Conclusions Why
did southerners join the Ku Klux Kian?
Reconstruction Ends
The violence of the Ku Klux Kian was not the only challenge to Reconstruction. Republicans slowly lost control of southern state governments to the Democratic Party. The General Amnesty Act of 1872 allowed former Confederates, except those who had held high ranks, to serve in public office. Many of these former Confederates, most of whom were Democrats, were soon elected to southern governments.
The Republican Party also began losing its power in the North. Although President Grant was re-elected in 1872, financial and political scandals in his administration upset voters. In his first term, a gold-buying scheme in which Grant's cousin took a leading role led to a brief crisis on the stock market called Black Friday. During his second term, his personal secretary was involved in the Whiskey Ring scandal, in which whiskey distillers and public officials worked together to steal liquor taxes from the federal government. Furthermore, people blamed Republican policies for the Panic of 1873.
Panic of 1873
This severe economic downturn began in September 1873 when Jay Cooke and Company, a major investor in railroads and the largest financier of the Union's Civil War effort, declared bankruptcy. The company had lied about the value of land along the side of the Northern Pacific Railroad that it owned and was trying to sell. When the truth leaked out, the company failed.
The failure of such an important business sent panic through the stock market, and investors began selling shares of stock more rapidly than people wanted to buy them. Companies had to buy their shares back from the investors. Soon, 89 of the nation's 364 railroads had failed as well. The failure of almost 18,000 other businesses followed within two years, leaving the nation in an economic crisis. By 1876 unemployment had risen to 14 percent, with an estimated 2 million people out of work. The high unemployment rate set off numerous strikes and protests around the nation, many involving railroad workers. In 1874 the Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives. Northerners were becoming less concerned about southern racism and more concerned about their financial well-being.
Election of 1876
Republicans could tell that northern support for Reconstruction was fading. Voters' attention was shifting to economic problems. In 1874 the Republican Party lost control of the House of Representatives to the Democrats. The Republicans in Congress managed to pass one last civil rights law. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 guaranteed African Americans equal rights in public places, such as theaters and public transportation. But as Americans became increasingly worried about economic problems and government corruption, the Republican Party began to abandon Reconstruction.

Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)
Background of the Case In 1892, Homer Plessy took a seat in the "whites only" car of a train in Louisiana. He was arrested, put on trial, and convicted of violating Louisiana's segregation law. Plessy argued that the Louisiana law violated the Thirteenth Amendment and denied him the equal protection of the law
The Court's Ruling
The Court ruled that the Louisiana "separate-but-equal" law was constitutional.
The Court's Reasoning
The Court stated that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments did not apply. The Court decided that the case had nothing to do with the abolition of slavery mentioned in the Thirteenth Amendment. The justices also ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment was not designed to eliminate social barriers to equality between the races, only political barriers.
Justice John Marshall Harlan disagreed with the Court's ruling. In a dissenting opinion, he wrote that "in respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law."
.........1,L......-— - -.
Why It Matters
Plessy was important because it	\
approved the idea of separate-but-equal \ facilities for people based on race. The doctrine of separate-but- equal led to segregation in trains, buses, schools, restaurants, and many other social	\
institutions.	i
The separate-but-equal doctrine led < to unequal treatment of minority groups \ for decades. It was finally struck down by ’ another Supreme Court ruling, Brown v. Board of Education, in 1954.
ANALYSIS
SKILL
Analyzing Information 1.	Why did the Court reject Plessy's arguments?
2.	Why was Plessyv. Ferguson an important Supreme Court case?
Republicans selected Ohio governor Rutherford B. Hayes as their 1876 presidential candidate. He believed in ending federal support of the Reconstruction governments. The Democrats nominated New York governor Samuel J. Tilden. During the election, Democrats in the South again used violence at the polls to keep Republican voters away.
The election between Hayes and Tilden was close. Tilden appeared to have won. Republicans challenged the electoral votes in Oregon and three southern states. A special commission of members of Congress and Supreme Court justices was appointed to settle the issue.
The commission narrowly decided to give all the disputed votes to Hayes. Hayes thus won the presidency by one electoral vote. In the Compromise of 1877, the Democrats agreed to accept Hayes's victory. In return, they wanted all remaining federal troops removed from the South. They also asked for funding for internal improvements and the appointment of a southern Democrat to the president's cabinet. Shortly after he took office in 1877, President Hayes removed the last of the federal troops from the South.
Redeemers
Gradually, Democrats regained control of state governments in the South. In each state, they moved quickly to get rid of the Reconstruction reforms.
Democrats who brought their party back to power in the South were called Redeemers. They came from a variety of backgrounds. For instance, U.S. senator John T. Morgan of Alabama was a former general in the Confederate army. Newspaper editor Henry Grady of Georgia was interested in promoting southern industry.
Redeemers wanted to reduce the size of state government and limit the rights of African Americans. They lowered state budgets and got rid of a variety of social programs. The Redeemers cut property taxes and cut public funding for schools. They also succeeded in limiting African Americans' civil rights.
African Americans' Rights Restricted
Redeemers set up the poll tax in an effort to deny the vote to African Americans. The poll tax was a special tax people had to pay before they could vote.
568 CHAPTER 17
Some states also targeted African American voters by requiring them to pass a literacy test. A so-called grandfather clause written into law affected men whose fathers or grandfathers could vote before 1867. In those cases, a voter did not have to pay a poll tax or pass a literacy test. As a result, almost every white man could escape the voting restrictions.
Redeemer governments also introduced legal segregation, the forced separation of whites and African Americans in public places. Jim Crow laws—laws that enforced segregation—became common in southern states in the 1880s.
African Americans challenged Jim Crow laws in court. In 1883, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was unconstitutional. The Court also ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to the actions of state governments. This ruling allowed private individuals and businesses to practice segregation. Plessy \r. Ferguson
In 1896 the U.S. Supreme Court returned to the issue of segregation. When Homer Plessy, an African American, refused to leave the whites-only Louisiana train car he was riding on, he was arrested and accused of breaking a state law requiring separate cars for blacks and whites. Plessy sued the railroad company and lost. His lawyers argued that the law violated his right to equal treatment under the Four-
teenth Amendment. He then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled against Plessy in Plessy v. Ferguson. Segregation was allowed, said the Court, if "separate-but-equal" facilities were provided. Among the justices, only John Marshall Harlan disagreed with the Court's decision. He explained his disagreement in a dissenting opinion:
" In the eye of the law, there is in the country no superior, dominant [controlling], ruling class of citizens ... Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law/'
—John Marshall Harlan, quoted in Plessyv. Ferguson:
A
Brief History with Documents, edited by Brook Thomas Despite Harlan's view, segregation became widespread across the country. African Americans were forced to use separate public schools, libraries, and parks. When they existed, these facilities were usually of poorer quality than those created for whites. In practice, these so-called separate-but-equal facilities were separate and unequal. Neither Congress nor the president would make significant actions to overturn the doctrine until the 1900s.
Farming in the South
Few African Americans in the South could afford to buy or even rent farms. Moving West also was costly. Many African Americans therefore remained on plantations. Others tried to make a living in the cities.

pressure from banks and others to keep raising cotton.
African Americans who stayed on plantations often became part of a system known as sharecropping, or sharing the crop. Land-owners provided the land, tools, and supplies, and sharecroppers provided the labor. At harvest time, the sharecropper usually had to give most of the crop to the land-owner. Whatever remained belonged to the sharecropper. Many sharecroppers hoped to save enough money from selling their share of the crops to one day be able to buy a farm. Unfortunately, only a few ever succeeded.
Instead, most sharecroppers lived in a cycle of debt. When they needed food, clothing, or supplies, most families had to buy goods on credit because they had little cash. When sharecroppers sold their crops, they hoped to be able to pay off these debts. However, bad weather, poor harvests, or low crop prices often made this dream impossible.
Sharecroppers usually grew cotton, one of the South's most important cash crops. When too many farmers planted cotton, however, the supply became excessive. As a result, the price per bale of cotton dropped. Many farmers understood the drawbacks of planting cotton. However, farmers felt

Rebuilding Industry
The southern economy suffered through cycles of good and bad years as cotton prices went up and down. Some business leaders hoped industry would strengthen the southern economy and create a New South.
Southern Industry
Henry Grady, an Atlanta newspaper editor, was a leader of the New South movement. "The new South presents... a diversified [varied] industry that meets the complex needs of this complex age," he wrote. Grady and his supporters felt that with its cheap and abundant labor, the South could build factories and provide a workforce for them.
The most successful industrial development in the South involved textile production. Businesspeople built textile mills in many small towns to produce cotton fabric. Many

people from rural areas came to work in the mills, but African Americans were not allowed to work in most of them.
Southern Mill Life
Work in the cotton mills appealed to farm families who had trouble making ends meet. As one mill worker explained, "It was a necessity to move and get a job, rather than depend on the farm." Recruiters sent out by the mills promised good wages and steady work.
Entire families often worked in the same cotton mill. Mills employed large numbers of women and children. Many children started working at about the age of 12. Some children started working at an even earlier age. Women did most of the spinning and were valued workers. However, few women had the opportunity to advance within the company.
Many mill workers were proud of the skills they used, but they did not enjoy their work. One unhappy worker described it as "the same thing over and over again... The more you do, the more they want done." Workers often labored 12 hours a day, six days a week. Cotton dust and lint filled the air, causing asthma and an illness known as brown-lung
disease. Fast-moving machinery caused injuries and even deaths. Despite the long hours and dangerous working conditions, wages remained low. However, mill work did offer an alternative to farming.

Reconstruction in the North
Although most federal Reconstruction policies were designed to reform the South, they affected groups in the North as well. There were many groups who worked to advance their own rights and interests during this time.
Women and Northern African Americans
The Radical Republicans passed many federal laws that required Southern states to allow African American men to vote. They based their cause on the ideal of equality found in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Women's suffragists began using these same arguments to support their own suffrage. Wyoming and Utah granted women the vote in 1869, but their motivations were not just to ensure equal rights for women. Wyoming leaders hoped to attract more women residents, while Utahans hoped to counteract the rising number of non-Mormon voters.
African Americans in the North faced less social discrimination than they did in the South but still faced racism and segregation. In response, some state governments passed laws that made segregation illegal. Some integrated their school systems. Still, most states upheld the principle of separate-but-equal facilities.

fortunes. Large companies grew by buying smaller companies, and railroads made huge profits transporting goods and people. Tax revenue increased as well, and governments were able to provide more services and make more investments.
Between 1865 and 1873, almost 3 million immigrants arrived in the United States. They provided a new pool of labor for the growing industrial economy. The number
of labor unions increased, and they began to push for policies that protected workers. Reformers pressed for eight-hour-workday and fair-pay laws. In addition, the increase in commercial and trading businesses led to a shift in the make up of the working class. It now included a majority of professionals and white-collar workers.
Eventually the focus of the Republican Party began to move away from civil rights for African Americans and toward reducing government corruption. The acceptance of the Compromise of 1877 signaled the end of the Republican focus on reforming racial politics in the South.

You are a female schoolteacher in Wisconsin in 1880. You live and teach in a small town, but you grew up on a farm and are used to hard work. Now you are thinking about moving West to claim free land from the government. You could teach in a school there too. You think it would be an exciting adventure, but your family is horrified that a single woman would move West on her own.
Would you decide to become a homesteader?
BUILDING BACKGROUND
Before the Civil War, most Americans thought of the Great Plains and other western lands as the Great American Desert. But in the years following the war, the U.S. population grew and settlement spread throughout the West 
New Lives on the Plains
The frontier changed dramatically as more and more people moved westward. Settlers built homes, fenced off land, and set up ranches and farms. Miners, ranchers, and farmers remade the landscape of the West as they adapted to their new surroundings. The geography of the West was further changed by the development and expansion of a large and successful railroad industry that moved the region's natural resources and goods to eastern markets.
In 1862 Congress passed two important land grant acts that helped open the West to settlers. The Homestead Act gave government-owned land to small farmers. Any adult who was a U.S. citizen or planned to become one could receive 160 acres of land. In exchange, homesteaders promised to build a house, live on the land for five years, and grow crops. After five years, the homesteader could file for his or her title to the land. Former Union soldiers could get land even more quickly. People could also buy the land after six months if they had the money to do so. The system of dividing the land into lots was the same system of townships, sections, and acres that was authorized by the Land Ordinance of 1785.
1.	The U.S. government encouraged the settlement of the Great Plains.
2.	Farms, ranches, and railroads were the basis of the economy that developed on the Plains.
3.	Economic challenges led to the creation of farmers' political groups.
4.	Native Americans and the U.S. government came into conflict over land in the West.
The Great Plains provided new opportunities for Americans but also caused conflict with Native Americans in the region.

SKILL
What might be some of the differences between Norway and Svendsen's new home in Iowa?
The Morrill Act granted more than 17 million acres of federal land to the states. The act required each state to sell this land and use the money to build colleges to teach agriculture and engineering. Eventually these 69 universities were the first in most western states, and still exist today. Iowa State, Purdue, and Texas A&M are all land grant colleges. In 1890 a second Morrill Act was passed that required states to also provide university facilities for African Americans. The Acts made living in western states much more attractive to people and created more educated voters and leaders.
The promise of land and a life free of discrimination drew a large number of African Americans to the West. In 1879 some 20,000

to 40,000 southern African Americans moved to Kansas. Known as Exodusters, these African Americans made an exodus, or mass departure, from the South. A number of black communities soon developed.
Western homesteads also were attractive to immigrants. Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, German, and Czech immigrants formed many small communities on the Great Plains. In addition, many single women moved west. The Homestead Act allowed unmarried women to own land, which was unusual for the time.
Analyzing Information How
did the government encourage westward expansion?
The Plains Economy
Most new residents planned to farm. But farmers from the eastern and midwestern states, as well as those from other countries, were not accustomed to the growing conditions in the Plains. Many struggled to survive. They faced unique challenges. Weather could be extreme and destroy crops. Also, the root-filled sod, or dirt, beneath the Plains grass was very tough. The hard work of breaking up the sod earned Plains farmers the nickname "sodbusters."
The cattle industry also grew rapidly. Following the Civil War, a growing economy and population created a greater demand for beef in the East. As the cattle business boomed, ranchers faced more competition for use of the open range. Farmers began to buy the rangeland on the Great Plains where cattle had once grazed freely.
The Railroad Empire
As more Americans moved west, the need to send goods and information between the East and West increased. Some wanted to build a transcontinental railroad—a railroad that would cross the continent and connect the East to the West. To encourage construe-
571C CHAPTER 17
tion, Congress passed the Pacific Railway Acts in 1862 and 1864. These acts gave railroad companies loans and large land grants that could be sold to pay for construction costs. Railroad companies sold this land to settlers, which encouraged people to move west.
Railroad companies also encouraged people to put their money into the railroad business, which they did—sometimes unwisely. Occasionally, companies would lie about, the value of the land they sold to hopeful settlers. By the 1880s, many small western railroads were deeply in debt. Despite such setbacks, Americans remained interested in railroad investments. By 1890, there were about 164,000 more miles of track in operation than in 1865. Railroads had become one of the biggest industries in the United States.
Railroad companies offered better shipping rates to large companies, causing small farmers and businesses to complain about unfair business practices. In February 1887, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act, providing national regulation over trade between states and creating the Interstate Commerce Commission to ensure fair railroad rates. However, the commission lacked power to enforce its regulations.
Farm Incomes Fall
By the 1880s mechanical farming became more common. Using machines, farmers
could work much more quickly on large fields with fewer workers. Farmers shipped their harvest east by train and from there overseas. The Great Plains became known as the breadbasket of the world.
The combination of more farms and greater productivity led to the overproduction of some crops. Overproduction resulted in lower prices. As profits decreased, many farmers found it difficult to pay bills. Farmers who could not make their mortgage payments lost their farms and homes. Many of these homeless farmers became tenant farmers who worked land owned by others. By 1880, one-fourth of all farms were rented by tenants, and the number continued to grow.

Indian groups such as the Apache and the Comanche lived in and around Texas and what is now Oklahoma. To the north were the Sioux. These groups spoke many different languages. However, they used a common sign language to communicate, and they shared a similar lifestyle.
Miners and settlers were increasing in numbers—and they wanted Indians' land. The U.S. government tried to avoid disputes by negotiating the treaties of Fort Laramie and Fort Atkinson, the first major treaties between the U.S. government and Plains Indians. These treaties recognized Indian claims to most of the Great Plains. They also allowed United States troops to build forts and roads and to travel across Indian homelands. The U.S. government promised to pay for any damages to Indian lands.
The treaties did not keep the peace for long. In 1858, the discovery of gold in what
is now Colorado brought thousands of miners to the West. They soon clashed with the Cheyenne and the Arapaho. In 1861, the U.S. government negotiated new treaties with Plains Indians. These treaties created reservations, areas of federal land set aside for Native Americans. The government expected Indians to stay on the reservations. This made hunting the buffalo that Plains Indians relied on almost impossible.
In the northern Plains, Southwest, and Far West, Native Americans resisted being moved to and confined on reservations. The U.S. government sent troops, including African American cavalry—called buffalo soldiers by the Indians—to force the Indians to leave. Battles between U.S. troops and Native Americans occurred throughout the Great Plains. Brutal attacks against each side occurred, sometimes including attacks on civilians, women, and children.
571e CHAPTER 17
Reforming Government Policies
By the 1870s, many Native Americans lived on reservations, where land was usually not useful for farming or buffalo hunting. Many Indians were starving. Government policies and corrupt officials kept supplies promised to the reservations from being delivered. In 1869, Ely S. Parker was appointed to head the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the first Native American to hold that post. During his two years in office, the number of incidents between U.S. Army troops and Native American groups fell.
Many social reformers believed that Native Americans should adopt the ways of white people in order to survive. Special schools were established that taught Native American children Anglo customs, sometimes against the wishes of the children's parents. In the late 1870s, a Paiute Indian named Sarah Winnemucca called for reform. She gave lectures on problems of the reservation system. In 1881, writer Helen Hunt Jackson published an influential book that pushed for reform of U.S. Indian policy.
The Dawes General Allotment Act of 1887 tried to lessen traditional influences on Indian society by making land ownership private rather than shared. The act also promised—but failed to deliver—U.S. citizenship to Native Americans. After breaking up reservation land and giving parcels to individuals, the government sold the remaining acreage. The Act took about two-thirds of Indian land.
End of the Frontier
By 1870, only small portions of the Great Plains remained unsettled. For most of the next two decades, this land remained open range. In March 1889, government officials announced that homesteaders could file claims on land in what is now Oklahoma. Within a month, about 50,000 people rushed to Oklahoma to stake their claims.
In all, settlers claimed more than 2 million acres of former Indian land in the famous Oklahoma land rush and another 9 million over the next several years. This huge wave of
pioneers was the last chapter of the westward movement. By the early 1890s, the U.S. frontier had largely ceased to exist.

<z> Narrowing the Task The key I
to a successful research report is picking a topic that is broad enough that you can find information, but narrow enough that you can cover it in detail. To narrow a subject, focus on one aspect of the larger subject. Then think about whether that one aspect can be broken down into smaller parts. Here's an example of howto narrow a topic:
Too Broad: Civil War Leaders Less Broad: Civil War Generals Narrower: Robert E. Lee's Role in the Civil War
1.	Prewrite
Choosing a Subject
Since you will spend a lot of time researching and writing about your topic, pick one that interests you. First, think of several topics related to the Civil War. Narrow your list to one topic by thinking about what interests you and where you can find information about the topic.
Developing a Research Question
A guiding question related to your topic will help focus your research. For example, here is a research question for the topic "Robert E. Lee's Role in the Civil War": How did Lee's decision to turn down the leadership of the Union army affect the Civil War? The answer to this question becomes the thesis, or the big idea of your report.

Taking Notes
As you read the source material, take thorough notes on facts, statistics, comparisons, and quotations. Take special care to spell names correctly and to record dates and facts accurately. If you use a direct quotation from a source, copy it word for word and enclose it in quotation marks. Along with each note, include the number of its source and its page number.
Organizing Your Ideas and Information
Informative research reports are usually organized in one of these ways:
■	Chronological order (the order in which events occurred)
■	Order of importance
■	Causes (actions or situations that make something else happen) and effects (what happened as a result of something else).
Use one of these orders to organize your notes in an outline. Here is a partial outline for a paper on Robert E. Lee.

Studying a Model
Here is a model of a research report. Study it to see how one student developed a paper. The first and the concluding paragraphs are shown in full. The paragraphs in the body of the paper are summarized.
INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH
Attention grabber
Statement of thesis
“I cannot raise my hand against my birthplace, my home, my children.” With these words, Robert E. Lee changed the course of the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln had turned to Lee as his first choice for commander of the Union army. However, Lee turned Lincoln down, choosing instead to side with his home state of Virginia and take command of the Confederate army. Lee’s decision to turn Lincoln down weakened the North and strengthened the Confederates, turning what might have been an easy victory for the North into a long, costly war.
BODY PARAGRAPHS
In the first part of the body, the student points out that Lee graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, served in the Mexican War, and was a member of the Union army. She goes on to explain that he would have been a strong leader for the North, and his absence made the North weaker. In the middle of the report, the writer discusses Lee's personality and character. She includes information about the strength of character he showed while in the military academy and while leading the Confederate army. She discusses and gives examples of his intelligence, his daring, his courage, and his honesty.
In the last part of the body of the report, the student provides examples of Lee leading the outnumbered Confederate army to a series of victories. The student provides details of the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville and explains how a lesser general than Lee may have lost both battles.
CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH
Summary of main points Restatement of big idea
Lee’s brilliant and resourceful leadership bedeviled a series of Union generals. He won battles that most generals would have lost. If Lee had used these skills to lead the larger and more powerful Union army, the Civil War might have ended in months instead of years.

THE NATION BREAKS APART 5
EPILOGUE
PaeGG®
America became a global power in the 1900s as U.S. troops fought in two world wars.
America Since 1877
The United States of America is a very different place today than it was in 1877. The nation is now bigger, more powerful, and more involved in world affairs. It has changed from a nation where most people lived in small towns to one in which most people live in cities, many with populations of more than 1 million people. The nation is also a more democratic place today—more Americans have access to the privileges and responsibilities of citizenship than at any other time in the country's history.
Despite these differences, America faces many of the same challenges that it faced in 1877. For example, Americans still debate questions about civil rights, religion, taxes, and the role of government in their lives. They also worry about the health of the environment, children, and the poor.
Americans do not always agree on these issues. But they do believe strongly in their right to debate and to disagree. The debates are usually led by elected leaders from the two major political parties. Almost all of the elected representatives in the nation belong to either the Republican or the Democratic Party. The Republican Party tends to support more conservative policies, such as low taxes and few regulations on businesses. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, usually supports more liberal policies such as environmental protection and government-supported social programs. The two sides must work together towards compromises that work best for the entire nation.
One of the most important and heavily debated issues today is health care reform. In an effort to extend health insurance coverage to all Americans, the Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Many Republicans initially voted against it, and the law has remained controversial. Different interest groups support each side of the debate. The American Medical Association, for example, supports the law, while the conservative group Americans for Prosperity opposes it. The freedom to disagree and debate—in peaceful and productive ways—is an indication of the fundamental health of the nation.
America as a Global Power
After the Civil War, the United States increasingly came into conflict with Native Americans in the West. After the massacre at Wounded Knee in 1890, American settlers began moving west in even greater numbers.

Martin Luther King, Jr., (center) helped lead the fight for civil rights in America.
The United States and Spain went to war in 1898. The two countries battled each other in the Caribbean and the Philippines. The war began a period of American expansionism during which U.S. influence spread throughout many nations.
In 1914 World War I began in Europe. By 1917 the United States had entered the war. The experience forever changed the United States. America had stepped onto the world stage with its military and industrial might. War tore Europe apart again in the 1930s and 1940s during World War II. When Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor in late 1941, the nation entered the global struggle.
The Civil Rights Era
After the Allied victory in World War II,
millions of veterans returned home ready
to start new lives. They enrolled in college
in record numbers, settled into the nation's
cities and new suburbs, and started families.
Soldiers who had fought on the side of democracy abroad also fought for democracy at home. This was especially true of the nation's African-American and Mexican-American soldiers. Their efforts to seek greater access to the rights of citizenship helped invigorate the civil rights movement. They were joined in these efforts by Americans from all walks of life—people who believed that America worked best when the promises of freedom were open to all.
By the 1960s, the push for greater civil rights had become a true social movement in America. It was a grassroots effort on the part of ordinary Americans to change both people's attitudes and federal laws. Cesar Chavez, for example, led the fight to win more rights for migrant workers. This movement for greater civil, educational, and political rights among racial and ethnic groups helped spur the women's rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s as well. Women began entering the workforce in larger numbers. More enrolled in college, and they began to have access to higher-paying jobs.

Economic Changes and Challenges
The U.S. economy has also changed dramatically since 1877. Changes in technology led to a second industrial revolution. In the 1930s, millions of Americans were affected by the huge economic collapse known as the Great Depression. After World War II, the U.S. economy recovered, and the nation enjoyed a long period of prosperity. Many Americans joined the middle class for the first time, buying homes, televisions and appliances, and cars in record numbers.
Since the 1970s, the U.S. economy has had more ups and downs. Many American companies have moved their factories overseas where wages are lower, causing hardship for many American workers. Technology and housing booms during the 1990s and early 2000s created prosperity. In the late 2000s, however, a severe economic crisis emerged. The banking system nearly collapsed, houses and stocks plummeted in value, and millions of people lost their jobs. The economic downturn resulted in a series of protests by a movement known as Occupy Wall Street. Groups met in cities across the nation to support the movement. Many economists think it may take a decade or more for the U.S. economy to fully recover.
Immigration and Democracy
Immigration has always been important to the United States. Since 1877, this strong tradition of immigration has continued. During the 1900s, people from every comer of the world came to America to settle. These new immigrants were Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, and Sikhs. They came from Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Many have moved away from their home countries in order to experience democracy and to take part in America's booming economy. They came in search of a brighter future, greater freedom, and a chance to start their lives over again—and they came to become Americans. The decade between 2000 and 2010 saw the highest number of immigrants in the nation's history: nearly 14 million.
The United States has become a place with many different cultures living side by side. Our national identity includes aspects of a variety of races and cultures. The nation's popular music, for example, is often based on an African American style of music called the blues. We are recognized for our acceptance of different religions and our landscape is full of a variety of places of worship. American food has been influenced by that of nations ranging from Germany and Italy to England and Mexico.
America Then and Now
In the years since 1877, the United States has faced challenges and experienced triumphs. The threat of terrorism—made clear by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001— remains an ongoing challenge. Another challenge came in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast and New Orleans, causing the city's levees to fail. The disaster displaced hundreds of thousands of people and caused more than $80 billion in damage to the Gulf Coast region. But for many Americans, especially those who toiled for the civil rights, a
triumph came with the election of Barack Obama, our nation's first African-American president, in 2008.
Challenges and triumphs alike highlight the importance of our nation's founding principles. More than 200 years ago, the Founding Fathers insisted that the United States was an experiment—a new nation devoted to the possibility that the ideals of equality and freedom could be supported by democracy, justice, and the rule of law. Today, just as then, this experiment works best when Americans exercise their rights seriously.

7. Writing a Report You have studied a wide variety of people, events, and themes in U.S. history. Choose a broad topic that has affected the economy, politics, or daily life throughout the nation's history. Create a thesis on the topic. Using the research and writing skills that you have learned throughout the year, research, outline, and prepare a report that supports your topic. Locate primary and secondary sources, both written and visual, to research information.
Look at maps, charts, graphs, and other representations of geographic and statistical data to inform your report. Pose questions about the material you find, and research the answers. Remember to use standard spelling, grammar, sentence structure, and punctuation in your writing, and to cite all sources that you have used in your report.
Then prepare a visual presentation of your report.
For your presentation, organize the information you found in written and visual sources, maps, graphs, charts, and databases into your own diagrams, charts, maps, or models. As you present your report, speak clearly and use the vocabulary you have learned. As you present your work to the class, summarize your report. As you listen to others' presentations, write a summary of their reports. Look for any bias in their sources or their report, and ask for clarification of any ideas or words you don't understand.
