Place and Time: Expansion of the United States
Beginning in 1607, Americans took the gradual first steps toward taming a continent and building a nation.
Today that nation spans the continent, and the rights and freedoms its people enjoy are the envy of the world. American history is the story of those accomplishments.

Thinking Like a Historian
guiding question Whydo we study history and sodal studies?
We study history for many reasons. We learn how the past has shaped our world today. Studying history also helps us develop the knowledge and skills we need to participate in public life as informed and responsible citizens.
History is one of the branches of knowledge of social studies. As you study history, you will also study other branches of social studies. These are:
•	Geography
•	Economics
•	Government
•	Citizenship
•	Culture
•	Science, Technology, and Society
Historians are people who study and write about history. Historians use a number of tools to collect and organize information.

Measuring Time
guiding question What tools help us measure time?
Studying history shows us when events took place. Which events happened first? How far apart in time did events take place? A variety of tools measure time.
Calendars
Historians rely on calendars, or dating systems, to measure time. A calendar breaks time into units and keeps track of those units. Cultures throughout the world have developed different calendars based on events in their history.
Chronology and Time Lines
The order in which events happen is chronology.
There are two types of chronology: absolute chronology and relative chronology. To apply absolute chronology, arrange events or individuals in order from the earliest to the latest. Here is an example:
•	Thomas Jefferson writes the Declaration of Independence, 1776;
•	The U.S. purchases the Louisiana Territory, 1803;
•	Andrew Jackson is elected president, 1828;
•	The Civil War begins, 1861.
It is not always possible to date an event precisely. We can only place approximate dates on events that take place over a long period of time. Examples are the Ice Age and the Industrial Revolution. In such cases, we can use relative chronology.
li Dagli Orti/Corbis
Throughout history, different cultures have developed different calendars. This calendar was developed by the Aztec people who lived in what is now Mexico.

SKILLS PRACTICE____________

Reading HELPDESK
To apply relative chronology, identify which time period, or era, came first, which came second, and so on. Here is an example using time periods from U.S. History. The Age of Exploration was the earliest of these four time periods, so it is listed first.
•	Age of Exploration
•	Reconstruction
•	Great Depression
•	Cold War Era
An easy way to keep track of chronology is to make a time line. A time line is a diagram showing the order of events within a period of time. As you study U.S. history, you will be expected to organize and interpret information from time lines. For practice, look at the time line on the previous page and think about how you would answer these questions:
•	Which event came first?
•	Which event was last?
•	During which century did these events take place?

Primary and Secondary Sources
GUIDING QUESTION
What is a primary source, and how does it differ from a secondary source? As you study social studies, you will often study and analyze information in primary sources and secondary sources. A primary source is a document or object that was created during the time being studied. For example, if you see a rocket launch and then write about it, you are creating a primary source. Examples of different types of primary sources are listed below.
•	Letters
•	Diaries
•	Official records
•	Photographs and paintings
•	Oral histories and interviews
•	Artifacts
Primary sources may be located in libraries, archives, or private collections. Many maybe viewed online. For example, the National Archives has images of the original U.S. Constitution on its Web site.

The letter from Abraham Lincoln is a primary source. Artifacts such as the Sioux deerskin bag, the mortar (a bowl in which ingredients are ground together), and the serpent figure are also primary sources.
A secondary source, on the other hand, usually comes from someone who was not present at an event. A book about the history of the space program is a secondary source. The writer of the book collected information from primary sources and other secondary sources. Some examples of secondary sources are:
•	Histories
•	Encyclopedias
•	Magazine articles
•	Textbooks
•	Biographies
Secondary sources are widely available online and in libraries. Encyclopedias can be a great resource for students studying the history of the United States or other countries.
Checking Your Sources
When you use primary or secondary sources to learn about an event, you need to analyze them to find out if they are reliable. You can evaluate a source by considering the language it uses, determining if the information in the source can be corroborated in other sources, and researching information about the author.
h


secondary source an account of an event written by someone who did not witness it
Lesson 1	7
This cartoon, drawn in the early 1900s, shows the Standard Oil Company as a giant octopus.
CRITICAL THINKING
Analyzing Primary Sources What can you infer about the cartoonist's point of view? Written, oral, and even visual accounts of events are often made from a point of view, or particular attitude about someone or something. The creator uses his or her point of view to decide which information is important, which people are key players, which details are worth recording, and which details are left out. Secondary sources are also often written from a point of view.
Most people have feelings and ideas that affect their point of view. Sometimes a point of view is expressed as a bias, or an unreasoned, emotional judgment about people and events. Here are some hints you can use to help uncover bias in secondary sources as well as in written, oral, or visual primary sources.
•	Identify the material’s creator. Examine his or her views and possible reasons for creating the material.
•	In written or spoken material, look for language that reflects an emotion or opinion—words such as all, never, best, worst, might, or should.
•	Is the creator showing bias? Bias reflects a personal and often unreasoned judgment about the subject.
point of view a particular attitude about someone or something
bias an unreasoned emotional judgment about people and events
8 Exploring Social Studies
Frame of Reference
When you are reading about a past event or interpreting a historical figure’s actions, you need to also think about frame of reference. Frame off reference refers to the experiences and beliefs that are influencing a person or group at a particular time.
Historical context is especially important when judging past events or writings. A person’s point of view must be considered within the frame of reference of his or her times. For example, we know that Abigail Adams wrote the letter that follows to her husband John Adams in the spring of 1776. As you read the letter, think about what was happening at the time.
PRIMARY SOURCE
M I
long to hear that you have dedared an independency.1 And, by the way, in the new code of laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors.2 Do not put such unlimited power into the hands ofthe husbands. Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation.3 ** Abigail Adams
—Abigail Adams, 1776
1	John was attending the Continental Congress, which would soon declare the United States independent from Great Britain.
2	"Ancestors" refers to English rulers. In England, women had few rights.
3	Abigail points out that if women have no say in the matters ofthe country, then they should not be subject to laws passed by men.
Evaluating the Validity of Sources
The more times you can answer “yes” to the following questions about a primary or secondary source, the more reliable you may consider the source:
•	Are facts supported with evidence?
•	Is the language or image objective and not emotional?
•	Can the same information be found in another source?
•	Is the source’s creator reputable, or does he or she have credentials that would suggest credibility?
•	Does the author or speaker acknowledge other viewpoints?

Using Charts, Graphs, Models, and Databases
GUIDING QUESTION
How do I create and interpret charts, graphs, models, and databases? Some social studies information is presented in various visual forms. These forms include charts, graphs, models, and databases. Charts and Databases
When you create a chart, you present information in an organized way. A chart arranges information, especially numbers, in rows and columns for easy reference. Charts help us categorize information in order to better understand it.
View the chart that shows information about monthly army salaries. The vertical column on the left shows the soldiers’ ranks. The row across the top identifies time periods in four major conflicts. Here are some questions to help you interpret this chart:
•	What was the monthly salary for a corporal during the Civil War?
•	Did a sergeant during the Vietnam War receive more or less pay than a sergeant during World War II? What was the difference in salary?
A database is a special kind of chart. When you create a database, you are collecting information that can be rapidly searched and retrieved. You can create your own database. By using special software developed for record keeping, you can easily add, delete, change, or update information. Let’s say that you wanted to build a database with information on events and people. First determine what facts you want to include. Then, follow the instructions to set up fields in the data management system that you are using. Enter each item of data in its assigned field. Determine how you want to organize the facts-by data, by person, or by topic. Finally, follow the instructions in your computer program to place the information in the order you selected.

Graphs
A graph presents numbers visually. This makes the numbers easier to understand. The types of graphs are described below. Display each graph as you read the description.
•	Circle graphs show how the whole of something is divided.
•	Bar graphs use bars to compare numbers visually. They compare different items or groups. Bar graphs can also be used to compare items at different points in time.
•	Line graphs also show how something changes over time. Rather than showing data for only one specific point in time, line graphs show a continuous line of data.
When you create a graph, the first thing you do is decide which type of graph best presents the information visually. Read each of the following examples and decide which graph works best: a circle graph, bar graph, or line graph.
•	In the student council election, Noah received 15 votes, Maya received 20 votes, and Elizabeth received 5 votes.
•	To show how much time you spent on homework every day for a week

What Is Geography?
guiding question How does geography affect our lives?
The story of the United States begins with geography—the study of Earth and its people. Geography describes Earth’s land, water, and plant and animal life. To understand the link between geography and history, keep in mind the following themes:
Location: “Where is it?” Absolute location is one exact spot on Earth. Relative location tells where a place is, compared with one or more other places.
Place: “What is it like?” Place describes the features that make an area unique, or different. Physical features include landform and climate. Cultural, or human-made, features include language and architecture.
Movement: “Why do people, things and ideas move from place to place?” For example, many early colonists came to America seeking religious freedom.
Region: “What common characteristics does an area share?” A
region is an area that is defined by common features. For example, the South during the 1800s was a largely agricultural region.

Lesson 2	13
Human-Environment Interaction: “What is the relationship between people and their surroundings?” People affect the environment by using it or changing it to meet their needs. Environmental factors that people cannot control, such as natural disasters, influence and affect how they live.
On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf of Mexico coast, destroying buildings, roads, and electrical lines from central Florida to Texas. Katrina caused huge economic problems from food shortages to the disruption of gas supplies. Because Louisiana and Texas are producers of oil and gas, energy needs all across the nation were affected.
Humans also change their environment to meet their needs.
As the nation grew during the 1800s, the need for better and more transportation systems also grew. The need for railroads, like roads and canals before, came from industry and trade. The growth of railroads, in turn, created thousands of jobs, and stimulated new industries, such as those for iron and steel. When the automobile became the most popular form of travel in the 1900s, the need grew

Globes and Maps
GUIDING QUESTION
What kinds of information do maps provide? The tools of the geographer include maps and globes.
These help us to learn more about Earth. Globes and maps serve different purposes, and each has its advantages and disadvantages.
A globe is a round model of Earth that shows its shape, lands, bodies of water, and directions as they truly relate to one another. A map is a flat drawing of all or part of Earth’s surface. Cartographers, or mapmakers, use mathematical formulas to transfer information from the round globe to a flat map. Still, all maps distort the shapes of the places they show.
Maps can show small areas such as a school campus. They can show the streets in a city. Or, they can show whole continents or even the entire world. They can show places as they exist now. Historical maps can show the features of a place at some time in the past.
Studying geography helps us to understand Earth—its people, its natural features, and the way they interact with each other.
Different Kinds of Maps
Maps differ because they serve many purposes and show various kinds of information. A physical map shows the physical features of an area, such as its mountains and rivers. Physical maps use color and shading to show relief— how flat or rugged the land surface is. Colors also are often used to show elevation—the height of an area above sea level. Political maps generally show Earth’s human-made divisions. These include cities and the boundaries of states and countries.
Another kind of map is the thematic map. Thematic maps show more specialized information than physical or political maps do. For instance, a thematic map might display the kinds
| of crops that grow in different areas. Or it might show where i ranching or mining take place.
Maps and globes do similar things, but each has advantages and disadvantages.

A physical map calls out landforms and water features. This physical map of the United States shows rivers and mountains. The colors used on physical maps include brown or green for land and blue for water.
As you study U.S. history, you will create and analyze thematic maps. For practice, create a personal thematic map that tells something about you. Your map might show your route to school, where your friends live, or identify the cities in your state you have visited.
Parts of a Map
The map key explains the lines, symbols, and colors used on a map. The key shows what population numbers each color represents.
Map keys can also show political divisions such as cities.
A measuring line, often called a scale bar, helps you determine distance on the map. The map scale tells you what distance on Earth is represented by the measurement on the scale bar. The scale bar on this map shows what measurement on the map equals a certain distance on Earth.
An important first step in reading any map is to find the direction marker. A map has a symbol called a compass rose. The compass rose tells you the positions of north, south, east, and west.
Latitude and Longitude
Lines on globes and maps provide information that helps us easily locate places on Earth. Most maps show these lines, which are called latitude and longitude. They cross one another, forming a grid pattern.
Lines of latitude circle Earth parallel to the Equator. The lines measure the distance north and south of the Equator in degrees. The Equator is located at 0°. The North Pole lies at 90°N (north).
Social Studies
This map is a special-purpose, or thematic, map. It provides historical information. The map also uses colors to show population patterns.
Lines of longitude circle Earth from the North Pole to the South Pole. These lines measure distances east or west of the starting line, which is at 0° longitude and is called the Prime Meridian. The Prime Meridian runs through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England.
The grid formed by the lines of latitude and longitude makes it possible to find the absolute location of a place. Only one place can be found at the point where a specific line of latitude crosses a specific line of longitude.
Posing and Answering Questions About Geography
In your studies, you often answer questions about what you have read or studied. You will also take part in another kind of activity in which you generate and answer questions about geographic distributions and patterns shown on maps. You will also sometimes be asked to pose questions shown on other geographic representations, such as graphs, charts, models, and databases.
To practice this skill using maps, view the U.S. population map. Then read the examples of typical questions that can be posed about the geographic patterns shown on the map.

Throughout your study of U.S. history, you will not only pose questions, you will also answer questions that appear in your textbook and worksheets. In addition, you will answer questions posed by your teacher and by your classmates. For practice in answering questions, choose a geographic visual such as a graph, chart, model, or database from the chapter.

What Is Economics?
guiding question What economic choices must every society make?
Economics is the study of how individuals and nations make choices about ways to use scarce resources to meet their needs and wants. Economics is also the study of how things are made, bought, sold, and used. There are four factors of production necessary to produce goods and services: natural resources, entrepreneurs, capital, and labor.
Natural resources: These are all the “gifts of nature” that make production possible. Natural resources include land and water, as well as fish, animals, trees and vegetation, and mineral deposits.
Entrepreneurs: An entrepreneur is a person who organizes and operates a business. Entrepreneurs assume risks in order to make a profit.
Capital: The machines, buildings, and tools that are used to make goods and services are known as capital. Economists also often think of money as a form of capital.

The nation's workforce, labor, is its human resources. Labor includes anyone, such as these workers at a Garland, Texas, factory, who works to produce goods and services.
Labor: Labor includes anyone who works to produce goods and services. To put it simply, labor is the nation’s workforce. Goods are products that are created in factories or grown on farms. Goods include bicycles, jackets, and ears of corn. Services are actions people perform for others, such as cutting hair, repairing cars, or teaching.
Scarcity is a problem that all societies face. There are not enough resources to produce all the goods and services people want. Scarcity requires people to make choices. Because of scarcity, every society must make three important choices: what to produce, how to produce, and for whom to produce.

The U.S. Free Enterprise Economy
guidingquestion IWiflf freedoms do people have in a free enterprise system?
To help make economic decisions, every country has its own economic system. Economic systems are different ways people use resources to make and exchange goods and services. Economic systems are often defined by their characteristics. In a free enterprise economy, the characteristics are:
20	Exploring Social Studies
Private property: Private property is anything owned by individuals or groups rather than by the government. The right to own private property is guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. Property includes money, land, buildings, machines, and personal possessions. As an individual, you are free to buy whatever you can afford. You also control how, when, and by whom your property is used.
Choice: Each of us can choose the type of work or job we do. We choose the products we buy. If we think the price of a product is too high, we can shop elsewhere or choose not to buy it. Businesses can choose which products to make or sell and choose the price at which to sell them.
Voluntary exchange: Under free enterprise, buying and selling is based on the principle of voluntary exchange. A buyer voluntarily exchanges money for goods or services. The seller voluntarily exchanges goods or service for money. If you purchase a game at a flea market, your transaction is an example of voluntary exchange. You are choosing to buy the game and the seller is willing to sell it to you at the price you are willing to pay.
Competition: Under free enterprise, people are free to compete with one another. As a consumer, you benefit from sellers’ competing offers. Competition for land, jobs, and natural resources has shaped much of the nation’s history. Businesses also compete for customers. This competition has been another major force in U.S. history.
Economic incentives: An incentive is something that causes a person to act. For example, money acts as an incentive for people to work. Money is also an incentive for businesses to produce goods and services and sell them for profit. Have you ever bought something you wanted because it was on sale? Have you ever not bought something you wanted because it cost too much? Both are examples of how price is an incentive.
The Beginnings of Free Enterprise
Colonial Americans were inspired by the work of British philosopher and economist Adam Smith. His book, The Wealth of Nations, was published in 1776, the same year the Declaration of Independence was written.
In his book, Smith set forth the basic principles of free enterprise—that people are free to buy, sell, and produce what they want with little or no government restriction.

Lesson 2	21

As trade takes place, the trading partners become interdependent. Each trading partner depends on the other to help provide his or her wants and needs. This interdependence occurs between international trading partners and also between partners within countries such as the United States.
The term laissez-faire economics (from the French “to let alone”) came to describe this idea. Smith s ideas influenced the founders ofthe United States, who limited the role of government mainly to national defense and keeping the peace.
A free enterprise economic system also developed in the nation because the people had fought a war for independence to escape English control. The British government had restricted the people’s right to trade with other nations, imposed taxes on the colonists without their consent, and held the power to quarter troops in the homes of colonists. The founders established a nation in which the government played a limited role in the economy. Trade was subject to few restrictions. Taxes were levied, but only through representatives elected by the citizens. Property rights were protected: Owners have the right to use their land, homes, and any other goods they possess as they see fit.
Ethics and Free Enterprise
Ethics are the principles of conduct against which actions are determined to be right or wrong, good or bad, fair or unfair.
The U.S. free enterprise economy is an ethical system because its characteristics promote economic freedom by:
•	letting individuals pursue the occupation of their choice;
•	providing goods and services for various groups in society;
•	bestowing rewards on producers who make goods preferred by buyers;
•	supporting the liberty of individuals;
•	and allowing individuals to develop their skills and talents.
John Locke was a British philosopher who inspired colonial Americans. Locke argued for economic freedom and private property rights. He wrote that “[a]s every man has a property in his own person, the labour of his body, and the work of his hands are properly his.”
Locke also believed that it was the duty of the government to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens. His ideas influenced the writers of our nation’s founding documents—the
Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.

Exploring Sodal Studies
Historic events can bring about great economic change. Nearly 100,000 people came to California to search and pan for gold in the late 1840s. Agriculture, shipping, and trade expanded to meet the need ofthe growing population for food and other goods. Cities also flourished during the gold rush.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
Understanding the foundations of American government helps us to recognize the values, beliefs, principles, and ideals that have been and still are important to the people of the United States.
Beliefs and Principles of a Nation
GUiDiNGQUESTiON What American beliefs and principles are reflected in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution?
A government is the ruling authority tor a community or society. Any organization that has the power to make and enforce, or carry out, laws and decisions tor its members acts as a government. Most governments are based on constitutions. A constitution is a detailed, written plan of government.
The United States is a constitutional republic. I bis is a system of government in which the people are the ultimate source of governmental power. The United States is the oldest constitutional republic in the world.
Foundations of American Government
Abraham Lincoln described our system of government as a “government of the people, by the people, for the people.” Lincoln’s words make three important points. First, the power of government comes from the citizens. Second, Americans themselves, acting through their representatives, make the decisions of government. Third, the purpose of the government is to make the United States a better place for those who live here.

PRINCIPLES OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION
Poplular Sovereignty Republicanism Limited Government
Federalism
Separation of Powers Checks and Balances
People are the source of the government's power.
People elect their political representatives.
The Constitution limits the actions of government by listing power it holds and does not hold.
In this government system, power is divided between national and state governments.
Each of the three branches of government has its own responsibilities.
Each branch of government holds some control over the other two branches.
Our nation’s founding documents—the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights— express important principles. These are:
•	All people are created equal.
•	All people possess certain basic rights.
•	The purpose of government is to secure these rights.
•	The authority of governments is derived from the people.
Many of the principles outlined in these founding documents were first formed during a movement of the 1700s called the Enlightenment. Many leaders of Britain’s American colonies were familiar with the writings of John Locke of England and the Baron de Montesquieu of France, two thinkers of the Enlightenment.
Locke believed that all people were born equal, with certain natural rights. These included the right to life, to freedom, and to own property. According to Locke, people form governments and choose leaders to protect these natural rights. Montesquieu developed the idea that the power of government should be divided among branches in order to prevent any person or group from becoming too strong.
Our English and Colonial Heritage
Our nation’s founding documents were also influenced by earlier documents and agreements that promoted freedom and liberty. The Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights were essential building blocks for political principles found in the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.
!
The Constitution sets forth the six basic principles upon which the U.S. system of government rests.

On November 21,1620,41 colonists aboard the Mayflower drafted an agreement. The Mayflower Compact was the first plan of self-government ever put in force in the English colonies.
In 1215 English nobles forced the king to sign an agreement called the Magna Carta. This document limited the power of the monarch by guaranteeing that no one would be above the law, not even a king or queen.
In 1689 Parliament drew up the English Bill of Rights.
This document further restricted the monarch’s power. It also guaranteed free elections to Parliament (England’s legislature), the right to a fair trial, and the elimination of cruel and unusual punishments.
The Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims in 1620, stands as the first example of many colonial plans for self-government. In 1639, representatives of several Connecticut towns wrote a plan of government for their colony. 'That plan, called the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, was the first constitution in the colonies.
The Influence of Our Founding Documents
In 1776 the American colonists began a revolution to defend their belief in equality, natural rights, and self-government. They made their beliefs clear in the Declaration of Independence, which stated the reasons they were seeking freedom. These beliefs later influenced France’s Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, a statement of principles that accompanied a revolution in that country in 1789.
Inspired by American ideals of equality and freedom, enslaved Africans took up arms in the French-held Caribbean island of

Saint Dominique—present-day Haiti. In 1804 Haiti became the second country in the Americas, after the United States, to gain independence. Over the next three decades, Mexico and other nations in Central and South America also revolted against their European rulers and gained self-government.
Political Parties and Interest Groups
A political party is an organization of individuals with common interests who organize to win elections, to operate the government, and to thereby influence government policy.
In the 1790s, the first two rival political groups organized in the United States. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson led one group, the Democratic-Republicans. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton led the other group, the Federalist Party.
They disagreed strongly about how the U.S. government should operate.
In the United States today, the two major parties are the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Competing political parties are a necessary part of democratic government. They are a key link between citizens and their elected officials. They give voters a choice between candidates and ideas. A basic difference between the major parties is their view on the role of government. Democrats tend to believe that the federal government should be more directly involved in regulating the economy and in providing housing, education, and jobs. Republicans tend to favor less regulation of the economy as a way to help the nation’s economy grow. Other political parties, called third parties, have been part of the American political scene since the early days of the republic.
An interest group is a group of people that have common aims and try to influence citizens and government officials to act in their favor. Interest groups represent a variety of causes. Many interest groups deal with economic interests, including groups like the National Association of Manufacturers and powerful labor organizations. Other interest groups deal with more specific causes. The National Taxpayers Union works for lower taxes and less wasteful spending. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) seeks to stop drunk driving and prevent underage drinking.

j What Is Citizenship?
| guiding question How is citizenship obtained?
1	A citizen is a person who owes loyalty to and is entitled to the
|	protection of a state or nation. How do you become a U.S. citizen?
j The U.S. Constitution establishes two ways to become a citizen:
| by birth and, for foreign-born people who choose to become I citizens, by a legal process called naturalization.
j	Citizenship by Birth If you were born in any of the 50 states
| or the District of Columbia, you became a U.S. citizen at birth.
| You also are a citizen if you were born outside the country s
(borders but in U.S. territory, such as Puerto Rico or Guam. Even if you were born elsewhere, you can claim citizenship if one of ? your parents is a U.S. citizen. Children born on American soil to non-U.S. citizens also acquire U.S. citizenship at birth.
Citizenship by Naturalization Immigrants who want to become citizens must meet certain requirements. They must be:
1	•	18 years old or older
I» a resident of the United States for five years • able to read, write, and speak English • of good moral character
To become citizens, applicants must also pass a citizenship test, which measures their understanding of U.S. history, government, and the legal system. The final step in naturalization is attending a ceremony and pledging an oath of allegiance. The applicant swears to be loyal to the United States and to obey the Constitution and other laws.

Rights and Responsibilities
guidingquestion What are the rights and responsibilities of citizens ofthe United States?
As citizens of our nation, we hold many rights. However, we must also fulfill the responsibilities of citizenship.
Rights and the Declaration of Independence
Almost from the moment that the United States declared itself an independent country, Americans have valued and celebrated their rights and freedoms. Thomas Jefferson’s words in the Declaration of Independence made it clear that the citizens of the new country would never be denied certain basic rights—rights that belong to all people. These principles are brilliantly stated in the second paragraph of the Declaration:
James Madison introduced a set of amendments to the U.S. Constitution during the first session of Congress. The states ratified 10 of them in 1791. These first 10 amendments became known as the Bill of Rights.
PRIMARY SOURCE
M
We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness—That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent ofthe Governed. 99 —Declaration of Independence, 1776
The Bridgeman Art Library/Getty Images
Jefferson stated that the principles he was identifying were “truths,” not just beliefs held by a few radicals. He also noted that these principles were “self-evident,” or obvious.
In saying that people have unalienable rights, or rights that cannot be taken away, Jefferson was borrowing from earlier thinkers such as William Blackstone and from Locke’s writings on natural rights. Natural (or unalienable) rights have several characteristics:
•	They belong to every human being regardless of gender, age, or nationality.
•	They cannot be taken away or interfered with by any government.
There are other kinds of rights besides natural rights. These rights are man-made and codified into law. Yet many of the individual rights that Americans enjoy and celebrate—such as the right to worship as one pleases, the right to assemble, and the right to fair treatment under the law—are based on the natural and unalienable rights of “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.”
Academic Vocabulary	unalienable right a right that cannot be

Lesson 3	29
During earlier periods in our nation's history, some people were not allowed to vote. Through the efforts of suffragists (above) and their supporters, women gained the right to vote with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920.
Today, to be eligible to vote, you must be a citizen of the United States and at least 18 years of age.

Rights and the Bill of Rights
In the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson laid the foundation for many of the rights that later became part of the U.S. Constitution. The first 10 amendments, or changes, to the Constitution were added in 1791. They are known as the U.S. Bill of Rights, and they list Americans’ basic rights and freedoms.
The First Amendment to the Constitution protects five basic freedoms: freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of the assembly, and freedom to petition the government.
How does the First Amendment protect these freedoms? The amendment safeguards religious freedom in two ways. First, the amendment prohibits Congress from establishing an official religion in the United States. This makes the United States different from countries in which a state church is established. Second, the amendment guarantees Americans the right to practice their faith as they wish. The government may not favor one religion over another or treat people differently because of their personal beliefs.
Many of the people who braved the journey to the American colonies did so because they were not allowed to practice their religions in their home countries. The Framers of the U.S. Constitution wanted to be sure this would not happen in their new nation.
Our Responsibilities
With citizenship come responsibilities, things we are expected or are required to do. As individuals we have personal responsibilities, such as being accountable for how we behave and how we support our families. As citizens, we also have responsibilities. The responsibilities of citizenship include respecting the law, paying our taxes, and supporting and defending the U.S. Constitution. Rights
•	Right to a prompt, fair trial by jury
•	Right to vote in elections for public officials
•	Right to run for elected office
•	Right to privacy
Personal Responsibilities
Follow rules and laws at home, school, and in the community
•	Accept responsibility for your actions
•	Support your family

Citizenship Responsibilities
•	Respect and obey federal, state, and local laws
•	Stay informed on issues affecting your community
•	Vote and serve on juries
Rules and laws help keep order. They protect the safety, property, and freedom of citizens. They also make it possible for people to live together peaceably. Our system of representative government makes it possible for citizens to work with elected leaders to change laws they do not like.
Paying taxes gives government money to use for a variety of purposes, such as defending the nation, providing services to citizens, and building roads and bridges.
Defending the Constitution means more than volunteering to serve in the military to protect the nation against enemies of freedom. It also means serving on juries when called to do so. Americans have the right to a trial by a jury. This right would be difficult to exercise if citizens neglected this responsibility. Jury duty is necessary to guarantee everyone a fair and speedy trial.
Our rights and responsibilities define who we are as Americans. Our national identity has been built through the nation’s history as a land of immigrants of many different racial and ethnic backgrounds. It is not based on our belonging to one ethnic group or religion but on our shared values—freedom, liberty, and | equality. We express our respect for these shared values through our patriotism and love of country; by respecting our history, traditions, and symbols; and by exercising our rights and responsibilities.

Reading HELPDESK
It matters because
We live in a nation and world very different from that of our ancestors. Culture and technology have played a major part in creating those differences. Learning more about culture and technology can help us better understand the changes that are shaping our world.
What Is Culture?
guiding question What influences have shaped American culture?
A culture is the way of life of people who share similar beliefs and customs. A particular culture can be understood by looking at various elements: what languages the people speak, what religions they follow, and what smaller groups are part of their society. The study of cultures also includes examining people’s daily lives, the history they share, and the art forms they have created.
Culture and Ethnic Groups
Culture is often understood by looking at dif ferent groups of people in a society. Each of us belongs to many social groups. Most social groups have rules of behavior that group members learn. Each member also has a certain status. Status refers to a person’s importance or rank. In all cultures, the family is the most important social group. Although family structures vary from culture to culture, most of us first learn how to behave from our families.
People also belong to an ethnic group. This is a group that shares a language, history, religion, and some physical traits. Some countries, like the United States, are multicultural, or made up of many different ethnic or cultural groups. Such

countries have a national culture that all their people share, as well as the many diverse ethnic cultures.
A
Nation of Immigrants The United States is a multicultural nation because immigration has shaped our history. From the first English adventurers who settled Virginia more than 400 years ago to the Latino, Asian, and other immigrants arriving today, immigration has been the story of America.
No matter when they have come, the nation’s immigrants have arrived for the same basic reasons. The main factors that pushed them from their homelands were a lack of economic opportunity, persecution for their religious or political beliefs, or the desire to escape war or political unrest.
The factors that pulled them to the United States have been equally timeless, such as the right to enjoy religious, political, and personal freedom; the lure of land, jobs, and other economic opportunities; and the chance to share in what is known worldwide as the “American Dream.”
The Arts
Through music, painting, sculpture, dance, and literature, people express what they think is beautiful and meaningful. The arts can tell stories about important figures and events in a culture’s past. The arts can also help us understand the issues of modern times.

r
During the colonial era and early 1800s, items that could not be made at home were manufactured—by local blacksmiths, furniture makers, and other craftspeople. By the mid-1800s, more of America's manufacturing shifted to mills and factories. Industrialization brought work and workers together.
During the Colonial America era, art, music, and literature were modeled after British and other European styles. After the War of 1812, American writers, inspired by nationalism, began to develop their own literature. They used settings, characters, and humor that were typically American. One ofthe first authors to work on American themes was Washington Irving. In Rip Van Winkle” and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” Irving wrote about life in the Hudson River valley.
Early American artists had traveled to Europe to study. Many followed the British style of painting. Most often they painted portraits. More often, the nation’s artists began painting scenes of America. George Catlin lived and worked among Native Americans. He painted scenes of their daily life. George Caleb Bingham painted vivid scenes of everyday life on the Missouri frontier.
Art styles were changing. But art also reflected the continuity and change in the American way of life. The painting of the blacksmith shows a traditional feature of rural life. The painting of the metal factory reflects change in America. Craftspeople, like the blacksmith, remained an important part of their communities. Many Americans, however, were moving to urban areas to find work in factories.
Americans also developed a new style of music. Stephen Foster combined African and European music to create uniquely American songs about life in the South. A Boston music teacher, Lowell Mason, started a music program in the public schools.
He also composed the music for more than 1,600 church hymns. Many, including “Nearer, My God, to Thee,” are often sung today.
For many enslaved African Americans, Christianity was a religion of hope and resistance. Their passionate beliefs found expression in the spiritual, an African American religious folk song. H READING PROGRESS CHECK

Americans have felt the huge impact of science and technology in almost every part of our daily lives. Science and technology affect our home and school life, our work, our leisure pursuits, what we eat, and the clothes we wear.
Scientific Discoveries Influence Daily Life
Scientific and medical discoveries have changed the way people live.
1752 Ben Franklin experiments with electricity.
Franklin’s experiments with electricity led him to develop the lightning rod. When placed at the top of a building, it conducted huge amounts of the electricity in lightning bolts harmlessly into the ground, protecting the building. Franklin’s finding led to technology such as motors, computers, and light bulbs that harnessed and used electrical power.
1840s Anesthesia improves surgery.
An important advance in medicine is credited to two physicians from the United States. Working independently, Dr. Crawford W. Long of Georgia in 1842 and Dr. W. T. G. Morton of Boston in 1846 were the first physicians to use ether as an anesthetic during surgery. During the Civil War, ether and chloroform were widely used by military surgeons.
1955 Salk polio vaccine becomes widely available.
In the early 1950s, polio became the most-feared disease of the era because it left many of its victims paralyzed for life. In the mid-1950s, Dr. Jonas Salk, an American physician, developed an effective vaccine against polio. The threat of polio was almost completely eliminated.
Think about: Which of these scientific discoveries has had the greatest effect on your life?
Technology Influences Daily Life
In ways big and small, technology has changed the way people live. A technological innovation is a better way of doing things or improves on something that already exists. Many technological innovations from the past still affect our lives today.

Technology and Urbanization
New technology revolutionized transportation and
communications, and began the change of the United States from an agricultural to an urban, industrial nation. The telephone and telegraph enabled people to communicate with others at a distance. They shared ideas, news, and conducted business faster. These forms of communication also drew people to urban areas.
Industrialization drew thousands of people from farms and villages to cities in search of factory jobs with higher wages. To serve industry, facilities such as banks, insurance companies, and warehouses developed. These, in turn, attracted more industry and workers.
The promise of jobs and new opportunity was one reason why many people moved to the cities. Urban areas also had other advantages. In contrast to the isolation of farm life, cities had running water, modern plumbing, access to telephones and other forms of communication, museums, libraries, and convenient transportation.
Many city populations doubled or tripled. In 1820 only one American city had more than 100,000 residents. By 1860, eight cities had reached that size. Between 1860 and 1900, American urban areas grew twice as fast as the total population.

Critical Thinking Skills
guidingquestion Howcan social studies skills help students organize and analyze information and ideas?
Studying history is more than reading sources and viewing pictures or graphs. Historians need many different skills to analyze, explain, and find patterns in the events of history. Here are some of the social studies skills you will use in your study of U.S. history. As you read, you will be able to practice these skills. Identifying Cause and Effect
A cause is an action that leads to an event. An effect is the result of that action. Look for “signal” words or phrases that alert you to cause and effect, such as so, because, as a result, therefore, produced, and for the following reasons.
Think about a personal achievement. The achievement might be scoring a winning goal, writing a funny story, or fixing a bicycle. What causes helped you accomplish this achievement? How might knowing those causes help you to achieve the same effect again? Making Predictions
One way to analyze information is to think about what might happen next. Predicting future events is difficult. Sometimes,

Native Americans who were forced from their land traveled west in the 1830s.
though, you can use knowledge of how certain causes led to certain effects in the past to make such a prediction. This is one benefit that comes from having a knowledge of history.
For example, in the 1830s, white Americans wanted the land on which the Cherokee and four other Native American peoples were living. The government forced all of these peoples to give up their land so that white settlers could have it. What do you think happened to these Native Americans in the West once the settlers took their land?
E
Drawing Inferences and Conclusions
Inferences and conclusions are two different types of explanations we form about things. An inference is something we assume based on what appears to be true. Drawing an inference means choosing the most likely explanation based on that evidence.
For example, you arrive at the school bus stop a little later than usual. No one is there. You draw the inference that you have missed the bus. You do not know that for sure, however. You did not see the bus pulling away, and there might be other reasons why no one is at the bus stop. But based on the evidence you have—that you were late and that no one is there—you assume (draw the inference) that you missed the bus.
Study the model of the division of powers between the national and state governments. What is a power that is shared? What inferences might you draw from this?

Lesson 5	39
The Framers ofthe U.S. Constitution
divided the powers of government into three types. The powers granted to the national government are called enumerated powers, or expressed powers. Reserved powers are powers set aside for the states. Powers that both the national government and the state governments share are concurrent powers.
A conclusion is a logical explanation that is based on known facts. When you draw a conclusion, you use all available information to form the explanation. Conclusions are often developed from inferences as more information is gathered. These differences make conclusions more reliable explanations than inferences are. Once you have drawn a conclusion based on facts, you can persuasively support your point of view on an issue. For example, by studying a variety of sources about an election-such as news reports, polling data, and debates between the candidates—you can effectively draw a conclusion about why a candidate won.

Comparing and Contrasting
When making comparisons, you examine two or more ideas, objects, or events. You identify the similarities, or what the two things have in common. When you contrast, you are noting differences between ideas, objects, or events.
At times, you are asked to both compare and contrast. Signal words or phrases provide clues to what you need to do. Words such as similar and also tell you to compare. Words and phrases such as however and on the other hand tell you to contrast.
View the chart of the Virginia and New Jersey Plans on page 239. Which parts of the two plans are similar? Which parts are different?
Sequencing
Sequencing involves putting events in the order in which they occurred. Using this skill will help you to see and understand relationships between events. You can sequence events in two ways:
^0 Exploring Social Studies
•	absolute chronology When you sequence events in this way, you are paying attention to the dates of the events.
•	relative chronology When you sequence events this way, you only need to know which event came first, which came second, and so on, without paying attention to their dates.
Sequence the following events using relative chronology.
Then identify the relationship between slavery and the Civil War.
•	1860: Abraham Lincoln is elected president of the United States.
•	1850: Some Southern senators oppose compromising with the North over slavery.
•	1861: Southern states leave the Union and the Civil War begins.
•	1858: Northerner Abraham Lincoln rises to leadership in a political party that opposes slavery.
Finding the Main Idea
When you look for the main idea of a selection, you look for the most important idea. The examples and information that explain the main idea further are called supporting details.
Some main ideas are clearly stated—often in the first sentence of a paragraph or sometimes, in the last sentence of a passage. Other times, the writer does not directly state the main idea. Instead, he or she provides details that help readers figure out what the main idea is.
To help you find the main idea, ask yourself:
•	What is each sentence about?
•	Is there one sentence that tells about the whole passage or that is more important than the other sentences?
•	What main idea do the supporting details point out?
Summarizing
When you summarize, you reduce a large amount of information into short and simple form. A summary is a short restatement of the information’s important content. Summarizing helps you digest and remember the main points in what you have read.
Categorizing
As a student, it is important that you know how to organize | large amounts of information in an understandable way.
| Categorizing helps you arrange facts and information into 1 groups that have the same characteristics. Putting things into | categories can make it easier to see similarities and differences 5 among them.

Making Generalizations
Generalizations are statements that are generally true, based on the facts available. For example, by saying “Our school has great athletic teams,” you are making a generalization. That s because great is probably not true of all your school’s teams but just most of them, which makes your statement generally true.
In studying history, you may need to put bits and pieces of information together in order to see the overall picture.
To make an accurate generalization, you must first collect facts about the subject. Then identify similarities among facts and use those similarities to form some general ideas about the subject.
The Puritans came to America in 1630 and started a colony called Massachusetts. Make a generalization about them from the following pieces of information:
. The Puritans left England because they wanted religious freedom.
•	The Puritans drove Baptists and other non-Puritans from their colony.
•	Puritan Anne Hutchinson was expelled from Massachusetts for challenging church teachings.
•	The Puritans expelled Roger Williams because he challenged the church’s authority.

Problem-Solving Skills
GUIDINGQUESTION
How are decision making and problem solving similar? You will sometimes be called on to investigate a topic in depth. You might be assigned to complete a project on your own. Your teacher will also assign group projects.
For some topics, you will need to solve a problem or make a decision based on the evidence you gather. A set process—a series of steps can help you make the decision or solve the problem. Making Decisions
People make decisions every day. Some decisions affect other people, can have serious results, and must be made quickly. You might be a person who requires a lot of information to make your decision. Or you may feel very comfortable relying on your instinct when making your decision.
Whatever the decision and whatever your style, decision making should generally follow a process similar to this:
42	Exploring Social Studies
When your group is working to solve a problem, a first step is to understand the problem. Ask the questions:
*	What do we know about the problem?
*	Do we have enough information to solve the problem?
*	If not, what information do we need?
•	Determine if others should be involved in the decisionmaking process.
•	Gather information to help you make the decision.
•	Identify options/alternatives.
•	Weigh each option and predict the consequences of each.
•	Choose the best option.
•	Put your decision into action.
Solving Problems
A planned and careful approach will assist you in arriving at a solution to a problem. Choosing not to deal with a problem is one option. However, problems very rarely go away by themselves.
Here is a process that should help you solve a problem:
•	Identify the problem.
•	Gather information about the problem.
•	List and consider solutions to the problem.
•	Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each possible solution.
•	Choose a solution and put it into action.
•	Evaluate the effectiveness of the solution.
Doing Research
I
When you research a topic, you must determine what you 1 want or need to learn about it. Create six questions to help you I find out the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the topic. Academic Vocabulary_____________ Content Vocabulary_____________
create to make something new or original generalization a statement that is generally true, based on the facts available
Lesson 5	43
SKILLS PRACTICE_________________
When the language spoken in the classroom is challenging, list the words you do not know. Use a dictionary to look them up after the lesson.
If you are working in a group, decide which member is doing which part.
After you create six questions, the next step is to gather your research materials. Begin with general reference books, such as encyclopedias and textbooks, or your notes from class. Looking for information on the Internet can be quick and rewarding. However, it can be a challenge to find out if the information you locate is true. It is important to apply the following standards to information on the Internet.
jf you answer no to any of the questions below, the Web site is probably not a reliable source:
. Is the authorship of the information clear?
•	Can you easily find out who is responsible for the Web site?
•	Has the Web site been updated recently?
•	Does the writing seem balanced, or does it contain a bias toward one point of view?
You must also organize the information you gather. Outlines and reports can be a great resource when doing research. For example, you could use an outline—such as the table of contents for this book—to organize information about U.S. history for a presentation. Similarly, reports can help you organize data. If you look at a government report on a topic such as the environment or education, the level of detail devoted to certain topics can help you identify the most important subjects to address in an essay.
Once you have organized your information, you need to interpret, or assign meaning, to it. Again, the organization of material in outlines and reports can provide insight on a topic. How is the data organized? In what order is information presented? The structure of an outline or a report can help you interpret the relative importance of different pieces of data.

Writing and Communication Skills
guiding question How do we communicate information?
We communicate information in three main ways. One way is in written form, as in a report, a letter, or an e-mail. Another way is by voice, as in a conversation, a speech, a song, or a presentation at work or in class. The third way we communicate is visually.
otographs, film or video, art, maps, and graphs are all forms of visua communication. Sometimes our communications involve two o t ese means. For example, this textbook uses writing and images to provide information about our nation’s history.

Writing Skills
Good writing meets certain standards. It shows correct use of grammar—the rules for how the words and other parts of a language are used. The words chosen clearly convey the writer’s information and ideas. All words are properly used and their spelling is correct.
It is also important that you use the special words of social studies correctly. As you read the lessons, you will see many special words and phrases identified as content vocabulary or academic vocabulary. Examples of special vocabulary include free enterprise and unalienable right. Sentences are complete and properly punctuated. They also are not so long that they are confusing.
The sentences in good writing are organized into paragraphs. A paragraph is a group of sentences about one idea or topic. Paragraphs are the building blocks of
o	Deliberate Plagiarism	Unintentional Plagiarism
	Passing off as one’s own	Omitting or not properly
	or rewriting books,	citing original sources
	articles, or works of others	Poor paraphrasing or summarizing
	Copying and pasting from web sites or	Assuming something is

The first paragraph of a composition usually introduces the	plagiarism.
topic. The next paragraphs present information about the topic in
a logical, easy-to-follow sequence. Then the final paragraph states
the writer’s conclusion about the topic.
A very important standard of good writing is that the work be
the writer’s own. To plagiarize is to present the ideas or words of
another person as your own without giving credit to the source.
Plagiarism is similar to forgery, or copying anything else that is
not yours, and violates the law. If you copy an idea or a written
text word for word, that is plagiarism.
To avoid plagiarism, follow these rules:
•	Put information in your own words.
•	When you restate an opinion from something you read, include a reference to the author—for example, “According to Smith and Jones,...”
•	Always include a footnote when you use a direct quotation from another author.
If you are writing a report, you may be required to include a bibliography. A bibliography is a list of the books, articles, Internet sources, and other sources you used to do your research. These are listed at the end of your report and should include:
•	the author of the source
•	the title of the source
plagiarize to present someone else's ideas or
words as your own
Lesson 5	45
President George W. Bush addresses members ofthe U.S. Border Patrol about policy issues. Communication skills are important to make sure the audience understands your message. When you plan an oral presentation, ask yourself:
•	Who is your audience?
•	What does your audience already know about the topic?
•	What do you want your audience to know?
•	What details and vocabulary will help you accomplish this?
. the publisher of the source or the Web site and Internet address (URL) where it can be found
•	the date the source was published or the Web site was accessed
Writing a Paragraph
Writing a good paragraph involves stating information clearly and arranging it in a logical order. Knowing how to write a well-organized paragraph helps you express your ideas clearly. To write a good paragraph, follow these steps:
•	Decide on the main point you want the paragraph to express. Write the idea in a sentence. This sentence will become the topic sentence or main idea ot the paragraph.
•	Next, write detail sentences to support the main idea. These sentences should add information that explains or expands the main idea stated in the topic sentence. They may be facts, examples, or reasons. They should be arranged in a logical order.
Use transition words such as next, then, also, finally, because, however, and as a result to link sentences within the paragraph. Transitions can also be used to link two paragraphs together.
Good Writing Checklist
When you finish your writing, check to make sure your work is free from errors. This checklist can help you:
•	Have I avoided run-on sentences and sentence fragments?
•	Have I punctuated sentences correctly?
•	Have I used every word correctly, including plurals and possessives?
46 Exploring Social Studies
•	Have I correctly used social studies terminology?
•	Do verbs and subjects agree?
•	Have I spelled every word correctly? Have I checked unfamiliar ones in the dictionary?
•	Are my paragraphs clear and arranged in a logical order?
•	Are the words my own?
Finally, evaluate the paragraph you have written. Does the topic sentence state the main idea clearly? Do the other sentences support the main idea?
Creating Presentations
Many of the standards and skills that make for good written communication apply to voice communication too. Whether you are giving a speech, oral report, or other presentation, your grammar should be correct. Your sentences should be complete, short, and in an order that makes your meaning clear.
These skills are especially important when you are delivering information orally. It is often more difficult for people to understand something they listen to than something they read.
To help your audience understand, you can ask key questions about the information you are presenting and then answer them in your presentation. Also, allow your audience time at the end of your presentation to ask questions.
Most social studies presentations are more interesting if they include visuals such as photographs, slide shows, videos, maps, graphs, or diagrams. Multimedia is the combination of text, images, video, audio, and animation in an interactive computer program. To create multimedia presentations, use special software on your computer.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
Human history in the Americas began thousands of years ago.
The Migration Begins
GUIDING QUESTION
Who were the first Americans, and how did they live? The written history of the Americas is several hundred years old, yet human beings have been living on these continents for thousands of years. Where did these people come from? How and when did they get here? How did the different corners of North and South America get settled?
Today, scientists are still seeking answers to these questions. Experts in archaeology (AHR«kee»ah«luh»jee), the study of ancient peoples, continue to piece together evidence that tells the story of the first Americans.
Archaeologists have learned a lot about the past from artifacts (AHR«tih»fakts)—the tools, weapons, and other objects that early people left behind. Based on this and other types of evidence, archaeologists have offered some possible answers to questions about the first Americans. A widely held theory of recent times is that the first humans might have come to the Americas 20,000 or more years ago. This theory maintains that early people traveled along a strip of land that once linked Asia and the Americas.

ago. During these years, a large share of Earth’s water formed huge sheets of ice, or glaciers. The glaciers held so much water that ocean levels were lower. The lower sea level exposed a strip of land—a “land bridge”—connecting northeastern Asia to what is now Alaska. Scientists today call this land bridge Beringia. It now lies beneath the Bering Strait, a body of water named for explorer Vitus Bering. A strait is a narrow body of water that connects two larger ones.
Many scientists believe early people traveled from Asia to North America across the land bridge. Yet not all scientists agree on how or when this might have happened. For example, some think people might have come to the Americas by boat. This might have allowed humans to spread faster throughout the Americas. As archaeologists discover new artifacts and evidence, new theories emerge to challenge old ones.
Searching for Hunting Grounds
It is clear, of course, that humans arrived in the Americas.
Long ago, they traveled throughout both continents. In time, settlements stretched as far east as the Atlantic Ocean and as far south as the tip of South America.

Lesson 1	55
What is the reason for this migration (my.GRAY.shuhn), or movement of people from one area to another? Why did these early Americans travel such distances? The answer may lie in the search for food. Early peoples were nomads (NOH.madz), people who moved from place to place in search of hunting grounds. Although they also ate wild grains and fruits, they depended on hunting for much of their food.
The first Americans did, indeed, find huge mammals to hunt. These included giant, shaggy beasts that resembled modern elephants: mastodons and mammoths. Early Americans were
skilled at hunting these and other animals. They stalked herds of bison, mastodons, or mammoths, charging at the animals with spears.
r
A single mammoth, which averaged 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, could provide tons of meat, enough to feed a group of people for months.
Earth Warms
About 15,000 years ago, the last ice age began to end. Temperatures started to rise, and the glaciers began to melt. Ocean levels rose, and Beringia disappeared beneath the waves, cutting off the land route between Asia and the Americas.
Around the same time, the large mammals on which humans depended for food began to disappear. This might have been the result of overhunting or changes in the climate. The decline in game populations meant that early Americans had to find other sources of food.

Learning to Farm
Around 10,000 years ago, people in the area now known as Mexico learned to plant an early form of maize (MAYZ), which is a type of corn. These early farmers also planted pumpkins, beans, and squash. The crops provided a steady, reliable source of food. The farming people no longer had to move from place to place to find things to eat. Farming also allowed the people to spend time on activities other than finding food. This resulted in an improvement in the lives of early Americans. In the 1600s, Native Americans taught the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony how to grow maize as well as beans and pumpkins.
Establishing Unique Cultures
Studying artifacts such as this antler or bone tool helps scientists learn about early cultures. Items such as these give important clues about the way ancient people lived. For example, scientists may be able to use a tool to infer how early people worked, what foods they ate, and what other tools they may have used.
Although some early Americans remained nomadic hunters, many others began to settle down. They built permanent shelters from clay, stone, or wood. They also made pottery and cloth.
Scientists have a method of determining how old an artifact is. Using a process called carbon dating, scientists can measure the amount of radioactive carbon in an
artifact. They can use this measurement to come up with an estimate of the artifact’s age. Carbon dating has helped scientists to date some settled North American villages to about 5,000 years ago.
Through the study and dating of artifacts from these villages, scientists know that agriculture changed the lives of early Americans. Common customs and beliefs also grew over time. Eventually, the groups of people living in the Americas developed their own cultures (KUHL*churz), or shared traditions and behaviors.

It matters Because
Early Americans developed rich cultures and complex civilizations in several locations.
Great Civilizations of Mexico, Central America, and South America
guiding question What civilizations in Mexico, Central America, and South America predated the arrival of Europeans?
Centuries before the Europeans arrived, great civilizations (sih* vuh«luh«ZAY*shuhnz), or highly developed societies, thrived in Mexico, Central America, and South America. The largest and most advanced of these were the Olmec, Maya, Aztec, and Inca.
Each of these civilizations controlled areas covering hundreds of square miles. They included millions of people and lasted for several centuries. The accomplishments of the Olmec, Maya, Aztec, and Inca rivaled any of the great civilizations in other parts of the world. Their people built grand cities in dense forests and on high mountains. They created spectacular works of art and developed advanced tools. They also came up with complex methods for tracking time, counting, and writing. The Olmec
Along the Gulf Coast of what is now Mexico, a people called the Olmec (OHL»mehk) once flourished. Between 1200 b.c. and 800 b.c., the Olmec built stone houses, monuments, and drainage systems. Their farmers grew food for thousands of people. For

reasons that are not fully understood, the Olmec civilization declined. By about 300 b.c., it had collapsed. Yet the Olmec had a strong influence on the cultures that followed.
The Maya
The Maya (MY*uh) civilization followed the Olmec and reached its peak between a.d. 250 and a.d. 900. Maya farmers planted maize, beans, squash, and other vegetables. These crops helped feed a large population, which may have peaked at 2 million people. These people lived in the many large cities the Maya built in the steamy rain forests of present-day Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Belize.
Maya civilization was a theocracy (thee»AH«kruh«see), a society ruled by religious leaders. Powerful Maya priests believed the gods were visible in the stars, sun, and moon. Their understanding of astronomy and their advanced mathematics helped them predict eclipses and develop a 365-day calendar.
The Maya also developed a system of writing that used hieroglyphics (HY •ruh«glih«fihks), symbols or pictures that represent things, ideas, and sounds.
Maya Transport and Trade
The Maya were active traders. Farmers brought maize and vegetables to city markets. They exchanged their goods for items such as cotton cloth, pottery, deer meat, and salt.
Without wheeled vehicles or horses, the Maya carried goods on their backs. Traders traveled on a network of roads that were carved out of the jungle. They also used canoes to ship goods, such as jade statues, turquoise jewelry, and cacao beans used for making chocolate, up and down Mexico’s east coast.
Maya Civilization Declines
In time the Maya civilization declined. By about 1200, its once-great cities were nearly deserted. The reason is a mystery.
Recent studies indicate that overpopulation, drought, and warfare are possible reasons for the Maya decline.
Though their civilization declined, the
Maya people did not disappear entirely.
Descendants of this great civilization still live in parts of Mexico and Central America today.
This Aztec calendar played an important role in religious as well as daily life. The Maya also had complex calendars.
Each Maya city had at least one stone pyramid, some of which reached about 200 feet (61 m)—the height of a 20-story building. The temples on top of the pyramids were religious and governmental centers.

Malinche (c. 1501-1550)
Much of what we know about individual Native Americans comes from Europeans. Malinche is one example. In 1519 she was enslaved and living under harsh Aztec rule. When the Spanish arrived in 1519, she gave them information about Aztec culture. She also learned Spanish quickly and served as a translator for the Spanish, who called her Doha Marina. Malinche helped build ties between the Spanish and the many unhappy Aztec subjects in the region.

The Aztec Empire
In 1325, centuries after the fall of the Maya, a group of hunters called the Aztec (AZ-tehk) were wandering through central Mexico. They were searching for a permanent home for their people. One day, they came upon an island in Lake Texcoco (tehs-KOH-koh). There they saw what they thought was a sign from their god: an eagle with a snake in its beak sitting on a cactus. According to Aztec legend, this sign indicated that the island was to be their home. It was on this site that the Aztec would build their capital city, Tenochtitlan (tay-NAWCH-teet-LAHN). Today it is the site of Mexico City.
At its height, Tenochtitlan was the largest city in the Americas-and one of the largest in the world. The city was a center of trade, attracting thousands of merchants to its outdoor marketplaces.
Tenochtitlan’s construction was a marvel of building skill, knowledge, and human labor. Workers toiled day and night under the direction of priests and nobles. They dug soil from the bottom of the lake to make causeways, or bridges of earth. These causeways linked the island and the shore. Elsewhere, they used earth to fill in parts of the lake, creating fields for growing crops.
Aztec Culture
The Aztec created a military empire. In the 1400s, the Aztec army conquered many neighboring communities. Conquered people had to pay tribute in food and other goods. Some were also forced to work as slaves in Aztec cities and villages.
Like Maya culture, Aztec culture revolved around its religious beliefs. The Aztec believed they must perform human sacrifices to please the gods and ensure abundant harvests. They sacrificed prisoners of war by the thousands for this purpose.
A
Great City Remembered The Aztec Empire was still going strong when Europeans arrived in the Americas in 1492. The first Europeans to see Tenochtitlan were awed by its splendor. In 1519 Hernan Cortes led 550 Spanish soldiers into the Aztec capital. Cortes wrote:

Spanish leaders eagerly made plans to explore the Americas and establish colonies.

The Great Inca Civilization
guidingquestion Why were the Inca considered a highly developed culture?
In the western highlands of South America, the largest of all early American civilizations grew—the Inca. The Inca people founded their capital city of Cuzco (KOOS*koh) around 1200.
In 1438 the emperor Pachacuti (PAH • chah • KOO • tee) came to the throne. He and his son, Topa Inca, expanded the empire by conquering others with their
powerful army. At its peak, the Inca Empire stretched for more than 3,000 miles (4,828 km), from present-day Colombia to northern Argentina and Chile.
This double-headed serpent is an Aztec wood carving covered in turquoise tiles. It may have been worn as a chest decoration during important occasions.

Fearsome Warriors
The Inca state was built around war. All men between 25 and 50 years old could be drafted to serve in the army for up to five years. Their weapons included clubs, spears, and spiked copper balls on ropes. Using slings, Inca soldiers could throw stones 30 yards (27 m).
Rather than fight this fearsome force, many neighboring areas accepted Inca rule. The Inca allowed those who cooperated to take part in the empire’s government. Those who resisted or rebelled faced harsh treatment.
Inca Culture
The Inca people believed their emperor was a descendant of the sun god. The Inca made magnificent gold jewelry and temple ornaments as gifts to the sun god. Inca workers also built great cities devoted to religious ceremonies, including Machu Picchu (MAH«choo PEE*choo), a site hidden high in the Andes.

Incas used quipus to track resources, such as food supplies. Different colors and lengths of string and different types of knots made up the system for recording important information.
Include this lesson's information in your Foldable®.
Supporting the large Inca population required a lot of food. In order to farm their mountainous lands, the Inca cut terraces, or broad platforms, into steep slopes. Stone walls on the terraces held the soil and plants in place. Inca farmers grew maize, squash, tomatoes, peanuts, chili peppers, cotton, and potatoes.
Managing and ruling over such a large territory was a great challenge. The Inca built at least 10,000 miles (16,093 km) of stone-paved roads to link distant parts of their empire.
The roads crisscrossed mountains, deserts,
and dense forests. To cross deep canyons or river valleys, the Inca built rope bridges. Runners carried messages from the emperor in Cuzco to outposts throughout the empire. The Inca language, Quechua (KEH • chuh • wuh), became the official language for the entire empire. The Inca had no written language, but they did develop a system of record-keeping using string called quipus (KEE • poos).
By knotting different colors of string in special patterns, the Inca used quipus to record and keep track of information about resources
Like the Aztec, the Inca were thriving in the early 1500s. They, too, would soon come face to face with Spanish soldiers and experience a dramatic change in fortunes.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
Early Native American groups of North America adapted to their environments.
Early North American Cultures
GUIDING question What did the Adena, Hopewell, Mississippian, Hohokam, and Ancient Puebloan cultures have in common?
As in Mexico, Central America, and South America, advanced cultures developed in parts of North America that are now the United States long before Europeans arrived in the 1500s. Among these cultures were the Adena, Hopewell, and Mississippians in the central and eastern regions of the present-day United States. The Hohokam and the Ancient Puebloans emerged in the southwestern region.
The Adena, Hopewell, and Mississippian Cultures
In central and eastern North America, prehistoric Native Americans built thousands of earthen mounds, or earthworks. The earthworks were not created by a single group, but by many different peoples. Scientists have sometimes referred to these different peoples together as the Mound Builders.
The ancient earthworks take many different forms. One famous example is in the shape of a serpent. Some resemble the pyramids of the Maya and the Aztec. Some contained burial chambers, and others were topped with temples. This seems to indicate that cultures of Mexico and Central America, such as the Maya and Aztec, may have influenced some of these cultures.
Archaeologists have classified these earthwork-building cultures into three groups: the Adena, Hopewell, and

Mississippian cultures. Modern-day scientists named the groups. No one knows what these early peoples called themselves.
The Adena were hunters and gatherers who lived in the Ohio River valley from about 800 b.c. to a.d. 100. The Hopewell people came later, between 200 b.c. and a.d. 500. The Hopewell were farmers and traders who built huge burial earthworks in the shapes of birds, bears, and snakes. Within these earthworks, archaeologists have discovered freshwater pearls, shells, cloth, and copper. These finds indicate that the Hopewell trade networks extended for hundreds of miles.
Cahokia
Sometime after a.d. 900, a people now called the Mississippians built the largest known earthworks complex in present-day Illinois. Later named Cahokia (kuh*HOH»kee«uh), the complex might have had 20,000 or more residents. Surrounded by farms and settlements, Cahokia became the center of Mississippian culture.
Cahokia appears to have resembled the ancient cities of Mexico. A great pyramid-shaped earthwork dominated Cahokia. Known as Monks Mound, it rose nearly 100 feet (30 m).
A temple crowned the summit of Monks Mound. A legend of the Natchez people, descendants of the Mississippians, hints at a direct link to Mexico:

« Before we came into this land, we lived yonder, under the sun. (thespeaker pointed toward Mexico]... Our entire nation extended along the great water [the Gulf of Mexico] where this great river (the River St. Louis) loses itself.«
—Natchez legend
As the Mississippian culture spread, it led to the rise of at least three other large cities: at present-day Etowa, Georgia; Moundsville, Alabama; and Spiro, Oklahoma. In the 1700s and 1800s, the sites of these ancient cities became cities of the United States.
The Hohokam
From about a.d. 200 to a.d. 1400, the Hohokam (hoh«hoh»KAHM) culture flourished in the dry, hot desert of present-day Arizona. As with the Adena, Hopewell, and Mississippian cultures, the name Hohokam was given to this culture in modern times.
As desert dwellers, the Hohokam were experts at maximizing their few sources of water. They irrigated (IHR»uh»gayt*uhd), or brought water to, their corn, cotton, and other crops by digging hundreds of miles of channels. The Hohokam also produced pottery, carved stone, and etched shells with acid. The shells serve as evidence of trade with coastal peoples.
The Ancient Puebloans
The Four Corners is the place where the modern-day states of Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico meet. It was in this region that the Ancient Puebloans (PWEH*bloh»uhnz) lived at about the same time as the Hohokam—from about a.d. 1 to

a.d. 1300. In the past, these people were called the Anasazi, but descendants of the Ancient Puebloans dislike that name.
The Ancient Puebloans built great stone dwellings that Spanish explorers later called pueblos (PWEH.blohs), or villages. Visitors to New Mexico today can still see one of the most spectacular of these ancient settlements, Pueblo Bonito. The huge structure was at least four stories high and had hundreds of rooms. Around Pueblo Bonito, archaeologists have found traces of a complex network of roads. These roads linked the pueblo with other villages. They suggest that Pueblo Bonito may have been a center for trade or religion.

The Ancient Puebloans also built dwellings in the walls of steep cliffs. Cliff dwellings were easy to defend and offered protection from winter weather. One of the largest cliff dwellings is Mesa Verde (MAY»suh VUHR«dee) in Colorado. This ancient, complex structure was home to several thousand people.
The Ancient Puebloans began leaving their pueblos and cliff dwellings for smaller communities in about 1300. They might have abandoned their large villages when drought, a long period of little rainfall, destroyed their crops.

While the Hohokam, the Ancient Puebloan, and the Adena, Hopewell, and Mississippian civilizations eventually faded away, other Native American cultures arose to take their place. In the time before European arrival in the late 1400s, many unique societies flourished throughout North America. Within different regions, different groups shared common features. These features reflected the conditions within each region.

Northern Peoples
A people called the Inuit (IH*noo»wuht) settled the frigid lands at the northernmost part of North America, near the Arctic Ocean. Some scientists believe the Inuit were the last migrants to come from Asia to North America.
The Inuit may have originally come from the Asian region of Siberia, bringing with them the skills needed to survive the cold climate. In the winter, the Inuit built igloos, low-lying structures of snow blocks, which protected them from severe weather.
The early Inuit were skilled hunters and fishers.
In the coastal waters, they hunted whales, seals, and walruses in small, skin-covered boats called kayaks.
On land they hunted caribou, large deer-like animals that live in the far North. The Inuit made warm, waterproof clothing from caribou skins and seal skins.
They burned seal oil in lamps.
Build Vocabulary: Word Origins
The words igloo and kayak are two examples of the many English-language words that come from Native American languages. Other examples include the words tomahawk, moose, and moccasin.
The Inuit people of the far North developed tools and techniques for living in a frozen and watery land.

Reading Strategy: Categorizing
Western Peoples
The western coast of North America has a mostly mild climate and dependable food sources. Such favorable conditions helped many native groups in this region thrive.
The Tlingit (TLIHNG.kuht), Haida (HY.duh), and Chinook (shuh.NUK) lived on the northwestern coast of North America in what are now Canada, southern Alaska, Washington, and Oregon. The cultures of this region depended on the forest and the sea for food and materials needed for living. Forests provided wood for houses and canoes as well as tree bark for making baskets and clothing. The rivers and coastal waters were filled with salmon, a main food source. Native Americans preserved salmon by smoking it over fires.
The area between the Cascade Mountains and the Rocky Mountains is known as the plateau region. There, the Nez Perce (NEHZ PUHRS) and Yakima (YAH.keh.muh) peoples also depended on the land, fishing the rivers, hunting deer in forests, and gathering roots and berries. The Native Americans of the plateau region lived in earthen houses.
Present-day California was home to a great variety of cultures. Along the northern coast, Native Americans fished for their food. In the central valley of California, the Porno (POH.moh) gathered acorns and pounded them
into flour. In the more barren southern deserts, nomadic groups collected roots and seeds.
Between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains lies the Great Basin region. There, the soil was too hard and rocky for farming. Thus, peoples such as the Ute (YOOT) and Shoshone (shuh.SHOHN) hunted and gathered small game, nuts, berries, roots, and some insects. They built temporary shelters from branches and reeds.

Southwestern Peoples
In the Southwest region, descendants of the Ancient Puebloans formed the Hopi (HOH.pee), the Acoma (uh.KOH.muh), the Zuni (ZOO.nee), and other groups. Farming was central to their cultures, with maize serving as their basic food source. They built their homes from dried mud bricks called adobe (uh.DOH.bee). They also used irrigation to grow beans, squash, melons, pumpkins, and fruit. Their trade network spread throughout the Southwest and into Mexico. Another group, the Jumano (JU.MAH.noh), were farmers as well as hunters and

gatherers. They traveled and traded throughout a territory that included Texas, New Mexico, and Northern Mexico.
The Apache (uh*PAH*chee) and the Navajo (NAH.vuh.hoh) settled in the Southwest region about 1,000 years ago. These new groups were primarily hunters and gatherers. In time, however, the Navajo settled in villages and built square houses called hogans. They also began to grow maize and beans, and they raised sheep as well.
Plains Peoples
The peoples of the Great Plains were nomadic. Their villages were temporary, lasting only for a growing season or two. The women planted maize, squash, and beans, while the men hunted antelope, deer, and buffalo. When the people moved from place to place, they dragged their homes—cone-shaped skin tents called tepees—behind them.
Buffalo were central to the lives of the people of the Plains. Native Americans used buffalo to supply many basic needs.
Buffalo meat was a good source of food, and people used the bones to make tools and weapons. Buffalo skins provided shelter and clothing.
After the Spanish introduced horses to Mexico in the 1500s, Native Americans captured and tamed the wild horses. The Comanche, the Dakota, and other Plains peoples became skilled riders. They hunted and fought on horseback, using spears, bows and arrows, and clubs while riding. The Great Plains, with its vast open grasslands, was well-suited to raising cattle. In the 1800s, ranchers moved rapidly into the region. Farmers on the Great Plains broke up the densely packed sod to grow crops.
Eastern Peoples
Complex societies existed in the woodlands of eastern North America. The people of the region relied on a combination of farming, hunting, and fishing. Farmers grew corn, beans, and squash.
Those who lived near water used hooks and nets to fish in the regions rivers and streams. A similar language connected the many Algonquian (al»GAHN»kwee»uhn) groups. The Cherokee (CHEHR»uh»kee) and Iroquois (IHR • uh • kwoy) had formal law codes and formed federations, agreements among different groups to join together.

Native American Languages
Many Native American groups still speak their native languages today, though the number of native-language speakers is small. It is estimated that approximately 150,000 people still speak Navajo (NAH*vuh«HO), while only about 2,000 still speak Cherokee.
For centuries, Native American groups of the Great Plains hunted buffalo. Native Americans often painted buffalo skins and made them into robes.

Lesson 3	69
The Iroquois lived in bark-covered longhouses. Each building could shelter several families.
The Iroquois lived in what is now northern New York State. The original five Iroquois groups were the Onondaga (ah*nuhn»DAW«guh), the Seneca (SEH*nih»kuh), the Mohawk (MOH«hawk), the Oneida (oh«NY«duh), and the Cayuga (kay«YOO«guh).
These groups often warred with each other. Then, in the 1500s, they established an alliance called the Iroquois League. According to tradition, Dekanawidah (deh»kah«nuh»WEE»duh), a tribal elder, and a chief of the Mohawk named Hiawatha (hi*uh*WAH*thuh) founded the league. They urged the Iroquois to unite in the spirit of friendship and peace.
The five nations agreed to the Great Binding Law, an oral constitution that defined how the league worked and established the Grand Council. This group of leaders met regularly to settle disputes among the various peoples.

Although Grand Council members were men, women played an important part in choosing delegates to the council.
The different members of the Iroquois League were organized according to clans, or groups of related families. The women in each clan chose a clan mother. These clan mothers then chose the male members of the Grand Council.
Southeastern Peoples
The Southeast was also a woodlands area, but with a warmer climate than the Eastern Woodlands. The Creek, Cherokee, and Chickasaw (CHIH»kuh»saw) lived in the Southeast. Farming was essential for each of these groups. In what is now Georgia and Alabama, the Creek lived in farming communities, growing corn, squash, tobacco, and other crops. The Cherokee farmed in the mountains of what is now Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas.
With soil and climate well suited for agriculture, the English colonists who settled the region in the 1600s and 1700s also farmed. Tobacco and cotton became important crops, as did indigo and rice. In northern Carolina, products used in shipbuilding were manufactured from pine trees.

The Story
Matters. ..
The year is 1492—a good year for Queen Isabella. After centuries of struggle, Catholic forces have driven the Muslims from Spain. She is grateful to God—and determined to use her power for God's glory.
Full of these thoughts, Isabella recalls a visit she received from a sailor named Christopher Columbus. He proposed finding a trade route to Asia by sailing west. She ignored him then. Now she decides to fund his voyage. She knows if Columbus succeeds, it will bring glory to God—and untold wealth to Spain. The European exploration ofthe Americas is about to begin.

New Ideas, New Nations
GUIDING question Where did the Renaissance take place?
For centuries after the Roman Empire fell in a.d. 476, the people of Western Europe were cut off from the rest of the work!. Western Europe was made up of small kingdoms and city-states dominated by the Catholic Church. Then, in the early a.d. 6()()s, a new religion, Islam, began to spread rapidly in the Middle East and Africa. This rise of Islam would soon end Western Europe’s isolation.
In 1095 the Europeans launched the first of nine expeditions, known as the Crusades. Their purpose was to take hack control of Christian holy sites in the Middle East from the Muslims-followers of Islam. The Crusades also had an unplanned result. In the Middle East, Europeans met Arab merchants, who sold them spices, sugar, silk, and other goods from China and India. European interest in Asia grew.
That interest grew even more after Italian explorer Marco Polo returned from China. In the late 1200s, Polo wrote about Asias people, great riches, and splendid cities in his book, Truvcls which was widely read in Europe. Two hundred years later, his Travels would inspire another Italian explorer-Christopher Columbus.

The Growth of Trade
Merchants in Europe knew they could make a lot of money selling goods from Asia. Wealthy Europeans were eager to buy Asian spices, perfumes, silks, and precious stones.
Merchants first bought these goods from Arab traders in the Middle East. The merchants then sent the goods overland by caravan to the Mediterranean Sea. From there, the goods traveled by ship to Italian ports in Venice, Genoa, and Pisa. These cities prospered as centers of the growing trade. However, Arab traders charged high prices. This led Europeans to look for a route to the East that would not require them to buy from Arab merchants. The Growth of Ideas
By the 1300s, several Italian city-states had become strong economic and cultural centers. Their influence spread across Europe. Newly powerful bankers and merchants in Pisa, Venice, and Genoa studied classical works—those of ancient Greece and Rome.
Science was another area in which change occurred. Many scholars tested new and old theories of science. They performed experiments and evaluated the results.
Caravans, or groups of travelers, from Asia carried silks and spices overland to markets in the West. At the shores ofthe Mediterranean and Black Seas, the goods were loaded onto ships and transported to Europe.

The arts were also influenced by classical forms and new ideas. Authors wrote about the individual s place in the universe. Artists studied classical sculpture and architecture. They admired the harmony and balance in Greek art.
The Renaissance
This period of intellectual and artistic creativity is known as the Renaissance (reh.nuh.SAHNS). The word renaissance means “rebirth” in French. It refers to the rebirth of interest in classical Greek and Roman ideas. As the Renaissance spread across Europe over the next two centuries, it changed the way Europeans thought about themselves and the world. It also set the stage for an age of exploration and discovery.
The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci, is a masterpiece of the Renaissance. From what we know, the portrait features a woman from Florence who was 24 years old when da Vinci began the painting.

The Rise of Powerful Nations
For centuries, Europe had been a patchwork of small states. By the 1400s, however, a new, larger type of state had developed in Western Europe. Strong monarchs rose to power in Spain,
Portugal, England, and France. They began to establish national laws, courts, taxes, and armies to replace those of the local rulers. These ambitious monarchs sought ways to increase trade and make their countries even stronger and wealthier.
As early as the mid-1400s, powerful countries such as Portugal and Spain began to search for sea routes to Asia. They, too, wanted to engage in foreign trade. This placed them in direct competition with the Italian port cities that had become so powerful a century earlier. As a result, a new era of exploration began.

CRITICAL THINKING
Making Connections What tools might sailors use to find their position at sea today?
Polo’s Travels when it appeared in printed form in 1477. This book gave people descriptions of faraway places, such as areas that are now Iraq, Siberia, Japan, India, Ethiopia, and Madagascar. Whether the descriptions were entirely accurate is open to debate. However, Polo’s Travels led European readers to realize that there were many spectacular sights beyond their immediate world. Better Maps and Instruments
Most early maps were not accurate. This was because they were drawn based on the points of view of traders and travelers.
Little by little, cartographers, or mapmakers, improved their accuracy. Using reports of explorers and information from Arab and Chinese scholars and astronomers, mapmakers made more accurate land and sea maps. These maps showed the directions of ocean currents. They also showed lines of latitude, which measured distances north and south of the Equator.
People also improved instruments for navigating the seas. Sailors could find their latitude with an astrolabe (AS»truh»layb), which measured the positions of stars. In the 1200s, Europeans acquired the magnetic compass from China. The compass allowed sailors to accurately determine their direction.
Better Ship Design
Advances in ship design allowed sailors to make long ocean voyages. The stern rudder and triangular sail enabled ships to sail into the wind. The Portuguese three-masted caravel (KER«uh»vehl) became the most famous ship of the European age of exploration. Caravels could sail faster and carry more cargo and supplies than earlier ships.

guiding question What were the most powerful empires in Africa?
Between a.d. 400 and 1600, powerful kingdoms and city-states flourished in Africa south of the Sahara. Much ol their power and wealth came from mining and trade.
Arab traders traveled Africa’s east coast exchanging cotton, silk, and porcelain for African ivory and metals. West Africans mined and traded gold, copper, and iron ore. 1’rade with North Africa’s Islamic societies brought wealth and Islamic customs to the West African kingdoms. The kingdoms also traded directly with Europe. The Portuguese set up trading posts along Africa’s western coast in the mid-1400s.

Ghana—A Trading Empire
Between a.d. 400 and 1100, a vast trading empire known as Ghana emerged in West Africa. Ghana grew wealthy from the taxes it placed on trade. Caravans carrying gold, ivory, and enslaved people crossed the desert to North Africa and returned with salt, cloth, and brass. Such trading contacts led many West Africans to become Muslim.

In 1076 North African people called Almoravids (al»muh»RAH»vihdz) attacked Ghana, disrupting the trade routes in the region. Soon new trade routes bypassed Ghana altogether. The drop in trade led to Ghana’s decline, and new kingdoms emerged in the region.
Mali—Wealth and Power
Mali, one of the new kingdoms, grew very powerful. Mali developed trade routes across the desert to North Africa. By the late 1200s, Mali’s territory was huge. One traveler reported that it took four months to cross it from north to south.
In 1324 Mali’s great king, Mansa Musa, a Muslim, traveled to the Muslim holy city of Makkah (Mecca) in what is now Saudi Arabia. He returned from this religious journey, or pilgrimage (PIHL»gruh»mihj), with an Arab architect. The architect built great mosques (MAHSKS), Muslim houses of worship, in Timbuktu, Mali’s capital. Timbuktu became a center of Islamic art and learning.
The Songhai Empire
In time, the Songhai (sawng»GEYE) people, who lived along the Niger River, overthrew Mali rule. They captured Timbuktu in 1468. Askiya Muhammad, leader of the Songhai Empire, divided Songhai into provinces, each with its own officials. Everyone in the empire followed a legal system based on the teachings of Islam. In the late 1500s, North Africa’s kingdom of Morocco defeated—and ended—the Songhai Empire.

guidingquestion Which country took the lead in finding a trade route to India?

Reading HELPDESK
In 1492 Christopher Columbus led 90 sailors in three ships on a voyage into the unknown. As the voyage dragged on, the sailors grew angry. Columbus wrote: “I am told ... that if I persist in going onward, the best course of action will be to throw me into the sea some night.” Before that could happen, a lookout from the ship Pinta made the signal that he had spotted land. On October 12, 1492, Columbus left his ship, the Santa Maria, and went ashore.
Columbus believed he had arrived in the Indies—islands located southeast of China. Actually, he had reached North America. How did Columbus get it so wrong? The maps that he and other European explorers used at the time did not include the Americas because no one in Europe knew they existed. All maps showed three continents—Europe, Asia, and Africa-merged into a huge landmass and bordered by oceans. Some explorers thought that the Western (Atlantic) and Eastern (Pacific) Oceans ran together to form what they called the
Ocean Sea. No one realized the true size of the oceans or the existence of other continents.

Columbus was sailing on behalf of Spain, but Portugal was the first European power to explore the boundaries of the known world by sea. Unlike Spain, Portugal did not have a port on the Mediterranean Sea. This meant the Portuguese could not use the existing trade routes between Asia and Europe. Portugal’s rulers wanted to find a new route to China and India.
The Portuguese also knew about the great riches in the West African kingdoms. These riches were carried by caravan across the desert to North Africa and then by ship across the Mediterranean. Portuguese traders needed a better route so that they, too, could get West African gold and other riches.
The Beginning of Portuguese Exploration
Portugal’s Prince Henry laid the groundwork for the era of exploration. In about 1420, he set up a center for exploration at Sagres (SAW»grish) on the southwestern tip of Portugal, “where endeth land and where beginneth sea.”
Known as Henry the Navigator, the prince never intended to become an explorer himself. Instead, he planned the voyages and then analyzed the reports that his crews brought home.
At Sagres, Prince Henry set up a school of navigation. There, astronomers, geographers, and mathematicians came to share their knowledge with Portuguese sailors, shipbuilders, and mapmakers. As each successful voyage brought back new information, Henry’s expert mapmakers updated the charts.
Portuguese ships sailed south along the coast of West Africa. As they went south, they traded for gold and ivory and set up trading posts in the region. Because of its abundance of gold, Africa’s west coast came to be known as the “Gold Coast.” In the mid-1400s, Portuguese traders began to buy enslaved Africans there as well.
King John II of Portugal launched new efforts to create a Portuguese trading empire in Asia. All the Portuguese had to do was find a sea route around Africa. If they succeeded, they would be able to trade directly with India and China. They could bypass the North African and Asian caravans and Mediterranean merchants. With that goal in mind, in the 1480s King John urged Portuguese sea captains to explore farther south along the African coast.

Bartolomeu Dias
In 1487 Bartolomeu Dias set out from Lisbon with two small caravels and a supply ship. King John had sent Dias to explore the southernmost part of Africa. From there, Dias was to sail northeast into the Indian Ocean. This expedition included some of Portugal’s best pilots.
They sailed for days, staying close to the coast ot Africa. After passing the mouth of the Orange River in South Africa, the expedition met with a fierce storm that carried it southward, off course and out of sight of land. When the winds linally died down, Dias steered east and then north until he found land again. Excitedly, Dias realized that he had already sailed past the southernmost part of Africa. On the way, he had passed a landform called a cape, a piece of land that juts into the water.
Dias set a course back to Portugal. On the return journey, after passing that piece of land again, he wrote that he had been around the “Cape of Storms.” King John renamed it the "Cape of Good Hope.” The king hoped that the passage around Africa might provide a new route to India.
Vasco da Gama

African coast as Dias’s ships had. Instead, they sailed in a wide arc south and west of Africa. They were out of sight of land for more than three months. The purpose of this detour was to reach ocean currents that would help the sailors travel safely around the Cape of Good Hope.
After rounding the cape on November 22, da Gama was on Africa’s eastern coast. He made many stops, including one at Mombasa (mahm»BAH«suh), part of present-day Kenya. There, he met a pilot from India who guided him the rest of the way.
Da Gama reached the port of Calicut, in India, in May 1498. Portugal’s long-held dream of a sea route to Asia was now a reality. Portugal's Trading Empire
Events moved quickly. Within six months of da Gama’s return to Portugal, 13 ships set sail out of Lisbon and headed for India. The ships were commanded by a nobleman, Pedro Alvares Cabral (PEH»droo AWL»vuh*ruhsh kuh»BRAWL).
Cabral planned to follow da Gama’s westward-then-southward course. Instead, he went so far west that he reached Brazil. Cabral claimed Brazil for his king and sent one of the ships back to Portugal with the good news that Portugal now had a foothold in the Americas.
Cabral then continued to India and returned with spices, porcelain, and other valuable cargo. Other Portuguese fleets soon made the journey to India, where Portugal set up permanent forts. Portuguese fleets began to make yearly voyages to India. Their cargoes made the Portuguese capital of Lisbon the marketplace of Europe.

Born in Genoa, Italy, in 1451, Christopher Columbus became a sailor for Portugal. He traveled as far north as the Arctic Circle and as far south as Africa’s Gold Coast. To reach Asia, Christopher Columbus had a different route in mind than the one used by his Portuguese comrades. He planned to sail west.
In the 1400s, most educated people believed the world was round. People were less certain about Earth’s size. Columbus was among those who based their estimates on the works of Ptolemy (TAHL*uh» mee), an ancient Greek astronomer. Columbus believed Asia was about 2,760 miles (4,441 km) from Portugal—a voyage of about two months by ship. However, Ptolemy had underestimated Earth’s size and, by using Ptolemy s estimate, Columbus did, too.

Vikings in North America
Several centuries before the voyages of da Gama, Cabral, and Columbus, northern Europeans, known as Vikings or Norsemen, had sailed to North America. They sailed from present-day Scandinavia to Iceland and Greenland in the 800s and 900s, and established settlements there for a brief period of time. According to Norse sagas, or traditional stories, a Viking sailor named Leif Eriksson explored lands west of Greenland in about the year 1000. The sagas refer to this land as “Vinland.” Ruins from around that period exist in northeastern Canada, which could support the sagas. The Vikings’ voyages were not well known throughout Europe, however. Other Europeans did not “discover” the Americas until Columbus made his historic voyage.
Columbus and Queen Isabella
Columbus had a plan for reaching Asia, but he still needed money to finance his expedition. He visited European monarchs, looking for support. Finally, he found a sponsor in Spain.
For most of the 1400s, Spanish monarchs devoted, or committed, their energy to driving the Muslims out of Spain. Muslims had invaded Spain in the 700s, but their power had been declining for centuries. The last Muslim kingdom in Spain

fell in 1492. This freed Spain’s monarchs to focus on other goals. The Spanish observed the seafaring and trading successes of neighboring Portugal with envy. They, too, wanted the riches of Asian trade.
King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain agreed to support Columbus’s expedition for two reasons. One reason was that Columbus promised to bring Christianity to any lands he found. This was important to Isabella because she was a devout Catholic. Another reason was that if he succeeded in finding a route to Asia, Spain would become wealthy from trade with that region. Queen Isabella promised Columbus a share of any riches gained from lands he discovered on his way to Asia.
Columbus's First Voyage
On August 3,1492, Columbus set sail from Palos, Spain. He had two small ships, the Nina and the Pinta, and a larger one, the Santa Maria. Columbus was captain of the Santa Maria, his lead ship, or flagship. The three ships carried about 90 sailors and a six-month supply of food and water.
The small fleet stopped at the Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa for repairs and supplies. Columbus then began the difficult voyage westward across unknown and mysterious stretches of the Atlantic Ocean.
After a few weeks at sea, the sailors grew nervous about the distance they had traveled. Columbus refused to alter his course. Instead, he encouraged the crew by describing the riches he believed they would find. He urged them on, saying that “with the help of our Lord” they would arrive in the Indies.
On October 12,1492, at two o’clock in the morning, a lookout shouted, “Tierra! Tierra!” “Land! Land!” He had spotted a small island in the chain now called the Bahamas. Columbus went ashore, claimed the island for Spain, and named it “San Salvador.” Although he did not know it, Columbus had reached the Americas.
Columbus believed he had arrived in the East Indies, the islands off the coast of Asia. This is why today we call the Caribbean Islands “the West Indies.” It also explains why Columbus called the local people “Indians.” He noted that the natives regarded the Europeans with wonder and often touched the crew members to find out “if they were flesh and bones like themselves.”
When Columbus returned to Spain, Queen Isabella and the Spanish king, Ferdinand, received him with great honor. They made him Admiral of the Ocean Sea and agreed to provide funds for his future voyages.
BIOGRAPHY
Queen Isabella (1451-1504)
Queen Isabella was a Catholic of strong faith. She insisted Columbus treat Native Americans fairly and ordered him to release several enslaved Native Americans he brought to Spain. Isabella hoped to convert the Native Americans to Christianity. She also wanted their labor. She ordered that the Native Americans be forced "to work on... buildings, to mine and collect gold... and to work on... farms and crop fields."
Christopher Columbus (1451-1506)
Columbus proved himself to be a great navigator and sailor. He believed he would discover great riches and new lands. He also knew he could win rich rewards for himself. Columbus wrote in 1492: "Your Highnesses commanded me... [to] go to...
India, and for this accorded me great rewards and ennobled me [raised me to the rank of nobility]."

Columbus's Achievements
Columbus made three more voyages for Spain, in 1493, 1498, and 1502. He explored the Caribbean islands of Hispaniola (present-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Cuba, and Jamaica. He also sailed along the coasts of Central America and northern South America. He claimed these lands for Spain and started settlements. He also mapped the eastern coastline of Central America.
Columbus had not reached Asia but instead had found a part of the world that was unknown to Europeans, Asians, and Africans. In the years that followed, the Spanish went on to explore most of the Caribbean and to establish the Spanish Empire in the Americas.
Dividing the Americas
Both Spain and Portugal wanted to protect their claims in the Americas. They turned to Pope Alexander VI for help. In 1493 he ordered a line of demarcation, an imaginary line that reached from the North Pole to the South Pole and cut through the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Spain was to control all lands west of the line, and Portugal would control all lands east of the line.

circumnavigate to travel completely around something, usually by water

Exploring the Americas
Portugal objected, saying that the division gave more land to Spain. In 1494 the two countries signed an agreement called the Treaty of Tordesillas (tohr«daySEE*yuhs), which moved the line farther west. The two countries had divided the entire unexplored world between themselves.
Further Explorations
After Columbus, other voyagers explored the Americas. In 1499 Italian Amerigo Vespucci (veh«SPOO«chee) led a voyage funded by Spain. On this and a later journey for Portugal, he explored the coast of South America. Vespucci realized South America was a separate continent and not part of Asia. European geographers began to call the continent “America” in his honor.
A
Spaniard, Vasco Nunez de Balboa (bal»BOH«uh), heard stories of the “great waters” beyond the mountains of Panama, in Central America. He hiked through steamy rain forests to find them. At the coast in 1513, Balboa saw a vast body of water, which he claimed for Spain along with the adjoining lands. Balboa was the first European to see the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. Sailing Around the World
In 1520 Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer who was sailing for Spain, reached the southernmost tip of South America. He sailed through the stormy waters of a narrow sea passage, or strait. The strait led him into a calm ocean—the same one Balboa had seen. The waters were so peaceful—pacifico in Spanish—that
s Magellan named the ocean the Pacific Ocean. Magellan died in I the Philippine Islands, but his crew continued to sail westward,

It matters because
Spanish explorers in the Americas conquered people and searched for gold. Spain became richer, while many Native Americans suffered from harsh treatment at the hands of the Spaniards.
European Explorers and
Conquerors
guiding question What were the goals of early Spanish explorers?
When Spanish explorers reached the Americas, natives told tales of gold, silver, and kingdoms wealthy beyond belief. 'I he Spanish listened eagerly, and they traveled far and wide in search of these riches.
These explorers, known as conquistadors (kahn*KEES«tah» dohrz), got encouragement from Spanish rulers. The rulers gave conquistadors the right to explore and create settlements in the Americas. In return, the conquistadors agreed to give Spain one-fifth of any treasure they found. This deal allowed Spanish rulers to explore the Americas with little risk. If a conquistador failed, he lost his own fortune. If he succeeded, both he and Spain gained wealth and glory.
The Conquest of Mexico and Peru
Although many of the tales of gold and riches proved to be false, some were true. Two wealthy empires—the Aztec in what is no" Mexico and Central America and the Inca in South America-were among the richest prizes the conquistadors claimed.
In 1519 Hernan Cortes landed on the east coast of present-day ^TkinklUi UKe a -Mexico. Within two years, Cortes conquered the Aztec Empire	t t t CT""Y|T? T A IVT

Cortes and Spain wealthy.
Cortes’s success encouraged other conquistadors. Twelve years after the Aztec conquest, Francisco Pizarro led an army into the Inca capital in Cuzco, in present-day Peru. The Spanish arrested and later executed the Inca ruler. Without their leader, the Inca were not able to fight effectively. Pizarro soon controlled most of the vast and wealthy Inca Empire.
Why Spain Won
The conquistadors’ victories over the Aztec and Inca were quick and lasting. How did Cortes and Pizarro conquer such mighty empires with their small forces?
First, the Spanish had weapons and animals the Aztec and Inca had never seen. The Spanish had guns and cannons.
They rode horses and had huge, ferocious dogs. To the Native Americans, the Spanish seemed almost like gods. One Aztec recalled the fear that spread at the soldiers’ approach: “[TJheir weapons clashed and rattled.... [T]hey terrified everyone who saw them.” Cortes received help from some native people who disliked their harsh rulers and were happy to help overthrow them. Finally, disease played a large role. For
many native groups, contact with the Europeans was deadly. With no immunity, or resistance, to European diseases, the Aztec and the Inca suffered terrible epidemics. Illnesses weakened them in their struggle against the Spanish.

Spain in North America
guiding question What did Spain hope to find in the Americas?
Mexico and Peru were lands rich in silver and gold. Hoping to find similar wealth to the north, conquistadors explored the southeastern and southwestern parts of what is today the United States.

Analyzing Primary Sources
In 1519 Hernan Cortes prepared to leave Cuba for Mexico with 11 ships carrying about 550 Spanish soldiers and 16 horses. Before setting off, Cortes said to his men:
PRIMARY SOURCE
“I know in my heart that we shall take vast and wealthy lands, people such as have never before been seen.... If you do not abandon me, as I shall not abandon you, I shall make you in a very short time the richest of all men who have crossed the seas.”

Juan Ponce de Leon (pahn-suh day lee.OHN) made the first Spanish landing on the east coast of present-day Florida in 1513. According to legend, Ponce de Leon was not looking only for gold. He also hoped to find the legendary fountain of youth. This had been described by a historian of that time as a spring of running water of such marvelous virtue that drinking it makes old men young again.” Ponce de Leon s exploration led to the first Spanish settlement in what is now the United States a fort the Spanish built at St. Augustine, Florida, in 1565.
The Seven Cities of Gold
Still other conquistadors searched for quick riches, and several lost their lives in the process. Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca (cuh.BAY.suh duh VAH*cuh) was part of a Spanish expedition to Florida in 1528. After coming into conflict with Native Americans in Florida, the expedition sailed south toward Mexico in November, led by Panfilo de Narvaez (nahr«VAH*ays). Three of its five boats were lost in a storm.
The two boats that made it through the storm became stuck on a beach on an island near present-day Texas. Within a few months, only a handful of the Spanish explorers were still alive. To survive among the Native Americans, de Vaca and an enslaved African named Estevanico (es«TAY»vahn»EE»koh) persuaded the Native Americans that they had healing powers. Cabeza de Vaca later wrote that their method of healing was “to bless the sick, breathing upon them,” and to recite Latin prayers.
In 1533 the Spaniards set off on a long trek across the Southwest. While traveling, they often heard stories about seven rich cities in the region. When Cabeza de Vaca finally arrived in Mexico in 1536, he told eager listeners about the “Seven Cities of Cibola”—seven cities of gold.
De Soto Searches for Gold
Excited by these stories, Hernando de Soto led an expedition to explore Florida and what is today the southeastern United States. For three years they traveled, following stories of gold. Their encounters with the native people often turned violent.
«De Soto crossed the Mississippi River in 1541, describing it as “swift, and very deep.” After traveling as far west as present-
ay Oklahoma, de Soto died of fever. His men buried him in the waters of the Mississippi.

Life Under Spanish Rule
The Granger Collection, NYC
GUIDING QUESTION
What effect did Spanish rule have on society? Spanish law set up three kinds of settlements in the Americas— pueblos, missions, and presidios. Pueblos, or towns, were centers of trade. Missions were religious communities. They included a church, a small town, and fields for crops. A presidio was a type of fort and was usually built near a mission.
Juan de Onate (day ohn«YAH«tay) traveled up from Mexico to establish a Spanish presence in the lands to the north. He was also assigned to convert the native people to Christianity.

Lesson 3	95
Mission Nuestra Senora de la Purisima Concepcion de Acuna, located in San Antonio, Texas, was dedicated in 1755 after 20 years of construction. All missions had the same basic plan and were located near wood, water, and land for farming and grazing. There was a church, housing for the priests and Native American converts, grain fields with irrigation ditches, and corrals for cattle, sheep, and goats.
Reading HELPDESK
In 1598 Onate founded, or established, the province of New Mexico. He introduced cattle and horses to the Pueblo people. The first Spanish city in the southwest, Santa he, was established in 1607. Santa Fe became the capital of the province in 1610
Spanish Colonial Society
There was a very clear class system in Spanish colonial society. The highest level of society was made up of the penbisulares, people who were born in Spain. They were the landowners, leaders of government, and heads of the Catholic Church. Next in rank were the Creoles, people born in the Americas whose parents were Spanish. The next level below were the mestizos (meh«STEE«zohs), people with one Spanish and one Native American parent. Still lower were the Native Americans, most of whom lived in great poverty, and enslaved Africans.
The Spanish government granted conquistadors who settled in the Americas the right to demand either taxes or labor from Native Americans living on the land. This system forced the Native Americans into a form of slavery.
For example, in the 1540s, when the Spanish discovered silver ore in northern Mexico, they set up mining camps. They then forced Native Americans to dig for silver. The damp mineshafts were a grueling environment in which to work. Many Native Americans died there from malnutrition and disease.

A
Spanish priest, Bartolome de Las Casas, spoke out against such cruel treatment of Native Americans and pleaded for laws to protect them. He claimed that millions had died because the Spanish “made gold their ultimate aim, seeking to load themselves with riches in the shortest possible time.” Las Casas’s reports convinced Spanish leaders to pass the New Laws in 1542. These laws forbade enslaving Native Americans. Unfortunately, the laws were not always enforced. The Plantation System
Not all Spaniards sought gold. Some found wealth shipping crops to Spain. In the West Indies, key exports were tobacco and sugarcane. The Spanish developed the plantation system to raise these crops. A plantation is a large farm.
The Spanish first used Native American labor to work their plantations. Las Casas suggested that they be replaced by enslaved Africans—a suggestion he bitterly regretted later. As a result, thousands of enslaved Africans were brought from West Africa to the Americas. Those who survived the brutal voyage were sold to plantation owners. By the late 1500s, slave labor was an essential part of the economy of the colonies.

Our Spanish Heritage
Spanish influence in the United States is strong. Many Spanish words have been incorporated into the language, such as “fiesta” and “canyon.” The Spanish, who were expert ranchers, introduced animals such as horses, sheep, pigs, and beef cattle into the American Southwest. Many place names in the United States today are Spanish in origin. Some examples in the text are Santa Fe and California. Can you think of any others?

Spanish Settlement in the Southwest
In the 1600s and 1700s, the Spanish, with much help from Native Americans, settled the Southwest, including present-day
New Mexico, Texas, and California.
The Spanish explorer Juan Cabrillo (kuh.BREE.yoh) first
sighted what is now California in 1542. However, for 200 years the Spanish had left the area alone. Around 1769, that policy changed. California was the northern frontier of the Spanish Empire in North America, and Spain needed a large number of colonists to solidify its hold on the region. Spain also wanted to convert more Native Americans to Christianity.
Spanish settlement in California consisted mostly of mission building. The Spaniards trained Native Americans who lived on the mission to be farmers. They learned how to grow crops, irrigate farmland, and perform other tasks usually carried out on a ranch. Eventually, the missions became economically profitable enough to sell some of their goods, such as wine, olive oil, and leather.
Effect on Native American Life
California’s many Native American groups had well-ordered societies before the Spanish arrived. They' hunted, fished, and gathered plants for food. The arrival of the Spanish disrupted this way of life. The Spanish forced native peoples to convert to Christianity and to live and work at the missions.

guidingquestion M/ftflf were the religious motives behind the A ge of Exploration?
The Europeans who explored and settled in North America in the 1500s sought wealth. They also wanted to spread their Christian faith. The first to arrive were Roman Catholics—the only Christian church in the western part of Europe at that time. Not long after Columbus made his first voyage across the Atlantic, however, religious conflict shook Europe. New rivalries based on religious beliefs emerged.
Luther and the Reformation
In 1517 a German priest named Martin Luther nailed a list of complaints on the door of a local Catholic church, questioning the power and authority of Catholic leaders—including the pope, the head of the Catholic Church. Luther hoped to spark reform within the Church, but Pope Leo X rejected his ideas. Others agreed with Luther. His ideas helped launch a movement called the Reformation (reh«fuhr«MAY»shuhn). The movement led to a new form of Christianity called Protestantism (PRAH*tuhs«tuhn«tih»zuhm). Among the differences between Protestants and Catholics was that Protestants did not accept the leadership of the pope. The Reformation led to widespread conflict within and between the nations of Europe.

In 1639 a French woman named Marie Guyard, or Marie of the Incarnation, arrived in Quebec, Frances first colony. Later, she wrote religious books in the languages of the native peoples she met there. In a letter, Guyard wrote:

“You will perhaps laugh that at the age of fifty years I am beginning to study a new tongue [language], but one must undertake all things for the service of God and the salvation of ones neighbour.”
—from Word From New France, by Marie Guyard
Religious Rivalry in Europe
In 1533 the English king, Henry VIII, left the Catholic Church. Later, during the rule of his daughter Elizabeth I, further reforms established England as a Protestant nation. At that time, it was common for kings and queens to insist that their subjects follow their religion. Subjects who did not could lose their lands and fortunes. In England, many people were unhappy about leaving the Catholic Church, but they had little power to resist.
England’s Protestantism caused conflict with Spain. Beginning in 1585, King Philip of Spain made plans to invade England. A successful invasion could mean the overthrow of Protestantism. In May 1588, Philip sent an armada (ahr.MAH.duh), or war fleet, of 132 ships to England. With 30,000 troops and more than 2,000 guns, the Spanish Armada was the mightiest naval force in the world. Yet the smaller, faster English ships quickly gained the upper hand.
The defeat of Spain’s armada marked the end of Spanish control of the seas. Now the way was clear for the English to start colonies in North America.
From her letter, what do you know about the person and character of Marie Guyard?
Religious Rivalries in the Americas
Catholics from Spain and France worked to spread their faith among the Native Americans. The Spanish settled in the southwestern and southeastern regions of North America, and the French settled in the northeast. Dutch and English Protestants set up colonies along the Atlantic coast between the French and the Spanish settlements. Religious differences contributed to the rivalries between these settlements.

Search for a Northwest Passage
In the 1500s and early 1600s, England, France, and the Netherlands sent explorers to map the coast of North America and, later, establish trade and colonies. Explorers also hoped to discover a Northwest Passage to Asia, a direct water route through the Americas.
England sent John Cabot, an Italian, to look for a northern sea route to Asia in 1497. Cabot probably landed on the coast of present-day Newfoundland. In 1524 France hired another Italian, Giovanni de Verrazano, to look for a northern route. Verrazano explored the coast of North America from present-day Nova Scotia down to the Carolinas.

In 1609 Henry Hudson and his crew landed on the shores of Delaware Bay. The native people offered goods for trade.
In 1535 French explorer Jacques Cartier (kahr«tee«AY) sailed up the St. Lawrence River, hoping it would lead to the Pacific. Cartier did not make it to the Pacific, but he discovered a mountain peak that he named Mont-Royal, which means “royal mountain.” This is the site of the present-day city of Montreal.
The Netherlands also wanted to find a passage through the Americas. The Dutch hired English sea explorer and navigator Henry Hudson to look for it. In 1609 he discovered the river that now bears his name. In his ship, the Half Moon, Hudson sailed north on the Hudson River as far as the site of present-day Albany, New York. Deciding that he had not found a passage to India, he turned back.
The following year England sent Hudson to try again. On this trip, Hudson discovered a huge bay—now called Hudson Bay. Thinking he had reached the Pacific, Hudson spent months looking for an outlet. His crew became impatient and rebelled. They set Hudson, his son, and a few sailors adrift in a small boat, never to be seen again.

In 1682 Robert Cavelier de La Salle followed the Mississippi all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. He claimed the region for France, calling it Louisiana in honor of Louis XIV. In 1718 the French founded New Orleans. French explorers and missionaries traveled west to the Rocky Mountains and the Rio Grande.

New France and New Netherland
French settlement in North America advanced slowly. New France was made up of estates along the St. Lawrence River.
Estate holders brought in settlers in exchange for land. These settlers became tenant farmers (TEH*nuhnt), who paid rent and worked for their lord for a set period each year.
The French got along well with the Native Americans. French trappers and missionaries lived among them, learned their languages, and respected their ways. The missionaries had come to convert Native Americans to Catholicism, but they did not try to change their customs. Because the French colony grew slowly, it did not seem to pose a threat to the Native Americans and their lands.
The Netherlands was a small country with few natural resources and limited farmland. This is why the Dutch were eager to set up a North American colony. After Hudson’s voyage in 1609, the Dutch began to explore North America.
The Netherlands also had a large fleet of trading ships that sailed all over the world. In 1621 the Netherlands created the Dutch West
India Company to run its trade between the Americas and Africa.
In 1623 the company took over control of the Dutch colony in North America, called “New Netherland.”
The heart of the colony was New Amsterdam. The town was built on the tip of Manhattan Island. In 1626 governor	y

In 1733 publisher John Peter Zenger, in his newspaper the New-York Weekly Journal, accused New York’s governor of corruption. For criticizing the governor, officials charged Zenger with a crime and threw him in jail. Zenger argued that the statements he had published about the governor were true. Therefore, he claimed, he had the right to publish them. Zenger’s lawyer, Andrew Hamilton, made a stirring defense:
PRIMARY SOURCE
John Peter Zenger's newspaper, the New-York Weekly Journal, was the battleground in an early case about freedom ofthe press.
civic virtue the democratic ideas, practices, and values that are at the heart of citizenship in a free society

66 The loss of liberty in general would soon follow the suppression ofthe liberty ofthe press; for it is an essential branch of liberty, so perhaps it is the best preservative ofthe whole. 99
—from The Trial of John Peter Zenger and the Birth of Freedom ofthe Press, by Doug Linder
The jury found Zenger not guilty. The case is seen as a key step in the development of a free press in this country.
Civic Virtue
Colonists were beginning to form new ideas of freedom.
They began thinking in terms of civic virtue (SNvihk VUHR.choo)—democratic ideas, practices, and values that form a truly free society. De Crevecoeur was writing about these ideals when he described the spirit ofthe new American. Benjamin Franklin was a shining example of civic virtue at its best. Colonists would soon put their belief in civic virtue into action. These ideas and actions would become the building blocks of a new nation.

Rivalry Between the French and the British
guidingquestion Howdid competition for land in North America lead to the French and Indian War?
In the 1700s, Britain and France were leading European powers. They competed for wealth and empire in different parts of the world. In North America, their rivalry was very strong.
This rivalry turned especially bitter in the mid-1700s. The British began to show interest in the Ohio River valley. This vast land beyond the Appalachian Mountains was rich in resources. The British believed they had a right to this land. The French also viewed the valley as theirs. The French enjoyed a thriving fur trade with the Native Americans of the region. They did not want to share this business with British settlers.
To protect their claims in the valley, the French built a chain of forts from Lake Ontario south to the Ohio River. The British responded by starting to build a fort in what is now western Pennsylvania. Before they could finish, the French seized the site. On it, they built their own fort, calling it Fort Duquesne
Lesson 4 151
Although Washington suffered defeat at Fort Necessity, the colonists viewed him as the hero who had struck the first blow against the French.
In spring 1754, the governor of Virginia sent a militia (muh»LIH»shuh)—a military force made up of ordinary citizens—to drive out the French. Leading this force was a young Virginian. His name was George Washington.
After marching to Fort Duquesne, Washington set up a small fort of his own nearby. He called it Fort Necessity.
Washington’s outpost soon came under attack by the French and their Native American allies. This combined army won the battle and forced Washington’s soldiers to surrender. The French later released the soldiers, who returned to Virginia.

Reading HELPDESK
As the conflict got under way, the French and the British both sought Native American help. The French had a big advantage. They already had many Native American allies. Native Americans generally distrusted the British and their hunger tor land. In contrast, the French were more interested in lur trading than in land. French trappers and fur traders often married Native American women. French missionaries converted many Native Americans to Catholicism. For these reasons, Native Americans helped the French and raided British settlements.
To counter the threat of the French and their Native American friends, the British colonists tried to make a treaty with the Iroquois. The Iroquois Confederacy (IHR«uh«kwoy kuhn»FEH«du*ruh«see) was the most powerful group of Native Americans in eastern North America. At that time, the confederacy included six nations—the Mohawk, Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Tuscarora. Delegates—representatives— from seven colonies met with Iroquois leaders at Albany,
New York, in June 1754. The Iroquois refused an alliance (uh»LY*uhns), or partnership, with the British. They did, however, promise to remain neutral—that is, to take no side.
The Albany delegates also talked about how the colonies might work together more closely against the French. They decided to adopt Benjamin Franklin’s Albany Plan of Union for a united colonial government. To form a colonial government, each colony would have to give up some of its powers.

was willing to do so. Disappointed, Franklin wrote, “Everybody cries, a Union is absolutely necessary; but when they come to the manner and form of the union, [they] are perfectly distracted.”
The Albany meeting failed to unify the colonists. Meanwhile, the conflict between the British and the French expanded into full-scale war—the French and Indian War.
READING PROGRESS CHECK
Identifying Cause and Effect Why did hostilities between the French and British increase during the mid-1700s?
The French and Indian War
guiding question What was the turning point in the French and Indian War?
The French enjoyed early success in the war. They captured several British forts. Meanwhile, their Native American allies carried out raids on the frontier, or edges, of the colonies. They killed colonists, burned farmhouses and crops, and drove many families back toward the coast.
The turning point came in 1757 when William Pitt became prime minister, the head of the British government. Pitt was a great military planner. He sent more trained British troops to fight in North America. To stop colonial complaints about the cost of the war, Pitt decided that Britain would pay for it. He knew that, after the war, the British would raise colonists’ taxes to help pay the large bill. Pitt had only delayed the time when the colonists would have to pay their share of the military costs.
Pitt’s goal was not just to open the Ohio River valley. He also wanted to conquer French Canada. In 1758 British forces won a key victory at Fort Louisbourg in present-day Nova Scotia.
The same year, a British force made up mostly of New York and New England militia captured Fort Frontenac at Lake Ontario.

Analyzing Why do you think Quebec and Montreal were related to French dominance in the Ohio River valley? Reading HELPDESK
Another British force finally took Fort Duquesne. The British renamed it Fort Pitt.
Quebec, the capital of New France, sat on a cliff above the St. Lawrence River. Because of its position, Quebec was thought to be impossible to attack. In September 1759, British scouts spotted a poorly guarded path along the back of the cliff. At night, British general James Wolfe’s soldiers overwhelmed the French guards and scrambled up the path. The British troops then surprised and defeated the French army on a field called the Plains of Abraham. The fall of Quebec and of Montreal the next year marked the defeat of France in North America.
Fighting between Britain and France and their respective allies continued in Europe and elsewhere until the war was final! ended with the Treaty of Paris of 1763. This treaty forced France to give Canada and most of its lands east of the Mississippi Riyer to Great Britain. Great Britain also received Florida from Frances ally, Spain. Spain acquired French lands west of the Mississippi River—called Louisiana—as well as the port of New Orleans.
The Treaty of Paris marked the end of France as a power in North America. In its aftermath, North America was in the hands of two European powers—Great Britain and Spain.

054 Life in the American Colonies

New British Policies
GUIDING QUESTION
How did the American colonists react to new British policies? The French defeat was a blow to Native Americans in the Ohio River valley. They lost their French allies and trading partners and now had to deal with the British. The British raised the prices of their goods. Unlike the French, the British refused to pay Native Americans to use their land. Worst of all, more colonists began settling in Native American lands.
Many Native Americans saw the settlers as a threat to their way of life. One of these was Pontiac, the chief of an Ottawa village near Detroit. In 1763 Pontiac and his forces captured the British fort at Detroit and other British outposts. During Pontiac’s War, Native Americans killed settlers along the Pennsylvania and Virginia frontiers.
The same year that Pontiac’s War began, Britain’s King George declared that colonists were not to settle west of the Appalachian Mountains. To enforce the new rule, the British planned to keep 10,000 troops in America. The Proclamation of 1763 helped remove a source of conflict with Native Americans. It also kept colonists on the coast—where the British could control them.
Colonists believed the proclamation limited their freedom of movement. They feared that the large number of British troops might interfere with their liberties. As a result, distrust began to grow between Britain and its American colonies.
Britain’s financial problems also led to trouble. Deeply in debt as a result of the war with France, the British government made plans to tax the colonies and tighten trade rules. These efforts would lead to conflict. Although no one knew it at the time, the end of the French and Indian War was also the start of a new era

Examining Why did the Proclamation of 1763 anger colonists? BIOGRAPHY
Pontiac, c. 1720-1769
Pontiac became an Ottawa chief while still a young man. A born leader, he brought together three Native American groups—the Ottawa, the Potawatomi, and the Ojibwa—in an alliance. As more British settlers moved into their lands, he convinced more groups to join. Based on Pontiac's plans, these groups attacked British forts and settlements. Pontiac himself led the successful attack on the fort at Detroit. Pontiac agreed to peace with the British in July 1766. Afterward, his allies turned against him.

Dealing with Great Britain
guidingquestion Why did the British go vernment establish new policies?
After their victory in the French and Indian War, the British controlled much of North America. To manage this territory, King George III issued the Proclamation of 1763. This order prohibited, or barred, colonists from living west ofthe Appalachian Mountains, on Native American land.
The British believed the Proclamation would help keep peace between Native Americans and settlers. It would also keep colonist? near the Atlantic Coast, where British authority was stronger. Finally, it would allow Britain to control westward expansion and the fur trade in the region. The king sent 10,000 troops to the colonies to enforce the Proclamation. The colonists feared that the large number of British troops would interfere with their liberties, and they resented the restriction on settling western land. Britain Restricts Trade

costs, so the British government issued new taxes on the colonies. It also enforced old taxes more strictly. To avoid taxes, some colonists resorted to smuggling. This caused British revenues to fall.
In 1763 Britain’s prime minister, George Grenville, set out to stop the smuggling. Parliament passed a law to have accused smugglers tried by royally appointed judges rather than local juries. Grenville knew that American juries often found smugglers innocent. Parliament also empowered customs officers to obtain writs of assistance. These documents allowed the officers to search almost anywhere—shops, warehouses, and even private homes—for smuggled goods.
The Sugar Act
In 1764 Parliament passed the Sugar Act, which lowered the tax on the molasses the colonists imported. Grenville hoped this change would convince the colonists to pay the tax instead of smuggling. The act also allowed officers to seize goods from accused smugglers without going to court.

The Sugar Act angered many colonists. They believed this and other new laws violated their rights. As British citizens, colonists argued, they had a right to a trial by jury and to be viewed as innocent until proved guilty according to British law. Colonists also believed they had the right to be secure in their homes—without the threat of officers barging in to search for smuggled goods.
The colonists also accepted the principle of “no taxation without representation” as a basic right. Since the colonies

The Spirit of Independence
Opposition to the Stamp Act
The Stamp Act outraged the colonists. They argued that only their own assemblies could tax them. Patrick Henry, a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, got the burgesses to take action. The assembly passed a resolution declaring that it had “the only and sole exclusive right and power to lay taxes” on its citizens.
In Boston, Samuel Adams helped start the Sons of Liberty. Its members took to the streets to protest the Stamp Act. Protesters burned effigies (EH •fuh»jeez)—stuffed figures—made to look like unpopular tax collectors.
Colonial leaders decided to work together. In October, delegates from nine colonies met in New York at the Stamp Act Congress. They sent a statement to the king and Parliament declaring that only colonial assemblies could tax the colonists.
People in colonial cities urged merchants to boycott British goods. As the boycott spread, businesses in Britain lost money and demanded Parliament repeal, or cancel, the Stamp Act. In March 1766, Parliament repealed the law. However, it also passed the Declaratory Act, stating that it had the right to tax and make decisions for the colonies “in all cases.”
The Townshend Acts
The Stamp Act taught the British that the colonists would resist internal taxes—those paid inside the colonies. As a result, in 1767 Parliament passed the Townshend Acts to tax imports such as glass, tea, and paper. The tax was paid when the goods arrived— before they were brought inside the colonies.
Protests against the Townshend Acts began immediately.
In towns throughout the colonies, women—some organized as Daughters of Liberty—began boycotts of British goods. Mercy Otis Warren, a leader of the Daughters of Liberty, later wrote pamphlets and poems urging separation from Britain. She also

Trouble in Massachusetts
gusdsngquestion How did the American colonists react to the Boston Massacre!
Protests continued to flare in the colonies, making British, nervous. In 1768 they sent word to Britain that the colonies were on the brink of rebellion—a rejection of British authority. Parliament sent troops to Boston. As angry colonists jeered, the redcoats set up camp in the center of the city.
For many colonists, this British act went too far. The colonists were already convinced that the British had passed laws that violated colonial rights. Now Britain had sent an army to occupy, or take control of, colonial cities.
To make matters worse, the soldiers in Boston acted rudely. The re coats, who were mostly poor men, earned little pay. Some stole rom local shops and got into fights with colonists. Also, in their o ours, the soldiers competed for jobs that Bostonians wanted. Tension in the Streets
On March 5, 1770, violence erupted. A fight broke out between ome ostonians and soldiers. As British officers tried to calm me crowd, a man shouted, “We did not send for you. We will not have you here. We’ll get rid of you, we’ll drive you away!”

The angry townspeople surged forward. They began throwing sticks and stones at the soldiers. “Come on, you rascals, you bloody backs, you lobster scoundrels, fire, if you dare,” someone in the crowd shouted.
After one soldier was knocked down, the nervous redcoats did fire. They killed five colonists. According to accounts, Crispus Attucks, a dockworker who was part African and part Native American, became the first casualty of the American Revolution. One Bostonian cried: “Are the inhabitants to be knocked down in the streets? Are they to be murdered ... ?” The colonists called the tragic encounter “the Boston Massacre.”
Spreading the News
Colonial leaders used the killings as propaganda—information designed to influence opinion. Samuel Adams put up posters that described the Boston Massacre as a slaughter of innocent Americans by bloodthirsty redcoats. Paul Revere made an engraving that showed a British officer giving the order to open fire on an orderly crowd.
The Boston Massacre led colonists to call for stronger boycotts of British goods. Troubled by the growing opposition in the colonies, Parliament repealed the Townshend Acts taxes on British imports, except the one on tea. In response, the colonists ended their boycotts, except on tea. Trade with Britain resumed.
Still, some colonists continued to call for resistance to British rule. In 1772 Samuel Adams revived the Boston committee of correspondence, a group used in earlier protests. The group circulated calls for action against Britain. Soon committees of correspondence sprang up throughout the colonies, bringing together protesters opposed to British measures.

The Intolerable Acts
When news of the Boston Tea Party reached London, King George III realized that Britain was losing control of the colonies. He declared, “We must either master them or totally leave them to themselves.”
In 1774 Parliament responded by passing a series of laws called the Coercive Acts. Coercive (co.EHR.sihv) describes the forceful pressure used to make someone do something. These laws were meant to punish the colonists for resisting British authority. One Coercive Act applied to all the colonies. It forced the colonies to let British soldiers live among the colonists. Massachusetts, though, received the harshest treatment.
One of the Coercive Acts banned town meetings in Massachusetts. Another closed Boston Harbor until the colonists paid for the ruined tea. This stopped most shipments of food and other supplies to the colony. Parliament was trying to cut Massachusetts off from the other colonies. Instead, the Coercive Acts drew the colonies together. Other colonies sent food and clothing to support Boston.
Following the Coercive Acts, Parliament also passed the Quebec Act. This law created a government for Canada and extended Canada’s territory south all the way to the Ohio River. This action ignored the colonies’ claims to that region.
The colonists believed all of these new laws violated their rights as English citizens. They expressed their feelings about the laws by calling them the Intolerable Acts. Intolerable means

The Delegates Vote
The delegates discussed complaints against the British. Then they voted. In a statement of grievances, the delegates called for the repeal of 13 acts of Parliament. They believed these laws violated the “laws of nature, the principles of the English constitution, and the several charters” of the colonies. The delegates also voted to boycott British trade. The colonies would not import or use any British goods, nor would they sell their goods in Great Britain.
The delegates to the Continental Congress also decided to endorse the Suffolk Resolves, prepared by the people of Boston and other towns in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. These resolutions declared the Coercive Acts to be illegal. They called on the county’s residents to arm themselves against the British. After delegates endorsed the resolves, other colonies also organized militias—groups of citizen soldiers.
The Colonial Militias
American colonists had a long tradition of serving and protecting their communities with militias. Members of a militia were an important part of each town’s defense. Militia members trained and drilled with the other citizen soldiers. They practiced using muskets and cannons. Each member was required to provide his own weapon—usually a musket—and ammunition. Later, as tension between Britain and the colonies grew, towns began to

Why were the battles at Lexington and Concord important? Many colonists believed that if fighting with the British were to break out, it would happen in New England. Militias in Massachusetts held drills, made bullets, and stockpiled weapons. Some militias were known as minutemen because they boasted they would be ready to fight at a minute’s notice. In the winter of 1774-1775, a British officer stationed in Boston noted in his diary.

By April 1775, several thousand British troops were in and around Boston, with more on the way. British general Thomas Gage had orders to seize the weapons from the Massachusetts militia and arrest the leaders.
Gage learned that the militia was storing arms and ammunition at Concord, a town about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Boston. He ordered 700 troops under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith “to Concord, where you will seize and destroy all the artillery and ammunition you can find.”

Meanwhile, the British continued their march. At dawn, the redcoats approached Lexington. There they ran into about 70 waiting minutemen. Led by Captain John Parker, the minutemen stood on the town common with muskets in hand. Badly outnumbered, the minutemen were about to give way to the redcoats. Just then, a shot was fired—from where is still not clear. Both sides let loose an exchange of bullets. When the shooting ended, eight minutemen lay dead.
The British continued on to Concord. While some troops burned the few weapons they found, the others met a group of minutemen waiting at the North Bridge. In a short battle, the British took heavy losses. They began to make their way back to Boston.
All along the road, colonists hid behind trees and fired on the soldiers. By the time the redcoats reached Boston, at least 174 were wounded and 73 were dead.
About 60 years later, poet Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in “The Concord Hymn” that the Americans at Lexington and Concord had fired the “shot heard ‘round the world. The battle for independence had begun.

This painting shows the British charge at what historians call the Battle of Bunker Hill—which actually took place on Breed's Hill.
More Military Action
guiding question What were the beliefs of the Loyalists and Patriots?
After the battles at Lexington and Concord, armed conflict with British forces quickly spread. Benedict Arnold, a captain in the Connecticut militia, raised a force of 400 to seize Fort Ticonderoga near Lake Champlain in New York. Ticonderoga occupied a key location. It was also rich in military supplies. Arnold learned that Ethan Allen of nearby Vermont also planned to attack the fort, so he joined forces with Allen’s men—the so-called Green Mountain Boys. Together, they took the British by surprise. Fort Ticonderoga surrendered on May 10, 1775.
Later, Arnold became a traitor to the Patriot cause. He sold military information to the British. When his crime was discovered in September 1780, he fled to British-controlled New York City. There he commanded British troops and led raids against the Americans in Virginia and Connecticut.
The Battle of Bunker Hill
Following Lexington and Concord, more volunteers joined the colonial militias. Soon militias around Boston numbered about 20,000 strong.
The British remained in control of the city, with the militia camped nearby. On June 16, 1775, militia commanded by Colonel William Prescott set up posts on Bunker Hill and Breed’s Hill, across the harbor from Boston.

The next day, the redcoats assembled at Breed’s Hill. Bayonets drawn, they charged. Low on ammunition, Prescott reportedly ordered, “Don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes.” The Americans opened fire, forcing the British to retreat. Twice more the redcoats charged, receiving furious fire from above. Finally, the Americans ran out of gunpowder and had to withdraw.
The battle on Breed’s Hill—which became known as the Battle of Bunker Hill—was a British victory. Yet the British suffered heavy losses of more than 1,000 dead and wounded. They were learning that defeating the Americans on the battlefield would be neither quick nor easy.
Choosing Sides
As news of these battles spread, each colonist faced a major decision—to join the rebels or remain loyal to Great Britain.
Those who sided with Britain, the Loyalists, did not think unfair taxes and laws justified a rebellion. Some were officeholders who felt a responsibility to uphold British rule. Others had not suffered from British policies and saw no reason to break with Britain. Still others believed Britain would win the war and did not want to be on the losing side.
The Patriots, on the other hand, supported the war. They believed that the colonists should have the right to govern themselves. The Patriots were determined to fight the British until American independence was won.
The American Revolution was not just a war between America and Britain. It was also a civil war—Patriots against Loyalists.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
The decision to declare independence came only after all other options had been exhausted.
The Second Continental Congress
GUiDlNGQUESTlON Howdid individuals and events impact efforts for independence?
In 1774 the Continental Congress agreed to meet again it the British did not address their complaints. In fact, as the battles at Lexington and Concord in 1775 showed, the dispute between the British and the colonies had worsened.
Distinguished Leaders
The Second Continental Congress met on May 10, 1775. The delegates included some of the greatest leaders in the colonies. Among them were John and Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee, and George Washington—all delegates to the First Continental Congress. Several new delegates came as well.
Benjamin Franklin, one of the most respected men in the colonies, had been a leader in the Pennsylvania legislature. In 1765 he represented the colonies in London and helped win repeal of the Stamp Act. John Hancock of Massachusetts was a wealthy merchant. He funded many Patriot groups, including the Sons of Liberty. The delegates chose Hancock to be president of the Second Continental Congress. Thomas Jefferson, only 32, was also a delegate. He served in the Virginia legislature. Jefferson was already known as a brilliant thinker and writer.

The Spirit of Independence
The delegates at the Second Continental Congress had much to discuss. Though American and British blood had been spilled, they were not ready to vote for a break from Britain. It would be another year before Jefferson would write the Declaration of Independence.
Key Actions
The Continental Congress did take steps to begin governing the colonies. It authorized the printing of money and set up a post office, with Franklin in charge. The Congress also formed committees to handle relations with Native Americans and foreign countries. Most important, it created the Continental Army.
Unlike local militias, such a force could form and carry out an overall strategy for fighting the British. The Congress unanimously chose George Washington to command this army. Washington was an experienced soldier and a respected Southern planter. He left Philadelphia at once to take charge of the forces in Boston.
The delegates then offered Britain a last chance to avoid war. They sent a petition, or formal request, to George III.
Called the Olive Branch Petition, it assured the king that the colonists wanted peace. It asked him to protect the colonists’ rights. The king rejected the petition. Instead, he prepared for war. He hired more than 30,000 German troops, called Hessians (HEH»shuhnz), to fight alongside British troops.

The War Heats Up
Congress learned that British troops in Canada were planning to invade New York. The Americans decided to strike first. A unit of Patriots marched north from Fort Ticonderoga and captured Montreal. However, an American attack on Quebec, led by Benedict Arnold, failed.
Washington reached the Boston area in July 1775, a few weeks after the Battle of Bunker Hill. The British held Boston, but Patriot militia ringed the city. Although the size of the colonial force grew every day, Washington realized that the men were disorganized and lacked discipline—the ability to follow strict rules and procedures. Washington began the task of turning armed civilians into soldiers.
Washington also needed weapons. He arranged to have dozens of cannons hauled 300 miles (483 km) from Fort Ticonderoga. Moving the heavy guns was a huge effort.
In March 1776, Washington believed his army was ready to fight. Under the cover of darkness, he moved soldiers and cannons into position overlooking Boston, while the redcoats slept.
The move surprised the British, who realized they were now within easy reach of Washington’s big guns. British General William Howe commanded his soldiers to hoard ships and withdraw from Boston. On March 17, Washington led his jubilant troops into the city. They watched as the British troops sailed away to Halifax, Nova Scotia, a part of Canada.
Moving Toward Independence
Many colonists held on to hope that the colonies could remain part of Great Britain. Still, support for independence was growing It was inspired in no small part by writer Thomas Paine. Paine arrived in the colonies from England in 1774. He soon caught the revolutionary spirit. In January 1776, he published a pamphlet called Common Sense. In bold language, Paine called for a complete break with British rule.

Declaring Independence
guidingquestion Why did the American colonies declare independence?
The Second Continental Congress was filled with spirited debate: Should the colonies declare themselves an independent nation or stay under British rule? In June 1776, Virginias Richard Henry Lee offered a bold resolution:
PRIMARY SOURCE
« That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States ... and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved. 99
—Richard Henry Lee, resolution for independence, 1776
The Congress debated Lee’s resolution. Some delegates still thought the colonies should not form a separate nation. Others argued that war had already begun and they should be free from Great Britain. Still others feared Britain’s power to crush the rebellion.
Writing the Declaration
While delegates debated, Congress chose a committee to write a declaration of independence.
John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Robert Livingston, and Roger Sherman formed the committee. Adams asked Jefferson to write the first draft. Jefferson hesitated, but Adams persuaded him, saying:
Committee members Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson examine Jefferson's changes to his draft of the Declaration.

Reason first—You are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second—I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third—you can write ten times better than I can. 99 —from The Writings of Thomas Jefferson, 1822
Jefferson agreed that he would do the writing for the great project. He drew on ideas from English philosopher John Locke to explain why the thirteen colonies were proclaiming their freedom.

preamble the introduction to a formal document that often tells why the document was written
In the 1690s Locke had expressed the idea that people are born with certain natural rights to life, liberty, and property. Locke wrote that people form
governments to protect those rights and that a
government interfering with those rights could rightfully be overthrown. Jefferson and other Patriots agreed with Locke. On July 2, 1776, the Second
Continental Congress voted on Lee’s resolution for independence. Twelve colonies voted for independence. New York did not vote but later announced its support.
Next, the delegates discussed Jefferson’s draft ol the Declaration of Independence. After making some changes, delegates approved the document on July 4, 1776. John Hancock signed the Declaration first. He remarked that he wrote his name large enough for King George to read without his glasses. Eventually, 56 delegates signed the document announcing the birth of the United States.
Copies of the Declaration of Independence were printed and sent out to people in the newly declared independent states. George Washington had the Declaration read to his troops in New York City on July 9. In Worcester, Massachusetts, a public reading of the Declaration of Independence led to “repeated [cheers], firing of musketry and cannon, bonfires, and other demonstrations of joy.”
The Declaration of Independence
The Declaration has four major sections. The preamble, or introduction, states that people who wish to form a new country should explain their reasons for doing so. The next two sections of the Declaration list the rights that the colonists believed they should have and their complaints against Great Britain. The final section proclaims the existence of the new nation.

holiday. He wrote, “The Second Day of July 1776 ... ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade ... and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other.” Instead, July 4, the date the delegates actually adopted the Declaration of Independence, is celebrated as Independence Day.
The Declaration of Independence states what Jefferson and many Americans thought were universal principles—that is, principles that apply to all people in all situations. It begins by describing what had long been viewed as basic English rights:

M
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable [not to be denied] Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.» —Declaration of Independence, 1776
The Declaration states that government exists to protect these rights. If government fails, “it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government.” The document goes on to list grievances against the king and Parliament. These include “cutting off our trade with all parts of the world” and “imposing taxes on us without our consent.” Americans had “Petitioned for Redress” of these grievances. The British had ignored or rejected these petitions.
Finally, the Declaration announces America’s new status (STAY»tuhs). Pledging “to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor,” the Americans declared themselves a new nation. The struggle for independence—the American Revolution—had begun.

186 The Spirit of Independence
The Declaration of independence
In Congress, July 4,1776. The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of America,
[Preamble]
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
[Declaration of Natural Rights]
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
[List of Grievances]
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
Words are spelled as originally written.
The Preamble The Declaration of Independence has four parts. The Preamble explains why the Continental Congress drew up the Declaration.
Natural Rights The second part, the Declaration of Natural Rights, lists the rights of the citizens. It goes on to explain that, in a republic, people form a government to protect their rights.

impel: force
endowed: provided
usurpations: unjust uses of power
despotism: unlimited power
List of Grievances The third part of the Declaration lists the colonists'complaints against the British government. Notice that King George III is singled out for blame.
The Declaration of Independence 187
relinquish: give up inestimable: priceless
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislature.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their acts of pretended legislation: For quartering large bodies of troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts ofthe world:
For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislature, and declaring themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.
Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.

The Declaration of Independence 189
Resolution of Independence The
final section declares that the colonies are "Free and Independent States" with the full power to make war, to form alliances, and to trade with other countries.
rectitude: rightness
We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
[Resolution of Independence by the United States]
j	We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of
j	America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the
Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.
And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
Signers of the Declaration The signers, as representatives of the American people, declared the colonies independent from Great Britain. Most members signed the document on August 2,1776.

It is December 25,1776. General George Washington is preparing to lead 2,400 troops across the Delaware River to launch a surprise attack on the British troops stationed in Trenton. The river is filled with huge chunks of ice. The weather is terrible, and hurricane-force winds pound at Washington's troops. After crossing the Delaware River, General Washington and his troops will have to march 9 miles (14 km) to meet their enemy. The young United States is in desperate need of some battlefield success in its war against the British.

Place and Time: Colonial America 1587 to 1770
Although several European nations had claims in North America, it was the British who eventually dominated the continent. England's early attempts at colonizing ended in failure, but by 1750, British colonies stretched for hundreds of miles along the Atlantic Coast.

The Mystery of Roanoke
GUIDING question What problems did the Roanoke settlers encounter?
The success of Spain’s colonies in the Americas did not go unnoticed. The great powers of Europe were all interested in the rich opportunities available on the other side of the Atlantic. England was no exception. In the late 1500s, English pirates such as Sir Francis Drake had success stealing Spanish treasure on its way from the Americas to Europe. The era of English colonization of the Americas began during this period and would continue until the 1700s. By 1584, however, none of these efforts had been successful.
That year, England’s Queen Elizabeth gave Sir Walter Raleigh the right to claim land in North America. Raleigh took up this effort with great energy. He sent scouts across the ocean to find a good place for a colony. The scouts mack an enthusiastic report of a place called Roanoke Island. This island lies off the coast of what is now North Carolina. At the time, Raleigh called this area Virginia.
Raleigh sent settlers to Roanoke Island twice. The first group arrived in 1585. While they were there, artist John White explored the area and drew pictures of what he saw. In a book illustrated by White, another colonist described the Native American towns:

Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia, 1588 The 1585 expedition produced some valuable information about the people and places of Virginia. Their colony, however, did not survive. After suffering through a difficult winter, the colonists gave up and returned to England.
Then, in 1587 Raleigh sent 91 men, 17 women, and 9 children to Roanoke. John White led this group. Shortly after arriving on the island, White’s daughter, who was part of the expedition, gave birth. Virginia Dare was the first English child born in North America.
Nine days after his granddaughter’s birth, White returned to England for supplies. Although he had hoped to be back within a few months, White was delayed. His country was at war with Spain. This war featured England’s great naval battle with the Spanish Armada. The fighting between England and Spain made it impossible for White to sail back to Roanoke for nearly three years.
When he returned to Roanoke, White found his colony deserted. The only clue he found was a tree with the word Croatoan carved on it. White thought perhaps the colonists had gone to Croatoan Island, about 50 miles (80 km) to the south.
Bad weather kept White from investigating. The Roanoke colonists were never seen again.

Success at Jamestown
guiding question Why did the Jamestown settlement succeed?
For a time, the failure at Roanoke discouraged the English from settling in North America. The idea emerged again in 1606.
By then, England had a new king, James I. He wanted to renew England’s quest for a colony in North America. Several merchants pressed him for a charter—a document that granted the right to form a colony.

The Virginia Company
The Virginia Company was a joint-stock company in which investors bought shares, or part ownership. Investors bought shares hoping the company would make money and that they would share in the profits. The plan was for the company’s settlers to find gold and establish trade in fish and furs.
James I granted a charter to the Virginia Company of London, In December 1606, the company sent 144 settlers in three ships to build a new colony in North America. In April 1607, the ships entered Chesapeake Bay. They sailed up a river Bowing into the bay. The colonists named the river the James and their new settlement Jamestown to honor their king.
Jamestown Survives
The colonists did not find gold or riches in Virginia. Instead thev faced severe hardships, including disease and hunger. The colony survived its first two years in part because of 27-year-old Captain John Smith. Smith forced the settlers to work. He also built ties with—and got food from—the local Powhatan people and their chief, who was also named Powhatan.
In late 1609, Smith was injured and had to return to England. The colony struggled. The Powhatan stopped providing food. The winter of 1609-1610 was called “the starving time.”

Somehow Jamestown survived this terrible time. More colonists arrived to replace those who had died. The colonists also found a way to make money for the investors. Using seeds from the West Indies, they began growing a type of tobacco. Soon planters all along the James River were raising this valuable crop.
More Settlers Come to Virginia The colony of Virginia began to expand. Relations with the Powhatan improved after a colonist, John Rolfe, married the chief’s daughter, Pocahontas. The Virginia Company sent women to Jamestown. As a result, marriage and children became a part of life in the colony. The Virginia Company also began giving a headright (HEHD«RYT), or land grant, of 50 acres to settlers who paid their own way to the colony. The headright system helped the colony succeed. The chance to own land lured many settlers to Virginia and gave them a reason to work hard.
The Virginia Company also gave the colonists the right to take part in their own government. In 1619, land-owning male colonists cast ballots for burgesses (BUHR«juhs»uhz), or representatives. The burgesses helped make laws for the colony. The House of Burgesses was the first legislature in North America elected by the people.
The Virginia Colony was growing in size, but it was not making any money for the shareholders of the Virginia Company. In fact, the company faced financial troubles. In 1624 King James took away the company’s charter. Virginia became a royal colony, meaning it was directly under the control of the government in England.

ITIAL QUESTION
How do new ideas change the way people Ihtt? IT MATTERS BECAUSE
Seeking freedom to pursue their own religion, English settlers started colonies in New England. Many people still come to the
Americas in search of religious freedom.
Seeking Religious Freedom
guiding question Why did the Puritans settle in North America!
The Jamestown settlers had come to America in search ot wealth. The next wave of English colonists arrived in search of religious freedom.
England had been a Protestant country since 1534 when King Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and formed the Anglican Church. Not everyone in England was happy with the new church. Many people dissented (dih»SEHNT»uhd), disagreeing with Anglican beliefs or practices. Some English people remained Catholic. Others were Protestants who wanted to reform the Anglican Church. The Protestants who wished to reform the Anglican Church were called Puritans. Some Puritans sought to set up their own churches and were known as Separatists.
The Separatists were persecuted (PUHR»sih«kyoot«uhd)— mistreated because of their beliefs—in England. Some fled to the Netherlands. There they found freedom to practice their religion but had difficulty finding work. They also worried that their children were losing their religious values and English way of life. To preserve their religious faith and English culture, some Separatists decided to move to America.

The Pilgrims Settle Plymouth
In 1620 a group of Separatists were able to get land grants from the Virginia Company. They received permission to settle in Virginia and to practice their religion freely. These Separatists became known as the Pilgrims. (A pilgrim is someone who undertakes a religious journey.) The Pilgrims boarded a ship called the Mayflower and set out for America to begin their new lives.
The Mayflower drifted off course on its journey across the Atlantic. The first land the Pilgrims sighted was Cape Cod, well north of their target. It was November, and winter was fast approaching. The colonists decided to drop anchor in Cape Cod Bay. They went ashore on a cold, bleak day in December at a place they called Plymouth.

The Mayflower Compact
Plymouth was outside the territory of the Virginia Company and its laws. While they were still on board ship, the Pilgrims signed
; a document later called the Mayflower Compact. This document set up an organized, orderly government. Each signer promised to obey the laws passed “for the general good of the colony.” The Mayflower Compact was a key step in the development of representative, democratic government in America.
Native American Help
During their first winter in America, almost half the Pilgrims died. Illness, hunger, and cold took a terrible toll. In the spring, however, two Native Americans—Squanto and Samoset—befriended the
i colonists. They taught the Pilgrims to grow corn, beans, and | pumpkins and showed the colonists where to hunt and fish.

In 1629 a group of Puritans formed the Massachusetts Bay Company. They received a royal charter to establish a colony north of Plymouth. The company chose John Winthrop to be the colony’s governor.
In 1630 Winthrop led about 900 men, women, and children to Massachusetts Bay. Most of them settled in a place they called Boston.
More settlers followed. During the 1630s, more than 15,000 Puritans journeyed to Massachusetts to escape religious persecution and economic hard times in England. This movement of people became known as the Great Migration.
At first Winthrop and his assistants made the colony’s laws.
In 1634 settlers demanded a larger role in the government. Adult male church members were allowed to vote for the governor and for representatives to the government. Later, property ownership became a requirement for voting.
The Puritans came to America to put their religious beliefs into practice. At the same time, they themselves had little tolerance for

different beliefs. They criticized or persecuted people who did not agree with their views. They strictly enforced their own religious rules. This lack of tolerance led people to form new colonies.
Connecticut and Rhode Island
To the west of Boston is land we now call the Connecticut River Valley. This rich land is better for farming than the stony soil around Boston. In the 1630s colonists began to settle this area.
A leader of this movement was Massachusetts minister Thomas Hooker. He did not like how Winthrop and other Puritan leaders ran the colony. In 1636 Hooker led his congregation to the Connecticut River Valley. There he founded the town of Hartford. Other nearby towns were soon established. Three years later these towns formed the colony of Connecticut. In 1639 they adopted a plan of government called the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. This was the first written constitution in America. The document described the organization of representative government in detail. Like the Mayflower Compact, it reflected a belief in democratic principles. The Connecticut colonists, like the Pilgrims, believed that the people had the right to make decisions in matters of government as well as matters of religion.

A minister named Roger Williams founded the colony of Rhode Island. Williams felt that government should not force people to worship in a certain way. He also believed it was wrong for settlers to take land away from the Native Americans. Forced by Massachusetts leaders to leave the colony, Williams found
refuge with the Narragansett, a Native American people.
They later sold him land, where Williams founded the town of Providence. With its policy of religious toleration, Rhode Island became a safe place for dissenters. It was the first place in America where people of all faiths could worship freely.
Others followed Williams’s example. In 1638 John Wheelwright led a group of dissenters from Massachusetts to found the town of Exeter in New Hampshire. New Hampshire became an independent colony in 1679.
Conflict With Native Americans
As settlers spread across New England, they met the Native Americans who lived there—Wampanoag, Narragansett, and other groups. Native Americans traded furs for settlers’ goods, but conflicts arose. Usually settlers moved onto Native American lands without permission or payment. Throughout the colonial period, settlers and Native Americans competed fiercely for land.
In 1675 Wampanoag leader Metacomet waged war against the New England colonies. Known to settlers as King Philip, Metacomet enlisted the help of other Native American groups. King Philip’s War raged for 14 months. In the end, the colonists defeated Metacomet. The war destroyed the power of the Native Americans in New England. Colonial settlement expanded.

NTIAL QUESTION
How does geography influence the way people live? It Matters Because
The Middle Colonies drew a diverse population to North America.
New York and New Jersey
GUIDING QUESTION
Why did the Middle Colonies grow? By 1660, England had two groups of colonies in North America. In the north were the New England colonies. In the south were Virginia and also the colony of Maryland, which was settled in 1634. Between these two groups of colonies were lands under Dutch control. This area was called New Netherland.
The main settlement of New Netherland was New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. This location combined a good seaport with access to the Hudson River. The river served as a major transportation link to a rich land of farms, forests, and furs. As a result, New Amsterdam became a center of shipping to and from the Americas.
The Dutch West India Company controlled New Netherland. It wanted to increase the colony’s population. To do this, the company offered large grants of land to anyone who could bring at least 50 settlers to work the land. The landowners who received these grants were called patroons (puh»TROONS). The patroons ruled like kings. They had their own courts and laws. Settlers owed the patroons labor and a share of their crops.
As you read, use a diagram like this one to illustrate how the New York and Pennsylvania colonies split to form the four middle colonies under British rule.

New Netherland Becomes New York
New Netherland’s success did not go unnoticed. The English wanted to gain control of the valuable Dutch colony. England insisted it had a right to the land, based on John Cabot’s explorations in the late 1400s. In 1664 the English sent a fleet to attack New Amsterdam. Peter Stuyvesant, governor of the colony, surrendered it to the English forces without a fight.
England’s King Charles II gave the colony to his brother, the Duke of York, who renamed it New York. New York was a proprietary colony. This was a colony in which an owner, or proprietor, owned all the land and controlled the government. Not until 1691 did the English government allow citizens of New York to elect their legislature.
New York continued to prosper under English control. It had a diverse population made up of Dutch, German, Swedish, and Native American people. Also among the population were people of the Jewish religion. They were the first Jews to settle in North America.
In 1664 New York had about 8,000 residents, including at least 300 enslaved Africans. By 1683 the population had swelled to about 12,000 people. New Amsterdam, which had been renamed New York City, was one of the fastest-growing places in the colonies. Because of its large natural harbor, the city had become a major seaport. View the location of New York City on the map of the Middle Colonies. Founding New Jersey
The Duke of York decided to divide his colony. He gave the land between the Hudson and Delaware Rivers to Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. The two proprietors named their colony New Jersey, after the English Channel island of Jersey where Carteret was born. To attract settlers, the proprietors offered large tracts of land and also promised freedom of religion, trial by jury, and a representative assembly.
Like New York, New Jersey had a diverse population. There were people of many different racial, religious, and national backgrounds that is, many different ethnic groups. New Jersey had no natural harbors, so it did not develop a major port or city like New York. New Jersey’s proprietors made little profit. Both eventually sold their shares in the colony. By 1702, New Jersey had become a royal colony. However, the colonists continued to make local laws. H READING PROGRESS CHECK

Pennsylvania and Delaware
GUIDING QUESTION
How did Pennsylvania differ from the other English colonies? The Quakers, a Protestant group that had been persecuted in England, founded the colony of Pennsylvania. In 1680 William Penn, a wealthy English Quaker, received the land in payment for a debt King Charles II owed Penn’s father. Pennsylvania, or “Penn’s Woods,” stretched inland from the Delaware River. The new colony was nearly as large as England.
William Penn saw Pennsylvania as a “holy experiment,” a chance to put his Quaker ideals into practice. The Quakers, or Society of Friends, believed that everyone was equal. People could follow their own “inner light” rather than the teachings of a religious leader. Quakers were also pacifists (PA«suh»fihsts), or people who refuse to use force or fight in wars.
Penn was an active proprietor. In 1682 he sailed to America to supervise the building of Philadelphia, a name that means “city of brotherly love.” Penn designed the city himself. He also wrote Pennsylvania’s first constitution. Penn believed that the land belonged to the Native Americans and that settlers should pay for it. He negotiated several treaties with local Native Americans.

Penn advertised his colony throughout Europe. By 1683, more than 3,000 English, Welsh, Irish, Dutch, and German settlers had arrived. In 1701, in the Charter of Privileges, Penn granted colonists the right to elect representatives to the legislature. Philadelphia quickly became America’s most prosperous city and its most popular port.
People from Sweden had settled land in southern Pennsylvania before the Dutch and then the English took over the area. Penn allowed these southern counties to form their own legislature. The counties then functioned, or worked, as a separate colony known as Delaware. However, Delaware remained under the authority of Pennsylvania’s governor.

Lesson 4
The Southern Colonies
TIAL QUESTION
How does geography influence the way people live? it Matters because
A warm climate, a long growing season, and rich soil spurred the growth of large-scale agriculture in the Southern Colonies.
Virginia and Maryland
guiding question What problems did Maryland and Virginia face?
The settlement of Jamestown in 1607 marked the beginning of English colonization in North America—and of the Virginia Colony. After its difficult beginnings, Virginia began to grow. The demand for workers was high. It took a great deal of labor to plant, tend, and harvest the tobacco crop on which the colony depended.
White landowners helped meet this need through the use of enslaved Africans. The first group of 20 Africans arrived in 1619 aboard a Dutch trading ship. In the years to follow, many more shiploads of this human cargo would arrive in North America.
The story of Virginia’s first Africans shows that not all people came to work in the colonies of their own free will. England also shipped criminals and prisoners of war to the colonies. They could earn their release by working for a period of time—usually seven years.
Many people also came to the colonies as indentured servants (ihn*DEHN»shuhrd SIRxvuhnts), agreeing to work without pay for a certain length of time to pay for their passage to America. Some came for adventure. Others came for a new start in life. Still others followed family members or friends.

Maryland arose from the dream of Sir George Calvert, Lord Baltimore. Calvert wanted a safe place for his fellow Catholics who faced persecution in England. England’s king, Charles 1, gave Calvert a proprietary colony north of Virginia. Soon after receiving this grant, Calvert died. His son, Cecilius, inherited the colony and named it Maryland. Cecilius sent two of his brothers to start the colony. They reached America in 1634.
Cecilius gave large estates to English aristocrats. He also granted smaller pieces of land to other settlers. As the number of plantations grew, so did the need for workers. The colony imported indentured servants and enslaved Africans.
For years the Calvert and Penn families argued over the boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania. In the 1760s, they hired two men named Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon to map the boundary between the colonies. This boundary line became

known as the Mason-Dixon Line. View the map of Maryland and the other colonies that make up the Southern Colonies.
Conflict arose from differences in religion. The Calverts welcomed Protestants as well as Catholics. Protestant settlers outnumbered Catholics. To protect Catholics, the colony established the Act of Toleration in 1649. The act ensured both Protestants and Catholics the right to worship freely.
Tensions, however, continued. In 1692 Maryland was made a royal colony, and the Anglican Church became the official church. As a result, Catholics faced the same restrictions they had encountered in England.

Virginia also experienced conflict. As the colony grew, settlers moved west—and onto Native American lands. In the 1640s, Virginia governor William Berkeley made a pledge to Native Americans. In exchange for a large piece of land, he agreed to keep settlers from pushing farther into their territory. Berkeley’s goal was to prevent the outbreak of a war with the Native Americans.
Nathaniel Bacon was a young planter in western Virginia.
He opposed the colonial government because it was dominated by easterners. Many westerners also resented Berkeley’s pledge to stay out of Native American territory. Some settled in the forbidden areas. They then blamed the government for not clearing the colony of Native Americans.
In 1676 Bacon led attacks on Native American villages. His army also marched to Jamestown to drive out Berkeley, and they burned the town to the ground. Bacon seemed on the verge of taking over the colony when he suddenly became ill and died. With his death, the rebellion faded. England recalled Berkeley and sent troops to restore order. Bacon’s Rebellion showed that government could not ignore the demands of its people.

Analyzing Visuals How does the map show the importance of tobacco in the Southern Colonies? The Carolinas and Georgia
guidingquestion What factors contributed to the growth of the Carolinas?
In 1663 King Charles II created a proprietary colony south of Virginia called Carolina—Latin for “Charles’s land.” The king gave the colony to eight nobles. The proprietors set up estates and sold or rented land to settlers brought from England.
John Locke, an English philosopher, wrote a constitution (kahn«stuh»TOO«shuhn), a plan that outlined the jobs and powers of the colony’s government. The constitution covered topics such as land divisions and social rank. Locke stated, “Every man has a property in his own person.... The labour of his body, and the work of his hands ... are properly his.”
Two Carolinas
Carolina split into northern and southern Carolina. Farmers from inland Virginia settled northern Carolina. They grew tobacco and sold timber and tar. Northern Carolina lacked a good harbor, so farmers used Virginia’s ports.
Settlers in southern Carolina took advantage of fertile land and the harbor at Charles Town (later Charleston). Settlements there spread, and trade in deerskin, lumber, and beef thrived.

Visual Vocabulary		
indigo The indigofera plant, often called just indigo, was used to make indigo dye.	T	
Two crops came to dominate Carolina agriculture. In the 1680s, planters discovered that rice grew well in the wet coastal lowlands. Growing rice required much labor, so the demand for enslaved labor rose. Another important crop was indigo. A young Englishwoman named Eliza Lucas developed this crop in the 1740s. Indigo, a blue flowering plant, was used to dye cloth.
By the early 1700s, Carolina’s settlers were growing tired of proprietor rule. In 1719 settlers in southern Carolina took control from the proprietors. In 1729 Carolina became two royal colonies—North Carolina and South Carolina.
Georgia
Georgia, founded in 1733, was the last British colony set up in America. James Oglethorpe received a charter from George II for a colony where debtors and poor people could make a fresh start.
In Britain, debtors (DEH»tuhrs)—those who had debts—could be imprisoned if they were unable to pay what they owed.
The British also hoped Georgia would block any Spanish attack on the colonies from Florida. Oglethorpe and his settlers built forts and the town of Savannah to discourage such attacks.
Georgia did not develop as Oglethorpe planned. Hundreds of poor people came from Britain, but few debtors settled there. Religious refugees from Central Europe and a small group of Jews also arrived. Many settlers complained about Oglethorpe’s rules, especially the limits on landholding and the bans on slave labor and rum. A frustrated Oglethorpe finally agreed to their demands. Disappointed with the colony’s slow growth, he gave up and turned Georgia over to the king in 1751.
By that time, the British had been in eastern North America for almost 150 years. They had lined the Atlantic coast with colonies.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
The unique resources and conditions that existed in each colony helped shape colonial economies and ways of living.
Making a Living in the Colonies
GUIDINGQUESTION
Howdidthe economic activity of the three regions reflect their geography? Life in colonial America was based largely on agriculture. Most colonists farmed or made their livings from related activities such as milling flour. Geography played an important role in the colonies’ economic development. Colonists learned to adapt to the climate and terrain of the region where they lived. Commercial New England
In New England, long winters and thin, rocky soil made large-scale farming difficult. Most farmers here practiced subsistence farming (suhb»SIS*tuhns)—producing enough to meet the needs of their families, with little left over to sell or trade. New England farmers often depended on their children for labor. Everyone in the family worked—spinning yarn, milking cows, fencing fields, and sowing and harvesting crops. Women made cloth, garments, candles, and soaps for their families.
Throughout New England were many small businesses. Nearly every town had a mill for grinding grain or sawing lumber. People used waterpower from streams to run the mills-Large towns attracted skilled craftspeople. Among them were blacksmiths, shoemakers, furniture makers, and gunsmiths.

Society/Bridc
Shipbuilding was an important New England industry. The lumber for building ships came from the region’s forests. Workers floated the lumber down rivers to shipyards in coastal towns.
The Northern coastal cities served as centers of the colonial shipping trade, linking the Northern Colonies with the Southern Colonies—and America with other parts of the world.
Fishing was also important. Nearby lay the Grand Banks, a shallow area in the Atlantic Ocean that teemed with cod, mackerel, halibut, and herring. Some New Englanders ventured far out to sea to hunt whales for oil and whalebone.
The Middle Colonies
Most people in the Middle Colonies were farmers. This region enjoyed more fertile soil and a slightly milder climate than New England. Farmers here plowed and planted larger areas of land and produced bigger harvests than did New Englanders. In New York and Pennsylvania, farmers grew large quantities of wheat and other cash crops—crops that could be sold easily in markets in the colonies and overseas.
Farmers sent wheat and livestock for shipment to New York City and Philadelphia, which became busy ports. By the 1760s, Philadelphia,
New York City, and Boston were the largest cities in the American colonies.
Like the New England Colonies, the Middle Colonies also had industries. Some were home-based crafts, such as carpentry and flour milling. Others were larger businesses— lumber mills, mines, ironworks, small-scale manufacturing, and so on.
The Middle Colonies attracted many Scots-Irish, German, Dutch, and Swedish settlers in the 1600s. Using agricultural methods developed in Europe, these immigrants became successful farmers. They gave the Middle Colonies a cultural diversity (duh«VUHR«suh»tee), or variety, not found in New England.
Life in the Southern Colonies
The Southern Colonies had rich soil and a warm climate well suited to certain kinds of farming. Southern farmers could plant large areas and produce harvests of cash crops, such as tobacco or rice. Most settlers in the Southern Colonies made their living from farming.
New York City, shown here in the late 1750s, was a bustling center of trade and population in the American colonies.

Lesson 1 135
Little commerce or industry developed there. For the most part, London merchants rather than local merchants from the colonies managed Southern trade.
Most large plantations were located in the Tidewater, a region of flat, low-lying plains along the seacoast. Planters built their plantations on rivers so they could ship their crops to market by boat. A plantation was like a small village. It had fields stretching out around a cluster of buildings, including cabins, barns, and stables, as well as carpenter and blacksmith shops, storerooms, and kitchens. A large plantation might have its own chapel and school. Small plantations often had fewer than 50 enslaved workers. Large ones typically had 200 or more.
Between the Tidewater and the Appalachian Mountains lay a region of hills and forests known as the backcountry. Its settlers included hardy newcomers to the colonies. They grew corn and tobacco on small family farms. Some had one or two enslaved Africans to help with the work. Backcountry farmers greatly outnumbered large plantation owners. Still, the plantation owners were wealthier and more powerful. They controlled the economic and political life of the region.
Tobacco and Rice
Reading HELPDESK
Tobacco was the principal cash crop in Maryland and Virginia. Growing tobacco and preparing it for sale required a lot of labor. At first, planters used indentured servants to work in the fields. These servants worked for a specified period of time and then were freed. When indentured servants became scarce and expensive, Southern planters began using enslaved Africans instead.
Slaveholders with large farms grew wealthy by growing tobacco. They sold most of it in Europe. Sometimes, though, there was too much tobacco on the market—more than buyers wanted. To sell the extra tobacco, planters had to lower their prices. Asa result, their profits fell. Some planters switched to other crops, such as corn and wheat.
The geography of South Carolina and Georgia helped make rice the main cash crop there. In low-lying areas along the coast, planters built dams to create rice fields called paddies. Planters flooded the fields when the rice was young and drained them when the rice was ready to harvest.
Work in the rice paddies was hard. It involved standing knee-deep in the mud with no protection from the blazing sun orbiting insects. To do this work, rice growers relied on enslaved workers.

The Growth of Slavery
guidingquestion Why were enslaved Africans brought to the colonies?
By the time Europeans were sailing to the Americas, slavery was widely practiced in West Africa. Many West African kingdoms enslaved those they defeated in war. Slave traders from Arab lands bought some of these enslaved people. Others were forced to work in gold mines or in farm fields.
The European colonization of the Americas created new demands for enslaved workers. Colonists needed workers for their plantations. West African slave traders met this need, selling
I captives they gained through wars and raids. The transatlantic j slave trade brought millions of Africans to the Americas. Slavery | and the slave trade became major parts of the colonial economy.
I
For enslaved Africans, the voyage to America usually began 1 with a march to a European fort on the West African coast. 4 There, they were sold to Europeans who loaded them on ships.

The Middle Passage
The trip across the ocean was called the “Middle Passage.” This name came from the fact that it was often the middle leg of the three-part route known as the triangular trade. People called this route “triangular” because, as the ships traveled between their destinations, their paths formed the three sides of a triangle.
The Middle Passage was a terrible ordeal. Chained together for more than a month, prisoners could hardly sit or lie down in the crowded ship decks. They received little food or water. Africans who died or became sick were thrown overboard. Those who refused to eat were whipped.
Those who survived the journey faced another terror when they reached American ports—the slave market. There they were physically examined and put up for sale as laborers to plantation owners. Life Under Slavery
Some enslaved Africans on plantations did housework, but most worked in the fields. Many enslaved people suffered great cruelty. Owners of large plantations hired overseers, or bosses, to keep the enslaved Africans working hard.

JU
Many colonies had slave codes, rules governing the behavior and punishment of enslaved people. Some did not allow enslaved workers to leave the plantation without the slaveholders written permission. Some made it illegal to teach enslaved people to read or write. Enslaved people were seldom allowed to move about freely or gather in large groups.
Punishments ranged from whipping for even minor misdeeds to hanging or burning to death for more serious crimes. Enslaved persons who ran away were punished severely when caught.
Although enslaved Africans had strong family ties, their families were often torn apart when a slaveholder sold a spouse, parent, or child. Many of the enslaved found strength in their African roots. They developed a culture that drew on the languages, customs, and religions of their African homelands.
Some enslaved Africans learned trades, such as carpentry, blacksmithing, or weaving. Skilled workers could sometimes set up shops, sharing their profits with the slaveholders. Those lucky enough to be able to buy their freedom joined the small population of free African Americans.
Critics of Slavery
Not all colonists believed in slavery. Many Puritans, for example, refused to hold people in slavery. In Pennsylvania, Quakers and Mennonites condemned slavery. Eventually, the debate over slavery would spark a bloody war between North and South.

Generally, when the grown people in the neighbourhood were gone far in the fields to labour, the children assembled together in some of the neighbours' premises to play; and commonly some of us used to get up a tree to look out for any assailant, or kidnapper, that might come upon us, for they sometimes took those opportunities of our parents' absence to attack and carry off as many as they could seize.... One day, when all our people were gone out to their works as usual, and only I and my dear sister were left to mind the house, two men and a woman got over our walls, and in a moment seized us both, and, without giving us time to cry out, or make resistance, they stopped our mouths, and ran off with us into the nearest wood. Here they tied our hands, and continued to carry us as far as they could, till night came on, when we reached a small house, where the robbers halted for refreshment, and spent the night. We were then unbound, but were unable to take any food; and, being quite overpowered by fatigue and grief, our only relief was some sleep, which allayed our misfortune for a short time. The next morning we left the house, and continued travelling all the day. For a long time we had kept [to] the woods, but at last we came into a road which I believed I knew. I had now some hopes of being delivered; for we had advanced but a little way before I discovered some people at a distance, on which I began to cry out for their assistance; but my cries had no other effect than to make them tie me faster and stop my mouth, and then they put me into a large sack. They also stopped my sister's mouth, and tied her hands; and in this manner we proceeded till we were out of sight of these people. When we went to rest the following night, they offered us some victuals, but we refused it; and the only comfort we had was in being in one another's arms all that night, and bathing each other with our tears. But alas! we were soon deprived of even the small comfort of weeping together. The next day proved a day of greater sorrow than I had yet experienced, for my sister and I were then separated while we lay clasped in each other's arms. It was in vain that we besought them not to part us; she was torn from me and immediately carried away, while I was left in a state of distraction not to be described. I cried and grieved continually, and for several days I did not eat anything but what they forced into my mouth. 99

Colonial Government
IAL QUESTION
How do new ideas change the way people live? It Matters because
Using ideas from England and their own experiences, American colonists began developing their beliefs about the proper form and role of government.
English Principles of Government
GUIDINGQUESTION
Why are protected rights and representative government important principles? When English colonists came to North America, they brought with them English ideas about government. These ideas had been developing in England over hundreds of years. By the 1600s, the English people had won political liberties, such as trial by jury, that were largely unknown elsewhere.
At the heart of the English system were two principles of government—protected rights and representative legislatures. These two principles greatly influenced the development of the United States and are important parts of the U.S. Constitution. Protected Rights
The colonists believed that government must respect civil liberties, or rights. In fact, the protection of people’s rights was a central idea in the English system of government. It first appeared in the Magna Carta, or Great Charter, which King John signed on June 15, 1215. This document gave English people protection against unjust treatment or punishment. For the English, even kings and queens were bound by the law.

Representative Government
The English had a tradition of representative government, in which people elect delegates to make laws and conduct government. The English Parliament was a representative assembly. It had the power to legislate, or make laws.
Parliament had two chambers, or houses: the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Only the eldest sons of England’s aristocracy—the upper, ruling class—could sit in the House of Lords. The House of Commons included commoners—mostly merchants or property owners elected by other property owners. American legislatures grew, in part, from this English model.
In the mid-1600s, Parliament and King James II began a struggle for power. In 1688, Parliament removed King James II from power and crowned William and Mary to rule. William and Mary promised to govern England according to the “statutes [laws] in Parliament agreed upon, and the laws and customs of the same.” The English called this peaceful transfer of power the Glorious Revolution. It brought a major change in the idea of government in England. From that time forward, no ruler would have more power than the legislature.
The English Bill of Rights
To set clear limits on a ruler’s powers, Parliament drew up the English Bill of Rights in 1689. The Bill of Rights stated that the ruler could not suspend Parliament’s laws, impose taxes, or raise an army without Parliament’s consent.
Members of Parliament had to be freely elected. Citizens of England had the	J i' Kf
right to a fair trial by jury in court
cases. The Bill of Rights also banned cruel and unusual	(
punishments.
Government in America
Each of the thirteen colonies
began as either a charter or a
proprietary colony. Charter
colonies were based on a
charter, a grant of rights by
the English monarch to a
company. Massachusetts was
a charter colony.

Established in 1619, the Virginia House of Burgesses was the first legislature in the English colonies. It became a foundation for the principle of self-government in colonial America and, later, the United States.

Lesson 2 143
r
In New England, town meetings were held in meeting houses like this one in Pelham, Massachusetts. Built in 1743, Pelham's Old Meeting House is the oldest town hall in continuous use in the nation.
Proprietary colonies were the property of an owner or group of owners. These proprietors ruled more or less as they wished. For example, they named their own governors and many other colonial officials. Pennsylvania was a proprietary colony.
Some colonies later became royal colonies, under direct English control. Virginia became the first royal colony in 1624. In a royal colony, Parliament appointed a governor and council, known as the upper house. The colonists selected an assembly, or lower house. The governor and
council usually did as the English king and Parliament told them. This often led to conflicts with the assembly. For example, colonists got angry when officials enforced tax or trade laws.
Not all colonists had a voice in government. In general, only white men who owned property could vote. Most women, indentured servants, landless poor, and African Americans could not vote. Still, compared to Europe, the share of the colonial population taking part in government was large. This training proved valuable when the colonies became independent.
Local Government in the Colonies
Over time, townspeople began discussing local issues at town meetings. These developed into local governments, with landowners holding the right to vote and pass laws. Because colonists in many areas took part in local government, they developed a strong belief in their right to govern themselves. Town meetings helped set the stage for the American Revolution.

English Economic Policies
GUIDINGQUESTION
How did the colonists react to England's economic policies’ Beginning in the 1600s, many European nations followed a theory known as mercantilism (MUHR.kuhn.tuh.lih.zuhm). Mercantilism holds that a country builds wealth and power by
uilding its supplies of gold and silver. To achieve this goal, a country must export, or sell to other countries, more than it

imports, or buys from other countries. A country must also seek colonies, which could supply raw materials and serve as a market for exports.
The English followed a mercantilist policy. They looked to the American colonies for raw materials, such as tobacco, rice, indigo, wheat, lumber, fur, leather, fish, and whale products. They also wanted the colonists to buy English manufactured goods, such as tools, clothing, and furniture.
To control this trade, England began passing a series of laws called Navigation Acts in the 1650s. These laws forced colonists to sell their raw materials to England even if they could get a better price elsewhere. Goods bought by the colonies from other countries in Europe had to go to England first and be taxed. All trade goods had to be carried on ships built in England or the colonies. The crews on the ships had to be English as well.

Many items in a colonial kitchen were tinware imported from England. Because of its silvery color, tinware was often called "poor man's silver." Although it was thought to be inferior to china or silver, tinware goods were less breakable than china and easier to clean than silverware.
Colonial Resistance
The colonists at first accepted the Navigation Acts because the laws guaranteed them a place to sell their raw materials.
Later, the colonists came to resent English restrictions With their population growing, colonists wanted to manufacture their own goods rather than import them from England. They also wanted to sell their products to buyers other than England. Colonial merchants began smuggling, or shipping goods without government permission or payment of taxes. Controls on trade would later cause conflict between the American colonies and England.

New American Spirit Many Americans were born in other countries. They brought with them different languages and ways of thinking. Yet in the colonies, immigrants became something new and different—they became Americans. In 1782 French writer J. Hector St. John De Crevecoeur (krev«KUHR) described this new type of person:

Life in the Colonies
guidingquestion What was life like for people living in the thirteen colonies?
The number of people living in the thirteen colonies rose from about 250,000 in 1700 to approximately 2.5 million hv the mid-1770s. The population of persons of African descent increased at an even faster rate—from about 28,000 to more than 500,000.
Immigration (im»ih»GRAY»shuhn)—the permanent moving of people into one country from other countries—was important to this growth. Between 1607 and 1775, an estimated 690,000 Europeans came to the colonies. Also during this time, traders brought in 278,000 enslaved Africans to the colonies.
There was another reason for the growing population. Colonial women tended to marry early and have large families. In addition, the colonies—especially New England—turned out to be a very healthy place to live compared to other parts of the world.
Still, compared to today, life was fragile. For example, women often died in childbirth. Outbreaks of serious diseases such as smallpox were common. Many people died in epidemics (eh.puh.DEH.mihks), outbreaks that affect large numbers of people. In 1721, for example, a smallpox epidemic in the city of Boston killed about 850 people, or 15 percent ofthe city’s population.

—from Letters from an American Farmer
A spirit of independence developed early in the history of the American people. Far from the rules and limits of their home countries, settlers began to develop their own ways of doing things. Throughout the colonies, people adapted their traditions to the new conditions of life.
Religion, education, and the arts contributed to a new American culture. The family, however, formed the basic foundation of colonial society—for those who were not enslaved, at least.
Family Roles
Men were the formal heads of the households. They managed the farm or business and represented the family in the community. On the farm, men worked in the fields and built barns, houses, and fences. Sons might work as indentured servants for local farmers or become apprentices. An apprentice (uh«PREHN«tuhs) agrees to work with a skilled craftsperson as a way of learning a trade.

Yale University in Connecticut started as a school in 1701. The University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia began as a charity school in 1740.

Widows and older women who had never married might work as teachers, nurses, or seamstresses. They could run businesses and own property, but they could not vote.

American Beliefs
guidingquestion What values and beliefs were important to the American colonists?
The American spirit and the family served as foundations for life in the colonies. In addition, Americans shared a commitment to education, strong religious beliefs, and openness to new ideas.
Colonial Education
Most colonists valued education. Parents often taught their children to read and write at home. In New England and Pennsylvania, in particular, people set up schools to make sure everyone could read and study the Bible. In 1647 the Massachusetts Puritans passed a public education law requiring communities with 50 or more families to have a public school.
The result was a high level of literacy in New England. By 1750, about 85 percent of the men and about half of the women were able to read. Many learned from The New England Primer.
Most schools in the Middle Colonies were private. Widows or unmarried women ran many of those schools. Quakers
and other religious groups ran others. In towns and cities, craftspeople often set up night schools for their apprentices. The earliest colleges were founded to train ministers.
The First Great Awakening
Religion had a strong influence in colonial life. In the 1730s and 1740s, a religious revival called the First Great Awakening swept through the colonies. In New England and the Middle Colonies, ministers called for “a new birth,” a return to the strong faith of earlier days. One such minister was Jonathan Edwards of

G.
Mayer/CORBIS Massachusetts, who gave powerful sermons. George Whitefield, an English preacher who arrived in the colonies in 1738, inspired worshipers in churches and open fields from Georgia to New England.
The Great Awakening inspired greater religious freedom. It led to the formation of many new types of churches. The new churches placed an emphasis on having personal faith rather than on church rituals. More colonists began choosing their own faiths, and the strength of established official churches declined. As a Baptist preacher noted, “The common people now claim as good a right to judge and act in matters of religion as civil rulers or the learned clergy.” This independence of thought encouraged the belief that colonists had the ability and the right to make their own decisions in government matters as well.
The Great Awakening also united colonists from north to south in a common experience. The colonists overcame regional barriers, which helped pave the way for the rapid spread of revolutionary ideas and excitement during the
struggle for independence.
The Enlightenment
By the middle of the 1700s, many educated colonists were also influenced by the Enlightenment. This movement, which began in Europe, spread the idea that knowledge, reason, and science could improve society.
In the colonies, the Enlightenment increased interest in science. People observed nature, staged experiments, and published their findings, much as Benjamin Franklin did.
The Enlightenment also promoted freedom of thought and expression, a belief in equality, and the idea of popular government.
Ideas of Freedom
Freedom of the press became an important issue in colonial America. Newspapers in colonial cities, such as Boston and Philadelphia, carried political news and often faced government censorship. Censorship is the banning of printed materials because they contain unpopular or offensive ideas.
Ministers such as George Whitefield (shown below) and Jonathan Edwards swayed crowds with their vivid, emotional style of preaching.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
The Patriots used skill, cunning, and determination to survive early defeats and win a key victory at Saratoga.
The Two Armies Face Off
guidingquestion Who were the opposing sides in the American Revolution?
In April 1776, colonial leader John Adams predicted, “Weshall have a long ... and bloody war to go through.” Few people agreed with him. Each side thought they would win the war quickly. The British planned to crush the colonists by force. Most Patriots—Americans who supported independence-believed the British would give up after losing one or two major battles.
British Advantages
As the war began, the British seemed to have a big advantage. They had the strongest navy in the world. The British also had a well-trained army. They were supported by the wealth of their empire. Great Britain also had more people. More than 8 million people lived in Britain. There were only 2.5 million Americans.
The Patriots did not seem to be a match for the British. They had no regular army and a weak navy. American soldiers also lacked experience and weapons for fighting. Much of the Patriot military force was in the form of militia groups. These
volunteer soldiers fought only for short periods of time and then returned home.
£§
In addition, not all Americans supported the struggle for independence. Some Americans remained loyal to Britain.
Others, such as the Quakers, were neutral. They would not take part in the war because they opposed all armed conflict.
Loyalists in the Colonies
At least one in five Americans was thought to be a “Loyalist” or “Tory.” The number may have been as high as one in three. These Americans remained loyal to Britain and opposed independence. Some Americans changed sides during the war. Loyalist support also varied from region to region. In general, support for Britain was strongest in the Carolinas and Georgia and weakest in New England.
Loyalists had reasons to support Britain. Some depended on the British for their jobs. Some feared the Revolution would throw America into chaos. Others simply could not understand why the colonies wanted independence. For them, Patriot complaints seemed minor and not worth fighting over.
The British actively sought the support of African Americans. Virginia’s royal governor, Lord Dunmore, promised freedom to those African Americans who joined the British cause. Many men answered his call. Eventually, some of them ended up free in Canada. Others settled in the British colony of Sierra Leone in Africa.
Loyalty to Britain divided friends and family. For example, William Franklin, son of Patriot Benjamin Franklin, was a Loyalist who had served as a royal governor of New Jersey. This disagreement caused lasting damage to their relationship. As one Connecticut man observed: “Neighbor [was] ... against
neighbor, father against son and son against
father, and he that would not thrust his own
blade through his brother’s heart was called
an infamous villain.”

Made in the 1750s, the Liberty Bell hung in the Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall).
Legend has it that on July 8,1776, the bell’s ringing announced the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence. The Liberty Bell also rang every Fourth of July and for many public events until a crack appeared in about 1846. Today, the Liberty Bell stands as a symbol of freedom. Why do you think such symbols are important to the people of a country?
The Continental Army was made up mostly of inexperienced soldiers.

During the Revolutionary War, women could not officially join the army. A few managed to fight in disguise. Many more served as cooks, nurses, or even spies.
Today, about 400,000 women serve in the American armed forces, reserves, and National Guard.

The Patriot soldier also had greater motivation, or sense of purpose. The British relied on mercenaries (MUHR.suh. nehr.eez), or hired soldiers, to fight for them. The Americans called these mercenaries “Hessians” (HEH.shuhnz) after the region in Germany from which most of them came. The Patriots fought for the freedom of their own land. This gave them a greater stake in the war’s outcome than soldiers who fought for money. The Americans also lured the Hessians away with promises of land.
The Patriots’ greatest advantage was probably their leader, George Washington. Few could match him for courage and determination. The war might have taken a different turn without Washington.
The Continental Army
After the Declaration of Independence, the Continental Congress served as the national government. However, the Congress lacked the power to raise money through taxes. Delegates led by James Madison of Virginia called for a stronger national government to bind the colonies together. They believed that winning independence was possible only under a strong national government.
Not every American agreed. They placed great value on liberty and personal freedom. After rejecting the rule of the British Parliament, they were unwilling to transfer power to their own Continental Congress. As a result, the American Revolution was in some ways 13 separate wars, with each state fighting for its own interests. This made it hard for the Congress to get soldiers and raise money.
Local militia made up a key part of the Patriot forces. These troops were limited. Many were farmers who needed to provide for their families and did not want to leave their fields unattended. The Patriots also needed well-trained soldiers who could fight the British throughout the colonies. To meet this need, the Congress established the Continental Army, which depended on the states to recruit (ree.KROOT) soldiers.
At first, soldiers signed up for just one year, but General Washington asked for longer terms. “If we ever hope for success, he said, we must have men enlisted for the whole term of the war. Eventually, the Continental Congress invited soldiers to sign up for three years or until the war ended. Most soldiers, however, still signed up for only one year.

The Continental Army also had a hard time finding officers— qualified military commanders. Some were young men who were recruited from the ranks. The best officers had experience from previous, or earlier, wars.
Men did all the fighting—with a few exceptions. For example, Margaret Corbin of Pennsylvania went with her husband when he joined the Continental Army. After he died in battle, she took his place. Mary Ludwig Hays McCauley joined her husband in battle as well. The soldiers called her “Moll of the Pitcher,” or “Molly Pitcher,” because she carried water pitchers to the soldiers. Legend has it she also took part in combat. On February 21, 1822, Pennsylvania recognized Molly Pitcher’s service by granting her an annual payment of $40. Deborah Sampson of Massachusetts took a different route to the battlefield. She joined up as a soldier by disguising herself as a man.

Relatively few soldiers fought in the war s early battles. At Bunker Hill, for example, about 2,200 British soldiers fought 1,200 Americans. The British had not yet won a clear victory. They realized they were going to need more troops.
During the summer of 1776, Britain sent 32,000 troops across the Atlantic to New York. The British commander, General William Howe, hoped the sheer size of his army would convince the Patriots to give up. He was soon disappointed.

Patriot Defeat on Long Island
Only 20,000 soldiers made up the Patriot force under George Washington. Yet the Americans were determined to fight. The two sides clashed in the Battle of Long Island in late August 1776. The British badly defeated the outnumbered Continental Army.
One Patriot, Nathan Hale, showed his bravery at Long Island. Hale disguised himself as a Dutch schoolteacher and went to spy on British troops. The British caught Hale and hanged him as punishment. According to legend, Hale went to his death
saying, “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.”
The Patriots fought hard on Long Island but could not overcome the larger and better-equipped British army.
A
British officer wrote that many Patriot soldiers killed on Long Island had not been wearing shoes, socks, or jackets. “They are also in great want of blankets,” he said, predicting that the rebels would suffer during the winter. After the defeat, Washington retreated from New York, which became a Loyalist stronghold. The British chased the Continental Army across New jersey into Pennsylvania. Satisfied that Washington was beaten, the British let him go.
A
Low Point for the Patriots Washington and his forces had managed to escape the British. As winter approached, however, the Patriots’ cause was near collapse The Continental Army had fewer than 5,000 soldiers. Many had completed their terms. Others had run away.

Washington begged the Continental Congress for more troops. He suggested allowing free African Americans to enlist, but many Americans opposed this idea. Early in the war, the Southern Colonies had persuaded the Congress not to take this step. Many white people in the South worried about giving guns and training to African Americans. They feared the possibility of revolt among the enslaved population.

African Americans in Battle
The growing need for soldiers led some states to ignore the ban on African Americans. Rhode Island raised an all-African American regiment in 1778. By the war’s end, every state except South Carolina enlisted African Americans to fight.
Historians believe that as many as 5,000 African Americans joined the Patriots. One example was Peter Salem, an enslaved African American from Massachusetts. Salem fought at Concord and at the Battle of Bunker Hill and served the Patriot cause throughout the war. In return for his service, Salem won his freedom. Another Massachusetts Patriot, Wentworth Cheswell, was a free African American. Like Paul Revere, Cheswell made a midnight ride on horseback to warn local residents that British soldiers were coming. He later fought heroically in the Battle of Saratoga.
African Americans had many reasons to fight. Some fought 5 because they believed in the Patriot cause of freedom and liberty, j Others may have joined up for the chance to earn money. Some I were enslaved Africans who had run away or who, like Salem, were « allowed by their slaveholders to enlist.

The Battles of Trenton and Princeton
While the Patriots were struggling through the winter, the main British force was settled in New York. The British also left some troops in Princeton and Trenton, New Jersey. Washington saw a chance to catch the British by surprise.
Washington was camped in Pennsylvania, across the Delaware River from the British camp in New Jersey. On Christmas night 1776, Washington led 2,400 troops across the icy river to surprise the enemy at Trenton the next day. Washington then escaped and marched to Princeton; his army scattered the British force there.

First, General John Burgoyne would lead troops south from Canada. At the same time, Lieutenant Colonel Barry St. Leger would move east from Lake Ontario. A third group, under General Howe, would move north up the Hudson. The three British forces would then attack Patriot troops at Albany.
The British Capture Philadelphia
Before the attack on Albany, Howe sought to capture
Philadelphia—the home of the Continental Congress. Howe won battles in September 1777 at Brandywine and Paoli, near Philadelphia. Then Howe’s troops captured Philadelphia, forcing the Continental Congress to flee. By now, winter was coming. Howe decided to stay in Philadelphia instead of going to Albany. The Battle of Saratoga
Meanwhile, the British plan for taking Albany was in trouble. In August, American soldiers led by Benedict Arnold stopped St. Leger at Fort Stanwix, New York.
General Burgoyne’s army had not reached Albany either. In July he captured Fort Ticonderoga, but he needed supplies. He sent a force to the American supply base at Bennington, Vermont. A local militia group, the Green Mountain Boys, defeated them. Burgoyne retreated to Saratoga, New York.
Here Burgoyne found himself in serious trouble—and alone. Patriots had stopped St. Leger at Fort Stanwix. Howe was still in Philadelphia. Now American troops under General Horatio Gates blocked and surrounded Burgoyne’s army. Burgoyne made a desperate attack on October 7. The Patriots held firm.
On October 17, 1777, General Burgoyne surrendered. The British plan had failed. The Continental Army had won an enormous victory that changed the course of the war.

Gaining Allies
guiding question How did America gain allies?
By late 1777, Benjamin Franklin had been in France lor a year. He was trying to get the French to support the Americans’ fight for independence. With his skill and charm, Franklin gained many friends for the United States. The French had secretly given the Americans money, but they had not entered the war.
The Continental Congress sent Jonathan Austin of Boston to France to deliver the news of the American victory at Saratoga. As soon as Austin arrived, Franklin asked if the British had taken Philadelphia. Austin answered, “Yes sir. . . . But sir, I have greater news than that. General Burgoyne and his whole army are prisoners of war!”
Franklin surely understood the importance of this news. The victory at Saratoga was a turning point in the American Revolution. France and other nations now realized that the Americans might actually win their war against Great Britain. France decided to help the Americans. In February 1778, France declared war on Britain and sent money, equipment, and troops to aid the American Patriots.

Like France, Spain also decided to help the Americans. Spain did not form an alliance with the United States, but it did declare war on Great Britain in 1779. Spanish forces fought the British in present-day Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. This fighting kept many British troops out of action against the Americans.
Winter at Valley Forge
In 1778 news traveled slowly across the Atlantic. People in the United States did not learn of the French-American alliance until the spring. Meanwhile, British general Howe and his forces spent the winter in comfort in Philadelphia. Washington set up camp at Valley Forge, about 20 miles (32 km) to the west. There, Washington and his troops suffered through a terrible winter. They lacked decent food, clothing, shelter, and medicine. Washington’s greatest challenge at Valley Forge was keeping the Continental Army together.
Snowstorms and damaged roads slowed delivery of supplies. The Continental Army built huts and gathered supplies from the countryside. Several volunteers—including Washington’s wife, Martha—made clothes for the troops and cared for the sick.
| Washington declared that no army had ever put up with “such I uncommon hardships” with such spirit. “Naked and starving as I they are,” he wrote, “we cannot enough admire the incomparable i patience and fidelity [faithfulness] of the soldiery.”
Benjamin Franklin served as America’s first ambassador to France. French nobles and thinkers greatly admired the American. Much like a singer or actor today, Franklin became a star in America and Europe. Fashionable women even wore a hairstyle meant to look like a fur cap Franklin wore. How might Franklin’s popularity have helped the Patriot cause?
Martha Washington, shown here on the arm of George Washington, helped lift the spirits of the army during the bitter winter at Valley Forge.

Foreigners Help on the Battlefield
The Patriot cause had supporters around the world. A number of individuals from other nations gave their talents to the cause.
One leader at Valley Forge was the Marquis de Lafayette (lah*fee»EHT) of France. He had come to the United States as a 19-year-old volunteer in June 1777. Lafayette was excited about the ideas expressed in the Declaration of Independence, and he wanted to join the battle for freedom. He believed that the American cause represented the future of humankind.
When he reached the United States, Lafayette offered his services to General Washington. He agreed to serve without pay and became a trusted aide to Washington.
Other Europeans volunteered to work for the Patriot cause. Two Polish men—Thaddeus Kosciuszko (kawsh«CHUSH«KOH) and Casimir Pulaski (poo*LAHS»kee)—supported American efforts. Kosciuszko helped build important defenses for the Americans. Pulaski won promotion to the rank of general. He died in 1779, fighting for the Continental Army.
Friedrich von Steuben (vahn STOO«buhn) also came to help Washington. Von Steuben had been an officer in the Prussian army. He helped to train the Patriot troops at Valley Forge and shape the ragged Continental Army into a more effective fighting force.
In 1778 Spaniard Juan de Miralles (mee*RAH*yays) arrived in Philadelphia. He had persuaded Spain, Cuba, and Mexico to send money to the United States. Miralles became friends with many Patriot leaders and lent money to the cause.
Europeans who had recently moved to the United States also joined the Patriot cause. For example, almost two-thirds of the soldiers in Pennsylvania regiments were foreign-born.
Even with the help of foreign nations and individuals, the Patriots faced a huge challenge. The Continental Army still needed large amounts of money to fight the war and defeat the British.

During the war, Congress and the states printed paper money. Over time, people came to question the value of this paper money, and the amounts required to make purchases rose.
CRITICAL THINKING
Identifying Cause and Effect What happened when people began to question the value of the paper money?
Problems in the Economy
Raising funds to pay for the war was a great challenge. The Continental Congress had no power to tax. The Congress did get some money from the states and borrowed money from friendly countries such as France, Spain, and Holland. Wealthy Patriots such as Haym Salomon and Robert Morris also lent large sums of money to the war effort. Yet these amounts fell far short of the need.
To meet this need, the Congress and the states simply printed hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of paper money. The paper money quickly lost its value. The face value of bills was greater than the supply of gold and silver backing them. This led to inflation (in«FLAY»shun), which means that it took more and more money to buy the same amount of goods. People began to have doubts about how much their paper bills were worth. Congress stopped printing paper money because no one would use it. This left the Americans with no way to finance their fight for independence.
New Ways of Thinking
The ideals of liberty and freedom inspired the American Revolution. These same ideals also caused some women to question their role in American society.
Abigail Adams was one example. In 1776 she wrote a letter to her husband, John Adams, a member of Congress, arguing for women’s rights:

Questioning Slavery
The revolutionary quest for freedom and liberty led some white Americans to question slavery. In 1778 Governor William Livingston of New Jersey asked his government to free all enslaved people. He said slavery was “utterly inconsistent with the principles of Christianity and humanity.”
African Americans made similar arguments. In New Hampshire, enslaved people asked the government for their freedom so “that the name of slave may not be heard in a land gloriously contending for the sweets of freedom.”
As you have read, African Americans fought for the American cause and hoped the Revolution would help end slavery. The Pennsylvania legislature in 1780 adopted a plan to gradually free enslaved people—the first legislature in the world to take such action against slavery. Other Northern states soon took similar measures. Still, the issue of slavery would remain unsettled for many years.
Treatment of Loyalists
Not all Americans supported the Patriot cause. During the war, thousands of Loyalists fought on the side of the British. Some Loyalists spied on the Patriots. Many Loyalists fled, packing their belongings and selling whatever they could.
Some left hurriedly for England. Others took off for Spanish-owned Florida.
Known Loyalists who remained in the United States faced difficult times. Their neighbors often shunned them. Some became victims of violence. Loyalists who actively helped the British faced arrest. In a few rare cases, Patriots executed Loyalists.

Fighting in the West
guiding question How did the war in the West develop?
The Revolutionary War was of great interest to many Native American groups living in and around the 13 states. Some Native Americans helped the Patriots. More sided with the British. For them, the British seemed less of a threat than the Americans, who lived in their midst and took their land.
West of the Appalachian Mountains, the British and their Native American allies raided American settlements. Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant led a number of brutal attacks in southwestern New York and northern Pennsylvania. Farther west, Henry Hamilton, the British commander at Detroit, paid Native Americans for settlers’ scalps. This practice earned him the nickname, the “hair buyer.”
Virginia militia leader George Rogers Clark set out to end attacks in the West. In July 1778, Clark led a force of 175 westward down the Ohio River and over land. The Patriots captured a British post at Kaskaskia (ka.SKAS.kee.uh) in present-day Illinois. They then took the British town of Vincennes (vin.SEHNZ) in present-day Indiana. British troops under Hamilton recaptured Vincennes that December. Clark vowed to get it back. In February 1779, Clark and his troops

guiding question What was the result of the war at sea?
The Revolutionary War also took place at sea. Here Great Britain’s powerful navy enjoyed a major advantage. British vessels formed an effective blockade (blah»KAYD), keeping ships from entering or leaving American harbors. The blockade limited delivery of supplies and troops to Patriot forces.
Privateers
To break the blockade, Congress ordered 13 warships, but only two of the ships made it to sea. Several were quickly captured by the British. The American navy was too weak to operate well.
Congress also authorized some 2,000 ships to sail as privateers. A privateer (pry»vuh»TEER) is a privately owned merchant ship outfitted with weapons. The goal of the privateer is to capture enemy merchant ships and cargo.
Finding crews for these ships was not difficult. Sailors from the whaling and fishing ports of New England signed on eagerly for the profitable privateering trade. During the war, privateers captured more British ships than the American navy did.

guidingquestioim What was the result of the war in the South?
In the early years of the war, the Americans had won several
battles in the South. In 1776 Patriot forces crushed Loyalists at tl.
Battle of Moore’s Creek, near Wilmington, North Carolina. The)
also saved the key port of Charles Town, South Carolina, from th
British. Although this was a small battle, its impact on the rest o: the war was great.

210 The American Revolution
By 1778, these results, along with Patriot victories such as Saratoga, had convinced the British that bringing their old colonies back into the empire would not be easy. As a result, the British came up with a new plan to finish the war.
The new British plan focused on the South, where there were many Loyalists. The British hoped to use sea power and the support of the Loyalists to win important victories in the Southern states. At first, the strategy worked.
Early British Success
In late 1778, British general Henry Clinton sent 3,500 troops from New York to take Savannah, Georgia. The British occupied the coastal city and controlled most of the state.
Clinton himself led a force into the South in early 1780.
In May, he led a second British attack on Charles Town. This time the South Carolina city surrendered, and the British took thousands of prisoners. It marked the worst American defeat of the war.
After Clinton’s victory, he returned to New York. He left General Charles Cornwallis in command of British forces in the South. The Continental Congress sent forces under General Horatio Gates to face Cornwallis. The two armies met at Camden, South Carolina, in August 1780. The British won this first encounter. Yet Cornwallis soon found that he could not control the area he had conquered. He and his troops faced a new kind of warfare.

Hit-and-Run Tactics
The British had counted on strong Loyalist support in the South. They received less help than expected. Instead, as British forces moved through the countryside, small forces of Patriots attacked them. These bands of soldiers appeared suddenly, fired their weapons, and then disappeared. This hit-and-run technique caught the British off guard.
Francis Marion was one successful Patriot leader. Marion, who was known as the “Swamp Fox,” operated out of the swamps of eastern South Carolina. He was quick and smart. One British colonel grumbled that “the devil himself” could not catch Marion. Spain's Help
Great Britain also found itself with another new enemy. Spain declared war on Britain in 1779. The Spanish governor of Louisiana, Bernardo de Galvez (GAHL»ves), had tons of supplies and ammunition shipped up the Mississippi River to American troops in the Northwest Territory. It was with this help that George Rogers Clark captured the key posts of Kaskaskia and Vincennes. Galvez also raised an army to fight the British. Galvez’s forces drove the British out of the Gulf of Mexico region.
American Successes
After their victory at Camden, South Carolina, the British moved northward through the Carolinas in September 1780. Along the way, the British warned the local people to give up the fight for independence and join the British. If they refused, the British threatened to “hang their leaders, and lay their country waste..
The Americans who received this warning were mountain people. Fiercely independent, they had been neither Patriots nor Loyalists until the British warning angered them. They formed a militia army and set out to force the British from their land. At Kings Mountain, the American militia force killed or captured a British-led Loyalist force of about 1,000. The Patriot victory brought new support for independence from Southerners.
In October 1780, Nathanael Greene replaced Gates as commander of the Continental forces in the South. Rather than lead one attack on Cornwallis’s forces, Greene split his army in two. In January 1781, one section defeated the British at Cowpens, South Carolina. Another section joined Francis Marion’s raids. Greene combined his forces in March. Then, he met Cornwallis s

Cornwallis Retreats
Cornwallis realized the British had to act quickly to win the war. More French troops were coming to North America, and the Patriots held Virginia. Troops and supplies were moving south.
In April 1781, Cornwallis marched north to Virginia.
His troops carried out raids throughout the region. General Washington sent Lafayette and General Anthony Wayne south to push Cornwallis back. Meanwhile, Cornwallis took shelter at Yorktown, on the Virginia coast. The battle for the South was entering its final phase.

Victory at Yorktown
guiding question What events occurred in the victory at Yorktown?
While the British were carrying out their southern campaign, key events were taking place in the North. In July 1780, French warships appeared off Newport, Rhode Island. The ships carried French soldiers commanded by Comte de Rochambeau (Row*sham*BOH).
Eventually, Rochambeau joined up with General Washington, who was camped north of New York City. There the two leaders waited for the arrival of a second fleet of French ships. If and when the second French fleet arrived, Washington planned to attack the British army base in New York, which was under the command of General Henry Clinton.
Instead, both the ships and the troops would find a better opportunity to strike at the British. That opportunity would come farther south—at Yorktown, Virginia.
Washington Leaves for Virginia
As he waited outside New York, Washington followed reports of fighting in the South. In 1781 he sent Lafayette and Anthony to Virginia to stop Cornwallis. Once in Virginia, Lafayette sent many spies to the nearby British camp. None was as important as James, an enslaved African held by William Armistead. The secret

information James gathered helped Lafayette pin down Cornwallis and his army on a peninsula, a piece of land surrounded by water on three sides. The place was called Yorktown.
Washington also got important news about the French fleet he was waiting for: The ships were heading toward Chesapeake Bay instead of New York. They were going to join in the fight to defeat Cornwallis. With this news, Washington quickly changed his plans. He and Rochambeau would advance on the British at Yorktown rather than at New York.
Washington kept his new strategy, or plan of action, secret. He wanted Clinton to think the Patriots still planned to attack at New York. This, he hoped, would keep Clinton from sending aid to Cornwallis.
Washington and Rochambeau then rushed south with their armies. Secrecy was strict. Most soldiers did not know where they were going. One wrote, “We do not know the object of our march, and are in perfect ignorance whether we are going against New York, or... Virginia.”
The French and American troops marched 200 miles (322 km) in 15 days. General Clinton did not learn they were gone until it was too late. There was nothing he could do to stop the three forces—
Lafayette’s troops, Washington’s and Rochambeau’s army, and the French fleet—from meeting at Yorktown. View the map of the siege at Yorktown.
A
Trap at Yorktown Washington’s plan worked perfectly. By the end of September, 14,000 American and French troops stood against Cornwallis’s 8,000 British and Hessian troops at Yorktown. Meanwhile, the French fleet kept guard at Chesapeake Bay. British ships could not get in to help Cornwallis escape by sea. General Clinton and the rest of the British army sat helplessly in New York. They were unable to help Cornwallis. The British were trapped.
American and French forces began a siege (SEEJ)—they blocked off the British supply and escape routes. In this way, they hoped to force the British to surrender.

HISTORIAN
Making Predictions
Throughout the Revolutionary War, Washington succeeded in holding his army together, despite many difficulties. One of these difficulties was political meddling. The Continental Congress often interfered with his military operations. During the gloomy winter at Valley Forge, some members of Congress and army officers plotted to replace Washington as commander in chief. How might Washington’s removal or resignation have affected the war?
In August 1781, Comte de Rochambeau joined Washington's Continental Army in its march to Yorktown.

Victory Over Cornwallis
The siege began to take effect. The British ran low on supplies and many soldiers were wounded or sick. On October 14, Washington’s aide, Alexander Hamilton, led an attack that captured key British defenses. Cornwallis could see that the situation was hopeless. On October 19, he surrendered his troops. The Patriots had won the Battle of Yorktown. They took nearly 8,000 British prisoners and captured more than 200 heavy guns.
At the surrender ceremony, the British marched between rows of French and American troops. A French band played “Yankee Doodle.” This was a song the British had used to taunt the Americans. A British band responded with a children’s tune, “The World Turned Upside Down.” With the mighty British surrendering to the upstart Americans, it seemed a fitting song for the situation.

Independence Achieved
guiding question What helped the Patriots win independence?
The Patriot victory at Yorktown was a terrible blow to the British and their war effort. Still, the fighting went on after Cornwallis surrendered. The British still held Savannah, Charles Town, and New York. There would be a few more clashes on land and sea. However, the defeat at Yorktown convinced the British that the war was too costly to pursue, or proceed with.
The Americans and British sent delegates to Paris to work out a treaty. Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay represented the United States. The American Congress ratified (RAT»ih«fyed), or approved, the first draft of the treaty in April 1783. The final Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3,1783. By that time Britain had also made peace with France and Spain.
Under the Treaty of Paris, Great Britain recognized the United States as an independent nation. The British also promised to withdraw all their troops from American territory. They gave Americans fishing rights to the waters off the coast of nearby Canada.
In turn, the United States promised that Americans would pay British merchants what they owed. The treaty also stated that the Congress would advise the new states to return property taken from Loyalists.
A
Conspiracy Against Congress Many months passed between the end of fighting in the Revolutionary War and the signing of the peace treaty. During that time, Washington was unwilling to dissolve the army. Instead, he camped his idle troops in Newburgh, New York.
Many of these soldiers believed they were owed pay from the Congress. When this pay did not come, the soldiers grew angry. Some officers sent a letter around in March 1783. If their demands were not met, the letter said, the army should use force against the Congress.
Washington realized that this threat of revolt was dangerous. The new nation could be destroyed. In a dramatic speech, he asked the angry soldiers to be patient. Then Washington urged the Congress to meet their just demands. The Congress agreed.
Washingtons leadership ended the threat to the new nation.
British forces first sang "Yankee Doodle" to poke fun at what they considered the awkward ways of the Americans. The Americans, however, quickly made "Yankee Doodle" their own. They created new verses that made fun of the British and praised George Washington.

Lesson 4 217
Washington Returns Home
In late November 1783, the war truly ended. The last British troops left New York City. Washington could at last give up his command. The soldiers could return to their homes and their lives.
On December 4, Washington said farewell to his troops. Three weeks later he formally resigned, or gave up his position, at a meeting of the Congress. Washington said,
“Having now finished the work assigned me, I retire ... and take my leave of all the employments of public life.” Washington returned home to Mount Vernon, Virginia. There he planned to remain
and live quietly with his family.
After the war, Washington looked forward to a return to his home, Mount Vernon, in Virginia. He planned to take no role in the new government.
CRITICAL THINKING
Speculating Why do you think Washington hoped to get away from public life? Why the Americans Won
How did the Americans defeat powerful Great Britain? Remember, the Americans had several advantages in the war. First, they fought on their own land. The British had to move troops and supplies across an ocean. It was harder for them to get reinforcements, as the siege of Yorktown showed. When their ships were blocked, the British troops had no support.
Also, the Americans knew the land. They knew where to lay in ambush (AM»bush), or surprise attack. They were expert at wilderness fighting. The British, in contrast, had much difficulty controlling the American countryside once they occupied the cities. The Battle of Kings Mountain, which you read about in Lesson 3, illustrates this point. The rural people did not like being told what to do. They also had wilderness fighting skills that could defeat their new enemies.
Help from other countries contributed to the American
victory. The success at Yorktown would not have been possible without French soldiers and ships. Spain gave aid when they attacked the British. Individuals, such as Lafayette and von Steuben, came to America to provide vital services to the Patriot cause.

.8 The American Revolution
Perhaps most important, the American Revolution was a movement of the people. Its outcome depended not on any one battle or event but on the determination and spirit of all Patriots. As Washington remarked about the patriotic crowds, “Here is an army they [the British] will never conquer.”
In 1776 the American colonists began a revolution. In the Declaration of Independence they outlined the principles of freedom and the rights they felt all peoples and nations should have. These ideas inspired people in other parts of the world.
For example, French rebels in 1789 began a revolution in defense of “Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.” The French upheld these principles: “Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.”
In 1791 there was revolution in the French colony of Saint Domingue. Inspired by the ideals of the American and French revolutions, enslaved
Africans took up arms. They were led
by a man named Toussaint L’Ouverture
(too»SAN loo»vuhr«TOOR) and soon
shook off French rule. In 1804 Saint
Domingue—present-day Haiti—became
the second nation in the Americas to
achieve independence from colonial
rule. “We have asserted our rights,”
declared the revolutionaries. “We
swear never to yield them to any power
on earth.”

During the era of the early republic that followed the American Revolution, the young nation struggled to resolve these questions States Write Constitutions
The Continental Congress took up this last question even before declaring independence. In May 1776, Congress asked the states to organize their governments. Each state adopted a state constitution or plan of government. Eight states had drafted constitutions before
e end of the year. New York and Georgia followed in 1777 and assachuse«s in 1780. Connecticut and Rhode Island decided to

States also divided power between the governor (or council) and the legislature. Most states set up two-house, or bicameral, legislatures to divide the work of government even further.
The first state constitutions aimed to keep power in the hands of the people. For example, voters chose the state legislators, and states held elections often. In most states, only white males who were at least 21 years old could vote.
Because state constitutions limited the powers of the governors, the legislatures became the most powerful branch of government. The state legislatures tried to make taxes fair for everyone, but disagreements arose. The shift from British colonies to self-governing states held many challenges.
A
New Republic The American people also had to form a national government. People agreed the new country should be a constitutional republic, a government in which citizens rule through elected representatives. These representatives would serve for a specific term of office and pledge to govern by the laws set down in a written constitution, or plan of government.
At first, most Americans wanted a weak central government.
They expected that each state would remain free to act independently on most issues. The states would rely on a central government only to wage war and handle relations with other countries.

Creating the Articles of Confederation
In the summer of 1776—while also drafting the Declaration of Independence—the Second Continental Congress appointed a committee to write a plan for a new central government. The result was the Articles of Confederation. After much debate, Congress adopted the Articles—the nation’s first constitution-in November 1777.
The Articles of Confederation established a weak central government. The states kept most of their power. For the states, the Articles of Confederation were “a firm league of friendship” in which each state retained “its sovereignty, freedom, and independence.”
The Articles of Confederation gave the Congress the powerto conduct foreign affairs, maintain armed forces, borrow money, and issue currency. Congress did not have the power to regulate trade, force citizens to join the army, or impose taxes. If Congress needed to raise money or troops, it had to ask the states. States were not required to contribute.
The new central government had no chief executive. This is an official, such as a president or a governor, who carries out the laws and leads the government in its day-to-day operations. Under the Articles of Confederation, government carried on its business, such as selling western lands, through congressional committees All the states had to approve the Articles and any
amendments. Yet not every state supported the Articles of
Confederation at first. Under the new plan, each state had one vote regardless of population. States with large populations believed they should have more votes.
Disputes over western lands delayed ratification of the Articles By the 1780s, seven of the original states laid claim to areas west of the Appalachians. Maryland refused to approve the Articles until New York, Virginia, and other states abandoned their land claims and ceded, or gave up, such territory to the national government. This done, Maryland joined the other 12 states in approving the Articles. On March 1, 1781, the Confederation formally became the government of the United States of America.

Summarize the basic problem with the Articles of Confederation.
Congress could not pass a law unless nine states voted in favor of it. Changing the Articles required the approval of all 13 states. This made it hard for Congress to pass laws or amend the Articles when there was any disagreement.
Even with these challenges, the new government managed some key achievements. Under the Confederation government, Americans negotiated a peace treaty with Britain and expanded the country’s foreign trade. The Confederation also helped with settling and governing the country’s western lands.

Policies for Western Lands
guiding question What process allowed new states tojoin the union?
The Articles of Confederation did not propose a way to add new states to the United States. Yet there were settlers living west of the Appalachian Mountains, outside the existing states. These Western settlers wanted to organize their lands as states and join the Union.
Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, the British gave up control of the land north of the Ohio River and west of the Appalachian Mountains. Many Americans were eager to settle in this region. The new United States government had to establish policies for settlement of these western lands. Another challenge was to come up with an orderly process by which new territories could achieve the status of statehood.
The Ordinance of 1785
In 1785 the Confederation Congress passed an ordinance, or law, that set up a process to survey and sell the lands north of the Ohio River. The new law divided this large area into townships.

Lesson 1 229
Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress could not tax citizens directly. Congress raised money by selling land in the Northwest Territory. The Ordinance divided land into townships, 6 miles (10 km) to a side. This created 36 square miles, or "sections."

Identifying Central Issues Why do you think Congress set up such a precise system for measuring out and dividing up the land?

Each township was 6 miles long (9.7 km) and 6 miles wide (9.7 km). These townships were to be further divided into 36 sections of 640 acres (259 ha). The government would sell each section at public auction, or sale, for at least a dollar an acre. Concerned about lawless people moving into western lands, Richard Henry Lee, the president of the Congress, urged that “the rights of property be clearly defined” by the government. Congress drafted another law to protect the interests of hardworking settlers.
The Northwest Ordinance
The Northwest Ordinance, passed in 1787, guaranteed the property rights of settlers and provided a democratic model for national expansion. It created a single Northwest Territory from lands north ofthe Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River. The lands were to be divided into three to five smaller territories. When a territory had 60,000 residents, the people could seek statehood. Each new state would have the same standing as the original 13 states.

It also stated, “There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in said territory.” This clause, or condition added to a document, marked the first attempt to stop the spread of slavery in the United States. The Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance attempted to make possible the settlement of the Northwest Territory in a peaceful and orderly way. In general, the laws were successful.
The United States Congress would later take a similar step in the South. In 1798 it created the Mississippi Territory from land west of Georgia. Congress organized the government of the territory in the same basic way as in the Northwest Territory— except that slavery was allowed.
Land Act of 1800
The Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance aimed to encourage settlement in the Northwest Territory. In time it became clear that people needed even more help. In 1800 Congress passed the Land Act. The act made it possible for people to pay for land a little at a time. Under the terms of this law, a person was required to buy at least 320 acres of land at a price of $2 per acre. The buyer could pay half of the money at the time of purchase and the rest in four yearly payments.

depreciate to fall in value
Problems at Home and Abroad
GUIDING QUESTION
In whatways was the Confederation government weak? Because of its weakness, the Confederation government had trouble with financial issues. Continentals, paper bills the Continental Congress had printed during the war, did not hold their value. By 1781, the currency had depreciated (dih«PREE«shee*ayt*ed), or fallen in value, so far that it was worth almost nothing. As more continentals appeared, people realized that Congress could not exchange or trade in the bills for gold or silver. The public began to doubt the money was worth anything. In 1779 it took 40 continentals to buy a single Spanish silver dollar. By 1781, a person needed 146 continentals to buy that Spanish coin. “Not worth a continental” became a common saying. At the same time, the price of food and other goods soared. In Boston and some other areas, high prices led to food riots.
In the 1780s, the Continental Congress faced a large debt. During the Revolutionary War, Congress had borrowed money from American citizens and foreign governments. It still owed Revolutionary soldiers pay for their military service. Without the power to tax, the Confederation could not easily raise money to pay its debts. The Continental Congress asked the states for money, but it could not force the states to pay. In fact, the states provided less than half of the money the federal government asked them to contribute.
Plan for Import Tax
Congress faced a collapse of the country’s finances. In 1781 it created a department of finance led by Philadelphia merchant Robert Morris. While serving in Congress, Morris had proposed a 5 percent tax on imported goods to help pay the national debt. The plan required a change to the Articles of Confederation. Twelve states approved the plan, but Rhode Island opposed it. Under the Articles, the single “no” vote was enough to block the plan. A second effort in 1783 also failed to win approval by all the states. The financial crisis grew worse.
Relations With Britain
Trouble with foreign governments also revealed the weaknesses o the American government. For example, American merchants complained that the British were blocking Americans from the
A
More Perfect Union West Indies and other British markets. In the Treaty of Paris of 1783, Britain had promised to withdraw from the lands east of the Mississippi River. British troops, however, continued to occupy several forts in the Great Lakes region.
In 1785 Congress sent John Adams to London to discuss these problems. Adams found the British unwilling to talk. They pointed to the failure of the United States to honor its promises made in the Treaty of Paris. The British claimed that Americans had agreed to pay Loyalists for the property taken from them during the Revolutionary War. Congress had proposed that the states pay the Loyalists. The states simply refused, and Congress could do nothing about it.
Relations With Spain
The United States had even greater problems with Spain. This European power, which controlled Florida as well as lands west of the Mississippi River, wanted to stop American expansion into its territory. To do this, Spain closed the lower Mississippi River to American shipping in 1784. Western settlers could no longer use the Mississippi River, which they relied on to ship goods to market.
In 1786 American diplomats reached a new trade agreement with Spain. Representatives from the Southern states, however, blocked the agreement because it did not include the right to use the Mississippi River.
The weakness of the Confederation and its inability to deal with problems worried many leaders, including George Washington. Americans began to agree that the country needed

Reading HELPDESK
A growing number of Americans became convinced that the government under the Articles of Confederation was too weak to deal with the country’s problems. Among these problems were serious economic difficulties.
After the Revolutionary War, the United States went through a depression, a period when economic activity slows and unemployment increases. Wartime damage to Southern plantations led to a sharp drop in rice exports. Trade also fell off when the British closed the West Indies market to American merchants. The little money the government did have went to pay debts to foreign countries. This resulted in a serious shortage of money in the United States.
Shays's Rebellion
Economic troubles hit farmers hard. Unable to sell their goods, they could not pay their taxes and debts. This led state officials to seize farmers’ lands and throw them in jail. This treatment angered many farmers. Some began to view the new governmed as just another form of tyranny. They wanted the government to

Resentment boiled in Massachusetts. In 1786 angry farmers led by former Continental Army captain Daniel Shays forced courts in the western part of the state to close.
The goal was to stop judges from legally taking away farmers’ lands.
The farmers’ revolt grew. In January 1787, Shays led a force of about 1,200 supporters toward the federal arsenal, or weapons storehouse, in Springfield,
Massachusetts. The farmers wanted to seize guns and ammunition. The state militia ordered the advancing farmers to halt and then fired over their heads.
The farmers did not stop. The militia fired again, killing four farmers.
Shays and his followers fled, and the uprising was over. Still, Shays’s Rebellion frightened Americans. Concern grew that the government could not handle unrest and prevent violence. On hearing of the rebellion, George Washington wondered whether “mankind, when left to themselves, are unfit for their own government.”
Slavery in the New Republic
The Revolutionary War called attention to the clash between the American belief in liberty and the practice of slavery.
Between 1776 and 1786, 11 states—all except South Carolina and Georgia—outlawed or taxed the importation of enslaved people.
Slavery existed and was legal in every state. In the North, however, it was not a major source of labor. People in that region began working to end slavery in America. In 1774 Quakers in Pennsylvania founded the first American antislavery society.

Lesson 2 235
In the South, much ofthe wealth came from large plantations that used enslaved labor to grow valuable crops such as tobacco, rice, and later, cotton. The reliance on slavery tended to keep Southern states from investing in other parts of their economy. Southern cities remained smaller than those in the North because there were fewer businesses in the South. The South also did not devote itself to improving its transportation systems or training its people to build new businesses and industries.
CRITICAL THINKING
Identifying Central Issues Why do you think the white South was so committed to keeping a slave-based economy?
Six years later, Pennsylvania passed a law that provided tor the gradual freeing of enslaved people. Between 1783 and 1804, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey passed laws that gradually ended slavery there.
Still, free African Americans faced discrimination. They were barred from many public places. Only a few states gave them the right to vote. Most of their children had to attend separate schools from white children. In response, free African Americans set up their own churches, schools, and aid groups.
Slavery continued to spread south of Pennsylvania. The plantation system depended on enslaved labor, and many white Southerners feared their economy could not survive without it.
That fear did not stop a number of slaveholders from freeing enslaved people. The number of free African Americans increased in Virginia after that state passed a law that encouraged manumission (maneyuh.MIH.shuhn), the freeing of individual enslaved persons.
Around this time, American leaders were deciding that the Articles of Confederation needed to be strengthened. The question of slavery would make those discussions more difficult.

The Constitutional Convention
guiding question How did leaders reshape the government?
Although the American Revolution led to a union of 13 states, it had not yet created a nation. Some leaders were satisfied with independent state governments that were similar to the old colonial governments. Others wanted a strong national government. They demanded a change in the Articles of Confederation. Among the leading Americans supporting reform were James Madison, a Virginia planter, and Alexander Hamilton, a New York lawyer.
The Convention Begins
In September 1786, Hamilton called for a convention, or meeting, in Philadelphia to discuss trade issues. He also suggested that this convention consider what possible changes were needed to make “the Constitution of the Federal Government adequate to the exigencies [needs] of the Union.”
George Washington at first was not enthusiastic about the meeting. Then, news of Shays’s Rebellion made Washington change his mind. He agreed to attend the Philadelphia convention, and the meeting took on greater importance.
The Convention began in May 1787 and continued through one of the hottest summers on record. The 55 delegates included planters, merchants, lawyers, physicians, generals, governors, and a college president. Three of the delegates were under 30 years of age, and one, Benjamin Franklin, was over 80. Many of the delegates were well educated. At a time when
few people went to college,
26 of the delegates had college degrees.
Native Americans,
African Americans, and women were not represented at the Convention. These groups were not considered part of the political process at that time.
Having Washington and Franklin at the Convention guaranteed the public trust.

Trust was important because the convention did not just amend, or revise, the Articles of Confederation. It produced an entirely new constitution. Some questioned whether the Convention had such authority.
Yet the work went on. Two men from Philadelphia also had key roles. James Wilson did important work on the details ofthe Constitution, and Gouverneur Morris polished the final draft. James Madison, who was a keen supporter of a strong national government, kept a record of the convention’s work. Madison is often called the “Father of the Constitution” because he was the author of the basic plan of government that the Convention adopted.
The Convention Organizes
The delegates chose George Washington to lead the meetings. Delegates also decided that each state would have one vote on all questions. Decisions would be based on a majority vote ofthe states present. Sessions were not open to the public. In fact, the windows were closed in the sweltering heat to keep anyone from listening in. This made it possible for the delegates to talk freely.

The Virginia Plan
Edmund Randolph of Virginia opened the Convention with a surprise. He proposed the Virginia Plan, which called for a strong national government. The plan, which was largely the work of James Madison, created a government with three branches: a two-house legislature, a chief executive chosen by the legislature, and a court system. The legislature would have powers to tax, regulate trade, and veto state laws. Voters would elect members ofthe lower house of the legislature. The members of the lower house would then choose members of the upper house. In both houses the number of representatives would be proportional or corresponding in size, to the population of each state. This would give a state such as Virginia many more delegates than Delaware, the state with the fewest number of people.
Delegates from the small states objected. They preferred a system in which all states had equal representation. Opponents of the Virginia Plan rallied around William Paterson of New Jersey On June 15, he presented another plan. This plan amended the Articles of Confederation, which was all the Convention had the power to do.

George Washington (1732-1799)
George Washington's military service is well known. He also became a key political leader in his later years. Washington did not want to attend the Constitutional Convention, but he did because he worried that the nation would not survive under the weak Articles of Confederation. The delegates unanimously chose him as the presiding officer, or leader, ofthe Convention. Washington said very little during the debates but later became one ofthe new Constitution's strongest supporters. He argued that later generations could make any changes necessary.

Agreeing to Compromise
GUIDING QUESTION
What compromises were reached in the new Constitution? The delegates had to decide whether to revise the Articles of Confederation or write a new constitution. On June 19, the states voted to work toward a new constitution based on the Virginia Plan. They still had to deal with the difficult issue of representation that divided the large and small states.
The Great Compromise
The Convention appointed a committee to settle the disagreement. Roger Sherman of Connecticut suggested what would later be called the Great Compromise. A compromise is the settling of a dispute when each party agrees to give up some of its demands. Sherman’s compromise proposed different representation in the two-house legislature. In the upper house-the Senate—each state would have two members. That is, the states would be equal in representation. In the lower house—the House of Representatives—the number of seats for each state would vary based on the state’s population. Larger states would have more representation.
The Three-Fifths Compromise
Delegates from the South and North disagreed on whether— and how—to count each state’s enslaved population. Including enslaved people as part of a state’s population would increase each Southern state’s size. This would give Southern states more seats in Congress. The Southern states liked this, but the Northern states did not. At the same time, larger populations would increase each Southern state’s taxes, because states were to be taxed based on their populations. The South was not happy about this.
As a solution to this dispute, delegates agreed to what was called the Three-Fifths Compromise. As part of this compromise, every five enslaved persons would count as three persons in the state s population total. This population total would be the basis for setting taxes and determining representation in Congress.
The Question of the Slave Trade
Most Northern states had already banned the slave trade. They wanted to prohibit it nationwide. Southern states considered slavery central to their economy. Northerners agreed to keep the new Congress from interfering with the slave trade until 1808.

Debating a Bill of Rights
State constitutions, such as those of Virginia and
Massachusetts, had a listing of key rights and freedoms. These are known as a declaration of rights, or a bill of rights. At the Convention, some delegates worried that without a bill of rights, the new national government might abuse its power. George Mason of Virginia proposed a bill of rights to be included in the Constitution. The delegates rejected this idea. Most of the delegates believed that the Constitution carefully defined government powers and provided enough protection of individual rights.
Approving the Constitution
On September 17, 1787, the delegates assembled to sign the Constitution they had created. Three delegates refused to sign— Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts and Edmund Randolph and George Mason of Virginia. Gerry and Mason would not sign because the Constitution did not have a bill of rights. Randolph, who had put forth the Virginia Plan, felt the final document strayed too far from his own beliefs.
The other delegates did sign the document. The approved draft of the Constitution went out to the states for their approval. Under the Articles of Confederation, all 13 states would have had to agree to any change to the framework of government. The drafters of the new Constitution decided, however, that the document would go into effect with the approval of just 9 of the 13 states.

What DoYou
Think?
Should the Constitution Be Ratified?
After the delegates in Philadelphia wrote the U.S. Constitution, it went before the American people for approval. Delegates in each state met at special conventions to decide whether to accept or reject the Constitution. In order for the Constitution to become the new plan for the government of the United States, 9 of the 13 states had to ratify, or approve, it.
Those who opposed the Constitution were called Anti-Federalists. Mercy Otis Warren and the other Anti-Federalist writers feared a strong national government would take away the rights of citizens. Federalists supported the Constitution. They believed that the Constitution would give the national government power to manage the problems facing the United States. At the same time, the Federalists argued, the Constitution would protect the rights of the individual.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
The Constitution contains features that came from the best political thinkers and that have helped the nation survive and thrive.
The Constitution's Sources
guidingquestion From where did the Framers of the Constitution borrow their ideas about government?
Although an American document, the Constitution has roots in other civilizations. The delegates who wrote the document studied the history of political thought in an effort to avoid the mistakes of the past. Many ideas found in the Constitution came from European political institutions and writers.
The Framers who shaped the document were familiar with the parliamentary system of Britain. Many had taken part in their colonial or state assemblies. They valued the individual rights guaranteed by the British judicial system. Although the Americans broke away from British rule, they respected many British traditions, or cultural beliefs and practices. European Influences
The English Magna Carta (1215) placed limits on the power of the monarch. Parliament, England’s lawmaking body, became a force that the king or queen had to depend on to pay for wars and the royal government. Like Parliament, colonial assemblies controlled their colonies’ funds. The assemblies had some control over colonial governors.

The English Bill of Rights of 1689 was another model for Americans. In fact, many people in the United States felt the Constitution also needed a bill of rights. The Framers believed in the ideas about the nature of people and government put forth by European writers of the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment was a movement of the 1700s that promoted knowledge, reason, and science as a means of improving society. James Madison and other Framers of the Constitution were familiar with the writings of John Locke and Baron de Montesquieu (mahn»tuhs«KYOO), two philosophers of the Enlightenment.
The English philosopher Locke wrote that all people have natural rights. He stated that these natural rights include the rights to life, liberty, and property. In his Two Treatises of Civil Government (1690), he wrote that government is based on an agreement, or contract, between the people and their government. Americans interpreted natural rights to mean the rights of Britons defined in the Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights. The Framers viewed the Constitution as a contract between the American people and their government. The contract protected peoples natural rights by limiting government power.
The French writer Montesquieu declared in The Spirit of Laws (1748) that the powers of government should be separated and balanced against each other. This separation would prevent any one person or group from gaining too much power. The Framers of the Constitution carefully spelled out and divided the powers of government.
Federalism
The Constitution created a federal system of government that divided powers between the national, or federal, government and the states. Under the Articles of Confederation, the states held most powers. Under the Constitution, the states gave up some powers to the federal government and kept others. Federalism (FE.duh.ruh.lih.zuhm), or sharing power between the federal and state governments, is one of the key features of the United States government. Under the Constitution, the federal government gained wide-ranging powers to tax, regulate trade, control the currency, raise an army, and declare war. It could also pass laws that were “necessary and proper” for carrying out its responsibilities. This power would allow Congress to make laws as needed to deal with new situations.
John Locke influenced many of the Framers of the Constitution. His views on natural rights are reflected in the Constitution.

The Constitution left some important powers to the states. The states kept the power to control trade inside their borders. They also could set up local governments and schools and establish marriage and divorce laws.
The Constitution also called for the sharing of some powers between the federal and state governments. Both federal and state governments would have the power to tax and to establish criminal justice systems.
While states had powers and shared others with the federal government, the Constitution and the laws of Congress were to he “the supreme law of the land.” No state could make laws or take actions that went against the Constitution. Federal courts would settle disputes between the federal government and the states on the basis of the Constitution.

into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The first three articles, or parts, of the Constitution describe each branch’s powers and responsibilities.
Government Branches
Article I of the Constitution declares Congress to be the legislative branch, or lawmaking branch, of the government. Congress is made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The powers of Congress include establishing taxes, coining money, and regulating trade.
Article II of the Constitution sets up the executive branch to carry out the nation’s laws and policies. At the head of this branch are the president and vice president. A special group called the Electoral College elects the president and vice president. Today, voters in each state choose the electors who make up the Electoral College.
Article III deals with the judicial branch, or court system.
The nation’s judicial power resides in “one supreme Court” and any lower federal courts Congress creates. The Supreme Court and other federal courts hear cases involving the Constitution, federal laws, and disputes between states.
Checks and Balances
The Constitution contains a system of checks and balances. This means each branch of government has ways to check, or limit, the power of the other branches. With this system, no single branch can gain too much power in the government. You will learn more about this system in another chapter.

The Bill of Rights
Various groups have drafted their own specialized versions of the Bill of Rights. For instance, in 2010 New Jersey lawmakers drafted an “Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights.” This legislation was designed to protect students from bullying and cyberbullying. The bill calls for anti-bullying training for teachers and gives school administrators tools for responding to bullying.
CRITICAL THINKING
Drawing Conclusions Why do you think lawmakers today refer to the Bill of Rights when proposing and promoting legislation?
Debate and Adoption
guiding question How was the Constitution ratified?
Before the Constitution could go into effect, nine states had to ratify, or approve, it. Americans debated the arguments for and against the Constitution in newspapers, at meetings, and in everyday conversations.
Federalists and Anti-Federalists
People who supported the new Constitution were called Federalists. They took this name to stress that the Constitution would create a system of federalism, a government in which power is divided between the national government and the states. In a series of essays, known as the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay argued for ratification of the Constitution. To win support, the Federalist Papers reminded Americans of the flaws in the Articles of Confederation. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay claimed that the United States would not survive without a strong national government. The Constitution, they argued, would create a better framework of government that would maintain a federal system in which there was a separation of powers that would protect the rights ofthe people.
Those who opposed the Constitution were called Anti-Federalists. They wrote their own essays, which later came to be known as the Anti-Federalist Papers. Anti-f ederalists argued that a strong national government would take away liberties Americans had fought for in the American Revolution. They warned that the government would ignore the will ofthe states and favor the wealthy few over the common people. Anti-Federalists favored local government that was controlled more closely by the people. A Bill of Rights
The strongest criticism of the Constitution may have been that it lacked a bill of rights to protect individual freedoms. Several state conventions announced that they would not ratify it unless a bill of rights was included. George Mason, an Anti-Federalist from Virginia, expressed the problem:

Drawing Conclusions Why is the ninth pillar significant?
Ratifying the Constitution
On December 7,1787, Delaware became the first state to approve the Constitution. By June 21,1788, the ninth state—New Hampshire-had ratified it. In theory, this made the Constitution law. However, without the support of the largest states—New York and Virginia— the new government could not succeed.
In Virginia, Anti-Federalist Patrick Henry claimed the Constitution did not place enough limits on government power. Still, Virginia did ratify the document after being promised that a bill of rights would be added as amendments (uh»MEHND»muhnts), or changes, to the document. This promise was met in 1791. In July 1788, New York ratified the Constitution, followed by North Carolina in November 1789
| and Rhode Island in May 1790.

GUIDINGQUESTION
What basic principles of government are set forth by the Constitution! The United States Constitution sets forth seven key principles upon which the American system of government rests. These principles are: (1) popular sovereignty, (2) a republican form of government, (3) limited government, (4) federalism, (5) separation of powers, (6) checks and balances, and (7) individual rights. The principles of the Constitution ensure government restraint as well as power. At the same time, the Constitution sets limits so that Americans need never fear tyranny.
Popular Sovereignty
The idea that the power of government lies with the people is called popular sovereignty, or “the right of the people to rule.” The Declaration of Independence had identified many grievances against King George III, including imposing taxes on the colonists without their consent and suspending their legislatures. The principles of the Constitution guard against the abuse of power by government. Republicanism
A republic is a government in which power is held by the people and exercised by their elected representatives. The principle of republicanism includes several ideas. Citizens have the opportunity to choose their representatives. Republicanism

Popular sovereignty . enumerated P°wer
•	constitutional . reserved power

•	limited government • republicanism
rejects the idea that the power to rule is inherited. Republicanism stresses the values of individual liberty and inalienable rights.
The Constitution establishes a republican form of government. A constitutional republic is a government in which the people rule through elected representatives who govern according to a constitution that limits the government’s power. Limited Government
The Framers were wary of a government that might take away people’s rights or favor certain groups. At the same time, they realized that the nation needed a stronger government than the Articles of Confederation had provided. Their goal was to establish limited government, in which the powers of government are strictly defined. A limited government has only those powers that are given to it by the people.
Federalism
The original 13 states had fought hard to win independence from Great Britain. The Articles of Confederation protected that independence, but it failed to create a national government strong enough to deal with many challenges the young nation faced.
The United States has a federal government, in which the many state governments and the single federal government share power. This system is known as federalism.
The Constitution creates the federal system. It explains how powers are distributed among different levels of government. The Constitution spells out the powers given to Congress and establishes the executive and judicial branches.
The Constitution lists enumerated powers, or those powers that are specifically given to Congress. Enumerated powers include the power to coin money, regulate interstate and foreign trade, maintain the armed forces, and create federal courts. The states cannot exercise these powers.
Reserved powers are those powers that belong to the states. The Constitution does not specifically list the reserved powers.
The Tenth Amendment declares that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government “are reserved to the States.”
The reserved powers include the power to establish schools, pass marriage and divorce laws, and regulate trade within a state.
Under the Constitution, the federal government and the state governments share certain powers. These are the concurrent powers. Examples of concurrent powers are the right to raise taxes, borrow money, provide for the public welfare,

republicanism favoring a republic with elected representation as the best form of government
The power to coin money is an enumerated power. Congress also has the power to print currency, such as the paper bills shown here.

The right to carry out criminal justice is a concurrent power, and the federal government and the states have their own justice systems.
and administer criminal justice. Each state and the federal government can exercise these powers at the same time.
While states have their own laws and powers, the Constitution is “the supreme Law of the Land.” If a state law contradicts the Constitution or federal law, the Constitution or federal law prevails. This is stated in Article VI, Clause 2, of the Constitution—the “Supremacy Clause.
Separation of Powers
To make sure no person or group in government has too much power, the Constitution provides for a separation of powers. This means the Constitution separates the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of government. It then places these powers in three different branches of government. Each branch has different—and limited—powers, duties, and responsibilities. Checks and Balances
The Framers did more than separate the powers of government. They set up a system of checks and balances. Under this system, each branch of government can check, or limit, the power of the other branches. This system helps maintain a balance in the power of the three branches.
Here is an example of how the system of checks and balances works: Congress (legislative branch) has the power to pass a law. If the president (executive branch) disagrees with the law, he or she can reject it through the presidential power of the veto. This veto power checks the power of Congress. At the same time, Congress can override the veto. This checks the power of the executive branch.
The United States Supreme Court (judicial branch) also has
important checks on the other branches. The Supreme Court has the power to interpret the Constitution and to decide whether or not actions by the legislative and executive branches are allowed.
Congress can check decisions made by the courts by beginning the process of changing the Constitution itself. For example, the Supreme Court ruled in the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford decision that African Americans—enslaved or free—were not citizens. In 1866 Congress proposed the Fourteenth Amendment. The amendment was meant to grant full citizenship to formerly enslaved African Americans. When ratified by the states in 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment had the effect of overruling the Dred Scott decision.
There are several other ways in which the branches of government check and balance one another. The diagram

“A System of Checks and Balances” shows how each branch of government can check the power of the other branches.
Individual Rights
The Constitution that the Framers wrote in 1787 did not have a Bill of Rights. These ten amendments became part of the Constitution in 1791. They guarantee basic liberties and individual rights, including:
•	Freedom of religion
•	Freedom of speech and of the press
•	Freedom to assemble in groups and to protest against the government
•	The right to bear arms
•	The right to a speedy and public trial by jury
•	The right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government
•	Freedom from “cruel and unusual” punishments
Since 1791, other constitutional amendments have expanded on the rights of the American people. For example, amendments have abolished slavery, defined citizenship, guaranteed equal protection of the law” for all people, and guaranteed the right to vote for people aged 18 and older. Amendments have also authorized the direct, popular election of senators.

Amending the Constitution
guiding question How is the Constitution able to change over time?
The United States Constitution is one of the world’s oldest written constitutions. It is also a short document compared to many other constitutions. Its clear, direct language has helped support stable government for well over two centuries. At the same time, the Constitution has enabled government to adapt to changing times and to deal with challenges that the original Framers never dreamed of—from radio communications to nuclear power to space exploration and more.
The Constitution has changed as a result of formal amendment. The Framers allowed for this process when they wrote the Constitution. People have suggested many hundreds of amendments over the years. Yet the nation has amended its Constitution only 27 times. The Framers deliberately made the amendment process difficult.
As the diagram “The Amendment Process” shows, amending the Constitution involves two steps. The first is the formal proposal of an amendment. Congress can do this by a two-thirds vote. Also, two-thirds of the state legislatures can call a

convention to propose an amendment, though this method has never been used.
The second step in the amendment process is ratification. Ratification of an amendment requires approval by three-fourths of the states. States can ratify the amendment at either a state convention or through a vote by the state legislature.
Amendments have brought significant changes to the nation. In addition to protecting our rights, amendments have extended the right to vote to a larger share of the population. The Fifteenth Amendment sought to ensure that African American men would have the right to vote. The Nineteenth Amendment extended voting rights to women. The Twenty-fourth Amendment outlawed poll taxes, giving more people the ability to vote. The Twenty-sixth Amendment lowered the voting age to 18.
Formal amendment is one way the Constitution has changed. The language of the Constitution has also been subject to different interpretations.
For example, over history, Congress has claimed for itself certain implied powers (ihm*PLYD). These are powers that are suggested but not directly stated in the Constitution. The source of the implied powers is Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution. Here is found the “necessary and proper clause,” or the “elastic clause.” This clause directs Congress to “make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper” for carrying out its duties.
Also in Article I, Section 8, is the “commerce clause.” This gives Congress power to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.” Congress has used this clause to expand its powers into areas, such as the regulation of television, that do not appear in the Constitution.
H READING PROGRESS CHECK
Summarizing What is the two-step process for amending the U.S. Constitution?
Over the course of American history, some unwritten customs of government have become so strong that they seem to have the effect of law. For example, until the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which was ratified in 1967, the Constitution did not specify that the vice president would assume the office of president in the event of a president’s death. Yet on eight occasions, that is exactly what happened. Each time the custom was applied, it acquired more force.

It Matters because

The Federal Government
guiding question What are the three branches of government?
To achieve a separation of powers, the Constitution divides the federal government into three branches. They are called the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
The Nation's Legislature
Congress is the legislative branch of government. It has two houses—the House of Representatives and the Senate. Currently, the House has 435 voting members and 6 nonvoting delegates from the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Representatives, who must be at least 25 years old, serve two-year terms. There is no limit to the number of terms a person can serve.
The number of representatives from each state is based on the states population. States with more people have more representatives in Congress, though every state has at least one representative. The federal government resets each states share of the 435 House seats every 10 years. A states number of representatives may go up or down depending on population changes.

Content Vocabulary

•	due process

The Senate has 100 senators, two from each state. Senators must be at least 30 years old, and they serve six-year terms. Only one-third of the seats come up for election every two years. As with House members, there are no term limits for senators.
Article I of the Constitution describes the role of Congress. Congress makes the nation’s laws. These laws are not just rules for behavior. Congress passes laws that impose taxes, authorize the spending of money, and create government programs. Congress also has the job of declaring war.
Both houses of Congress must agree on a bill, or proposed law. Once both houses do this, the bill goes to the president. If the president signs the bill, it becomes law.
The Executive Branch
The executive branch is led by the president and vice president, who each serve four-year terms. It also includes the president’s cabinet, or top advisers, and many other offices, departments, and agencies. The executive branch’s main job is to administrate, or carry out, the laws passed by Congress. The president does, however, propose laws to Congress.
The president has many other powers laid out in Article II of the Constitution. These include directing foreign policy, naming ambassadors, and negotiating treaties with other nations. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
The Constitution places the military under the control of the president, a civilian. The Framers realized that, if military force was not controlled, it could endanger the nation.
The Judicial Branch
Article III of the Constitution establishes a Supreme Court and allows for Congress to create lower courts. Congress has established district courts, which are the main trial courts for the federal government, and appeals courts, which hear cases on appeal from lower courts. There are several other types of federal courts as well. For example, there are special federal courts for hearing bankruptcy cases. Bankruptcy is a legal process for people or businesses that cannot pay off their debts.
The Supreme Court is at the top of the United States legal system. It rules on only the most difficult legal questions, and its rulings are never appealed.
The Supreme Court also has the power of judicial review.
The Court can review the actions of the executive and legislative branches to determine whether they violate the Constitution.

BIOGRAPHY
Sandra Day O'Connor (1930-)
In his 1980 election campaign, Ronald Reagan promised to name the first woman justice to the Supreme Court. During his first year in office, a vacancy opened on the Court. Reagan chose Sandra Day O'Connor, an Arizona appeals court judge, to fill the vacancy. O'Connor served as a justice until 2006. In an interview, she discussed the increased opportunities for women she had witnessed: "When I went to law school, about 1 percent of all law students were women. And last year, over 50 percent were."
Members are nominated by the president and approved by Congress. Today the Supreme Court is made up of nine justices-the chief justice and eight associate justices. The Constitution gave Congress the power to set this number. Justices serve no fixed term. Unless removed for bad behavior, they stay on the bench until they retire or die.
The main duties of the justices are to hear and rule on cases they choose from among the thousands that are presented to them each year. They listen to arguments, and then they must present and explain their decision called the Courts opinion. This opinion is then used by lower courts in making their rulings, P READING PROGRESS CHECK

What it Means to be a Citizen
GUIDINGQUESTION
What are the rights and elements of participation of American atm? Citizens of the United States enjoy certain rights and liberties. Being a citizen also involves some responsibilities.
Our Rights
Our rights fall into three main categories: 1’he right to be protected from unfair government actions, the right to be treated equally with others, and the right to enjoy basic freedoms.
Our government must treat people fairly and accordingto clear rules. This is spelled out in the Fifth Amendment, which says no one shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Due process means the government must follow established procedures in taking action against a citizen.
The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees all people equal protection of the laws. This principle means all people, regardless of race, religion, or political beliefs, must receive the same treatment under the law.
The First Amendment outlines many of our basic freedoms These include freedom of religion, freedom of speech and of the press, freedom of assembly, and freedom to petition the government. The Framers knew that in a free society in which the people rule, people must be able to share ideas.
Our rights and freedoms have limits. For example, government can limit our freedom of speech or our right to hold a protest

if it threatens public safety. Also, one person’s exercise of his or her rights cannot take away others’ rights. Limits on rights and freedoms must be applied equally to all people.
The Duties and Responsibilities of Citizenship
A citizen is a person who owes loyalty to a nation and is entitled to its protection. For the most part, anyone born on U.S. soil is automatically a U.S. citizen. U.S. soil includes American territories and military bases around the world.
Citizenship is also granted to anyone born outside of the United States if one parent is a U.S. citizen. A person who was born in another country can become a citizen through the process called naturalization (NA«chuh*ruh»lih.ZAY.shuhn).
A number of responsibilities—things we are expected or required to do—come with citizenship. For example, citizens must obey the law, pay their taxes, and sit on a jury if they are called. All males 18 and older must register with the government in case they are needed to defend the country. Exercising the right to vote is an important responsibility that allows citizens to participate in government and guide its direction.
Other responsibilities are more personal in nature. They include supporting one’s family, getting an education, and being informed about public issues. Respecting the property, rights, and opinions of others and being accountable for one’s behavior are also key responsibilities. If people do not fulfill their responsibilities as citizens, the quality of our government and communities is diminished.

268 The Constitution
The Constitution of the united States
The Constitution of the United States is truly a remarkable document. It was one of the first written constitutions in modern history. The Framers wanted to devise a plan for a strong central government that would unify the country, as well as preserve the ideals of the Declaration of Independence.
The entire text of the Constitution and its amendments follows. For easier study, those passages that have been set aside or changed by the adoption of amendments are printed in blue. Also included are explanatory notes that will help clarify the meaning of each article and section.
269
The Preamble introduces the Constitution and sets forth the general purposes for which the government was established. The Preamble also declares that the power of the government comes from the people.
The printed text of the document shows the spelling and punctuation of the parchment original.
Article I. The Legislative Branch
The Constitution contains seven divisions called articles. Each article covers a general topic. For example,
Articles I, II, and III create the three branches of the national government— the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Most of the articles are divided into sections.
70 The Constitution
Preamble
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
Article I
Section 1
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.
Section 2

The Constitution 273
Elastic Clause The final enumerated j power is often called the "elastic dause.''This clause gives Congress the right to make all laws "necessary and proper" to carry out the powers expressed in the other clauses of Article I. It is called the elastic clause because it lets Congress "stretch" its powers to meet situations the Founders could never have anticipated.
What does the phrase "necessary and proper" in the elastic clause mean? Almost from the beginning, this phrase was a subject of dispute. The issue was whether a strict or a broad interpretation of the Constitution should be applied.The dispute was first addressed in 1819, in the case of McCulloch v. Maryland, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a broad interpretation.
Habeas Corpus A writ of habeas corpus issued by a judge requires a law official to bring a prisoner to court and show cause for holding the prisoner. A bill of attainder is a bill that punished a person without a jury trial. An "ex post facto" law is one that makes an act a crime after the act has been committed. What does the Constitution say about bills of attainder?

The Constitution 275
Previous Elections The Twelfth Amendment, added in 1804, changed the method of electing the president stated in Article II, Section 3. The Twelfth Amendment requires that the electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president.
Qualifications The president must be a citizen of the United States by birth, at least 35 years of age, and a resident of the United States for 14 years.
Vacancies Ifthe president dies, resigns, is removed from office by impeachment, or is unable to carry out the duties of the office, the vice president becomes president.
The Twenty-fifth Amendment sets procedures for presidential succession.
Salary Originally, the president's salary was $25,000 per year. The president's current salary is $400,000. The president also receives annual nontaxable expense and travel accounts. The president also receives living accommodations in two residences—the White House and Camp David.

But it there shouie. remain two or more who have equal V otes, the Senate shah chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President.
[4.] The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.
[5.] No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.
[6.] In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.
[7.] The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.
[8.] Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:—“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”
Section 2
[1.] The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.
[2.] He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.
[3.] The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.

The Cabinet Mention of "the principal officer in each of the executive departments" is the only suggestion of the president's cabinet to be found in the Constitution. The cabinet is an advisory body and its power depends on the president. Section 2, Clause 1 also makes the president—a civilian—the head of the armed services. This established the principle of civilian control of the military.
Presidential Powers An executive order is a command issued by a president to exercise a power which he or she has been given by the U.S. Constitution or by a federal statute.
The Constitution places the military under the control of the president, a civilian.The Framers realized that, if military force was not controlled, it could endanger the nation. In times of emergency, presidents sometimes have used the executive order to override the Constitution and Congress. During the Civil War, President Lincoln suspended many fundamental rights, such as closing down newspapers that opposed his policies and imprisoning people who disagreed with him. Lincoln said that these actions were justified to preserve the Union.
The Constitution 277
Article III. The Judicial Branch The
term judicial refers to courts.
The Constitution set up only the Supreme Court, but provided for the establishment of other federal courts. The judiciary of the United States has two different systems of courts. One system consists of the federal courts, whose powers derive from the Constitution and federal laws.The other includes the courts of each of the 50 states, whose powers derive from state constitutions and laws.
Statute Law Federal courts deal mostly with "statute law," or laws passed by Congress, treaties, and cases involving the Constitution itself.
The Supreme Court A Court with "original jurisdiction" has the authority to be the first court to hear a case.
The Supreme Court has "appellate jurisdiction"and mostly hears cases appealed from lower courts.

New States Congress has the power to admit new states. It also determines the basic guidelines for applying for statehood. Two states, Maine and West Virginia, were created within the boundaries of another state. In the case of West Virginia, President Lincoln recognized the West Virginia government as the legal government of Virginia during the Civil War. This allowed West Virginia to secede from Virginia without obtaining approval from the Virginia legislature.

278 The Constitution
The Constitution 279
Republic Government can be classified in many different ways. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle classified government based on the question "who governs?" According to Aristotle, all governments belong to one of three major groups:
(1)	autocracy—rule by one person;
(2)	oligarchy—rule by a few persons; or (3) democracy—rule by many persons. A republic is a form of democracy in which the people elect representatives to make the laws and conduct government.
Section 4
The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.
Article V. The Amendment Process

The Constitution 281
Bill of Rights The first 10 amendments are known as the Bill of Rights (1791). These amendments limit the powers of government. The First Amendment protects the civil liberties of individuals in the United States. The amendment freedoms are not absolute, however. They are limited by the rights of other individuals. What freedoms does the First Amendment protect?
Amendment I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
Amendment II
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
Amendment VI
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining Witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.
Amendment III
No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.
Amendment VII
In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of common law.
Rights to a Speedy, Fair Trial A
basic protection is the right to a speedy, public trial. The jury must hear witnesses and evidence on both sides before deciding the guilt or innocence of a person charged with a crime.
This amendment also provides that legal counsel must be provided to a defendant. In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled, in Gideon v. Wainwright, that if a defendant cannot afford a lawyer, the government must provide one to defend him or her. Why is the right to a “speedy" trial important?
Rights of the Accused This amendment contains important protections for people accused of crimes. One of the protections is that government may not deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. This means that the government must follow proper constitutional procedures in trials and in other actions it takes against individuals. According to Amendment I/, what is the function of a grand jury?
Vocabulary_________________________
quarter: to provide living accommodations
warrant: document that gives police particular rights or powers
probable cause: a reasonable basis to believe a person is linked to a crime
common law: law established by previous court decisions
Amendment IV
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place, to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
Amendment V
| No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or 1 otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or * indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the
land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.
Amendment VIII
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.
Amendment IX
The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
Amendment X
The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.
Amendment XI
The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.
bail: money that an accused person provides to the court as a guarantee that he or she will be present for a trial
282 The Constitution
Powers of the People This amendment prevents government from claiming that the only rights
/ people have are those listed in the Bill of Rights.
Powers of the States The final amendment of the Bill of Rights protects the states and the people from an all-powerful federal government. It establishes that powers not given to the national government—or denied to the states—by the Constitution belong to the states or to the people.
i Suits Against States The Eleventh ;---i Amendment (1795) limits the

Election of President and Vice President The Twelfth Amendment (1804) corrects a problem that had arisen in the method of electing the president and vice president.
This amendment provides for the Electoral College to use separate ballots in voting for president and vice president. If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, who elects the president?

Rights of Citizens The Fourteenth ? Amendment (1868) originally was
intended to protect the legal rights j of the freed slaves. Today it protects
the rights of citizenship in general by prohibiting a state from depriving
j any person of life, liberty, or property J without"due process of law." In
addition, it states that all citizens have the right to equal protection of the law in all states.
Representation in Congress This section reduced the number of members a state had in the House of Representatives if it denied its citizens the right to vote. Later civil rights laws and the Twenty-fourth Amendment guaranteed the vote to African Americans.

Public Debt The public debt acquired by the federal government during the Civil War was valid and could not be questioned by the South. However, the debts of the Confederacy were declared to be illegal. Could former slaveholders collect payment for the loss of their slaves?
Right to Vote The Fifteenth Amendment (1870) prohibits the government from denying a person's right to vote on the basis of race. Despite the law, many states denied African Americans the right to vote by such means as poll taxes, literacy tests, and white primaries. During the 1950s and 1960s, Congress passed successively stronger laws to end racial discrimination in voting rights.

Electors for the District of Columbia
The Twenty-third Amendment (1961) allows citizens living in Washington, D.C., to vote for president and vice president, a right previously denied residents of the nation's capital. The District of Columbia now has three presidential electors, the number to which it would be entitled if it were a state.
Abolition of Poll Tax The Twenty-fourth Amendment (1964) prohibits poll taxes in federal elections. Prior to the passage of this amendment, some states had used such taxes to keep low-income African Americans from voting. In 1966 the Supreme Court banned poll taxes in state elections as well.
The Vice President The Twenty-fifth Amendment (1967) established a process for the vice president to take over leadership of the nation when a president is disabled. It also set procedures for filling a vacancy in the office of vice president.
This amendment was used in 1973, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned from office after being charged with accepting bribes. President Richard Nixon then appointed Gerald R. Ford as vice president in accordance with the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment. A year later, President Nixon resigned during the Watergate scandal and Ford became president. President Ford then had to fill the vice presidency, which he had left vacant upon assuming the presidency. He named Nelson A. Rockefeller as vice president. Thus individuals who had not been elected held both the presidency and the vice presidency. Whom does the president inform if he or she cannot carry out the duties of the office?

Section 4
Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the power and duties of the office of Acting President.
Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the power and duties of his office.

Abigail Adams is thoughtful and smart. Like other women of her day, she does not lead a public life. Yet to her husband—patriot and now President John Adams—she is a trusted adviser.
During her husband's presidency, she watches with a keen eye as the first political parties form. She helps her husband identify his true friends— and his secret enemies.
Her involvement in politics shocks some people. For a time, it even costs her a dear friendship with Thomas Jefferson.
The division of the nation into different political parties was a trying time for the United States. It was one of the challenges facing the young nation in the Federalist Era.

George Washington and his administration established many customs and processes that are still in place today.
Washington Takes Office
guiding question What dedsions did Washington and the new Congress have to mill about the new government?
Under the Articles of Confederation, the United States had several presidents. Their job was to lead Congress, and they were not strong chief executives. The government under the Articles was weak and ineffective. When delegates met to reform the government, they wrote a new Constitution that included a strong executive branch headed by a single president.
With the ratification of the Constitution and national elections, a new government was in place by the spring of 1789. On April 30, George Washington took the oath of office as the first president of the United States. During the early Republic era, the Washington administration and those that followed put finances in order, witnessed the birth of political parties, improved its transportation system, and more than doubled its territory. By 1824, the United States had been transformed into a strong independent nation.
Washington knew that his actions and decisions would set Pr®cedents (PREH«suh»duhnts), or traditions, that would help shape the nations future. “No slip will pass unnoticed,” he said. Washington worked closely with Congress to create an effective government. In those first years, the president and Congress created departments within the executive branch and set up the

court system. Congress added the Bill of Rights to the Constitution. Washington set the standard for how long a president should serve and for how the nation should relate to other nations.
The Cabinet
The executive branch of government took shape during the summer of 1789. Congress set up three departments and two offices within the executive branch. Washington chose leading political figures to head them. He picked Thomas Jefferson to head the State Department, which handles relations with other nations. He named Alexander Hamilton to manage the nation’s money at the Department of the Treasury. Henry Knox was the choice to look after the nation’s defense as the secretary of the Department of War. To address the government’s legal affairs, Washington chose Edmund Randolph to be attorney general. Congress also created the office of postmaster general.
The department heads and the attorney general had many important duties. Among them was giving advice to the president.
Together, this group of top executive advisers formed what is called a cabinet.
Congress was unsure how much power the president ought to have over the cabinet. In a vote on this question, senators were evenly divided. Vice President John Adams broke the tie. He voted to allow the president the power to dismiss cabinet officers without Senate approval. This established presidential power over the whole executive branch.
Establishing the Court System The first Congress also faced the job of forming the nation’s court system. Some favored a uniform legal system for the entire nation. Others favored keeping the existing state systems. The two sides reached an agreement in the Judiciary Act of 1789. This act established a federal court system. The states kept their own laws and courts, j but the federal courts had the power to j reverse state decisions. The act marked | a first step in creating a strong and i independent national judicial system.

Lesson 1 297

In 1789 Congress created a federal court system with three levels. Those three levels today include the district courts at the lower level, the appeals courts in the middle, and the Supreme Court at the top. Use the Internet to research this system, and create a chart or diagram that compares the powers of each level.
The Constitution established the Supreme Court as the finai authority on many issues. President Washington chose John Jay to lead the Supreme Court as chief justice. The Senate approved Jay’s nomination.
The Bill of Rights
Americans had fought a revolution to gain independence from British control. They did not want to replace one unjust government with another one. As protection from the powers of a strong national government, many Americans wanted the Constitution to include a bill ot rights. It would guarantee civil liberties. In fact, some states had agreed to ratify the Constitute only with the promise that a bill of rights be added.
To fulfill this promise, James Madison introduced a set of amendments during the first session of Congress. Congress passed 12 amendments, and the states ratified 10 of them, in December 1791, these 10 amendments, together called the Billot Rights, became part of the Constitution.
The Declaration of Independence had listed many grievances the American colonists held against King George III. To address those grievances, the Bill of Rights limits the power of government. It protects individual liberty, including freedom of speech and the rights of people accused of crimes. The Tenth Amendment says that any power not listed in the Constitution belongs to the states or the people. Madison hoped this amendment would help protect Americans against a national government that was too powerful.
The Supreme Court Building, built in 1935, is the seat of the Supreme Court of the United States.

The New Economy
guidingquestion How did the economy develop under the guidance of Alexander Hamilton?
As president, Washington focused on foreign affairs and military matters. He rarely suggested new laws and almost always approved the bills that Congress passed. For the government’s economic policies, the president depended on Alexander Hamilton, secretary of the treasury. Hamilton was in his early thirties when he took office, but he had bold plans and clear policies in mind.
Hamilton faced a difficult task. The federal and state governments had borrowed money to pay for the American Revolution. They now owed millions of dollars to other countries and to American citizens. As a result, the nation faced serious financial trouble. Hamilton tried to improve the government’s finances, establish a stable economic system, and strengthen the country at the same time.
Hamilton's Plan
The House of Representatives asked Hamilton to make a plan for the “adequate support of the public credit.
This meant that the United States needed a way to borrow money for its government and economy. To be able to borrow in the future, the government had to prove it could pay back the money it already owed.
Hamilton proposed that the federal government take over and pay off the states’ wartime debts. He argued that paying off the debt as a nation would build national credit and make it easier for the nation to borrow money.
Hamilton also believed that federal payment of state debts would give the states a strong interest in the success of the national government.
The Plan Faces Opposition
Congress agreed to part of Hamilton’s
plan—to pay the money owed to other
nations. However, Hamilton’s plan
to pay off the debt owed to American
citizens caused protest.
When borrowing money from citizens during the American Revolution, the government issued bonds. These are notes that promise repayment of borrowed money in the future.
Alexander Hamilton shaped the new nation's economy.

Lesson 1 299
PROTECTIVE TARIFFS
In the late 1700s, American industries lacked experience. As a result, it often cost American manufacturers more to make a product than it cost foreign makers. To raise the price of imported products, the U.S. government used protective tariffs. This helped protect American industries by making foreign-made goods more expensive and, therefore, less attractive to American buyers.

Now calculate the cost of buying 100 American-made and 100 British-made hats with the tariff. Which is greater?
CRITICAL THINKING
Speculating How might the issue of U.S.-imposed tariffs impact U.S. relations with Britain?

While waiting for repayment, many bond owners— shopkeepers, farmers, and soldiers—sold their bonds. They accepted less money than the bonds’ stated value. Olten, the buyers of these bonds were speculators, people who risk money in hopes of making a large profit in the future.
Now, Hamilton was proposing to pay off the old bonds at full value. This would make the speculators rich. The original bondholders would get nothing. Many people were upset by this idea. One newspaper said Hamilton’s plan was “established at the expense of national justice, gratitude, and humanity.”
Even stronger opposition came from the Southern states. These states had accumulated, or built up, much less debt than the Northern states. Several had already repaid their debts. Yet Hamilton wanted the entire nation to pay all the debt together, Southern states complained about having to help pay other states’ debts.
Compromise and a Capital
To win support for his plan, Hamilton worked out a conrprom's< with Southern leaders. If they voted for his plan to pay off the
state debts, he would support locating the nation’s capital in the South.	F
Congress ordered a special district to be laid out between Virginia and Maryland along the banks of the Potomac River. There, George Washington chose the site for the new capital city, later named Washington, District of Columbia, in his honor. While workers prepared the new city, the nation’s capital shifted from New York City to Philadelphia

The Fight for a National Bank
Hamilton also asked Congress to create a national bank—the Bank of the United States. The proposed bank would hold government funds and make debt payments. It would also issue a single form of money for use throughout the nation. At that time, different states and banks issued their own currencies. Having a national currency would make trade and all other financial actions much easier.
Madison and Jefferson opposed a national bank, believing it would only help the wealthy. They argued that the Constitution did not give Congress the power to create a bank. Hamilton believed the Constitution indirectly gave Congress power to create a bank when it gave Congress power to collect taxes and borrow money. Washington agreed, and Congress created the national bank.
Tariffs and Taxes
Hamilton believed that the United States needed more manufacturing. He proposed protective tariffs—high taxes on imports. The tariffs would raise money for the government and protect American industries from foreign competition. The South had little industry and opposed such tariffs. Congress passed only low tariffs. Hamilton also believed the federal government had the right to impose direct taxes on the people and called for taxes to pay the national debt. Congress approved several taxes, including a tax on the manufacture of whiskey.
Hamilton’s ideas created conflict. Jefferson and Madison worried that Hamilton was building a dangerously powerful government run by the wealthy. They began to organize opposition to Hamilton and the policies he favored.

Trouble in the New Nation
guidingquestion What challenges on the frontier did the new government face?
Washington faced difficult challenges while in office. Britain and France were pushing the United States to get more involved in their conflicts. President Washington stood firm against this pressure. Native Americans, aided by the British and Spanish, fought the westward advance of American settlers. In addition, there was growing unrest from within the American population, The Whiskey Rebellion
The new government wanted to collect taxes on some products made in the United States. In 1791 Congress passed a tax on the manufacture and sale of whiskey, a type of alcohol made from grain. Western Pennsylvania farmers were especially upset by this tax. Their anger turned into violence in July 1794. An armed mob attacked tax collectors and burned down buildings. This protest, called the Whiskey Rebellion, alarmed government leaders. They viewed it as a challenge to the power of the new government. Washington sent federal troops to meet the challenge. His action sent a strong message to the public: The government would use force to maintain order.

Challenges in the West
Washington worried about ongoing European interest in the Northwest Territory. The British and Spanish were trying to stir up Native American anger against American settlers in the region. To block these efforts, Washington signed treaties with Native American groups. Yet American settlers ignored the treaties and moved onto lands promised to Native Americans. Fighting broke out between the two groups.
Again, Washington decided to use force. He sent an army under General Arthur St. Clair to restore order in the Northwest Territory. In November 1791, St. Clair’s army met a strong Native American force led by Little Turtle, a Miami chief. More than 600 U.S. soldiers died in the battle. It was the worst defeat U.S. forces had ever suffered against Native Americans.
Americans hoped an alliance with France would help them achieve full control in the West. The possibility of French involvement led Great Britain to take action. In 1794 the British urged Native Americans to destroy American settlements west of the Appalachians. The British also began building a new fort in Ohio.
Native Americans demanded that settlers who were living north of the Ohio River leave the area. In response, Washington sent Anthony Wayne, a Revolutionary War general, to the region.
The United States fought with Native Americans in the Northwest Territory for control of land and resources.

BIOGRAPHY
John Jay (1745-1829)
John Jay attended college at the age of 14 and the First Continental Congress at the age of 28. Later, with Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, he wrote essays for The Federalist defending the Constitution.
George Washington appointed Jay the first chief justice ofthe United States in 1789.To avoid warwith Great Britain, Jay negotiated Jay's Treaty. This unpopular treaty ruined his chances for the presidency.
In August 1794, Wayne’s army defeated more than 1,000 Native Americans under Shawnee chief Blue Jacket. The Battle of Fallen Timbers, near present-day Toledo, Ohio, crushed the Native Americans’ hopes of keeping their land. In the Treaty of Greenville (1795), Native American leaders agreed to surrender most of the land in what is now Ohio.

Problems with Europe
guidingquestion Why did Washington want to remain neutral in foreign conflkti
In 1789 France erupted in revolution. Americans cheered at first as the French rose up against their king. The French struggle against royal tyranny was familiar to them. By 1793, however, the revolution had turned terribly violent. Some Americans were horrified by the bloodshed. Public opinion became divided.
When Britain and France went to war in 1793, some Americans sympathized with France. Others supported Britain. Washington hoped that the United States could stay neutral and not take either side.
Washington Struggles to Stay Neutral
Staying neutral proved difficult. The French tried to draw the United States into their conflict with Britain. They sent Edmond Genet (zhuh«NAY) to ask American volunteers to attack British ships. President Washington issued the Proclamation of Neutrality, which prohibited Americans from fighting in the war. The proclamation also barred French and British warships from American ports. Congress responded to the conflict by creatinga new navy in 1794.
Britain also challenged Washington’s desire for neutrality. The British captured American ships that traded with the French Then, they forced the American crews into the British navy. Americans were outraged by this practice of impressment.
Washington sent John Jay, chief justice ofthe United States, to discuss a solution with the British. The result of this negotiation was called Jay’s Treaty. In the treaty, the British agreed to withdraw from American soil. There was no mention of impressment or British interference with American trade. Few

Washington Leaves Office
After eight years in office, Washington decided not to seek a third term as president. In his Farewell Address, Washington urged his fellow citizens to “observe good faith and justice toward all nations.... It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances.” These parting words influenced the nation’s foreign policy for more than 100 years. Washington also warned against something he saw as a growing threat to the young nation: political parties. Differing ideas about the extent of federal power in the early republic, however, soon caused the formation of the nation’s first political parties.

it Matters because
Our nation's two-party political system developed from Americans taking opposing sides on political issues.
Opposing Parties
guidingquestion Howdid different opinions lead to the first political parties?
The American people generally admired President Washington and his service to the nation. Still, harsh attacks appeared from time to time in newspapers. One paper even called Washington “the scourge and the misfortune of his country.”
Most of the attacks on Washington came from supporters of Thomas Jefferson. They hoped to weaken support for the policies of Alexander Hamilton, which the president seemed to favor.
In fact, by 1796, the supporters of Jefferson and Hamilton were beginning to form the nation’s first political parties.
At that time, many Americans thought political parties were harmful to good government. The Constitution made no mention of parties because its authors saw no good use for them. Washington disapproved of political parties, or “factions” as they were known. He warned that they would divide the nation.
To others, though, it seemed natural that people would disagree about issues. They also knew that people who hold similar views tend to band together.
Washington s cabinet was clearly divided on key issues. Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson had very different views. They disagreed on economic policy and foreign relations.

They did not share the same opinion on the power of the federal government or on the meaning of the Constitution. Even Washington was partisan (PAHR.tuh.zuhn)—clearly favoring one faction. The president believed he stood above politics, but he usually supported Hamilton’s views.
Political Parties Emerge
The differences found in Washington’s cabinet also existed in Congress and among the public. They formed the basis for two distinct political parties that emerged at this time.
One party was the Federalists. Led by Hamilton, this group favored a strong federal government. They believed the Constitution gave government “implied” powers.
These implied powers are not enumerated, or listed clearly in the Constitution. The Federalists argued for a loose interpretation of the Constitution. They pointed out that the Constitution gave Congress the power to make all laws “necessary and proper” to carry out its enumerated powers.
The Democratic-Republicans, or Republicans, stood against the Federalists. Jefferson and James Madison led this faction. They believed in a strict reading of the Constitution. They rejected the Federalist idea of implied powers. They believed congressional powers were limited to what is absolutely necessary to carry out the enumerated powers.
Debate over the national bank highlighted these differences. The Constitution gave Congress specific powers to do such things as issue and borrow money. To Hamilton, this implied that the federal government could
create a bank to help with these tasks. Jefferson, however, thought the bank was unconstitutional.

The Role of the People
The two parties also disagreed about the role of ordinary citizens in government. Federalists supported representative government in which elected officials ruled in the people’s name. They did not, however, believe it was wise to let the public become too involved in politics.
Federalists thought that educated, wealthier men should hold f public office. They did not trust ordinary people to make good 1 decisions. In Hamilton’s words, “The people are turbulent and 1 changing; they seldom judge or determine right.

orfaction	distinct dearly different from the others
Lesson 3 307
Hamilton led the Federalist Party, which favored broad federal powers. Federalists believed that wealthy, educated men should be elected to office and control the government.
Jefferson and the Republican Party wanted to limit federal powers and protect the powers ofthe states. Republicans thought it was important for ordinary people to participate in government.
SKILLS PRACTICE
The Republicans feared a strong central government controlled by only a few people. They believed that representative government and liberty would be safe only if ordinary people took part fully in government. As Jefferson wrote, “I am not among those who fear the people. They, and not the rich, are our dependence [what we depend on] for continued freedom.” Washington's Reaction
The growing differences between the parties—and between Hamilton and Jefferson—troubled President Washington. He tried to get his two cabinet members to work out their differences. He wrote to Jefferson, trying to persuade him: “I... ardently wish that some line could be marked out by which both of you could walk.”
Washington’s efforts to get Jefferson and Hamilton to work together failed. The split was so strong that Jefferson left the cabinet and his job as secretary of state. Soon afterward, Hamilton resigned as secretary of the treasury. The rival groups and their points of view moved further apart. As the election of 1796 approached, the two parties each prepared to seek control of the presidency.
The Presidential Election of 1796
To prepare for the election, both parties held caucuses (K AW*kuhs»uhz). At these meetings, members of Congress and other leaders nominated, or chose, their parties’ candidates for office.
Each party chose two presidential candidates, and the electors voted for any two. The Federalists chose John Adams and Charles Pinckney. The Republicans chose Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. There was no candidate identified as a vice presidential candidate on the ballot.
The Federalists carried the New England region. Republican strength lay in the Southern states. Adams got 71 electoral votes, winning the election. Jefferson finished second with 68 votes. Under the rules of the Constitution at that time, the person with the second-highest electoral vote total—Jefferson—became vice president. The administration that took office on March 4,1797, had a Federalist president and a Republican vice president.

John Adams as President
guidingquestion IV/j at important events occurred during the presidency of John A dams?
John Adams spent most of his life in public service. He was well known as one of Massachusetts’s most active Patriots in the period before and during the Revolutionary War. He served two terms as vice president under Washington before becoming president. His time in office, however, was troubled.
The XYZ Affair
The nation was in the middle of a dispute with France when Adams took office. The French viewed the 1794 Jay’s Treaty as an American attempt to help the British in their war with France. To punish the United States, the French seized American ships that carried cargo to Britain.
President Adams sent a team of diplomats to Paris to try to resolve the dispute in the fall of 1797. French officials chose not to meet with the Americans. Instead, the French sent three agents who demanded a bribe and a loan for France from the Americans. The Americans refused.
When Adams learned what had happened, he was furious.
The president urged Congress to prepare for war. In his report to Congress, Adams used the letters X, Y, and Z in place of the French agents’ names. As a result, the event came to be called the XYZ affair.
Alien and Sedition Acts
When the public found out about the XYZ affair, many grew angry at foreign attempts to influence their government. They became more suspicious of aliens—residents who are not citizens. Many Europeans who had come to the United States in the 1790s supported the ideals of the French Revolution. Some Americans questioned whether these aliens would remain loyal if the United States went to war with France.
In response to these concerns, Federalists in 1798 passed the Alien and Sedition Acts. Sedition (sih.DIH.shuhn) means activities aimed at weakening the government. The Alien and Sedition Acts allowed the president to imprison aliens. The president could also deport—send out of the country those thought to be dangerous. President Adams was a strong supporter of these laws.

Democratic-Republicans saw the Alien and Sedition Acts as Federalist tyranny. They looked to the states to respond and protect people’s liberties. Madison and Jefferson wrote stateme of protest that the Virginia and Kentucky legislatures passed a; resolutions.
The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799 claimed that the Alien and Sedition Acts violated the Constitution. They declared that the states should not put then into action. The Kentucky Resolution further said that states could nullify (NUH»luh«fy)—legally overturn—federal laws tb thought were unconstitutional.

The issue of states’ rights would remain an important issue in American politics for many years.
Meanwhile, the Federalists urged Adams to declare war on France. Adams, however, resisted this pressure. Instead, he sent a representative to seek peace with France.
In 1800 the French agreed to a treaty and stopped their attacks on American ships. Though it had benefits for the United States, the agreement with France was unpopular and hurt Adams’s chance for reelection.

The Election of 1800
GUIDINGQUESTION
IV/jflf did the election of 1800 show about the nature of politics! In the election of 1800, the Federalist Party supported President Adams for a second term and Charles Pinckney for vice president. The Republicans nominated Thomas Jefferson for president and Aaron Burr as his running mate.
The election campaign of 1800 was very different from the political campaigns we see today. Neither Adams nor Jefferson traveled around the country to gather support. Many thought direct campaigning improper for a person who would be president. Instead, hundreds of letters were sent to leading citizens and newspapers to make candidates’ views public.
The campaign was bitterly fought. Each political party made personal attacks against the other. For example, the Federalists accused Jefferson, who believed in freedom of religion, of being godless. The Republicans warned that the Federalist Party favored the wealthy and would bring back monarchy.
The Vote Is Tied
Under the Constitution, voters in a presidential election are really electing groups of people called electors. These electors form what is known as the Electoral College. They cast the ballots that

actually elect the president and vice president. Each state has as many electors and electoral votes as it has members of Congress.
At that time, the Constitution said that electors were to cast two ballots—without indicating which was for president and which was for vice president. The candidate with the majority of votes became president, and the candidate with the next-largest number of votes became vice president. In 1800, 73 electors cast their ballots for Jefferson and Burr. Each candidate, therefore, got the same number of votes. Because of the tie vote, the House of Representatives had to decide the election.
In the House, Federalists tried to keep Jefferson from becoming president by supporting Burr. For 35 ballots, the election remained tied. Finally, one Federalist decided not to vote for Burr.
Because no one wanted to see another tie between a presidential and vice-presidential candidate, in 1803 Congress passed the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified the following year. From then on, electors cast one of their votes for president and the other for vice president.
Jefferson's Inauguration
On the day he became president, Jefferson dressed in his everyday clothes. He walked to the Senate to take the oath of office. President Adams did not attend.

government?" Try to answer your question, then read ahead to see whether your predictions are correct.	Lesson 1 j j g
The Jefferson Era
BIOGRAPHY
Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826)
In addition to his many achievements in government and politics, Jefferson was a noted inventor and architect. His inventions include a plow that was twice as fast as older ones, a machine for making macaroni, and a device that encoded messages. He also designed the house on his plantation (Monticello) and founded the University ofVirginia.

In his Inaugural Address, Jefferson outlined his goals, including “a wise and frugal government and the support of the state governments in all their rights. Jefferson believed that a large federal government threatened liberty and that individual states could better protect freedom. He wanted to limit the power, size, and authority of the central government.
H READING PROGRESS CHECK
Identifying What criticism did each political party make of the other inthe election of 1800?
Jefferson as President
guiding question What did Jefferson want to accomplish during his presidency?
Thomas Jefferson had strong ideas about government, and he surrounded himself with people who shared similar views. Jefferson and Albert Gallatin, secretary of the treasury, reduced the national debt and cut down on military expenses. Jefferson also limited the number of federal government workers to a few hundred people. At the same time, his government got rid of most federal taxes. They only collected customs duties, or taxes on imported goods. Under Jefferson, the government’s income would come from customs duties and from the sale of western lands. He believed that these changes would help to create a stable economic system.
Judiciary Act of 1801
After the election and before Jefferson took office, the Federalists passed an act to expand the nation’s court system. John Adams used this act, the Judiciary Act of 1801, to make hundreds of appointments during his last days as president. Adams also asked John Marshall to serve as chief justice. Congress was then still under Federalist control and supported Adams’s choices. In this way, Adams blocked Jefferson from making appointments and made sure the Federalists controlled the courts.
Adams s appointments could not take effect until these last-minute appointees, known as midnight judges,” received certain official papers, called commissions. When Jefferson became president, some of these appointees had not yet received their commissions. Jefferson told Secretary of State James Madison not to deliver them.

The Growing Power of the
Supreme Court
One of the appointees who did not
get his commission was William
Marbury. He asked the Supreme
Court to force its delivery. The Court
said it did not have the jurisdiction
(jur»iss»DIK»shuhn)—the legal
authority—to force delivery of
Marbury’s commission. Marbury had
argued that an act of Congress gave the Court such authority, but the Court ruled that that act violated the Constitution.
The ruling in Marbury v. Madison affected much more than William Marbury’s career. In this landmark case, Chief Justice John Marshall established the three principles of judicial review: (1) the Constitution is the supreme law of the land;
(2) the Constitution must be followed when there is a conflict with any other law; and (3) the judicial branch can declare laws unconstitutional. In short, Marshall claimed for the courts the power to find acts of other branches unconstitutional. Judicial review is a key check on the legislative and executive branches.
In his 34-year term as chief justice, Marshall helped broaden the power of the Court. He also expanded federal power at the expense of the states. In McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), the Court held that Congress does have implied powers and that states cannot tax the federal government. In Gibbons v. Ogden (1824), the Court held that federal law overrules state law in matters affecting more than one state. In Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the Court decided that states could not regulate Native Americans. Only the federal government had that power.

Lesson 2
The Louisiana Purchase
QUESTION
Howdoesgeographylnfluencethewaypeoplelive? IT MATTERS BECAUSE
The Louisiana Purchase changed the size and shape of the nation and helped hasten westward expansion.
Westward, Ho!
guiding question How did Spain and France play a role in Americans moving west?
In 1800 the territory of the United States extended as far west as the Mississippi River. The area west of the river—known as the Louisiana Territory—belonged to Spain. The Louisiana Territory was an enormous area of land, stretching south to the city of New Orleans and west to the Rocky Mountains. Its northern boundaries remained undefined.
During the early 1800s, Americans moved west in search of land and adventure. These pioneers, many of them farmers, expanded settlement in Kentucky and Tennessee. Many also set out for even less-populated areas in the Northwest Territory. They made a long and exhausting journey over the Appalachian Mountains. Pioneers heading to the western lands had to travel along rough, muddy roads or cut their way through thick forests.
These westward-bound pioneers loaded their household goods into Conestoga (kah*neh*STOH»guh) wagons, sturdy vehicles topped with white canvas. The settlers traveled with their two most valued possessions: rifles and axes. They needed rifles for protection and to hunt animals for food. They used axes to cut paths for their wagons through the dense forests.
Many of the settlers set up farms along rivers that fed into the Upper Mississippi River. Farmers needed access to the Mississippi to transport their crops to markets. Their goods traveled down the Mississippi to New Orleans, where workers loaded them onto other ships bound for markets on the East Coast. The Spanish controlled the region, but they allowed the Americans to sail on the Lower Mississippi and trade in New Orleans. For the western farmers, this agreement was vital to their economic survival.
The French Threat
For some years, the Spanish allowed American goods to move freely in their territory. In 1802 the Spanish suddenly changed their policy, no longer allowing American goods to move into and beyond New Orleans. President Jefferson learned that Spain and France had secretly agreed to transfer the Louisiana Territory to France. Jefferson believed that France had also gained Florida in its secret agreement with Spain.
This news alarmed Jefferson. The agreement between Spain and France posed a serious threat to the United States. France’s leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, had plans to create empires in Europe and the Americas. French control would put American trade along the Mississippi River at risk. Congress authorized Robert Livingston, the new minister to France, to offer as much as $2 million for New Orleans and West Florida in order to gain control of the territory. Napoleon and Santo Domingo
Napoleon dreamed of a Western empire. He saw the Caribbean island of Santo Domingo as an important naval base from which he could control such an empire. Events in Santo Domingo, however, ended Napoleon’s dream. Inspired by the ideas of the French Revolution, Toussaint L’Ouverture (too*SAN loo»vuhr»TOOR) led enslaved Africans and other laborers in Santo Domingo in a revolt against the island’s plantation owners. After fierce fighting, the rebels won and declared the colony an independent republic. L’Ouverture established a new government.
In 1802 Napoleon sent troops to regain control of Santo Domingo, but they were not successful. By 1804, the French were driven out of Santo Domingo. The country adopted the name Haiti, from the name used by the original inhabitants of the island.

An Expanding Nation
guiding question How did the Louisiana Purchase open an area of settlement’
Napoleon had a problem: he needed money to finance his war against Britain. Without Santo Domingo, Napoleon had little use for Louisiana. In order to solve his money problem, he decided to sell the Louisiana Territory. A French official told U.S. representatives Robert Livingston and James Monroe that the entire Louisiana Territory was for sale. The offer took Livingston and Monroe by surprise. They did not have the authority to accept such an offer.
The deal, however, was too good to pass up. The new territory would provide plenty of cheap land for farmers for future generations. It would also give the United States control of the Mississippi River, which would protect domestic shipping interests. These benefits convinced Livingston and Monroe to close the deal, even though they did not have authorization to buy the whole territory. After a few days of negotiation, the parties agreed on a price of $15 million.
Jefferson worried that such a large purchase might not be legal. The Constitution said nothing about acquiring new territory. By what authority could he and the federal government buy the land? He thought of seeking a constitutional amendment, but he realized there was no time for such a step. Jefferson decided the government’s treaty-making powers allowed the purchase of the new territory. The Senate approved the purchase in October 1803. The purchase of the Louisiana Territory doubled the size of the United States.
The Lewis and Clark Expedition
Reading HELPDESK
Americans knew little about the land west of the Mississippi, and Jefferson wanted to learn more about the new territory he had just acquired. He persuaded Congress to sponsor an expedition to gather information about the new land. The expedition would document findings about the territory’s people, plants, and animals and recommend sites for future forts.
The expedition had another goal: finding and mapping the fabled Northwest Passage, a water route across North America. In order to trade with Asia, Europeans had to sail around Africa. Because the trip was long and costly, European explorers searched, unsuccessfully, for a more direct route. Once the Americas were colonized, Americans and Europeans continued

to sail around Africa or around the tip of South America in order to reach Asia. Finding a water route across North America became more important than ever.
Jefferson chose Meriwether Lewis, his 28-year-old private secretary, to head the expedition. Lewis joined the militia during the Whiskey Rebellion and had been in the army when Jefferson hired him as his private secretary in 1801. Jefferson apparently looked forward to one day sending out an expedition to explore the continent. He hired Lewis with that in mind. William Clark was co-leader of the expedition. Clark was 32 years old and a friend of Lewis’s. Clark also brought along York, an enslaved African American and lifelong companion of Clark’s. York was a key member of the expedition. He was especially helpful building ties with Native Americans, many of whom had never before seen an African American and were drawn to him.
Lewis and Clark were well-informed amateur scientists. They also had experience doing business with Native Americans. Together they assembled a crew of expert sailors, gunsmiths, carpenters, scouts, and a cook. Two men of mixed Native American and French heritage served as interpreters.
View the map “Exploring the Louisiana Territory” to follow the expedition’s route. In the spring of 1804, the expedition left St. Louis and worked its way up the Missouri River. On May 5,1805, Lewis described what they encountered along the trail, in his journal:
Sacagawea
(c. 1788-1812?)
Sacagawea was the daughter of a Shoshone chief. Lewis and Clark hired her and her husband, a French Canadian fur trader, as interpreters. Sacagawea proved extremely valuable. She negotiated the purchase of horses, found edible plants, and made moccasins and clothing. According to Clark, her presence helped calm the fears of Native Americans the group met during their journey.

The expedition encountered many Native American groups on the journey. A Shoshone woman named Sacagawea (SA»kuh»juh»WEE*uh) joined their group as a guide.
After 18 months and nearly 4,000 miles (6,437 km), Lewis and Clark reached the Pacific Ocean. They spent the winter there. Then they headed back east, returning in September 1806. The explorers had collected valuable information about people, plants, animals, and the geography of the West. Perhaps most important, their journey inspired people to move westward.

From 1804 to 1806, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark mapped and explored more than 7,000 miles (11,265 km).

Pike's Expedition
Lewis and Clark were not the only people Jefferson sent to explore the wilderness. Lieutenant Zebulon Pike led two expeditions west between 1805 and 1807. He traveled through the Upper Mississippi River valley and into present-day Colorado. In Colorado, he found a snowcapped mountain he called Grand Peak, known today as Pikes Peak.
From Pike’s travels, Americans learned about the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. Pike also mapped part of the Rio Grande and traveled across northern Mexico and what is now southern Texas.

Hamilton and Burr Duel
Alexander Hamilton was concerned about rumors of secession. He had never trusted Aaron Burr, and now he heard that Burr had secretly agreed to lead New York out of the Union. Hamilton accused Burr of plotting treason. Meanwhile, Burr was suffering setbacks in his political career. Blaming Hamilton for these troubles, Burr challenged him to a duel.
The two men—armed with pistols—met in Weehawken,
New Jersey, in July 1804. Hamilton hated dueling, which was illegal but popular among upper-class Americans at the time. Hamilton pledged not to shoot at his rival, but Burr took no such pledge. He aimed to shoot Hamilton, and he was successful. Seriously wounded, Hamilton died the next day.

American Ships on the High Seas
guidingquestion How did the United States become involved in a conflict with Tripoli?
In 1785 the ship Empress of China returned to New York from China. The ship’s cargo of tea and silk sold for a great profit. The chance for similar profit inspired others to follow in the Empress of China’s wake. Soon, American merchant ships were sailing regularly to China and India, as well as South America, Africa, and lands along the Mediterranean Sea.
In the mid-1790s, France and Britain were at war. French and British merchant ships stayed home to avoid capture by their enemies. American merchants took advantage of this opportunity. By 1800, the United States had almost 1,000 merchant ships trading around the world.
Piracy on the Seas
The practice of piracy, or robbery on the seas, made some foreign waters dangerous. Pirates from the Barbary States of North Africa—Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis—terrorized European ships sailing on the Mediterranean Sea.
The Barbary pirates demanded that governments pay tribute, or protection money, to allow their country’s ships to pass safely. If tribute was not paid, the pirates attacked and took ships and

War With Tripoli
The Barbary States also demanded that the United States pay tribute. In 1801 the ruler of Tripoli asked the United States for even more money. When President Jefferson refused to pay, Tripoli declared war on the United States. In response, Jefferson sent ships to blockade Tripoli.
In 1804 pirates seized the U.S. warship Philadelphia. They towed the ship into Tripoli Harbor and threw the crew into jail. Stephen Decatur, a 25-year-old U.S. Navy captain, took action. He slipped into the heavily guarded harbor with a small raiding party. Decatur burned the captured ship to prevent the pirates from using it. A British admiral praised the deed as the “most bold and daring act of the age.”

The war ended with the signing of a peace treaty in June I805, Tripoli agreed to stop demanding tribute, but the United States ! had to pay $60,000 for the release of the prisoners. Although the ’ United States no longer had to pay tribute to Tripoli, it continued | paying other Barbary States until 1816.
Violating Neutral Rights
Thomas Jefferson won reelection in 1804. The nation was at peace—but trouble was brewing. Across the Atlantic Ocean, Great Britain and France were fighting another war that threatened to interfere with American trade.
When Britain and France went to war again in 1803, the United States traded with both countries. By not taking sides in the war, the United States was able to continue with this trade. A nation not involved in a conflict enjoyed neutral rights, meaning its ships could sail the seas and not take sides.
American merchants prospered for two years. By 1805, however, Britain and France were each trying to block the other from trading with the United States. Britain blockaded the French coast and threatened to search all ships trading with France. France then announced that it would search and seize ships caught trading with Britain.
The British Abuse American Shipping
Officers of the British ship Leopard impress American sailors from the Chesapeake in 1807.
Reading HELPDESK
The British desperately needed sailors for their naval war. Many of their own sailors had deserted due to the terrible living conditions hard labor, harsh treatment, and terrible food—in the British Royal Navy. British naval ships began stopping American ships to search for suspected British deserters. The British then forced these suspected deserters to return to the British navy.
The practice of forcing people into military or naval services is called impressment (ihm«PREHS*muhnt). While some of the sailors taken were deserters from the British navy, the British impressed hundreds of native-born and naturalized American citizens.
The British often waited for American ships outside an American harbor, where they boarded and searched them. In June 1807, the British warship Leopard stopped the American vessel Chesapeake off the coast of Virginia. The Leopard’s captain demanded that he be allowed to search the American ship for .ritph deserters’ but the Chesapeake’s captain refused. In reply,

As you read classroom materials, list examples of well-written sentences with different structures. Compare your list with a partner's list.
When Britain violated America’s neutral rights, Jefferson banned some trade with Britain. After the attack on the Chesapeake, he took stronger measures.
Congress passed the Embargo Act in December 1807. An embargo (ihm»BAHR*goh) prohibits trade with another country. The act targeted Great Britain, but the embargo banned imports from and exports to all foreign countries. Jefferson wanted to prevent Americans from using other countries as go-betweens for forbidden trade.
The embargo of 1807 was a disaster. With ships confined to their harbors, unemployment rose in New England. Without European markets, the South could not sell its tobacco or cotton. The price for wheat fell in the West, and river traffic stopped. Britain, meanwhile, simply bought needed goods from other countries. Congress repealed the Embargo Act in March 1809. In its place, it passed the Nonintercourse Act. This act, which prohibited trade only with Britain and France, was also unpopular and unsuccessful.

CRITICAL THINKING
IMPORTS AND EXPORTS
1800-1820 A nation's balance of trade is the difference between the value of its exports and the value of its imports. A nation has a trade surplus, or positive balance of trade, when it exports more than it imports. It has a trade deficit, or negative balance of trade, when it imports more than it exports. For example, if the United States imported $50 in tea and exported $100 in cotton, it would have a trade surplus.
New Orleans was a major port in the early 1800s.

Lesson 3 331
The Election of 1808
Jefferson, following Washington’s precedent, made it clear that he would not be a candidate for a third term. The Republicans chose James Madison from Virginia as their candidate. The Federalists hoped that voter anger over the embargo would help them win. They nominated Charles Pinckney. Pinckney carried most of New England, but the Federalists gained little support from the other regions. Madison won the presidency with 122 electoral votes. Pinckney received just 47 votes.

guidingquestion What issues challenged James Madison during his presidency?
James Madison took office under unfavorable conditions. He faced major problems. The nation was involved in the embargo crisis, and Britain continued to halt American ships. Cries for war with Britain grew louder. Meanwhile, trouble was also brewing in the West.
War Looms
In 1810 Congress passed a new trade law. It would permit direct trade with either France or Britain, depending on which country first lifted its trade restrictions, or limits, against the United States. The British took no action, but Napoleon acted quickly, promising to end France’s trade restrictions.
In spite of that promise, the French continued to seize and sell American ships. On the verge of war, Americans were divided only over who the enemy should be. Although angry over French actions, Madison believed Britain was the bigger threat to the United States.

As tensions grew, some Native Americans renewed their contacts with British agents and fur traders in Canada.
Other Native Americans pursued a new strategy. Tecumseh (tuh»KUHM»suh), a powerful Shawnee chief, tried to build a confederacy among Native American nations in the Northwest.
Tecumseh wanted to halt white movement into Native American lands. He believed that a strong alliance—with the backing of the British in Canada—could achieve that goal. Tecumseh also thought the treaties the U.S. government made with individual Native American nations were worthless. “The Great Spirit gave this great island to his red children,” he said. No one nation, he believed, had the right to give it away.
Working alongside Tecumseh was his brother, Tenskwatawa (ten»skwah*TAH»wuh). Known as the Prophet, Tenskwatawa urged Native Americans to return to their ancient customs. His message gained a large following. He founded Prophetstown in northern Indiana, near where the Tippecanoe and Wabash Rivers meet.
Tecumseh Meets the Governor
The governor of the Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison, became alarmed by the growing power of the two Shawnee brothers. Fearing that they would form an alliance with the British, Harrison sent Tecumseh a letter. He warned Tecumseh that the United States had more warriors than all the Native American groups combined.
Tecumseh replied to Harrison in person.

The Battle of Tippecanoe was a victory for the Americans. Yet it came at a cost. After his people’s defeat, Tecumseh joined forces with the British who, settlers believed, had supplied his confederacy with guns.
The War Hawks Call for War
Meanwhile, President Madison faced demands for a more aggressive policy toward Britain. The loudest voices camefroma group of young Republican members of Congress known as the War Hawks. Led by Henry Clay of Kentucky and John Calhoun of South Carolina, they represented the West and South.
The War Hawks supported increases in military spending and were driven by hunger for land. War Hawks from the West wanted the fertile forests of southern Canada, whereas the southerners wanted Spanish Florida. The War Hawks also wanted to expand the nations power. Their nationalism (NA*shuh*nuh»lih»zuhm)—or loyalty to their country—appealed to a renewed American patriotism.
Not everyone, however, wanted war. The Federalists in the Northeast remained strongly opposed to it.
The Eve of War
By the spring of 1812, Madison knew that he could no longer avoid war with Britain. In a message to Congress on June 1, Madison asked them to declare war.
The British had already decided to end their policy of search and seizure of American ships. Unfortunately, news of Britain’s change in policy did not reach Washington, D.C., until it was too late. Once set in motion, the war machine could not be stopped. H READING PROGRESS CHECK

The War of 1812 changed how Americans felt about their country and how other countries viewed the United States.
Defeats and Victories
guidingquestion In what ways was the United States unprepared for war with Britain?
When the war began, the War Hawks were confident the United States would achieve a quick victory over the British. In reality, though, the Americans were unprepared for war.
The fighting force was small and ill-prepared. The regular army had fewer than 12,000 soldiers, 5,000 of whom were new recruits. Added to that were the state militias with between 50,000 and 100,000 poorly trained soldiers. Commanders who had served in the American Revolution were now too old to fight. In addition, not everyone supported the conflict. Some states opposed “Mr. Madison’s War.” The Americans also underestimated, or misjudged, the strength of the British and their Native American allies.
In July 1812, the war began. General William Hull led the American army from Detroit into Canada, where they met Tecumseh and his warriors. Fearing a massacre by the Native Americans, Hull surrendered Detroit to the British. Several other American attempts to invade Canada also ended in failure. General William Henry Harrison led one of these unsuccessful efforts. He decided that the Americans could make no headway as long as the British controlled Lake Erie.

U.S.
Naval Strength The U.S. Navy had three of the fastest frigates (FRIH.guhts), or warships, afloat. When the Constitution destroyed two British vessels early in the war, Americans rejoiced. Privateers, armed private ships, also captured many British vessels, boosting American morale.
Oliver Hazard Perry, commander of the Lake Erie naval forces, had his orders. He was to assemble a fleet and seize the lake from the British. The showdown came on September 10, 1813, when the British ships sailed out to face the Americans. In the bloody battle that followed, Perry and his ships destroyed the British naval force. After the battle, Perry sent General Harrison the message, “We have met the enemy and they are ours.”
With Lake Erie in American hands, the British and their Native American allies tried to pull back from the Detroit area. Harrison and his troops cut them off. In the fierce Battle of the Thames, Tecumseh was killed.
American forces also attacked York (present-day Toronto), burning the parliament. Still, though America had won several victories by the end of 1813, Canada remained under British rule. Defeat of the Creek
Before his death in the Battle of the Thames, Tecumseh had talked with the Creek in the Mississippi Territory about forming a confederation to fight the United States. With his death, hopes for such a confederation ended. The British-Native American alliance also came to an end.
In March 1814, Andrew Jackson led U.S. forces in an attack on the Creek in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. More than 550 Creek people died in that battle, and the Creek were forced to give up most of their lands.

and the United States. In the spring of 1814, British fortunes began to improve. After winning the war against Napoleon,
Britain was free to send more forces against the United States.
In August 1814, the British sailed into Chesapeake Bay and launched an attack on Washington, D.C. British troops quickly overpowered the American militia on the outskirts of the city. Then they marched into the American capital. “They proceeded, without a moment’s delay, to burn and destroy everything in the most distant degree connected with the government,” reported a British officer. Among the buildings set ablaze were the Capitol and the president’s mansion. Fortunately, a thunderstorm put out the fires before they could completely destroy the buildings.
The British did not try to hold Washington, D.C. Instead, they headed north to Baltimore. They attacked that city in mid-September, but the people of Baltimore were ready and held firm. A determined defense and fierce artillery fire from Fort McHenry in the harbor kept the British from entering the city.
As the bombs burst over Fort McHenry during the night of September 13, local attorney Francis Scott Key watched. The next morning he saw the American flag still flying over the fort. Deeply moved, Key wrote a poem that became known as “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Congress designated “The Star-Spangled Banner” as the national anthem in 1931.

Dolley Madison (1768-1849)
Dolley Payne Todd married James Madison in 1794, several years after the death of her first husband. While James Madison served as President Jefferson's secretary of state, Dolley acted as hostess for the widowed president. During the War of 1812 she showed remarkable bravery. In 1814 as the British approached the capital, she refused to leave the White House until she had packed up many valuable items, a painting of George Washington, and other priceless valuables.
CRITICAL THINKING
Drawing Conclusions Why do you think Dolley Madison risked danger to save White House valuables? A
Turning Point at Plattsburgh While British forces were attacking Washington and Baltimore, British general Sir George Prevost led about 10,000 soldiers south from Canada. Their goal was to capture Plattsburgh on the shore of Lake Champlain. An American naval force on the lake defeated the British fleet in September 1814. Fearing the Americans would surround them, the British retreated into Canada.
The Battle of Lake Champlain convinced the British to end the war in North America. They had defeated Napoleon in Europe. To keep fighting the United States would result in little gain and was not worth the effort.
The End of the War
In December 1814, American and British representatives met in Ghent, Belgium, to sign a peace agreement. The Treaty of Ghent did not change any existing borders. There was no mention of the impressment of sailors. Even neutral rights had become a dead issue since Napoleon’s defeat.
One final battle occurred before word of the treaty reached the United States. On January 8, 1815, the British advanced on New Orleans. Waiting for them were Andrew Jackson and his troops, who hid behind thick cotton bales. The bales absorbed the British bullets, while the British advancing in the open provided easy targets for American troops. In a short but gruesome battle, hundreds of British soldiers were killed. At the Battle of New Orleans, Americans achieved a decisive victory and Andrew Jackson became a national hero.
Nationalism and Economic Growth
Many New England Federalists had opposed “Mr. Madisons War.” In December 1814, they met at the Hartford Convention in Connecticut. To protect their interests, they made a list of proposed amendments to the Constitution. Some even talked about seceding from the Union.
The Federalists’ grievances seemed unpatriotic in the triumph following the war. The party lost support and declined as a political force, leaving only one major political party. The War Hawks of the Republican Party carried on the Federalist belief in a strong national government. They favored trade, western expansion, the energetic development of the economy, and a strong army and navy.

338 The Jefferson Era
The War of 1812 helped the United States to gain its economic independence. As a result of the war, Americans became less reliant on Europe for products and developed more of their own manufacturing. For example, the British blockade of America’s Atlantic coast during the war caused a shortage of cotton cloth throughout the country. The blockade forced Americans to set up cloth manufacturing and other industries.

The Story

From the earliest colonial days, each generation of settlers has carved out new western lands in the wilderness. They have cleared swaths of forests to build farms and settle new towns.
In 1775 Kentucky pioneer Daniel Boone leads a group of men through the Appalachian Mountains along the Cumberland Gap into the land Boone calls "Kentucke." They clear and widen an existing trail to create the Wilderness Road. This becomes the major pathway for settlers migrating westward. By 1792, Kentucky has become a state—the first U.S. state located west ofthe Appalachians.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
The Industrial Revolution of the late 1700s changed how people lived and worked.
Industrial Growth
guidingquestion How did new technology affect the way things were made?
In colonial times, most Americans lived in the same place that they worked, which was usually a farm. When they wanted or needed something, they made it. Using their hands and simple tools, people made much of their own furniture, farm equipment, household items, and clothing.
In the mid-1700s, people began producing goods through new methods. In Great Britain, inventors built machines that did some of the work involved in cloth making, such as spinning thread. These new machines ran on the power of flowing water. British cloth makers built factories, called mills, along rivers. In the mills, they installed large numbers of machines. To tend the machines, mill owners paid people wages, regular payment of money in return for work. People began to leave their homes and farms to work in the mills and collect wages. This historic change is so important that it is known as the Industrial Revolution.
The Industrial Revolution in the United States
The Industrial Revolution reached the United States around 1800. Mills and factories first appeared in New England because of its geography. First, New England’s poor soil made farming difficult People willingly gave up farm work to earn wages in mills and

materials, such as cotton, and the shipping out of finished goods,
such as cloth.
New Inventions
At the heart of the Industrial Revolution was technology. First, new machines changed the way people made cloth. Inventions ’ such as the water frame and spinning jenny spun thread, and the power loom wove the thread into cloth. Compared to making thread or cloth by hand, the machines saved time and money.
Other inventions followed. In 1793 Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin. The word gin is short for “engine.” It quickly removed the seeds from picked cotton and allowed a huge increase in cotton production.
In 1798 Eli Whitney received a contract from the U.S. government to make 10,000 rifles in 28 months. To produce this large quantity in a short time, Whitney devised a manufacturing method that would produce interchangeable parts. The idea was to make large quantities of uniform pieces that could replace any other identical pieces. Interchangeable parts opened the way for producing many different kinds of goods on a mass scale and for reducing the price of the goods.
The Rise of Factories
In 1790 Congress passed a patent law to protect the rights of
inventors. A patent gives an inventor the sole legal right to make	*'
money from an invention for a certain period of time. Thus,
patents, then and now, encourage technological innovation.	■>
The British also tried to protect their inventions. One law prohibited textile workers from sharing technology or leaving the country. Still, a British worker named Samuel Slater brought these secrets to the United States. He memorized the design of the machines used in the British factory in which he worked.
In the 1790s, Slater built copies, in the United States, of British machines that made cotton thread. Slater’s mill marked an important step in the Industrial Revolution in the United States.,
Francis Cabot Lowell improved on Slater s mill in 1814. Lowell s Massachusetts textile, or cloth, factory not only made thread, it also wove the thread into cloth. Lowell began the factory system in which all manufacturing steps are combined in one place.
Working in a factory was very different from working and living on a farm. Think about how working for wages changed the lives of people who had been used to making most of the goods they needed. How do you think life was different for the women in the picture below?
These young factory workers from the 1840s, known as "Lowell Girls," lived and worked together.

Free Enterprise
The capitalist economic system of the United States helped spur industrial growth. In capitalism, individuals and businesses own property and decide how to use it. The people—not the government—control capital, which includes the buildings, lam machines, money, and other items used to create wealth.
We also use the term free enterprise to describe the Americ; economic system. People are free to work wherever they wish and to buy, sell, and produce whatever they want. The main elements of free enterprise are economic freedom, relatively low taxes, profit, private property, and competition. Business owners produce the products they think will sell the best and make the most profit. Businesses compete for customers with low prices an high quality. This competition helps push businesses to improve. P READING PROGRESS CHECK

Agriculture Grows
GUIDINGQUESTION
Why did agriculture remain the leading occupation of Americans in the 1800s? While many New Englanders went to work in factories in the early 1800s, most Americans still lived and worked on farms.
In the Northeast, farms were small, so a family could do all the necessary work. Farmers in the Northeast usually sold their products locally.
Agriculture moved west along with American settlers.
Western farmers in the region north of the Ohio River found land that could support a thriving agriculture. Many of these farmers concentrated on raising pork and cash crops such as corn and wheat.
In the South, cotton production rose sharply after the invention of the cotton gin. In addition, the cotton gin encouraged planters to grow cotton over a much wider area. Southern farmers seeking new land moved west to plant and farm cotton. Large plantations across the Deep South were devoted to the cultivation of the valuable crop. Between 1790 and 1820, cotton production soared from 3,000 to 300,000 bales per year in the South.
The success and spread of cotton production created a huge demand for enslaved workers. Trade in enslaved Africans expanded. Between 1790 and 1810, the number of enslaved Africans in the United States rose from about 700,000 to 1.2 million.
As farmers moved west, the crops they planted varied according to the climate. While cotton was the common choice in the warmer South, grain crops such as wheat (shown here) and corn dominated the cooler areas to the north.

Economic Independence
guiding question Howdid the growth of factories and trade affect cities?
Small investors—such as shopkeepers, merchants, and farmers-provided the money necessary to build most new businesses. These people invested money in hopes of earning profits if the businesses were successful. Low taxes, minimum government regulations, private property, and competition encouraged the growth of the free enterprise system in the young nation. Growth of Corporations
In the 1830s, changes in the law paved the way for the growth of corporations. A corporation is a type of business that can have many owners. Because of their legal status, corporations can grow to a large size. They sell stock—shares of ownership in a company to raise the money to build factories and expand their business. Large corporations began to appear in this era, and their great size helped drive industrialization.

The word corporation comes from the Latin word corpus, which means "body." It is a group of people that acts together. A corporation continues to exist even after the people who first formed it have one. 350 Growth and Expansion

Cities Grow Up
The growth of factories and trade led to the growth of towns and cities. Many cities developed along rivers because factories could take advantage of the waterpower and easily ship goods to markets. Older cities such as New York, Boston, and Baltimore also grew as centers of commerce and trade.
Along New York City’s South Street, shipping piers extended for three miles (five km). One traveler wrote of the busy waterfront:

Every thought, word, look, and action of the multitude seemed to be absorbed by commerce. 99 —from The Growing Years, by Margaret L. Coit
To the west, towns such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Louisville were located on major rivers. As farmers in the West shipped more products by water, these towns grew rapidly.
Cities and towns looked different from modern urban areas. They featured wood and brick buildings and unpaved streets. Barnyard animals often roamed freely. There were no sewers to carry away waste, so diseases such as cholera and yellow fever were a threat. Fire was another danger. Sparks from a fireplace could easily ignite wooden buildings. Fires could be disastrous since few cities had organized fire companies. Yet cities offered many opportunities, such as a variety of jobs and steady wages.
As cities grew, residents built libraries, museums, and shops for people to enjoy during their leisure time. For many, the jobs and attractions of city life outweighed the dangers.

Headed West
guiding question What helped increase the movement of people and goods?
In 1790 the first census—the official count of a population-revealed that there were nearly 4 million Americans. At that time, most of these people still lived in the narrow strip of land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic Ocean. That pattern, however, was changing. For years, a few rugged American settlers had been crossing the Appalachian Mountains and settling in western lands. Now, a steady stream of settlers began moving west.
Daniel Boone and the Wilderness Road
Explorer and pioneer Daniel Boone was among the early western pioneers. In 1769 he explored a Native American trail through the Appalachian Mountains. Called Warriors’ Path, it led Boone through a break in the mountains—the Cumberland Gap. Beyond the gap lay the gentle hills of a land now called Kentucky. For two years, Boone explored the area’s dense forests and lush meadows.
In 1775 Boone rounded up 30 skilled foresters to make the trail easier to cross for pioneers migrating west. Boone’s crew widened Warriors’ Path, cleared rocks from the Cumberland

Building Roadways
The nation needed good inland roads for travel and to ship goods. Private companies built many turnpikes, or toll roads. Tolls, or fees paid by travelers, helped pay the cost of building the roads. Many roads had a base of crushed stone. In some areas, workers built “corduroy roads.” These roads had a surface made up of logs laid side by side, like the ridges of corduroy cloth.

The route closely followed that of a military road George Washington had built in 1754. It eventually reached Ohio and then Vandalia, Illinois. Congress viewed the road as vital to military readiness but did not take on any other road-building projects.
Traveling on Rivers
River travel was far more comfortable than travel by road, which was often rough and bumpy. Also, boats or river barges could carry far larger loads of farm products or other goods.
River travel had two big drawbacks, however. First, most major rivers in the eastern region flowed in a north-south direction, while most people and goods were headed east or west. Second, while traveling downstream was easy, moving upstream against the current was slow.
In the 1780s and 1790s, boat captains were already using steam engines to power boats in quiet waters. These early engines, however, did not have enough power to overcome the strong currents and winds found in large rivers, lakes, or oceans.
The Clermont's First Voyage
In 1802 Robert Livingston, a political and business leader, hired Robert Fulton to build a steamboat with a powerful engine. Livingston wanted the steamboat to carry cargo and passengers up the Hudson River from New York City to Albany.
In 1807 Fulton launched his steamboat, the Clermont. The boat made the 150-mile (241 km) trip from New York City to Albany in 32 hours. Using only sails, the trip would have taken four days.
The Clermont offered many comforts. Passengers could sit or stroll on deck or relax in sleeping compartments below deck. The engine was noisy, but its power provided a smooth ride.

Steamboats ushered in a new age of river travel. Shipping goods and moving people became cheaper and faster. Regular steamboat service began along the Mississippi River, between New Orleans and Natchez, Mississippi, in 1812. Steamboats also contributed to the growth of river cities such as Cincinnati and St. Louis. By 1850 some 700 steamboats were carrying cargo and passengers within the United States.
New Waterways
Steamboats improved transportation but were limited to major rivers. No such river linked the East and the West.
Business and government officials led by DeWitt Clinton in New York developed a plan to connect New York City with the Great Lakes region. They would build a canal—an artificial waterway—across the state of New York. The canal would connect the Hudson River with Buffalo on Lake Erie. From these points, existing rivers and lakes could connect a much wider area. The Erie Canal
Thousands of workers, many of them Irish immigrants, helped build the 363-mile (584 km) Erie Canal. Along the way they built a series of locks—separate compartments in which workers could raise or lower the water level. The locks worked like an escalator to raise and lower boats up and down hills.
Canal building was a hazardous task. Many workers died as a result of cave-ins or blasting accidents. Another threat was disease, which bred in the swamps where the workers toiled.
After more than eight years of hard work, the Erie Canal opened on October 26, 1825. Clinton, who was now governor of New York, boarded a barge in Buffalo and traveled on the canal to Albany. From there he sailed down the Hudson River to New York City. As crowds cheered, officials poured water from Lake Erie into the Atlantic Ocean.

CRITICAL THINKING
Analyzing Why do you think the canal helped populations grow?
Canal Travel Expands
At first, the Erie Canal did not allow steamboats because their powerful engines could cause damage to the canal’s earthen banks. Instead, teams of mules or horses hauled the boats and barges. A two-horse team pulled a 100-ton (91 t) barge about 24 miles (39 km) in one day. This was fast compared with travel by wagon. In the 1840s, workers strengthened the canal banks so that steam tugboats could pull the barges.
The Erie Canal’s success did not go unnoticed. By 1850 the country had more than 3,600 miles (5,794 km) of canals. Canals lowered shipping costs and brought prosperity to towns along their routes. They also linked regions of a growing country.

The formation of new states reflected the dramatic growth ofthe region west of the Appalachians. In 1800 only 387,000 white settlers lived west of the Appalachian Mountains. By 1820 that number had grown to more than 2.4 million people. Ohio, for example, had only 45,000 settlers in 1800. By 1820 it had 581,000 residents.
Early pioneer families often settled in communities along the great rivers, such as the Ohio and the Mississippi. These waterways provided a highway for shipping crops and other goods to markets. The growth of canals also helped expand the area open to settlement. Canals allowed people to settle on lands farther from the large rivers.
People often preferred to settle with others from their original homes. It was mainly people from Tennessee and Kentucky who settled Indiana, for example. Michigan’s pioneers came mostly from New England.
Western families often gathered together for social events.
Men took part in sports such as wrestling. Women met for quilting and sewing parties. Both men and women took part in cornhuskings. These were gatherings where farm families shared the work of stripping the outer layers from corn.
Life in the West did not have many of the conveniences of Eastern town life. The pioneers had not traveled to the West to live a pampered life. They wanted to make new lives for themselves and their families.
At the same time, these new settlers brought with them many ofthe same hopes and dreams held by people in the East. In this way, the western migration of American pioneers helped spread an American culture and way of life.

National Unity
GUIDING QUESTION
How did the country change after the War of 1812? With the end of the War of 1812, the intense divisions that once split the nation faded. In their place was a feeling of unity. In the 1816 presidential election, James Monroe, the Republican candidate, faced no serious opposition. The Federalists, weakened by doubts about their loyalty during the war, barely survived as a national party. Monroe won the election by an overwhelming margin.
A
Boston newspaper called this time the Era of Good ; Feelings. The new president was a living, breathing symbol of this mood. Monroe had been involved in national politics since the American Revolution. He wore breeches, or knee-length pants, I and powdered wigs—styles no longer in fashion. Yet with his	I
sense of dignity, Monroe represented a united country, free of political strife.
Outgoing President James Madison’s last message to Congress in 1817 expressed a growing nationalism, or strong loyalty to the nation. The War of 1812 had made clear that Jefferson’s ideal j, of a limited central government could not meet the needs of a nation in times of crisis. Sounding more like a Federalist than a Republican, Madison urged the federal government to guide

29D Identify points of view from the historical context surrounding an event and the frame of reference which influenced the participants.
The Second Bank of the United States
The charter for the First Bank of the United States expired in 1811, and Congress let the bank die. In 1816 the Republican majority in Congress approved the creation of a new national bank. President Madison signed the bill creating the Second Bank of the United States.
After the First Bank closed, many state banks had acted unwisely. They made too many loans and allowed too much money into circulation.
These actions led to inflation, a rise in the prices of goods. As prices rose, American families could buy less and less with each dollar. The absence of a national bank also meant the federal government had no safe place to keep its funds. The Second Bank of the United States restored stability to the money supply, helping American businesses to grow. Competition From Britain
Another challenge facing the economy was a flood of British goods following the War of 1812. British factories often had more advanced technology and methods than American factories. The British turned out goods of higher quality and at a lower price than goods made in the United States. Naturally, buyers preferred these goods. By flooding the United States with their goods, the British hoped to keep American businesses from competing.

Lesson 3 359
The varying views toward tariffs in different regions of the country were the result of each region’s unique economy. The South, for example, not only purchased manufactured goods from foreign nations, its planters also sold crops overseas. When imports from Europe decreased, Europeans had fewer dollars to buy cotton, tobacco, and other goods from the American South.

New Tariffs
American manufacturers called for high tariffs to protect their growing industries. To address this problem, Congress passed the Tariff of 1816. Unlike earlier revenue tariffs, which were meant to provide income for the federal government, this tariff was designed to protect American manufacturers from foreign competition by placing high taxes on imports. Merchants who paid the tariff on imported goods simply added the cost of the tariff to their prices. This made imported items more expensive for consumers and encouraged them to buy cheaper, American-made goods.
When Congress passed protective tariffs in 1818 and 1824 that were even higher than the Tariff of 1816, some Americans protested. Southerners were especially angry. They felt that the tariff protected Northern manufacturers at their expense. The South had few factories, so people there saw little benefit from high tariffs. What the Southern states did see were higher prices for the goods they had to buy.
Growing Sectionalism
The tariff dispute illustrated a growing sectionalism (SEHK»shuh»nuh«lih*zuhm)—differences in the goals and interests of different parts of the country. Such differences had existed since colonial times. Now it seemed they were growing sharper. In fact, they soon brought an end to the Era of Good Feelings.
In the early 1800s, three distinct sections developed in the United States—the North, the South, and the West. The North included New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. The South covered what is now the Southeast. The West included the area between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. Geography, economics, and history all contributed to sectional differences and differing ways of life in the United States. As the differences grew deeper, however, people began to wonder whether sectionalism might divide the nation.
Each section of the country had a strong voice in Congress in the early 1800s. Henry Clay of Kentucky represented the interests of Western states. John C. Calhoun of South Carolina spoke for Southern interests. Daniel Webster of Massachusetts protected the interests of New England. Each leader, although a nationalist at this time, remained concerned with protecting the interests of his own section of the country.
360 Growth and Expansion
Nationalism and the Supreme Court
Under the strong leadership of Chief Justice John Marshall, the U.S. Supreme Court backed the powers ofthe national ’ government over the states in three landmark decisions in the early 1800s. In the case of Fletcher v. Peck in 1810, the Court ruled that courts could declare acts of a state government void if they violated provisions of the Constitution. Then, in 1819, the Court decided the case of McCulloch v. Maryland. It said that the state of Maryland could not tax the local office of the Bank ofthe United States because it was the property of the national government. Allowing such a tax, the Court said, would give states too much power over the national government.
In this ruling, the Court also declared that the national bank was constitutional, even though the Constitution did not specifically give Congress the power to create a bank. Marshall observed that the Constitution specifically gave Congress power to issue money, borrow money, and collect taxes. Congress could also, he reasoned, do whatever was “necessary and proper” to carry out those powers.
In 1824 the Court again ruled in favor of federal government power in Gibbons v. Ogden. The state of New York had granted a monopoly (muh«NAH»puh«lee)—sole control of an industry— to a steamship operator running ships between New York and New Jersey. Under New York’s law, no other operator could run steamboats on the same route. The Supreme Court said that only Congress had the power to make laws governing interstate commerce, or trade between states.
Missouri Statehood
In 1819 the Missouri Territory asked Congress for admission as a state. Most Missouri settlers had come from Kentucky and Tennessee, which allowed slavery. They believed slavery ought to be legal in Missouri.
Representative James Tallmadge proposed that Missouri gradually abolish slavery in order to be admitted to the Union.
The House passed this plan, but the Senate blocked it.
At the time, the population in the North was slightly larger than that in the slave states of the South. Consequently, the North had 105 members in the House of Representatives, compared to the South’s 81 members. Representation in the Senate was balanced, with 11 slave states and 11 free states. The addition of Missouri as a free state would put the South in the minority in both houses of Congress.
BIOGRAPHY
Henry Clay (1777-1852)
Henry Clay had a long career in Congress that began when he was elected to fill a Senate vacancy when he was just 29, a year shy ofthe Constitution's age requirement. Clay's ability to resolve arguments earned him the nickname "The Great Compromiser." He believed strongly in the nation. In a speech on the Senate floor, he once said: "If the... sad event ofthe dissolution [breaking up] of this Union is to happen,... I shall not survive to behold the sad and heart-rending [upsetting] spectacle."

The Missouri Compromise
Debates in Congress heated to the boiling point. Fearing a split in the Union, Henry Clay suggested the Missouri Compromise. Clay proposed that Maine, in the Northeast, enter the Union as a free state. Missouri could then enter as a slave state. This would keep an even balance of power in the Senate—12 free states and 12 slave states.
The Missouri Compromise also addressed the question of slavery in the rest of the Louisiana Purchase territory. The compromise drew a line west from the southern boundary of Missouri—at 36°30' N latitude. The compromise blocked slavery north of the line but permitted it south of the line.
The Missouri Compromise promised a temporary solution to sectional conflict. It did nothing to solve the basic problem, however. Americans who moved west took their different ways of life with them. White Southerners wanted to take an economy based on slavery to their new homes. Northerners believed in labor by free people and wanted to establish that in the West. It was a disagreement that seemed to have no peaceful solution.

GUIDING QUESTION
How did the United States define its role in the Americas? The War of 1812 heightened Americans’ pride in their country. Americans also realized that the United States had to establish a new relationship with the powers of Europe.
Relations with Britain
During James Monroe’s presidency, the United States and Britain reached two key agreements. In the 1817 Rush-Bagot Treaty, both countries agreed to limit the number of armed naval vessels on the Great Lakes. Each country was to take apart or destroy other armed ships on the Great Lakes.
The Convention of 1818 set the northern boundary of the Louisiana Purchase territory between the United States and Canada at the 49th parallel. Each country agreed to maintain its border without armed forces. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams also negotiated the right of Americans to settle in the Oregon Country.
Relations with Spain
Spain controlled the colonies of East Florida and West Florida. In 1810 American settlers in West Florida rebelled against Spanish rule. The United States government then argued that West Florida was included in the Louisiana Purchase. In 1810 and 1812, the United States took control of sections of West Florida.

cede
to transfer control of something
The territory claimed by the United States reached west to the borders of Louisiana and Mississippi. Spain objected to losing part of West Florida but took no action against the United States.
Native Americans living in Spanish East Florida sometimes raided American settlements in Georgia. General Andrew Jackson was ordered to stop these Seminole raids. Jackson believed his order included pursuing the Seminoles into Florida. In the spring of 1818, William McIntosh, a Creek chief, led Creek allies against the Seminoles in Georgia. Meanwhile, Jackson followed fleeing Seminoles into Spanish West Florida. After pursuing the Seminoles, Jackson and his troops moved farther into West Florida. There they seized the Spanish forts at Pensacola and San Marcos. Secretary of State Adams had not authorized Jackson’s actions, but he did nothing to stop them or to punish Jackson.
Jackson s raid demonstrated American military strength compared to that of Spain. Secretary of State Adams believed that the Spanish did not want war and wanted to settle the dispute. Adams was correct, and with the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819, Spain ceded, or gave up control of, all claims and ownership to both East and West Florida. They also gave up claims to Oregon Country in the Pacific Northwest, while the United States agreed to Spanish control of Texas.

Spain Loses Power
Meanwhile, Spain was losing power elsewhere in its vast empire. In 1810 a priest named Miguel Hidalgo (ee.DAHL.goh) led a rebellion in Mexico. Hidalgo called for racial equality and the redistribution of land. The Spanish captured and executed Hidalgo, but by 1821 Mexico had gained its independence from Spain.
Simon Bolivar, also known as “the Liberator,” led the independence movement that won freedom for the present-day countries of Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Jose de San Martin successfully achieved independence for Chile and Peru. By 1824 Spain had lost control of most of South America. The Monroe Doctrine
In 1822 four European nations—France, Austria, Russia, and Prussia—discussed a plan to help Spain regain its American holdings. The possibility of increased European involvement in the Americas troubled President Monroe. There were also concerns about Russia’s intentions for controlling land in the Northwest.
The president issued a statement on December 2, 1823:
The United States would not get involved in the internal affairs or wars in Europe. It also would not interfere with any existing European colonies in the Americas. At the same time, the statement said, North America and South America “are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.” The Monroe Doctrine, as the statement came to be known, served as a clear warning to European nations to keep out of the Americas. It became a guiding force in American foreign policy in the decades ahead.

366 Growth and Expansion
by Mark Twain
Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), known as Mark
Twain, was born in Missouri. He spent his early years along the Mississippi River in the town of Hannibal.
Later, as a young man, Clemens trained as a river pilot’s apprentice. He used his experiences as a basis for many of the stories in his memoir, Life on the Mississippi. This book is a collection of humorous anecdotes and folktales that provides a glimpse into Twain’s life before he became a famous author.
Mark Twain used memories of his youth in writing Life on the Mississippi.
«I remember the annual processions of mighty rafts that used to glide by Hannibal when I was a boy,—an acre or so of white, sweet-smelling boards in each raft, a crew of
two dozen men or more. ...99
—from Life on the Mississippi
PRIMARY SOURCE
6i Between La Salle s opening of the river and the time when it may be said to have become the vehicle of anything like a regular and active commerce, seven sovereigns had occupied the throne of England, America had become an independent nation.
The river's earliest commerce was in great barges—keelboats, broadhorns. They floated and sailed from the upper rivers to New Orleans, changed cargoes there, and were tediously warped and poled back by hand. A voyage down and back sometimes occupied nine months. In time this commerce increased until it gave employment to hordes of rough and hardy men; rude, uneducated, brave, suffering terrific hardships with sailor-like stoicism;... heavy fighters, reckless fellows, every one, elephantinely jolly, foul-witted, profane; prodigal of their money, bankrupt at the end ofthe trip, fond of barbaric finery, prodigious braggarts; yet, in the main, honest, trustworthy, faithful to promises and duty, and often picturesquely magnanimous.
Vocabulary
sovereign one who holds power tedious boring stoicism the quality of not reacting to pleasure or pain elephantine having great size profane not religious prodigal wasteful prodigious large in size or quantity
magnanimous noble, generous
heyday the peak of one's strength
By and by the steamboat intruded. Then for fifteen or twenty years, these men continued to run their keelboats down-stream, and the steamers did all ofthe upstream business, the keelboatmen selling their boats in New Orleans, and returning home as deck passengers in the steamers.
But after a while the steamboats so increased in number and in speed that they were able to absorb the entire commerce; and then keelboating died a permanent death.
The keelboatman became a deck hand, or a mate, or a pilot on the steamer; and when steamer-berths were not open to him, he took a berth on a Pittsburgh coal-flat, or on a pine-raft constructed in the forests up toward the sources of the Mississippi.
Literary Element
Imagery is the use of descriptive and figurative language. It appeals to at least one ofthe five senses: hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling and touching. As you read, identify images that create a sensory experience. For example, how does Twain's description ofthe rafts appeal to your sense of smell?
In the heyday ofthe steamboating prosperity, the river from end to end was flaked with coal-fleets and timber rafts, all managed by hand, and employing hosts ofthe
rough characters whom I have been trying to describe. I remember the annual processions of mighty rafts that used to glide by Hannibal when I was a boy,—an acre or so of white, sweetsmelling boards in each raft, a crew of two dozen men or more, three or four wigwams scattered about the raft's vast level space for storm-quarters,—and I remember the rude ways and the tremendous talk of their big crews... for we used to swim out a quarter or third of a mile and get on these rafts and have a ride.

During the Jackson Era, elections became more democratic and our modern political system began to take shape.
New Parties Emerge
guiding question What new ways of campaigning appeared during the elections of 1824 and 1828?
From 1816 to 1824, the United States had only one major political party. This was the Democratic-Republican Party. The party was far from united. In 1824, four Democratic-Republican candidates competed for the presidency. Party leaders chose William H. Crawford, a former senator from Georgia, to be their candidate. Three other candidates were favorite sons—that is, they received backing from their home states rather than the national party. Their views reflected the interests of their regions.
Two favorite sons, Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay, were from the West. Clay, of Kentucky, was Speaker of the House of Representatives. Jackson, of Tennessee, was a hero of the War of 1812. Raised in poverty, he claimed to speak for Americans who had been left out of politics. The third favorite son, John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, was the son of former president John Adams. He was popular with merchants of the Northeast.
The House Chooses the President
In the election, Jackson received a plurality (pluh»RA«luh»tee) of the popular vote—the largest share. No candidate received a majority, or more than half, of the electoral votes. The

1824 * Eight electors in Maine voted for Adams and one voted for Jackson.
**Two electors in Delaware voted for Jackson and one voted for Crawford.
*** Twenty-six electors in New York voted for Adams, five voted for Crawford, four voted for Clay and one voted for Jackson, t Seven electors in Maryland voted for Jackson, three voted for Adams and one voted for Crawford, tt Three electors in Louisiana voted for Jackson and two voted for Adams.
ttt Two electors in Illinois voted for Jackson and one voted for Adams.
The election of 1824 produced great controversy.
Constitution requires that the House of Representatives select the president when no candidate has won a majority of the electoral vote.
As the House prepared to vote, Clay met with Adams. Clay agreed to use his influence as Speaker to defeat Jackson. With Clay’s help, the House chose Adams for president. Adams quickly named Clay to be secretary of state. In the past this office had been the stepping-stone to the presidency. Jackson’s followers accused the two men of making a “corrupt bargain” and stealing
the election.
Adams as President
Adams and Clay denied any wrongdoing. No one ever uncovered any evidence of a bargain. Still, the charge cast a shadow over Adams’s presidency.
In his first message to Congress, Adams announced his plans. In addition to improving roads and waterways, he wanted to build a national university and support scientific research.
Adams’s proposals upset his opponents. They wanted a more limited role for the federal government. It would be wrong, they believed, for government to spend money on such projects. Congress finally approved funds for improving rivers, harbors, and roads, but this was far less than Adams wanted.

CRITICAL THINKING
Comparing How did having only two presidential candidates in 1828 affect the results of this election?
The Election of 1828
By 1828, the Democratic-Republican Party had split. Jacksons supporters called themselves Democrats. The National Republicans supported Adams. Most Democrats favored states’ rights and distrusted strong central government. The National Republicans wanted a strong central government. They supported measures such as building roads and a national bank to facilitate economic growth.
During the campaign, both sides resorted to mudslinging, or attempts to ruin their opponents reputation with insults. The candidates also used slogans, buttons, and rallies. Such practices became a regular part of American political life.
In the election, Jackson received most of the votes cast in the frontier states. He also received many votes in the South, where his support for states’ rights was popular. John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, who had been Adams’s vice president, switched parties to run with Jackson. Calhoun also supported states’ rights. Jackson won the election easily. Shortly after the election, Jacksons supporters officially formed the Democratic Party. With the election of Jackson—a man from humble origins who had the support of the common man—the nation entered a new era: The Age of Jackson.

376 The Jackson Era
Jackson as President
GUIDINGQUESTION
How did Andrew Jackson make the American political system more democratic? Andrew Jackson had qualities most Americans admired. He was a patriot, a self-made man, and a war hero. Thousands of ordinary people came to Washington for his inauguration.
Expanded Voting Rights
President Andrew Jackson promised “equal protection and equal benefits” for all Americans—at least, all white American men. Jackson’s promise reflected the spirit of the times.
In the nation’s early years, only men who owned property or paid taxes could vote. By the 1820s, many states had loosened these requirements. White male sharecroppers, factory workers, and others could now participate in the political process. By 1828, nearly all states let voters, rather than state legislatures, choose presidential electors. Women still could not vote. African Americans and Native Americans had few rights of any kind.
Making Government More Democratic
Jackson disliked interest groups, organized groups of people who try to influence government in a way that helps their own interests. He also disliked people whose power came from privilege. Instead, Jackson and other Democrats wanted to further open government to the people. They were disturbed that the federal government had become a bureaucracy (byuh»RAH«kruh«see), a system in which nonelected officials carry out laws.
Andrew Jackson's supporters gather outside the White House hoping to shake hands with a president who seemed to be just like them.
CRITICAL THINKING
Drawing Conclusions Why do you think people identified so closely with Andrew Jackson? Andrew Jackson (1767-1845)
Like many of his supporters, Andrew Jackson was born in a log cabin. A j noted war hero, Jackson was called "Old Hickory" because he was said to be as tough as a hickory stick. Small ; farmers, craftspeople, and others who felt left out of the expanding American economy admired Jackson. They felt that his rise from a log cabin to the White House demonstrated the kind of J success story possible only in the United States.
CRITICAL THINKING
Drawing Inferences Why do you think voters would identify with a candidate who was from humble beginnings? Soon after taking office in 1829, Jackson fired many federal workers and replaced them with his supporters. The fired employees protested. But one Jackson supporter said: To the victors belong the spoils.” In other words, because Jackson had won the election, his supporters had the right to the spoils, or benefits, of victory. This practice of replacing current government employees with supporters of the winner is called the spoils system.
Jackson’s supporters also abandoned the unpopular caucus system, in which top party leaders chose the party’s candidates for office. Instead, parties began using nominating conventions (NAHM«ih»nayt«ing kuhn*VEN*shuhnz), where delegates from the states chose the party’s presidential candidate. This system allowed many more people to participate in the selection of candidates.

The Tariff Debate
guidingquestion Howdida fight over tariffs become a debate about states'rights versus federal rights?
A tariff is a tax on imported goods. In 1828 Congress passed a high protective tariff on manufactured goods from Europe. Manufacturers in the United States—mostly in the Northeast-welcomed the tariff. Because tariffs made European goods more expensive, Americans were more likely to buy U.S.-made goods. Southerners, however, hated the new tariff. The South traded cotton to Europe for manufactured goods, and the new tariff would make these items more expensive.

Vice President Calhoun, who believed in states’ rights, claimed that a state could nullify, or refuse to accept, a federal law if it was not in that state’s best interests. According to the states’ rights position, the Constitution was an agreement among the states to establish a national government. If an act of the national government went beyond the powers granted by the Constitution, a state had the right to refuse to obey.
President Jackson disagreed. If a state could nullify any federal law it considered unconstitutional, the power of the federal government would cease. He feared nullification could destroy the Union.

I
378	The Jackson Era
In 1830, at a Washington dinner marking Thomas Jefferson’s birthday, Jackson had a chance to make his feelings on nullification known. He offered a toast. Looking directly at Calhoun, the president declared, “Our Union! It must be preserved!” Answering Jackson’s challenge, the vice president rose with a toast of his own: “The Union, next to our liberty, most dear.” To make sure his meaning was clear, Calhoun added, “It can only be preserved by respecting the rights of the states.”
In 1832 Congress passed a lower tariff. It was not enough to cool the protest. South Carolina passed the Nullification Act, declaring it would not pay the “illegal” tariffs of 1828 and 1832. The state threatened to secede, or break away, from the Union if the federal government interfered.
To ease the crisis, Jackson backed a bill that would gradually lower the tariff. Jackson also vowed to uphold the law and asked Congress for the power to use the power of the federal government if it was needed.
Early in 1833, Congress passed the lower tariff bill and also the Force Bill, allowing Jackson to use the military to enforce federal law. South Carolina accepted the new tariff but nullified the Force Bill. Both sides claimed victory and the issue was put to rest—at least, temporarily.

Removing Native Americans
guidingquestion Why were Native Americans forced to abandon their land and move wesG
As the nation expanded west, many Native Americans still remained in the East. The Cherokee, Creek, Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw peoples lived in the mountains, plateaus, and swamps of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. These groups had created successful farming communities that were much like many other American communities. As a result, Americans considered them “civilized” and called them the “Five Civilized Tribes.”
Though Americans recognized the success of the Five Civilized Tribes, they did not necessarily respect their rights.
In fact, some white people wanted the Native Americans’ lands for themselves. To make this possible, they wanted the federal government to force eastern Native Americans to relocate to lands west of the Mississippi River.
Andrew Jackson supported the white settlers’ demand for Native American land. He had once fought the Creek and Seminole in Georgia and Florida to give the settlers more land. When he became president in 1829, he stated that he wanted to move all Native Americans to the Great Plains. Many people

believed this region to be a wasteland where American settlers would never want to live. Many people thought that if all Native Americans moved there, conflict with them would be ended.
The Cherokee Versus Georgia
In 1830 President Jackson pushed the Indian Removal Act through Congress. This law allowed the federal government to pay Native Americans to move west. Jackson then sent officials to make treaties with the Native Americans in the Southeast. In 1834 Congress established the Indian Territory. Most of the region was located in what is now the state of Oklahoma. This area was to be the new home for the Native Americans of the Southeast.
Most eastern Native American peoples felt forced to sell their land and move west. The Cherokee refused to do so. In treaties of the 1790s, the federal government had recognized the Cherokee as a separate nation. However, the state of Georgia, in which many Cherokee lived, refused to accept the Cherokee’s status. In 1830 Georgia made Cherokee land part of the state. It also began to enforce state laws in the Cherokee Nation.
As pressure for relocation mounted, the Cherokee appealed to the American people:

Still, Georgia pressured the Cherokee. In response, the Cherokee turned to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Worcester v. Georgia (1832), Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that Georgia had no right to interfere with the Cherokee. President Jackson, who supported Georgias efforts to remove the Cherokee, defiantly opposed the Supreme Court s ruling. “John Marshall has made his decision,” Jackson is said to have declared, “now let him enforce it.” No one was willing or able to challenge the failure of the president and Congress to enforce the Courts ruling.
The Trail of Tears
By 1835, the Cherokee were divided about what to do. That year the federal government convinced a small number of Cherokee— about 500 of them—to sign the Treaty of New Echota. In this treaty, the group agreed to give up all Cherokee land by 1838.
Cherokee Chief John Ross sent a protest to the U.S. Senate. Ross explained that the few Cherokee who signed the treaty did not speak for all the 17,000 Cherokee in the region. Many white Americans, including senators Daniel Webster and Henry Clay, also opposed the treaty as unfair. However, their pleas did not change the minds of President Jackson or the white settlers. In 1836 the Senate approved the treaty by a single vote.

382 The Jackson Era
When the treaty s 1838 deadline arrived, only about 2,000 Cherokee had moved west. Jackson’s successor, President Martin Van Buren, ordered the army to move the rest of them. In May 1838, General Winfield Scott arrived in the Cherokee Nation with 7,000 troops to remove the remaining Cherokee by force. He told them that resistance and escape were hopeless. The Cherokee knew that fighting would lead to their destruction. Filled with sadness and anger, Cherokee leaders gave in.
Between June and December 1838, soldiers rounded up Cherokee in North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. Under guard, the Cherokee began their march to Indian Territory in the West.
The forced relocation of some 15,000 Cherokee was a terrible ordeal. Most people were not prepared for the journey. Trouble started even before they set out. As the Cherokee crowded into camps and awaited the command to begin their march, illness broke out. As many as 2,000 Cherokee died.
Once on the trail, the Cherokee suffered from hunger and from exposure to the weather. These conditions led to the deaths of another 2,000 people.
When the relocation was over, about one quarter of the Cherokee population was dead. The Cherokee came to call their forced journey west the Trail Where They Cried. Historians call it the Trail of Tears.

Andrew Jackson disliked the Second Bank of the United States long before he became president. Congress had set up the bank in 1816 to hold the federal government’s money and to control the nation’s money supply. Private bankers rather than elected officials ran the bank. Its president, Nicholas Biddle, represented everything Jackson disliked. Jackson prided himself on being a self-made western pioneer who had started with nothing. Biddle came from a wealthy Philadelphia family and had a good education and experience in financial matters.
In addition, the Bank’s assigned duties made it a powerful institution. Many western settlers depended on being able to borrow money to run their farms. The Bank’s strict policies made such loans difficult to obtain. Like many other westerners, Jackson viewed the Bank as a monopoly that favored wealthy Easterners and limited western growth.

early for a new charter a government permit to run the Bank-even though the Bank’s charter did not expire until 1836. They thought this would force Jackson to take action against the bank.
Clay and Webster believed the Bank had the support of the American people. They thought that if Jackson tried to veto, or reject, the renewal of the Bank’s charter, he would lose support. Henry Clay wanted to run for president. He and Webster believed that Jackson’s veto would help Clay defeat the president in the 1832 election.
Jackson told Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, “The bank is trying to kill me. But I will kill it.” Jackson vetoed the bill. He argued that the Bank was unconstitutional despite the Supreme Court’s decision to the contrary in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819). This case had concerned whether the state of Maryland had the right to tax the national bank of the United States.
Webster and Clay were right about one thing. The Bank did play a large part in the election of 1832. Instead of gaining support for Clay as president, however, their plan backfired. Most people supported Jackson’s veto, and Jackson was reelected. Jackson then decided to “kill” the Bank even before its current charter ended. He ordered all government deposits withdrawn from the Bank and placed in smaller state banks. In 1836 he refused to sign a new charter for the Bank, and it closed.

CRITICAL THINKING
Analyzing Primary Sources What is the meaning of the documents that appear at Jackson's feet? The Panic of 1837
Jackson decided not to run for a third term in 1836. The Democrats chose Van Buren, Jackson’s vice president during his second term. The Whigs, a new party that included former National Republicans and other anti-Jackson forces, were the opposition. The Whigs nominated three candidates. Each had support in a different part of the nation. The Whigs hoped this tactic would keep Van Buren from getting a majority of the electoral votes. Then the election would be decided by the House of Representatives, which the Whigs controlled. The Whigs plan failed. Jackson’s popularity and support helped Van Buren win both the popular and the electoral vote.
Van Buren had barely taken office when a financial panic hit the nation. The panic was in part an effect of Jackson s victory over the Bank of the United States. When the Bank ceased operations in 1836, control over state banks vanis e

This cartoon blames President Van Buren's policies for the Panic of 1837. Van Buren is standing, second from the right.
Some of these banks began issuing huge amounts of banknotes. Concerned that these notes had little value, the government stopped accepting them as payment for purchasing public land, People began to Question the value of their banknotes, leading to economic panic.
The Panic of 1837 led to a depression, a severe economic downturn. Land values dropped and banks failed. Thousands of businesses closed. Many workers lost their jobs, and farmers lost their land. In cities across the nation, many people could not afford food or rent.
President Van Buren did little to ease the crisis. He believed in the principle of laissez-faire—that government should interfere as little as possible in the nation’s economy. However, Van Buren did persuade Congress to create an independent federal treasury in 1840. This meant that the government no longer had to deposit its money in private banks as it had been doing. It would keep its money in the federal treasury instead.
This new system prevented state and private banks from using government money to back their banknotes. It helped prevent further bank crises.
Calling it a “second declaration of independence,” Van Buren and his supporters hailed the passing of the federal treasury law. Still, members of Van Buren’s own Democratic Party joined the Whigs in criticizing the act. The split in the Democratic Party gave the Whigs a chance to win the presidency in 1840.

The French term laissez-faire is a combination of a form of the verb laisser, which means "to let or allow," and the verb faire, meaning "to do." In translation, the phrase literally means "let them do." As a policy, it has been translated as "let them do as they please," referring to the people. In practice, it refers to giving the government the smallest role possible. 388 The Jackson Era

Lesson 3 389
During the campaign of 1840, the log cabin image appeared in paintings, banners, and political cartoons.
The Log Cabin Campaign
To run against Van Buren, the Whigs united behind one of their 1836 candidates, William Henry Harrison. Like Andrew Jackson, Harrison was a hero of the War of 1812. John Tyler, a planter from Virginia, was Harrison’s running mate. Harrison had first gained fame with his victory over Tecumseh’s followers in the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. The Whigs made reference to this event in the campaign slogan: “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too.
Harrison needed the support of the workers and farmers who had voted for Jackson in order to win the election. The Whigs portrayed Harrison, who in reality was a wealthy Ohioan, as a simple frontiersman like Jackson. The Democrats attacked this image. They said that all Harrison was good for was sitting in front of a log cabin and collecting his military pension. These attacks played right into the hands of the Whigs, who adopted the log cabin as the symbol of their campaign.
While presenting Harrison as a “man of the people,” the Whigs portrayed Van Buren as a wealthy snob with perfume-scented whiskers. They blamed him for the depression and accused him of spending the people’s money on expensive furniture for the White House. The Whigs’ tactics
and the effects of the depression seemed to work. A record number of voters turned out to elect Harrison by a wide margin, making him the first Whig president.
Inauguration day 1841 was bitterly cold. Harrison insisted on delivering his long speech without a hat or coat. He died of pneumonia 32 days later. He served the shortest term of any president, and John Tyler became the first vice president to gain the presidency because of the death of a president. At age 50, Tyler was also the nation’s youngest president up to that time.

390 The Jackson Era
John Tyler's Presidency
John Tyler won the vice presidential election as a Whig. However, he had once been a Democrat and had opposed many Whig policies. Whig party leaders had put him on the election ballot with Harrison mainly to attract Southern voters. Whig Party leaders Daniel Webster and Henry Clay had believed they could control Harrison and run the country behind the scenes. Harrison’s death ruined that plan.
President Tyler vetoed several bills sponsored by Whigs in Congress. His lack of party loyalty outraged many Whigs. When he twice vetoed a bill to renew the charter of the Bank of the United States, all but one of his cabinet members resigned. Only Daniel Webster remained as secretary of state. Whig leaders actually expelled Tyler from the Whig Party.
The biggest success of the Tyler presidency came in the area of foreign relations. In 1842 the United States and Great Britain signed the Webster-Ashburton Treaty. This agreement settled a long dispute over the border between Maine and Canada and set a firm U.S.-Canadian boundary from Maine to Minnesota.
Except for opposing Tyler, the Whigs could not agree on their party’s goals. Increasingly, they voted by region—North, South, and West—not party. This division may explain why the Whig candidate, Henry Clay, lost the election of 1844 to Democratic candidate James Polk. After only four years, the Whigs were out of power.
The Whigs elected just one more president, Zachary Taylor, in 1848. Taylor also died in office. By then, the Whig Party had become badly divided over the issue of slavery. By the early 1850s the party had nearly disappeared. Many Northern Whigs left the party and helped to form a new political party—the Republican Party that we have today.

Matters...
The six-month trip to the Oregon Country in the Northwest is hard and dangerous. Pioneers in "wagon trains" of up to 100 wagons wade or swim across swift rivers, climb steep mountains, face severe storms, and risk conflict with Native Americans.
These pioneers are also part of something bigger than themselves. They are helping the nation fulfill its "Manifest Destiny"—the idea that the United States should stretch from sea to shining sea.

Rivalry in the Northwest
guidingquestion Why did Americans want to control the Oregon Country?
The Oregon Country was a huge area located north of California, between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. It included all of what are now Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, plus parts of Montana and Wyoming. The region also contained about half of what is now the Canadian province of British Columbia.
In the early 1800s, four nations claimed the vast, rugged land known as the Oregon Country. The United States based its claim on Robert Gray’s discovery of the Columbia River in 1792 and the Lewis and Clark expedition. Great Britain had explored the Columbia River. Spain controlled California, and Russia had settlements south from Alaska into Oregon.
Adams-Onis Treaty
Many Americans wanted control of Oregon in order to gain access to the Pacific Ocean. During the administration of President James Monroe, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams negotiated the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819 with Spain. Spain agreed to set the northern border of New Spain at what is now California’s northern border and gave up all claims to Oregon.
In 1824 Russia also gave up its claim to the land south of Alaska.

Dealing with Great Britain was more complicated. In 1818 Adams worked out an agreement with Britain for joint occupation. This meant that people from both the United States and Great Britain could settle there. When Adams became president in 1825, he proposed that the two nations divide Oregon along the 49° N line of latitude. Britain refused, and the countries extended the joint occupation.
Mountain Men in Oregon
Fur traders had been the first Americans to take up the challenge of living in the Oregon Country. They came to trap beaver, whose skins were in great demand in Europe. The British established trading posts in the region, as did merchant John Jacob Astor of New York. In 1808 Astor organized the American Fur Company. The country’s leading fur company, it traded on the East Coast, in the Pacific Northwest, and in China.
At first, the fur merchants traded with the Native Americans.
Gradually others joined the trade. These tough, independent men spent most of their time in the Rocky Mountains and were known as mountain men. Many had Native American wives.
They lived in buffalo-skin lodges and dressed in fringed buckskin pants, moccasins, and beads.
Over time, the mountain men could no longer make a living by trapping. Overtrapping had reduced the beaver population, thus limiting the number of pelts available, and changes in fashion reduced demand for pelts. Some mountain men moved to Oregon and settled on farms.
THE RISE AND FALL OF THE FUR TRAPPERS

In the early 1800s, fur trappers could find plenty of beaver in the Oregon Country. In Europe, people liked to wear hats made out of beaver pelts (skins). After several years, the trappers had caught too many
beavers. There were few left.
Also, silk hats began to become more popular than beaver hats. As the supply and demand for pelts dropped, fur trappers had to find a new way to make money.

Reading HELPDESK
With their knowledge of the western lands, several mountain men, such as Jim Bridger and Kit Carson, found work as guides. They led the parties of settlers now streaming west. Beginning in the 1830s, the mountain men carved out several east-to-west passages that played a vital role in western settlement. The most popular route was the Oregon Trail. Others included the California Trail and the Santa Fe Trail.
READING PROGRESS CHECK
Identifying Which countries claimed the Oregon Country?
Oregon and Manifest Destiny
guiding question What is Manifest Destiny?
In the 1830s, Americans began traveling to the Oregon Country to settle. Economic troubles in the East and reports of Oregon’s fertile land drew many people.
Marcus and Narcissa Whitman
Among the first settlers were Dr. Marcus Whitman and his wife, Narcissa. They were missionaries who went to Oregon in 1836 and built a mission among the Cayuse people near the present site of Walla Walla,
Washington. They wanted to provide medical care and convert the Cayuse to Christianity.
The new settlers unknowingly brought measles to the mission. Native Americans had never been exposed to this disease. An epidemic killed many of the Cayuse children. The Cayuse blamed the Whitmans. They attacked the mission in November 1847 and killed the Whitmans and 11 others.
Along the Oregon Trail
The Whitman massacre was a shocking event, but it did little to stop the flood of pioneers on their way to Oregon. Drawn by reports of fertile Oregon land and driven by economic hard times in the East, many Americans took to the trail. These pioneers were called emigrants—people who leave their own country— because they left the United States to go to Oregon.

120"W

In 1843 about a thousand emigrants made the journey.
Tens of thousands more would follow in the years ahead. Before the difficult 2,000-mile (3,219 km) journey, these pioneers packed all their belongings. They stuffed their canvas-covered wagons with supplies. From a distance these wagons looked like schooners, or ships at sea, and people
called them prairie schooners. Gathering in Independence or other towns in Missouri, the pioneers followed the Oregon Trail across the Great Plains, along the Platte River, and through the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains. Then they turned north and west along the Snake and Columbia Rivers into the Oregon Country.
America Seeks Its Manifest Destiny
Since colonial times, many Americans had believed their nation s mission should be to serve as a model of freedom and democracy. In the 1800s that vision changed.
Lesson 1 401
Push-pull factors are reasons for people to leave one area and move to another area. Push factors—such as lack of economic activity or a natural disaster such as a hurricane or flood—drive people away from an area. Pull factors—such as a desirable climate or the opportunity to own land— attract people to an area.

Many believed that the nation’s mission was to spread freedom ■ by settling the entire continent. In 1819 John Quincy Adams 9 expressed what many Americans were thinking when he said	1
expansion to the Pacific was as certain as the Mississippi River 1 flowing to the sea.	|
In the 1840s, the United States entered a new era of westward 1 expansion. New York newspaper editor John O Sullivan declared j it was the United States’s “Manifest Destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has	j
given us.” O’Sullivan meant that the United States was clearly	‘
destined—set apart for a special purpose—by God to extend its boundaries all the way to the Pacific Ocean.
"Fifty-Four Forty or Fight"
Many Americans wanted the United States to take over all of Oregon. In the 1844 presidential election, James K. Polk, the Democratic nominee, supported this desire. Democrats used the slogan “Fifty-Four Forty or Fight,” referring to the line of latitude they believed should be the nation’s northern border in Oregon.
Polk’s Whig opponent, Henry Clay, did not take a strong position on the Oregon issue. Polk won the election because Whig support was not united behind Clay.
A firm believer in Manifest Destiny, Polk was focused on acquiring Oregon. Britain would not accept a border at 54°40' N latitude. In 1846 the two countries compromised. They set the border at 49° N latitude. It was the same boundary the British had rejected 21 years before.

Florida
guidingquestion Howdid Florida become a state?
When Spain transferred Florida to the United States on July 17, 1821, Florida became an American territory. Under the terms of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, Florida had an appointed territorial governor, a territorial legislature, and a nonvoting delegate to the United States Congress.
Tallahassee became the territorial capital in 1824. The capital was located about midway between St. Augustine and Pensacola, Florida’s major cities at that time. Not counting Native Americans, fewer than 8,000 people lived in the territory, including enslaved people. Later, as news of the area’s fertile land spread, thousands of new settlers streamed into Florida.
Many planters from Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas had worn out their soil with years of heavy planting. They left these lands with their depleted, or used up, soils for new land in Florida. Here, the planters established cotton and tobacco plantations, especially in northern Florida and the narrow strip in the northwest called the Panhandle. In addition, small farms and cattle ranches dotted the region of central Florida. The leading planters of northern Florida played a major role in the government and politics of the area.

Lesson 2 403
The Territory Grows
In 1837 the census for the territory of Florida reported that 48,000 people lived there. Enslaved people made up about one-half of Florida’s population. Officials organized a vote to determine if Floridians wanted to form a state. Only white men over 21 years of age voted in this election. These voters chose to seek statehood. Now Floridians had to draw up a state constitution and submit it to the U.S. Congress.
Florida voters chose 56 people to attend the constitutional convention in St. Joseph, a small port city on the Gulf Coast. The first constitution provided for a governor elected for four years and an elected General Assembly, or legislature. The constitution also allowed slavery and called for a system of public schools. The delegates approved the constitution on January 11,1839. Florida then sent the document to the U.S. Congress for final approval, or ratification.
Florida’s desire to enter the Union as a slave state caused some difficulty. Congress had long struggled to maintain an equal balance between slave and free states. As a result, it would take six years for Congress to act on Florida’s wish. Congress had to wait until another territory was ready to become a free state. Statehood for Florida
Iowa finally emerged as a free-state candidate. With the question of slavery removed. President John Tyler signed the Florida statehood bill. Florida became the twenty-seventh state in the United States on March 3, 1845. The next year, Iowa entered the Union as a free state. Thus, the balance between the slave and free states in the nation remained the same in Congress.

Texas
guiding question How did Texas become a state?
In 1821 Mexico won its independence from Spain. The land that is now the state of Texas was part of Mexico. At the time, the non-Native American population of Texas was about 3,000. Most of these people were Tejanos (tay.HAH.nohs), or Mexicans who daimed Texas as their home. Wishing to increase settlement, Mexico offered vast tracts of land to people who would agree to bring families to settle there—as citizens of Mexico. Stephen F. Austin brought 300 American families to settle in Texas.
Austin’s success made him a leader among the American settlers.
At first, Mexico encouraged Americans to settle in Texas. Before long, Americans greatly outnumbered Tejanos. Tensions with Mexico developed when Americans refused to follow Mexico’s rules. These included learning Spanish and becoming Catholic. Many Americans also had enslaved African Americans, which Mexico threatened to ban. In 1830 Mexico issued a decree, or official order, closing its borders to further immigration. American settlers, led by Austin and Sam Houston, tried to make peace with Mexican leaders. These efforts failed. Texans—including Americans and Tejanos—began planning to break away from Mexico.
In 1835 the conflict grew violent. Mexican general Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna took an army into Texas to punish the rebels. In December of that year, the Texans captured the city of San Antonio from a larger Mexican force. Santa Anna was enraged. His army reached San Antonio in late February 1836. There it found a small Texan force barricaded, or blocked off, inside a mission building called the Alamo.
The Alamo
The Texans had only about 180 soldiers to take on Santa Annas army of several thousand. The Texans did have brave leaders, however, including folk hero Davy Crockett, commander William B. Travis, and a tough Texan named Jim Bowie.

For 13 long days, through several attacks, the defenders ofthe Alamo kept Santa Anna’s army at bay with rifle fire. On March 6, 1836, Mexican cannon fire smashed the Alamo’s walls.
The Mexican army was too large to hold back. They entered the fortress, killing all the defenders, including Travis, Crockett, Bowie, and a number of Tejanos. Only a few women and children and some servants survived to tell of the battle.
The Alamo defenders had been defeated, but they had bought the Texans time to gather troops and supplies. They had also provided the Texans with a rallying cry: “Remember the Alamo!”
Texas Declares Its Independence
During the siege at the Alamo, Texan leaders met at the town of Washington-on-the-Brazos. Among them were a number of Tejanos, who were also unhappy with Mexican rule. On March 2,1836—four days before the fall of the Alamo—they declared independence from Mexico. They then established the Republic of Texas.
Texan leaders set up a temporary government. This government named Sam Houston commander in chief of the Texan forces. Houston gathered an army of about 900 at San Jacinto (san juh»SIHN*toh), near the site of present-day Houston, s Santa Anna camped nearby with an army of more than 1,300. j On April 21, the Texans launched a surprise attack, shouting, j “Remember the Alamo!” They killed more than 600 soldiers s

The Lone Star Republic
In September 1836, Texans elected Sam Houston as their president. Mirabeau Lamar, who had fought at the Battle of San Jacinto, served as vice president. Houston sent a delegation to Washington, D.C., to ask the United States to annex, or take control of, Texas.
Andrew Jackson, however, refused their request. The addition of another slave state would upset the balance of slave and free states in Congress. For the moment, Texas would remain an independent country.
Texas Becomes a State
Many Texans wanted to join the United States. Southerners favored Texas annexation, but Northerners opposed admitting another slave state to the Union. President Martin Van Buren did not want to inflame the slavery issue or risk war with Mexico. He put off the question of annexing Texas. John Tyler, who became president in 1841, supported Texas annexation. The Senate remained divided over the slavery issue and failed to ratify the annexation treaty.
The situation changed with the 1844 presidential campaign. Manifest Destiny was a popular idea at the time. The South wanted Texas. The North favored gaining all of Oregon.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
Mexican lands in the West became part of the United States.
The New Mexico Territory
guiding question How did the Santa Fe Trail benefit the New Mexico Territory?
In the early 1800s, the land called New Mexico was a vast region between the Texas and California territories. It included all of the land that is now the states of New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. Native Americans had lived in the area for thousands of years. Spanish conquistadors, or soldiers, arrived in the late 1500s. They made the region part of Spain’s American colonies. In 1610 the Spanish founded the settlement of Santa Fe. Spanish missionaries soon followed the conquistadors into the area.
Mexico—including New Mexico—won its independence from Spain in 1821. Before that time, the Spanish had tried to keep Americans away from Santa Fe. They feared that Americans would want to take over the area. The new Mexican government, however, welcomed American traders. Mexico hoped trade would boost the economy.
William Becknell, the first American trader to reach Santa Fe, arrived in 1821. Becknell’s route came to be known as the Santa Fe Trail. It was a big improvement over the other trails that existed in the dry and rugged area at that time. As Becknell wrote: “I avoided the so much dreaded sand hills, where adventurers have frequently been forced to drink the blood of their mules, to allay [relieve! their thirst.”

guiding question How did the culture of California develop?

The Santa Fe Trail started near Independence, Missouri, which was then on the western edge of the United States. It crossed the prairies to the Arkansas River. It followed the river west toward the Rocky Mountains before turning south. The trail was mostly flat, and Becknell used wagons to transport his goods.
Other Americans soon followed Becknell. The Santa Fe Trail became a busy trade route. As trade with New Mexico increased, Americans began settling in the area. Some began to believe that acquiring New Mexico was part of the United States’s Manifest Destiny.
Spanish explorers and missionaries from Mexico settled California in the 1700s. Captain Gaspar de Portola and Father Junipero Serra (hoo»NIP*uh»roh SEHR«uh) began a chain of missions that eventually extended from San Diego to Sonoma.
The missions aimed to convert Native Americans to Christianity and the Spanish way of life. On mission lands, Native Americans grew crops, tended livestock, and worked at weaving and other crafts. American mountain man Jedediah Smith described the missions as “large farming and [cattle-ranching] establishments.”
BIOGRAPHY
John C. Fremont (1813-1890)
John C. Fremont was a mapmaker who helped explore and settle the West. He led his third expedition to California in 1845. The United States was close to war with Mexico because of the conflict over Texas. In June 1846, he encouraged a small group of Americans during the Bear Flag Revolt. Fremont later wrote that he saw their actions as "movements with the view of establishing a settled and stable government, which may give security to their persons and property."
After Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, California became a Mexican state. Mexicans bought mission lands and set up huge ranches, or ranchos. Native Americans worked the land in return for food and shelter. Rancheros—ranch owners—treated Native Americans almost like slaves.
In the 1840s, more Americans reached California. John C. Fremont, an army officer, wrote of the region’s mild climate and vast natural resources. Americans began to talk about adding California to the Union. They argued that the nation would then be safely bordered by the Pacific Ocean rather than by a foreign country. Shippers also hoped to build seaports on the Pacific coast for trade with East Asia.

Conflict Begins
guidingquestion Why did war break out between the United States and Mexico?
President James K. Polk was determined to get the California and New Mexico territories from Mexico. After Mexico refused to sell the lands, Polk planned to gain them through war. To justify a
war,	Polk hoped to get Mexico to strike first.
Relations between the two countries were not friendly. The two nations disagreed about where the Texas-Mexico border
was.	The United States said that the Rio Grande formed the border. Mexico claimed that the border lay along the Nueces (nu«AY»sehs) River, 150 miles (241 km) farther north.
Polk sent a representative, John Slidell, to Mexico to propose a deal. Slidell could offer $30 million for California and New Mexico as long as Mexico accepted the Rio Grande as the Texas border. The United States would also pay what Mexico owed to American citizens. Mexican leaders refused to discuss the offer. They announced that they intended to reclaim Texas for Mexico.
To bring pressure, Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to lead U.S. forces into the disputed area on the Rio Grande. To Mexican leaders, Taylor’s action was an invasion of their country. On April 25,1846, Mexican troops attacked Taylor’s forces. President Polk told Congress that Mexico had ‘ invaded our territory and shed American blood upon the American soil.” On May 13, Congress passed a declaration of war against Mexico.

A
War Plan Polk planned to defeat Mexico by accomplishing three goals.
First, the United States would drive Mexican forces out of the disputed area between Texas and Mexico. Second, it would seize New Mexico and California. Finally, American forces would advance into Mexico and capture the capital, Mexico City.
By 1847, Zachary Taylor had accomplished the first goal. His army had captured all the important towns in the border area between Mexico and Texas. General Stephen Kearney made progress toward the second goal by marching his troops down the Santa Fe Trail. They captured New Mexico’s capital, Santa Fe, in 1846 after the Mexican governor fled. Kearney then turned toward California.
California Uprising
Even before war with Mexico officially began, American settlers in northern California had begun an uprising. They were encouraged by American general John C. Fremont. The settlers had little trouble overcoming the weak official Mexican presence in the territory. On June 14, 1846, the Americans declared California independent. They renamed it the Bear Flag Republic. The name came from the flag the rebels had made for their new nation.

The state flag of California today is based on the bear flag created during the Bear Flag Revolt in 1846.
The Bear Flag Republic did not exist for long. Within a month, American warships arrived at the ports of San Francisco and San Diego to claim the republic for the United States.
Mexico still refused to surrender, even though it had lost New Mexico, California, and Texas. President Polk sent General Winfield Scott and his troops to attack Mexico City. They landed in the port of Veracruz and captured it after three weeks of
fighting. They still needed to travel 300 miles (483 km) to Mexico City, fighting Mexican troops along the way.
Finally, in September 1847, six months after Scott’s forces had landed in Veracruz, they captured Mexico’s capital. Polk’s plan for the war had succeeded.

Peace Terms
Defeated on February 2, 1848, Mexico’s leaders signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (GWAH»duh»loop he»DAHL*goh). Mexico gave the United States more than 500,000 square miles (1,295,000 sq. km) of territory—what are now the states of California, Nevada, and Utah, as well as most of Arizona and New Mexico and parts of Colorado and Wyoming.
Mexico accepted the Rio Grande as its border with Texas. In return, the United States paid Mexico $15 million and assumed $3.25 million in debts Mexico owed American citizens.
With Oregon and the former Mexican territories under the American flag, the dream of Manifest Destiny had been realized. The question of whether the new lands should allow slavery, however, would lead the country toward another bloody conflict. Q READING PROGRESS CHECK

California Gold Rush
guiding question Howdid the discovery of gold help California?
When gold was discovered at Sutter’s Mill in 1848, people from all over the world traveled to California in search of riches. Those who arrived in 1849 were called forty-niners. As one official reported, “The farmers have thrown aside their plows, the lawyers their briefs, the doctors their pills, the priests their prayer books, and all are now digging gold.” Some people arrived by sea. Others traveled on the Oregon Trail or the Santa Fe Trail.
Americans made up about 80 percent of the forty-niners. Others came from Mexico, South America, Europe, and Australia. About 300 men arrived from China, the first large group of Asian immigrants to settle in the United States. Although some eventually returned to China, others remained and established California’s Chinese American community.

Lesson 4 415
A few forty-niners became rich from their work on the hillsides and streams of California, but most gained little or nothing.
Reading HELPDESK
The Land Law of 1851, however, established a group of reviewers who examined the Californios’ land rights.
When a new settler claimed land that was held by a Californio, the two parties would go to court. There, it was the Californio who had to prove his or her ownership of the land. Some Californios were able to prove their claims. Many others lost their cases and their land.
The Life of a Forty-Niner
As people rushed to a new area to look for gold, they built new communities. Towns and small cities appeared almost overnight. One site on the Yuba River had only two houses in September 1849. A year later, a miner arrived to find a bustling town of 1,000 people “with a large number of hotels, stores, groceries, bakeries, and... gambling houses.”
Cities also flourished during the Gold Rush. As ships arrived daily with gold seekers, San Francisco became a boomtown, growing quickly from a tiny village to a city of about 20,000 people.
Most forty-niners had no experience in mining. Whenever they heard that gold had been discovered at a particular site, they rushed to it and attacked the hillsides with pickaxes and shovels. They spent hours bent over streambeds, “panning” for gold dust and nuggets. Panning involved gently swirling water and gravel in a pan in order to remove dirt and, perhaps, reveal a small speck of gold.

‘ Mining camps contained men of all backgrounds but few women. Lonely and suffering hardships, many men spent their free hours drinking, gambling, and fighting. Mining towns had no police or prisons. As a result, citizens known as vigilantes (vih»juh«LAN»teez) formed committees to protect themselves. Vigilantes took the law into their own hands and acted as police, judge, jury, and sometimes executioner.
Economic and Political Progress
The Gold Rush had lasting effects on California. Agriculture, shipping, and trade grew to meet the demand for food and other goods. Many people who had arrived looking for gold stayed to farm or run a business.
Rapid growth brought the need for better government. In 1849, Californians applied for statehood and wrote a constitution. The constitution’s ban on slavery, however, caused a crisis in Congress. Southern states opposed California’s admission.
Congress eventually worked out a compromise by which California was admitted as a free state in 1850.

In 1862 Confederate forces enjoyed a string of impressive victories in Virginia, each over a different Union general. The Confederates turned back General George B. McClellan at the Seven Days’ Battle, General John Pope at the Second Battle of Bull Run, and General Ambrose Burnside at Fredericksburg. In May 1863, at Chancellorsville, Virginia, Lee’s army defeated a Union force twice its size. “My God, my God,” Lincoln said when he

the Union grew grim.
Lee Invades Maryland
Confederate president Jefferson Davis urged Lee to move his troops into western Maryland—Union territory. His goal was to move into Pennsylvania and to bring the war deeper into the Northern states. Though he knew McClellan was following him with a sizable force, Lee’s forces crossed into Maryland and began the invasion of Union territory.

The Battle of Antietam
Once in Maryland, Lee split his army into four parts. To confuse McClellan, he ordered each part to move in a different direction Lee’s plan never had a chance to work. A Confederate officer lost his copy of the orders describing it. Two Union soldiers found the orders and brought them to McClellan.
McClellan did not attack immediately. This gave Lee time to gather his troops. On September 17, 1862, the two sides met at a place called Antietam (an.TEE.tum) near Sharpsburg, Maryland.
Antietam was a key victory for the Union. It was also the deadliest single day of fighting in the war. About 6,000 soldiers died. About 17,000 more suffered wounds. Because of the great losses, Lee retreated to Virginia after the battle. For the time being, his strategy of invading the North had failed.

At first, Lincoln viewed the Civil War as a battle for the Union, not a fight against slavery. As the war went on, Lincoln changed the way he thought about the role of slavery in the war.
The Debate Over Ending Slavery
Lincoln hated slavery, yet he was reluctant to make the Civil War a battle to end it. Early in the war, Lincoln hesitated to move against slavery for fear of losing the border states. Even many white Northerners who disapproved of slavery were not eager to risk their lives to end it.
Meanwhile, abolitionists, including Frederick Douglass and newspaper editor Horace Greeley, urged Lincoln to make the war a fight to end slavery. The abolitionists described slavery as a moral wrong that needed to be abolished. They also pointed out that slavery was the root of the divisions between North and
. South. Finally, they argued that if Lincoln presented the war as a 1 fight to abolish slavery, Britain and France would be less wilhng j to support the South. Confederate hopes were increasingly linked - to this European support.
Emancipation Proclamation

Robert E. Lee (1807-1870)
Robert Edward Lee came from a leading Virginia family. He attended West Point Academy and graduated second in his class in 1829. Lee was still in the United States Army and stationed in Texas in 1861 when that state seceded from the Union. He returned to Virginia. Soon after his return, Virginia voted to secede from the Union. Lee resigned from the U.S. Army and became commander of Virginia's military forces.

Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation sent a clear message to enslaved people and the Confederacy about the future of slavery.
PRIMARY SOURCE
A
Call for Emancipation The Constitution did not give Lincoln the power to end slavery, but it did give him the power to take property from an enemy in wartime. By law, enslaved people were considered property, On September 22, 1862, Lincoln announced that he would issue the Emancipation Proclamation (ih»mant«suh»PAY»shuhn prah»kluh»MAY*shuhn). This decree freed all enslaved people in areas that were “in rebellion against the United States” on January 1,1863.
The Emancipation Proclamation did not change the lives of all enslaved people overnight. For example, enslaved people living in the loyal border states remained in bondage. Others remained under the direct control of their holders in the South and would have to wait for a Union victory before gaining their freedom.
Yet the Emancipation Proclamation had a strong impact. With it, the government declared slavery to be wrong. It was clear that a Union victory would end slavery in the United States.

Different Way of Life guiding question How did life change during the Civil War?
When the Civil War began, many young people left their homes to serve in the military. This meant leaving family and friends, and jobs or school.
Almost everyone who stayed home was touched in some way by the war. Only about half of the school-age children attended school because many had to stay home to help their families. Schools closed during the war in some areas, especially those near battles and skirmishes. Many schools and churches served instead as hospitals for the wounded.
Although the war affected everyone, life in the South changed most dramatically. Both armies spent the majority of their time on Southern soil. Because the fighting took place there, the South suffered the most destruction. Southerners who lived in the paths of marching armies lost their crops and sometimes their homes. Thousands of Southern civilians became refugees—people displaced by war.
Even those who lived outside the war zones suffered. As the war dragged on, many areas faced shortages of food and everyday supplies. Common household items became scarce.

New Roles for Women
GUIDING QUESTION
What were the new roles for women in the Civil War? Against the advice of family and friends, Kate Cumming, a young woman from Mobile, Alabama, left home to begin a career as a nurse with the Confederate Army of the Mississippi. Cumming was one of the many women whose lives changed because of the Civil War.
In both the North and the South, women kept the farms and factories going. They ran offices, taught school, and kept government records. Women suffered the stress of having husbands away at war and the pain of losing family members. They struggled to keep their families together. With little money available, they cut back on expenses and went without many things they were used to.
Caring for the Wounded
In the Civil War, thousands of women on both sides served as nurses. The idea of women nurses on the battlefield was a relatively new one. Many doctors did not welcome them. They said that women were too delicate for the bloody work of wartime hospitals. Some men also felt it was improper for women to tend the bodies of men they did not know.
Strong-minded women disregarded these objections. Serving with the Union army, Mary Edwards Walker became the first female army surgeon and later received the Congressional Medal of Honor. Dorothea Dix helped persuade officials to let women work as nurses. She became the superintendent of nurses for the Union army and recruited large numbers of women to serve. Another Northerner, Clara Barton, became famous for her work helping wounded soldiers. In the South, Sally Tompkins set up a hospital for soldiers in Richmond, Virginia. Tompkins held the rank of captain in the Confederate army and was the only female officer in the Confederate forces.
The women who served in wartime hospitals came face to face with terrible brutality. After the Battle of Shiloh, Kate Cumming wrote, Nothing that I had ever heard or read had given me the faintest idea of the horrors witnessed here.”
Spying
Women on both sides served as spies. For example, Rose O’Neal Greenhow entertained Union leaders in Washington, D.C. From them, she gathered information about Union plans and passed it

to the South. Greenhow eventually was caught and convicted of treason—the crime of betraying one’s country.
Harriet Tubman, a leading “conductor” on the Underground Railroad, also served as a spy and scout for the Union. In 1863 Tubman led a mission that freed many enslaved people and disrupted Southern supply lines.
Some women disguised themselves as men and became soldiers. Loreta Janeta Velazquez fought for the South at the First Battle of Bull Run and at the Battle of Shiloh. She later became a Confederate spy.

guidingquestion What were the conditions in hospitals and prison camps during the Civil War?
For many soldiers, battle could be a terrifying experience. For those with wounds or for those taken prisoner, the misery was just beginning.
In 1861 Dorothea Dix became superintendent of woman nurses for the Union army. Part of her job was to set up military hospitals like the brick building shown here. Dix served till the end of the war without pay.

Reading Strategy: Context Clues
Prisoners of War
Each side treated its enemy soldiers with a mixture of sympathy and hostility. At first the two sides exchanged prisoners. After this system broke down over issues such as Confederate treatment of African American prisoners, each side set up prison camps. A prisoner typically kept his blanket and a cup or canteen. These possessions were all he had during his imprisonment. Food shortages made the suffering worse. Volunteers distributed bread and soup to the wounded. In the prisons, though, there was little or nothing to eat.
Andersonville prison opened in Georgia in early 1864. It was built to hold 10,000 prisoners. By August, 33,000 crammed its grounds. The men slept in shallow holes dug in the ground. All they received to eat each day was a teaspoon of salt, three tablespoons of beans, and eight ounces of cornmeal. They drank and cooked with water from a stream that also served as a sewer. Almost 13,000 Union prisoners died there, mostly from disease.
The Union prison in Elmira, New York, was no better. Captured soldiers from the South suffered through the winter months without blankets and warm clothes. The hospital was located in a flooded basement. A pond within the compound served as both toilet and garbage dump. Almost one-quarter of all prisoners at Elmira died.
Field Hospitals
Surgeons set up hospitals near battlefields. There, with bullets and cannonballs flying by, they bandaged wounds and amputated limbs. Nurse Kate Cumming recalled:
M
We have to walk, and when we give the men anything kneel, in blood and water; but we think nothing of it. 99 —from Kate: The Journal of a Confederate Nurse
Disease was another medical threat. Crowded together in camps and drinking unclean water, many soldiers got sick. Disease spread quickly—and could be deadly. Some regiments lost half their men to illness before they ever went into battle.
Explaining Why were prison camps set up?

•	The word is defined immediately following its use.
•	A synonym or an antonym is used that explains the meaning.
•	Hints appear in the surrounding passage to help you figure out the meaning.
Doctors in the Civil War did not have many modern medicines. To prevent deadly infections, they often amputated wounded limbs with tools such as these.
Political and Change
guiding question What political and economic changes occurred during the Civil Wat?
In the South, many white people opposed the war. The fighting was costly, not just in terms oflives lost or damaged, but in food, material, and money. Everywhere, people suffered from shortages. Bread riots broke out throughout the South as hungry people took to the streets.
In Richmond, a group of mostly women and
children gathered peacefully to protest but soon started smashing shop windows and stealing food.
In the North, the Democratic Party was split down the middle. War Democrats supported the war while criticizing Lincoln’s handling of it. Peace Democrats argued for ending the fighting and reuniting the states. Most Peace Democrats came from Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana. Critics of the Peace Democrats called them Copperheads. A copperhead is a type of deadly snake. Rather than take offense, the Copperheads embraced this label by wearing pennies as badges on their clothing.
Northerners who opposed the war discouraged people from enlisting. A few even helped Confederate prisoners escape.
Opponents claimed that the Peace Democrats encouraged the South to keep fighting. T hey said the war dragged on because Confederates believed the Peace Democrats would eventually prevail in the North.
Jail Without Trial
As a way of dealing with war opponents in the North,
President Lincoln suspended habeas corpus (HAY«bee»uhs KAWR.puhs)—a legal process that helps ensure the government has a legal right to keep someone in jail. The Constitution says government can suspend habeas corpus, but only when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.
With this act, Lincoln’s government was able to jail thousands of Northerners without putting them on trial. Some of these people were likely traitors to the Union. Others did nothing more than use their right of free speech to criticize the government.
In the South, President Davis also suspended habeas corpus. He, too, believed he needed to deal harshly with opponents ofthe war. Still, Davis’s action upset many loyal supporters.
Draft Laws
Both the North and the South had trouble getting troops to sign up. In 1862 the Confederate Congress passed a draft that required able-bodied white men between ages 18 and 35 to serve for three years.

Technology and Industry
guiding question How did technology and industry change during the 1800s?
The early years of the 1800s saw much innovation in industry and technology. The ways in which Americans worked, traveled, and communicated underwent great change. The new ways of living affected the whole nation, but their effects were most dramatic in the North.
Three Phases of Industrialization
Before industrialization, workers made most goods one item at a time, from start to finish. To make clothes, a woman might spin the thread, weave the cloth, then cut and sew the fabric. Industrialization changed that way of working.
The North’s industrialization took place in three phases. During the first phase, employers divided jobs into smaller steps. For example, one worker would spin thread—and nothing else. Another worker wove cloth. Each worker specialized in one step and became an expert in it. Two specialized workers could produce more cloth than if each worker did both tasks.
During the second phase of industrialization, entrepreneurs built factories to bring specialized workers together. This allowed the product to move quickly from one worker to the next.

Taking Notes: Identifying Cause and Effect
As you read, use a diagram like the one shown to describe the three phases of the development of industrialization in the North.

In the third phase, workers used machines to complete tasks. For example, machines called looms wove cloth using the power of flowing water. The machines worked much faster than any human could. The worker’s job changed from weaving to tending the machine.
Mass production of cloth began in New England in the mid-1800s. Then, Elias Howe invented the sewing machine in 1846. Workers could now make clothing in mass quantities by using machine-made fabrics and sewing machines.
Similar changes were transforming other industries and affecting the North’s economy. By 1860, the Northeast’s factories made at least two-thirds of the country’s manufactured goods. Changing Transportation
Improvements in transportation contributed to the success of the new American industries. Between 1800 and 1850, crews built thousands of miles of roads and canals. By connecting lakes and rivers, canals opened new shipping routes. In 1807 inventor Robert Fulton launched his first steamboat, the Clermont, on the Hudson River. Steamboats made fast upstream travel possible. They carried goods and passengers more cheaply and quickly along inland waterways than flatboats or sail-powered vessels did.
In the 1840s, builders began to widen and deepen canals to make space for steamboats. By 1860, about 3,000 steamboats traveled the country’s major
rivers and canals, as well as the Great Lakes.
This encouraged the growth of cities such as Cincinnati, Buffalo, and Chicago.
Sailing technology also improved in the 1840s. The new clipper ships featured tall sails and sleek hulls. They could sail 300 miles (483 km) per day, as fast as most steamships at that
time. Clipper ships got their name because they “clipped” time from long journeys. They swiftly and cheaply moved goods from the eastern United,

In 1851 the Flying Cloud, a famed clipper ship, sailed from New York City to San Francisco in 89 days.

North and South The Railroads Arrive
The first railroads in the United States ran along short stretches of track that connected mines with nearby rivers. Horses pulled these early trains. The first steam-powered passenger locomotive began running in Britain in 1829.
A year later, Peter Cooper designed and built the first
American steam-powered locomotive. The Tom Thumb, as it was called, got off to a slow start. It actually lost a race staged against a horse-drawn train when its engine failed. Before long, however, engineers had improved the technology. By 1840, steam locomotives were pulling trains in the United States. In 1840 the United States had almost 3,000 miles (4,828 km) of railroad track. By 1860, the nations tracks totaled about 31,000 miles (49,890 km), mostly in the North and Midwest.
The new rail lines connected many cities. One line linked the cities of New York and Buffalo. Another connected Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Railway builders connected these eastern lines to lines being built farther west in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.
By 1860, the nation’s railroads formed a network that united the Midwest and the East.
Moving Goods and People
) The impact of improved transportation was felt deeply in the ; western areas of the country. Before canals and railroads, farmers
sent their crops down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. From J there, goods sailed to the East Coast or to other countries. This
took a considerable amount of time and often caused goods to be more expensive.
i Railways and canals transformed trade in these regions. The | opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 and later the railroad networks | allowed grain, livestock, and dairy products to move directly
from the Midwest to the East. Improvements in transportation | provided benefits to both businesses and consumers. Farmers and j manufacturers could now move goods faster and more cheaply, j As a result, consumers could purchase those goods at lower prices | than in the past.

The railroads also played an important role in the settlement of the Midwest and the growth of its industry. Fast, affordable train travel brought people into Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.
The populations of these states grew, as did urban railroad centers such as Chicago and Omaha. New towns and industries developed as more people moved into the area.

Build Vocabulary: Multiple Meaning Words___________	_
The word engineer has many meanings. As a verb, it can mean to use science ai math to make certain complex products. As a noun, it often means someone w applies those skills—for example, someone who builds buildings or electrical systems. The word also refers to the people who operate and drive trains.
In 1863 construction began on a railroad to link the eastern and western United States. Two competing railroad companies began laying track from Sacramento, California, and Omaha, Nebraska. They met at Promontory Point, Utah, on May 10,1869, where the final spike linking the two tracks was driven. With the transcontinental railroad s completion, the American West was opened for settlement.
Progress With Problems
As more people moved more quickly along railways and waterways, the possibility of disaster also increased. The SS Central America was a 270-foot side-wheel steamer that carried passengers and cargo between New York and the Central American country of Panama. In September 1857, the ship was carrying a full load of passengers when it steamed into a hurricane. It sank off the coast of the Carolinas, and hundreds of people drowned.
In Pennsylvania, some 60 people were killed and more than 100 injured when two trains slammed head on into each other in July 1856. The Great Train Wreck of 1856 horrified the nation. Newspapers demanded that railroad companies improve their methods and equipment and make the safety of passengers their first concern.
Communications Breakthroughs
The growth of industry and the new pace of travel created a need for faster methods of communication. The telegraph (teh»luh»graf) a device that used electric signals to send messages filled that need.

BIOGRAPHY
John Deere (1804-1886)
John Deere was born in Vermont. He trained as a blacksmith but found it difficult to make a living in his home state. He traveled to the state of Illinois in the 1830s.There he learned that farmers were having a difficult time plowing the region's rich but sticky soil with the rough iron plows ofthe day. Deere began making a polished steel plow that performed much better. Within 10 years, Deere was selling 1,000 plows per year. He was quoted as saying, "I will never put my name on a product that does not have in it the best that is in me."
CRITICAL THINKING
Drawing Condusions What can you conclude about how Deere's invention benefited his farmer customers?
Samuel Morse, an American inventor, developed a system for sending coded messages instantly along electrical wires. After Morse showed his system could send messages over a short distance, Congress gave him money to test the device over a wider area. Morse strung wires between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland. On May 24, 1844, he was ready to tryout his system. A crowd of people watched as Morse tapped out the words “What hath God wrought” on his telegraph system. A few moments later, the operator in Baltimore sent the same message back in reply. Morse’s telegraph had worked!
Telegraph operators sent messages quickly by using Morse code. This code uses different arrangements of short and long signals—dots and dashes—to represent letters of the alphabet. Telegraph companies formed, and workers put up telegraph lines across the country. By 1852, there were about 23,000 miles (37,015 km) of telegraph lines in the United States.
The telegraph allowed information to be communicated in minutes rather than days. People could quickly learn about news and events from other areas of the United States. The telegraph also allowed businesses to become more efficient with production and shipping.

Farming Innovations
guidingquestion M/ftflf changes made agriculture more profitable in the 1830s?
In the early 1800s, few farmers were willing to settle in the treeless Great Plains west of Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota. Even areas of mixed forest and prairie west of Ohio and Kentucky seemed too difficult for farming. Settlers worried that their old plows could not break the prairie’s matted sod. They also worried that the soil would not be fertile enough to support fields of crops.
Advancements in Agriculture
Three inventions ofthe 1830s helped farmers overcome difficulties in farming the land. As a result, settlement expanded throughout wider areas of the Midwest.
Reading HELPDESK

Morse code a system of dots and dashes that represent the alphabet
430 North and South
One of these inventions was the steel-tipped plow developed by John Deere in 1837. This allowed farmers to cut through the hard-packed prairie sod. Knowing that they would be able to farm the land on the prairies helped people make the decision to move west. Equally important to the transformation of farming were the mechanical reaper, which sped up the harvesting of wheat, and the thresher, which quickly separated the grain from the stalk. Each of these innovations reduced the labor required for farming.
McCormick's Reaper
Cyrus McCormick was the genius behind the invention ofthe mechanical reaper. Before this invention, farmers had harvested grain with handheld cutting tools. McCormick’s reaper greatly increased the amount of crop a farmer could harvest. Because farmers could harvest more wheat, they could plant more of it. Growing wheat became profitable. Raising wheat became and would remain the main economic activity on the Midwestern prairies.
New machines and the ease of access to railroads allowed farmers to plant more acres with cash crops. Midwestern farmers grew wheat and shipped it east by train and canal barge. Northeast and Middle Atlantic farmers increased their production of fruits and vegetables.
In spite of improvements in agriculture, the North was steadily becoming more industrial and urban. Agriculture in the region was still growing, but industry was growing faster.

Reading HELPDESK
The Factories of the North
guidingquestion Why did many Americans push for reform in the workplace during this era?
The factory system played an important role in the nation’s economic growth. The factory system combined several steps of an item’s production under one roof. In the mid-1800s, machines took over more and more manufacturing tasks. These innovations changed the way goods were manufactured. The range of goods manufactured this way also increased. American factories began to turn out everything from fabric and clothing to shoes, watches, guns, sewing machines, and agricultural machinery. More goods were available at cheaper prices to a growing number of consumers, leading to economic growth.
Conditions for Factory Workers
Working conditions worsened as the factory system developed. Employees worked long hours. By 1840, the average workday was 11.4 hours. Longer days caused fatigue—and on-the-job accidents. Many factory machines had rapidly moving belts and other parts. These belts had no shields for protection, and many workers, especially children, suffered injuries from these belts. Belts were just one of the many hazards of factory work.
Employees often worked under harsh conditions. In the summer, factories were hot and stifling. The machines gave off heat, and there was no such thing as air-conditioning at that time. Likewise, in the winter workers were often cold because most factories had no heating.
No laws existed to control working conditions or protect workers. Factory owners were often more concerned about profits than about employees’ comfort and safety.
Child labor was also a serious problem. Children in factories often worked six days a week and 12 hours or more a day. The work was dangerous and hard. Young workers tended machines in mills and worked underground in coal mines. Reformers called for laws to regulate child labor, shorten work hours, and improve conditions. Many years passed before child labor regulations became law.
Workers7 Attempts to Organize
Workers tried various ways to gain better conditions in the workplace. By the 1830s, they began organizing into unions.
Skilled workers formed trade unions. These were groups of workers with the same trade, or skill. The idea was that by working together, union members would have more power than they would as individuals.
In New York City, skilled workers wanted to receive higher wages and limit their workday to 10 hours. Groups of skilled workers formed the General Trades Union of the City of New York. The workers staged a series of strikes in the mid-1830s. A strike is a refusal to work in order to put pressure on employers.
Going on strike was illegal in the early 1800s. In addition to the threat of losing their jobs, workers who went on strike faced punishment for breaking the law. In 1842 a Massachusetts court ruled that workers did have the right to strike. Workers would not receive other legal rights for many more years.
African Americans in the North
In the North, slavery had largely disappeared by the 1830s.
Still, racial prejudice (PREH.juh.dihs)—an unfair opinion of a group—and discrimination (dihs.krih.muh.NAY.shuhn) unfair treatment of a group—remained. Some discrimination was
1 political. For example, white men in New York no longer a to I own property in order to vote. Few African Americans enjoye S this right. Rhode Island and Pennsylvania passed laws to keep
African Americans from voting.
Connections to
TODAY
Child Labor Laws
In the United States today, federal laws place strict limits on the work children can do. The Fair Labor Standards Act limits the hours that a child under the age of 16 can work.
It also prohibits children from certain dangerous jobs, such as working in logging or operating a crane. States also have child labor laws, which are sometimes even more strict than federal law.
Manufacturers often hired children because they could pay children lower wages than adult workers.

Lesson 2 433
The women who worked at the Lowell mills communicated—and shared grievances—through a publication called the Lowell Offering. It included creative works on many topics, including the hardships facing factory workers.
Social discrimination also existed. Most communities in the North did not allow African Americans to attend public schools. Many communities also kept them from using other public services. African Americans often had to attend poor-quality schools and go to hospitals that were reserved only for them.
Discrimination had economic effects as well. In the business world, only a few African Americans found success. In New York City, Samuel Cornish and John B. Russwurm founded Freedom’s Journal, the first African American newspaper, in 1827. In 1845 Macon B. Allen became the first African American licensed, or given official authority, to practice law in the United States. Most African Americans, however, lived in poverty in the mid-1800s. Women Workers
Women also faced discrimination in the workplace. Employers often paid women half as much as they paid male workers. Men kept women from joining unions and wanted them kept out of the workplace.
In the 1830s and 1840s, some female workers tried to organize. Sarah G. Bagley, a weaver from Massachusetts, founded the Lowell Female Labor Reform Organization. In 1845 her group petitioned for a 10-hour workday. Because most of the workers were women, the legislature did not consider the petition. However, movements like this one paved the way for later movements to help working women. B REAPING PROGRESS CHECK

The Growth of Cities
guidingquestion Wh at challenges did European immigrants face in Northern cities!
Industrialization had a big impact on cities. Factories were usually in urban areas. Because factories drew workers, Northern cities grew in size in the early 1800s.
Urban Populations Grow
Some major cities developed between 1820 and 1840 from Midwestern villages located along rivers. St. Louis sits on the banks of the Mississippi River just south of where that river meets the Illinois and Missouri Rivers. By the mid-1800s, steamboats from north and south lined up along the docks of St. Louis.

Increased Immigration
Between the years 1840 and 1860, immigration to the United States grew sharply. The greatest number of immigrants came from Ireland. A plant disease, the potato blight, destroyed most of the Irish food supply in the 1840s. The people of Ireland faced famine, an extreme shortage of food. About 1.5 million of them left Ireland for the United States between 1846 and 1860. Many settled in Boston, New York City, and other Eastern cities.
The second largest group of immigrants in the United States between 1820 and 1860 came from Germany. Some sought work and opportunity.

Immigrants Face Prejudice
In the 1830s and 1840s, some people began to resist immigration.
They were known as nativists (NAY*tih*vihsts). Nativists „
believed that immigration threatened the future of native
American-born—citizens. They often blamed immigrants for
problems in American society. Some accused immigrants of
bringing crime and disease to U.S. cities.
Many nativists were members of the working class. They
accused immigrants of taking jobs from workers who were real
Americans. They were also angry that immigrants often wou
work for lower wages.

The Know-Nothing Party
In 1849 nativists formed a new political party. Because party members often answered questions about their group with the statement “I know nothing,” the party came to be known as the Know-Nothing Party. The Know-Nothings called for stricter citizenship laws. In 1854 the Know-Nothings became known as the American Party. The party was strongest in the North, where most immigrants were located.
The Know-Nothings, like most native white Americans, were Protestants. In contrast, most Irish immigrants, and some German immigrants too, were Roman Catholics. The Know-Nothings disliked Catholics because they followed the teachings of the pope. They feared that the Catholic immigrants would be more loyal to the pope than to the leaders of the United States. □ READING PROGRESS CHECK

L QUESTION
Wffy do people make economic choices? It Matters Because
The demand for cotton deepened the white South's commitment to slavery and a slave-based economy.
Rise of the Cotton Kingdom
guidingquestion How were the economies ofthe South and North different?
In the early years of the United States, the South had an economy based almost entirely on farming, despite the fact that settlers had developed only a small part of the region. Most Southerners lived in the Upper South, an area along the Atlantic coast in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. A few people had also settled in Georgia and South Carolina.
By 1850, the South had changed. Its population had spread inland to the Deep South. This region includes Georgia and South Carolina, as well as Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The economy of the South was thriving. That economy depended, however, on slavery. In fact, slavery grew stronger than ever in the South, while it all but disappeared in the North.
Cotton Is King
Southern planters grew mainly rice, indigo, and tobacco in colonial times. After the American Revolution, demand for these crops decreased. European mills now wanted Southern cotton.
Raising a cotton crop took a large amount of time and labor. After the harvest, workers had to carefully separate the plant’s sticky seeds from the cotton fibers.

Eli Whitney solved this problem with his invention of the cotton gin in 1793. Whitney’s gin quickly and easily removed seeds from cotton fibers. With a cotton gin, productivity (proh»duhk»TIH*vuh«tee)—the amount a worker can produce in a given time—shot up. The cotton gin helped workers process 50 times more cotton each day than they could by hand.
The use of the cotton gin had important consequences. It encouraged farmers to grow more cotton in more places. Because Southern planters relied on enslaved workers to plant and pick their cotton, the demand for slave labor increased. Slavery spread across a larger area of the South.
By 1860, the Deep South and Upper South remained agricultural, but each region concentrated on different crops. The Upper South grew more tobacco, hemp, wheat, and vegetables. The Deep South produced more cotton, as well as rice and sugarcane.
Because more workers were needed to produce cotton and sugar, the sale of enslaved Africans became a big business. Enslaved people in the Upper South were increasingly bought by slave traders who then sold them in the Deep South. This trade became known as the domestic slave trade.

Southern Industry
guiding question Why did industry develop slowly in the South?
Industry developed more slowly in the South than in the North. Why was this so? One reason was the boom in cotton. Agriculture, especially cotton farming, produced great profits. Building new industry is costly. Planters would have had to sell enslaved people or land to raise the money to build factories. They chose instead to invest in profitable agriculture—including enslaved Africans.
In addition, the market for manufactured goods in the South was smaller than that in the North. Enslaved people, who made up a large share of the population, had no money to buy goods. This limited local market discouraged industries from developing.
For these reasons, some white Southerners simply did not want industry. One Texas politician, Louis Wigfall, summed up that Southern point of view:
PRIMARY SOURCE
W
We want no manufactures: we desire no trading, no mechanical or manufacturing classes. As long as we have our rice, our sugar, our tobacco and our cotton, we can command wealth to purchase all we want. 99
—quoted in Louis T. Wigfall, Southern Fire-Eater
INCREASES IN PRODUCTIVITY
New inventions helped increase worker productivity in the 1800s. Increased productivity meant farmers could grow more cotton to sell. By the mid-1800s, cotton made up more than one-half of U.S. exports.
Cotton's role in the economy of the South—and the nation—increased in the 1800s.

LESSON 3 REVIEW
Factories in the South
Because the South had fewer factories, it depended on the North for manufactured goods. Some Southern leaders thought the South’s dependence was too great. They wanted to develop more industry in the region. These leaders also argued that factories would improve the economy of the Upper South.
William Gregg of South Carolina shared this view. He opened his own textile factory. Georgias Augustin Clayton also went into textiles, opening a cotton mill. In Virginia, Joseph Reid Anderson made Tredegar Iron Works one of the nation’s leading iron producers. The Alabama Iron Works also included a sawmill for producing lumber. These industries, however, were not typical of the South.
Southern Transportation
In general, farmers and the few manufacturers of the South relied on natural waterways to transport their goods. Most towns were located on coasts or along rivers because canals were scarce and roads were poor.
Southern rail lines were short, local, and not linked together. The South had fewer railroads than the North. This caused Southern cities to grow more slowly than Northern cities, where railways were major routes of commerce and settlement. The rail networks in the North also gave Northern manufacturers an advantage over their Southern competitors. Lower shipping costs allowed Northerners to charge less for their goods. By I860, only about one-third of the nation’s rail lines lay within the South. This rail shortage would hurt the South in the years to come.

Southern Agriculture
guidingquestion How were Southern farms different from Southern plantations?
Slavery was at the heart of the Southern economy, but that did not mean that every white person owned large numbers of enslaved people. White society in the South was complex and had many levels. Most white Southerners fit into one of four categories: yeomen, tenant farmer, rural poor, or plantation owner.
Small Farmers and the Rural Poor
Most white people in the South were yeomen (YOH«muhn), farmers who generally owned small farms of 50 to 200 acres (20-81 ha). These yeomen lived mostly in the Upper South and in the hilly areas of the Deep South. They did not practice plantation-style agriculture. They grew crops to use themselves and to trade with local merchants. Yeomen generally owned few or no enslaved African Americans.
Another group of Southern whites worked as tenant farmers. They rented land from property owners.
These classes of white Southerners made up the majority of the white population of the South. They lived in simple liomes_cottages or log cabins. The poorest of these groups lived in crude cabins.

These rural poor were often stubborn and independent. Though they were looked down upon by many, they were proud of their ability to provide for their families.
A few free African Americans also held enslaved workers. Some free African Americans bought members of their own families to free them, although others worked their enslaved workers in the same manner as white Southern planters. Plantation Owners
The larger plantations covered several thousand acres. In addition to the land they owned, plantation owners measured their wealth by the number of enslaved people they had. In 1860 only about 4 percent of slaveholders held 20 or more enslaved workers.
Earning profit was the main goal for owners of large plantations. To make a profit, they needed to bring in more money than they spent to run their plantations.
Large plantations had fixed costs. These are operating costs that remain much the same year after year. For example, the cost of housing and feeding workers is a fixed cost. There is no easy way to reduce a fixed cost.
On the other hand, the price of cotton changed from season to season. A change in price often meant the difference between a successful year for a plantation and a bad one.

North and South
Plantation owners—who were almost always men—traveled often in order to ensure fair dealings with traders. Their wives often led difficult and lonely lives. They took charge of their households and supervised the work done in the other buildings. They watched over the enslaved domestic workers and sometimes tended to them when they became ill. Women also often kept the plantation’s financial records.
Keeping a plantation running involved many tasks. Some enslaved people cleaned the house, cooked, did laundry and sewing, and served meals. Others were trained as blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers, or weavers. Still others tended livestock. Most enslaved African Americans, however, were field hands.
They worked from sunrise to sunset to plant, tend, and harvest crops. An overseer (OH«vuhr«see»uhr), or plantation manager, supervised them.

guidingquestion Howdid enslaved African Americans try to cope with their lack offreedom?
The social and economic realities of slavery made the life of most enslaved African Americans one of hardship and misery. They worked hard, earned no money, and had little hope of freedom. They lived with the threat that a slaveholder could sell them or members of their family without warning. In the face of these brutal conditions, enslaved African Americans tried to build stability. They kept up their family lives as best they could They developed a culture all their own that blended African and American elements. They came up with clever ways to resist slavery.
The punishments used against enslaved people included whipping, which could leave terrible scars.

American Music
From the rhythmic patterns and themes of work songs and spirituals arose a new musical form—the blues. The blues influenced later styles, including jazz, rock and roll, and rap.
Wynton Marsalis is a modern-day jazz musician whose music has its roots in work songs and spirituals.
In the face of this threat, enslaved people set up a network of relatives and friends. If an owner sold a father or mother, an aunt, an uncle, or a close friend stepped in to raise the children left behind. These networks were a source of strength in the lives of enslaved people. Large, close-knit extended families became an important part of African American culture.
African American Culture
In 1808 Congress banned the importation of enslaved persons. Slavery remained legal, but traders could no longer purchase enslaved people from other countries. Some illegal slave trading continued, but by 1860, almost all the enslaved people in the South had been born there.
Though most enslaved people were born in the United States, they tried to preserve African customs. They passed traditional African folk stories on to their children. They performed African music and dance.
Enslaved people also drew on African rhythms to create musical forms that were uniquely American. One form was the work song, or field holler. A worker led a rhythmic call-and-response song, which sometimes included shouts and moans. The beat set the tempo for their work in the fields.
African American Religion
Many enslaved African Americans followed traditional African religious beliefs and practices. Others, however, accepted the Christian religion that was dominant in the United States. Christianity became for enslaved people a religion of hope and resistance. Enslaved people prayed for their freedom. They expressed their beliefs in spirituals, African American religious folk songs. The spiritual below, for example, refers to the biblical story of Daniel, whom God saved from being eaten by lions:

Spirituals helped enslaved people express joy—but also sadness about their suffering here on Earth. Enslaved people also used spirituals as a way to communicate secretly among themselves.
Slave Codes
On large plantations, enslaved people might live in small communities such as this.
Enslaved people were also affected by political factors such as slave codes. Sometimes called black codes or Negro Laws, these were laws that controlled enslaved people in the Southern states.
One purpose of the codes was to prevent what white Southerners dreaded most—a slave rebellion. For this reason, slave codes prohibited enslaved people from gathering in large groups. The codes also required enslaved people to have written passes before leaving the slaveholder’s property.
The slave codes made teaching enslaved people to read or write a crime. White Southerners feared that an educated enslaved person might start a revolt. They thought an enslaved person who could not read and write was less likely to rebel.
Copper slave tags identified enslaved workers when they were away from their home plantation.

BIOGRAPHY
Harriet Tubman
(c. 1820-1913)
Harriet Tubman was born into slavery in Maryland. She escaped in 1849 and fled to Philadelphia. The following year Tubman returned to free her family. This began a career during which she made 19 trips to the slaveholding South and helped about 300 slaves escape to freedom. During the Civil War, Tubman helped the Union Army. In June 1863, she led a squad of African American soldiers on a South Carolina mission that led to the freeing of 800 enslaved African Americans. After the war, Tubman became an active women's suffragist and created the Home for the Aged in Auburn, New York. She died there in 1913.
CRITICAL THINKING
Drawing Conclusions Why do you think Tubman was willing to risk her own freedom to help free other enslaved African Americans? Reading HELPDESK

Two months after the uprising began, authorities captured and hanged Turner. Still, his rebellion terrified white Southerners. White mobs killed dozens of African Americans, many of whom had nothing to do with the rebellion. Whites also passed more severe slave codes, making life under slavery even harsher.
Armed revolts such as Turner’s were rare because enslaved African Americans realized they had little chance of winning. For the most part, enslaved people resisted slavery by working slowly or by pretending to be ill. Sometimes they might set fire to a plantation building or break tools. Such acts helped enslaved African Americans cope with their lack of freedom. Even if they were not free, they could strike back at the slaveholders. Escaping Slavery
Enslaved people also resisted by running away from their owners. Often their goal was to find relatives on other plantations. Sometimes they left to escape punishment.
Less often, enslaved African Americans tried to run away to freedom in the North. Getting to the North was very difficult. Among those who succeeded were Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, two African American leaders.
Most who succeeded escaped from the Upper South. A runaway might receive aid from the Underground Railroad, a network of “safe houses” owned by people opposed to slavery.
Moses Grandy, who did escape, spoke about the hardships runaways faced:
PRIMARY SOURCE
M
They hide themselves during the day in the woods and swamps; at night they travel.... In these dangerous journeys they are guided by the north-star, for they only know that the land of freedom is in the north. 99 —from Narrative of the Life of Moses 6ronitf
The big danger, of course, was capture. Most runaways were caught and returned to their owners. The owners punished them severely, usually by whipping.

GUIDING question MTjflf changes did urbanization introduce in the South by the mid-1800s?
Though mostly agricultural, the South had several large cities by the mid-1800s, including Baltimore and New Orleans. The 10 largest cities in the South were either seaports or river ports. Cities located where the regions few railroads crossed paths also began to grow. These included Chattanooga, Montgomery, and Atlanta.
Free African Americans formed their own communities in Southern cities. They practiced trades and founded churches and other institutions, yet their rights were limited. Most states did not allow them to move from state to state. Free African Americans did not share equally in economic and political life.
In the early 1800s, there were no statewide public school systems in the South. People who could afford to do so sent their children to private schools. By the mid-1800s, however, education was growing. North Carolina and Kentucky set up and ran public schools.
The South lagged behind other parts of the country in literacy (LIH»tuh«ruh*see), the ability to read and write. One reason was that the South was thinly populated. A school would have had to serve a wide area, and many families were unwilling or unable to send children great distances to school. Many Southerners also believed education was a private matter.

The Story
Matters...
Young Emily Dickinson excels at school, especially in Latin, science, and writing. Dickinson even takes the then-unusual step of attending college for a year, but she finds its strict rules unsuited to her creative energy.
As an adult, she spends less and less time in public. After the age of 40, she dresses only in white. She does not travel and chooses not to meet most visitors. She spends much of her time writing, eventually producing 1,800 brilliant gems of poetry. She is a literary pioneer— though few people at the time know it. Only 10 of her poems ever appear in print during her lifetime. Only in death is she recognized among the era's many women of achievement.

Religion and Reform
guiding question What was the effect of the Second Great Awakening?
In the 1800s, some Americans began to fear that the country was becoming too secular, or not religious, and began a series of religious meetings called revivals. Reverend James B. Finley described an early nineteenth-century revival this way:
PRIMARYSOURCE
Reading HELPDESK
M
The noise was like the roar of Niagara [Falls]. The vast sea of human beings seemed to be agitated as if by a storm.... Some of the people were singing, others praying, some crying for mercy.... While witnessing these scenes, a peculiarly strange sensation, such as I had never felt before, came over me. My heart beat tumultuously [violently], my knees trembled, my lip quivered, and I felt as though I must fall to the ground. 99 —from Autobiography of Rev. James S. hnky
At this time, people traveled great distances to hear preachers speak and to pray, sing, weep, and shout. This wave of religious interest—known as the Second Great Awakening—stirred the nation.
Also at this time, a new spirit of reform took hold in the United States. This spirit brought changes to American religion, education, and literature. Some reformers sought to improve society by forming utopias (yu»TOH»pee»uhs)—communities

based on a vision of the perfect society. Most of these communities did not last. A few groups, such as the Mormons, did form lasting communities.
The Impact of Religion
Attending revivals often made men and women eager to reform their own lives and the world. Some people became involved in missionary work or social reform movements. Among those movements was the push to ban alcohol.
Connecticut minister Lyman Beecher was a leader of this movement. He wanted to protect society from “rum-selling, tippling folk, infidels, and ruff-scuff.” Beecher and other reformers called for temperance, or drinking little or no alcohol. They used lectures, pamphlets, and revival-style rallies to warn people of the dangers of liquor.
The temperance movement persuaded Maine and some other states to outlaw the manufacture and sale of alcohol. States later
repealed most of these laws.
Changing Education
Reformers also wanted to improve education. Most schools had little money, and many teachers lacked training. Some people opposed the idea of compulsory, or required, education.
Religious revivals could attract thousands of people for days of prayers and song.

454 The Spirit of Reform
In addition, some groups faced barriers to schooling. Parents often kept girls at home. They thought someone who was likely to become a wife and mother did not need much education. Many schools also denied African Americans the right to attend.
Massachusetts lawyer Horace Mann was a leader of educational reform. He believed education was a key to wealth and economic opportunity for all. Partly because of his efforts, in 1839 Massachusetts founded the nations first state-supported normal school—a school for training high school graduates to become teachers. Other states soon adopted Mann’s reforms.
New colleges and universities opened their doors during the age of reform. Most of them admitted only white men, but other groups also began
winning access to higher education. Oberlin
College of Ohio, for example, was founded in
1833. The college admitted both women and
African Americans.

SKILLS PRACTICE________________

Helping People with Disabilities
Reformers also focused on teaching people with disabilities. Thomas Gallaudet (ga»luh»DEHT) developed a method to teach those with hearing impairments. He opened the Hartford School for the Deaf in Connecticut in 1817. At that same
time, Samuel Gridley Howe was helping people with vision impairments. He printed books using an alphabet created by Louis Braille, which used raised letters a person could “read” with his or her fingers. Howe headed the Perkins Institute, a school for the visually impaired, in Boston.
Schoolteacher Dorothea Dix began visiting prisons in 1841. She found some prisoners chained to the walls with little or no clothing, often in unheated cells. Dix also learned that some inmates were guilty of no crime. Instead, they were suffering from mental illnesses. Dix made it her life’s work to educate the public about the poor conditions for prisoners and the mentally ill. Her efforts resulted in states improving prisons and mental facilities.

Culture Changes
guiding question What type of American literature emerged in the 1820s?
Art and literature of the time reflected the changes in society and culture. American authors and artists developed their own style and explored American themes.
Writers such as Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau stressed the relationship between humans and nature and the importance of the individual conscience. This literary movement was known as Transcendentalism. Emerson urged people to listen to the inner voice of conscience and to overcome prejudice. Thoreau practiced civil disobedience (dihs»oh»BEE»dee*uhns)—the refusal to obey laws considered unjust. For example, Thoreau went to jail in 1846 rather than pay a tax to support the U.S.-Mexican War, which he believed was fought to expand slavery.
In poetry, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote narrative, or story, poems such as the Song of Hiawatha. Walt Whitman captured the new American spirit and confidence in his Leaves of Grass. Emily Dickinson wrote hundreds of simple, deeply personal poems, many of which celebrated the natural world.
American artists also explored American topics	KW
and developed a purely American style. Beginning in the 1820s, a group of landscape painters known as the Hudson River School focused on scenes of the Hudson River Valley. Printmakers Nathaniel Currier and James Merritt Ives created popular prints that celebrated holidays, sporting events, and rural life.

The Start of the Abolition Movement
guiding question How did Americans' attitudes toward slavery change?
Among the reformers of the early 1800s were abolitionists (a»buh«LIH«shuhn»ihsts), who sought the end of slavery. Though their voices were growing, their cause was not a new one.
The Early Movement
Even before the Revolution, some Americans had tried to limit or end slavery. Early antislavery societies generally believed slavery had to be ended gradually. First they wanted to stop the slave trade. Then they would phase out slavery itself. Supporters believed that ending slavery gradually would give the South’s economy time to adjust to the loss of enslaved labor.
At the Constitutional Convention in 1787, delegates debated slavery and its future. The delegates reached a compromise, allowing each state to decide whether to allow the practice.
By the early 1800s, the Northern states had ended slavery or adopted plans to gradually abolish it. Slavery continued in the South, however. In fact, the rise of the Cotton Kingdom increased the use of enslaved labor.
The reform movement of the early and mid-1800s gave new life to the antislavery cause. A growing number of Americans believed slavery was wrong and that the practice should end.

• abolitionist

Many wno leo tne antislavery movement came from the Quaker faith. In 1821 Benjamin Lundy, a Quaker, founded a newspaper in Ohio called the Genius of Universal Emancipation.
Its purpose was to spread the abolitionist message. “I heard the wail of the captive,” he wrote. “I felt his pang of distress, and the iron entered my soul.”
The Colonization Plan
There were many barriers to ending slavery. Many white Northerners still supported the practice. Even some white abolitionists worried about the effect free African Americans would have on society. They did not like the idea of hundreds of thousands of formerly enslaved people living in the United States.
In 1816 a group of influential whites formed the American Colonization Society. They planned to send free African Americans to Africa to start new lives. The society raised money to send free African Americans out of the country. Some went to the west coast of Africa, where the society acquired land for a colony. The first settlers arrived in Liberia (“place of freedom”) in 1822. In 1847 Liberia declared itself an independent republic.
The American Colonization Society did not stop the growth of slavery. It helped resettle only about 10,000 African Americans by the mid-1860s. Only a few African Americans wanted to go to Africa, while most wanted to be free in America.

The Movement Builds Strength
GUIDING QUESTION
Why did the reform movement gain momentum? Ending slavery gradually and colonization remained the main goals of antislavery groups until the 1830s. At this time, abolitionists began arguing that enslaved African Americans should be freed immediately. Slavery became America’s most pressing social issue.
Making the Case Against Slavery
Massachusetts abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison had a great influence on the antislavery movement. In 1831 he started a newspaper called The Liberator.
Garrison was one of the first white abolitionists to call for an immediate end to slavery. He rejected a slow, gradual approach. In the first issue of The Liberator, he wrote, “I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice.... I will not retreat a single inch—AND I WILL BE HEARD.”
Garrison was heard. He attracted enough followers to start the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1832 and the American Anti-Slavery Society the next year. By 1838, the groups Garrison started had more than 1,000 local branches.
Sarah and Angelina Grimke were two other early abolitionists. The sisters were born in South Carolina to a wealthy slaveholding family. They both moved to Philadelphia in 1832. While living in the North, the Grimke sisters spoke out for both abolition and womens rights.
To show their commitment to abolition, the Grimkes asked their mother to give them their family inheritance early. Instead of money or land, the sisters wanted several of the family’s enslaved workers. The sisters immediately freed them.
The Grimkes, along with Angelina’s husband, Theodore Weld, wrote American Slavery As It Is in 1839. This book collected firsthand stories of life under slavery. The book was one of the most powerful abolitionist publications of its time.
Harriet Beecher Stowe was another writer who made a major impact on public opinion. Her 1852 novel, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, became a wildly popular best-seller. The book portrayed slavery as a cruel and brutal system. Some people, however, strongly opposed the book and its message. Sale of Uncle Tom’s Cabin was banned in the South.

While serving in the House of Representatives, former president John Quincy Adams battled slavery. Adams introduced constitutional amendments providing for the gradual abolition of slavery. Adams’s amendments did not pass.
African American Abolitionists
Free African Americans in the North especially supported the goal of abolition. Most lived in poverty in cities and had trouble getting good jobs and decent housing. They were often subject to violent attacks. Yet these African Americans were proud of their freedom. They sought to help those who remained enslaved.
African Americans helped organize and lead the American Anti-Slavery Society. They subscribed to The Liberator. They also did their own writing and publishing. In 1827 Samuel Cornish and John Russwurm started the country’s first African American newspaper, Freedom’s Journal.
Born free in North Carolina and settling in Boston, writer David Walker published a powerful pamphlet against slavery. He challenged African Americans to rebel and overthrow slavery.
He wrote, “America is more our country than it is the whites’— we have enriched it with our blood and tears.”
In 1830 free African American leaders held a convention in Philadelphia. Delegates met “to devise ways and means for the bettering of our condition.’’ They discussed starting an African American college and encouraging free African Americans to move to Canada.

BIOGRAPHY

Sojourner Truth (1797-1883)
Sojourner Truth was a powerful voice for abolition. Truth worked with William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, and others to bring about the end of slavery. She traveled throughout the North and spoke about her experiences in slavery. Sojourner Truth was also an active supporter of the women's rights movement.
CRITICAL THINKING
Making Connections Why do you think Sojourner Truth later became involved with the women's rights movement?
The Role of Frederick Douglass
Frederick Douglass is the best-known African American abolitionist. Born into slavery in Maryland, Douglass escaped in 1838. He settled first in Massachusetts.
As a runaway, Douglass faced the danger of capture and a return to slavery. Still, he joined the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. He traveled widely to speak at abolitionist meetings. He even appeared at events in London and the West Indies. Douglass was a powerful speaker who often moved listeners to tears. He also edited the antislavery newspaper North Star.
Douglass made his home in the United States because he believed abolitionists must fight slavery at its source. He insisted that African Americans receive not just freedom but full equality with whites as well. In 1847 friends helped Douglass buy his freedom from the slaveholder from whom he had fled in Maryland. Sojourner Truth
“I was born a slave in Ulster County, New York,” Isabella Baumfree began when she told her story to audiences. After a childhood and youth filled with hardship, she escaped in 1826. Then, she officially gained her freedom in 1827 when New York banned slavery. Baumfree later settled in New York City with her two youngest children. In 1843 Baumfree chose a new name, Sojourner Truth—Sojourner because she “was to travel up an’ down the land, showin’ the people their sins” and Truth because she “was to declare the truth to the people.”
The Underground Railroad
Abolitionists sometimes risked prison and death to help African Americans escape slavery. They helped create a network of escape routes from the South to the North called the Underground Railroad.
Underground Railroad “passengers”—that is, escaping African Americans—traveled by night, often on foot. The North Star guided them in the direction of freedom. During the day they rested at stations —barns, basements, and attics—until the next night. The railroad s conductors” were whites and African Americans who guided the runaways to freedom in the northern United States or Canada. Harriet Tubman was the most famous conductor.
The Underground Railroad helped as many as 100,000 enslaved people escape. It gave hope to many more.

Reaction to the Abolitionists
guiding question Who opposed the abolition of slavery?
Abolitionists stirred strong reactions. Most white Southerners believed abolition threatened their way of life, which required enslaved labor.
Even in the North, only a minority of white people supported abolition. Many white Northerners worried that freed African Americans would never blend into American society. Others feared that abolitionists could begin a war between the North and the South.
Opposition to abolitionism sometimes led to violence. In Philadelphia a bloody race riot followed the burning of an antislavery group’s headquarters. Police had to jail William Lloyd Garrison to protect him from a Boston mob.
Elijah Lovejoy in Illinois was not so lucky. Angry whites invaded his antislavery newspaper offices and wrecked his presses three times. Three times Lovejoy installed new presses. The fourth time the mob attacked, it set fire to the building. When Lovejoy came out of the blazing building, someone shot and killed him.
The White South Reacts
White Southerners fought abolitionism with arguments in defense of slavery. They claimed that slavery was necessary to the Southern economy and had allowed Southern whites to reach a high level of culture. As anti-abolitionist Senator James Henry Hammond said in an 1858 speech to Congress: In all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life... . Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement.”
The John Rankin House, located along the Ohio River, was a station stop on the Underground Railroad. The Reverend John Rankin, along with his wife and children, assisted hundreds escaping from slavery.

CRITICAL THINKING
Summarizing Why did anti-abolitionists attack Elijah Lovejoy?
White Southerners also argued that they treated enslaved people well. They claimed that Northern workers were worse off than enslaved workers because they worked in factories for long hours at low wages. Also, Northern workers had to pay for their own goods and services from their small earnings, while enslaved African Americans received food, clothing, and medical care.
Other defenses of slavery were based on racism. Many whites believed that African Americans were better off under white care than on their own.
The conflict between pro-slavery and antislavery groups continued to mount. At the same time, a new women’s rights movement was growing.

It matters Because
Women began the long quest for expanded rights, including the right to vote, in the mid-1800s.
Reform for Women
guiding question What did women doto win equal rights?
For women such as Lucretia Mott, causes such as abolition and women’s rights were linked. Like many other women reformers, Mott was a Quaker. Quaker women enjoyed an unusual degree of equality in their communities. Mott was actively involved in helping runaway enslaved workers. She organized the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society. At an antislavery convention in London, Mott met Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The two found they also shared an interest in women’s rights.
The Seneca Falls Convention
In July 1848, Stanton and Mott helped organize the first women’s rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York. About 300 people, including 40 men, attended.
A highlight of the convention was debate over a Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions. These resolutions called for an end to laws that discriminated against women. They also demanded that women be allowed to enter the all-male world of trades, professions, and businesses. The most controversial issue, however, was the call for woman suffrage, or the right to vote in elections.

IDENTIFYING
Which items on the time line reflect growing opportunities for women to learn and gain skills? CRITICAL THINKING
Analyzing Which items on the time line suggest women were using their education to achieve great things?
Elizabeth Cady Stanton insisted the resolutions include a demand for woman suffrage. Some delegates worried that the idea was too radical. Mott told her friend, “Lizzie, thee will make us ridiculous.” Standing with Stanton, Frederick Douglass argued powerfully for women’s right to vote. After a heated debate, the convention voted to include in their declaration the demand for woman suffrage in the United States.
The Seneca Falls Declaration
The first women’s rights convention called for women’s equality and for their right to vote, to speak publicly, and to run for office. The convention issued a Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions modeled on the Declaration of Independence. Just as Thomas Jefferson had in 1776, women announced the need for revolutionary change based on a claim of basic rights:

& When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among the people of the earth a position different from that which they have hitherto [before] occupied, but one to which the laws of nature and of nature s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that thi should declare the causes that impel them to such a course.»
In this passage, two important words—“and women”—are added to Thomas Jefferson’s famous phrase:
^6 We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among thes are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.... 99

466 The Spirit of Reform
Before you explain something, think about the important and interesting details. Use as many of these details as you can.
The women’s declaration called for an end to laws that discriminated against women. It demanded that women be free to enter the all-male world of trades, professions, and businesses.
ii The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and [wrongful takings of power] on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.
Now, in view of this entire [withholding of rights] of one-half the people of this country, their social and religious degradation,—in view of the unjust laws above mentioned, and because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of the United States. 99

The Women's Movement Grows
The Seneca Falls Convention helped launch a wider movement.
In the years to come, reformers held several national conventions, with the first taking place in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1850.
Both male and female reformers joined the cause.
Among the movement’s leaders was Susan B. Anthony, the daughter of a Quaker abolitionist. She called for equal pay and college training for women, and coeducation (coh»eh»juh»KAY«shuhn)—the teaching of males and females together. Anthony also organized the country’s first womens temperance association, the Daughters of Temperance. Anthony met Elizabeth Cady Stanton at a temperance meeting in 1851.
They became lifelong friends and partners

Women Make Gains
guiding question In what areas did women make progress in achieving equality?
Pioneers in women’s education began to call for more opportunity. Early champions such as Catharine Beecher believed that women should be educated for their traditional roles in life. The Milwaukee College for Women used Beecher’s ideas “to train women to be healthful, intelligent, and successful wives, mothers, and housekeepers.”
Other people thought that women could be trained to be capable teachers and to fill other professional roles. These pioneers broke down the barriers to female education and helped other women do the same.
Maria Mitchell was the first woman to work as a professional astronomer.
"It seems to me that the needle is the chain of woman.... Emancipate her from the 'stitch, stitch, stitch/... and she would have time for studies which would engross as the needle never can."
CRITICAL THINKING
Paraphrasing Restate the quote from Mitchell above using your own words. One of these pioneers, Emma Willard, educated herself in subjects considered suitable only for males, such as science and mathematics. In 1821 Willard set up the Troy Female Seminary in upstate New York. Willard’s seminary taught mathematics, history, geography, and physics, as well as the usual homemaking subjects.
Mary Lyon, after working as a teacher for 20 years, began raising funds to open a women’s college. She established Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in Massachusetts in 1837, modeling its curriculum on that of nearby Amherst College. Lyon became the school’s first principal, believing that “the great secret... is female education.”

Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in South Hadley, Massachusetts, was the first women's college in the United States.

Marriage and the Family
Prior to the mid-1800s, women had few rights. They depended on men for support. Anything a woman owned became the property of her husband if she married. She had few options if she was in an unhappy or abusive relationship.
During the mid- to late-1800s, women made some gains in marriage and property laws. New York, Pennsylvania,
Indiana, Wisconsin, Mississippi, and the new state of California recognized the right of married women to own property.
Some states passed laws allowing divorced women to share guardianship of their children with their former husbands.
Indiana was the first of several states that allowed women to seek divorce if their husbands abused alcohol.
Breaking Barriers
In the 1800s, women had few career choices. They could become elementary school teachers—often at lower wages than a male teacher received. Jobs in professions dominated by men were even more difficult. Women had to struggle to become doctors or work in the ministry. Some strong-minded women succeeded.
Elizabeth Blackwell tried and failed repeatedly to get into medical school. Finally accepted by Geneva College in New York, Blackwell graduated first in her class and achieved fame as a doctor.
Maria Mitchell was another groundbreaking woman. She was educated by her father and, in 1847, became the first person to discover a comet with a telescope. The next year, she became the first woman elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1865 Mitchell joined the faculty of Vassar College.
Women’s gains in the 1800s were remarkable but far from complete. Women remained limited by social customs and expectations. In fact, women had just begun the long struggle to achieve their goal of equality.

Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave
Frederick Douglass (c. 1818-1895) was born and raised in slavery in Maryland. One of his owners broke the law by teaching him to read and write. Douglass escaped from slavery in 1838 and made his way to freedom in the North. There he began to speak against slavery.
This passage comes from the first chapter of
Frederick Douglass’s autobiography. He wrote the autobiography because many people doubted his story. They had heard him speak against slavery and thought he spoke too well to have once been enslaved. Douglass decided to tell his life story as a way to quiet these critics.
Frederick Douglass escaped a life of slavery to become a leading abolitionist.

PRIMARYSOURCE
UI was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot County, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday. They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvest-time, cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time. A want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood. The white children could tell their ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same privilege.
I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it.... The nearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age. I come to this, from hearing my master say, some time during 1835,1 was about seventeen years old....
My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant—before I knew her as my mother. It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age. Frequently, before the child has reached its twelfth month, its mother is taken from it, and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off, and the child is placed under the care of an old woman, too old for field labor. For what this separation is done, I do not know, unless it be to hinder the development of the child's affection toward its mother, and to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child. This is the inevitable result.
Literary Element
First-Person Point of View occurs when a story's narrator tells his or her own experiences. First-person narrators use the pronouns /, me, and we. These narrators tell readers a lot about their own experience but very little about the experiences of other people or characters in their stories. As you read, think about what you learn because Douglass tells his own story—and what you don't learn.

His is a complicated story that raises many questions about slavery and freedom. Dred Scott was born into slavery in Virginia. He has been taken against his will to live in many places—including places where slavery is illegal. Now Scott is wondering: Did his time in "free" territory turn him into a free man? He decides to take his question to a court for a judge to decide.
Other people wonder if Scott—an enslaved African American—even has the right to go to court.
The answers to these questions are of great interest to the people of the United States. Emotions run high as the debate over slavery rages.

Political Conflict Over Slavery
guiding question What political compromises were made because of slavery?
The question of slavery had long fueled debate in the United States. Each time this debate flared, the nation’s leaders struck some form of compromise.
For example, in 1820 the Missouri Compromise preserved the balance between slave and free states in the Senate. It also brought about a temporary stop in the debate over slavery.
New Territory Brings New Debates
In the 1840s, the debate over slavery in new territories erupted again. In 1844 the Democrats nominated James K. Polk of Tennessee for president and called for the annexation of Texas at the earliest possible time. After Polk’s election, Texas was admitted to the Union in December 1845.
Texas’s entry into the Union angered the Mexican government. Matters worsened when the two countries disputed the boundary between Texas and Mexico. At the same time, support was growing in the South for taking over California and New Mexico. President Polk tried to buy these territories from the Mexican government, but failed. All these issues helped lead to the U.S.-Mexican War.

Differing Views
The issue of new lands that might be gained from the war with Mexico led the country into a new era of sectionalism. Soon after the war with Mexico had begun, Representative David Wilmot of Pennsylvania introduced the Wilmot Proviso, which would ban slavery in any lands the United States might acquire from Mexico.
Southerners protested. They wanted the new territories to remain open to slavery. Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina offered another idea, saying that neither Congress nor any territorial government could ban slavery from a territory or regulate it.
Neither bill passed, but both caused heated debate. By the 1848 presidential election, the United States had taken California and New Mexico from Mexico but took no action on slavery in those territories.
In 1848 the Whigs picked General Zachary Taylor as their presidential candidate. The Democrats chose Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan. Both candidates ignored the slavery issue, which angered some voters.
Those who opposed any territorial expansion of slavery left their parties and formed the Free-Soil Party. Its slogan was Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor, and Free Men. The party chose former president Martin Van Buren as its candidate. Taylor won, but the Free-Soil Party gained several seats in Congress.

New Compromise Concerned over growing abolitionism, Southerners wanted a strong national fugitive (FYOO»juh»tihv), or runaway, slave law. Such a law would require every state to return runaway slaves.
In 1849 California applied to become a state—without slavery.
If California became a free state, however, slave states would be outvoted in the Senate. Even worse, antislavery groups wanted to ban slavery in Washington, D.C. Southerners talked about seceding (seh»SEED»ihng) from, or leaving, the Union.
In 1850 Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky suggested a compromise. California would be a free state, but other new territories would have no limits on slavery. In addition, the slave trade, but not slavery itself, would be illegal in Washington, D.C. Clay also pushed for a stronger fugitive slave law.	,

The Fugitive Slave Act
Part of the Compromise of 1850 was the Fugitive Slave Act Anyone who helped a fugitive could be fined or imprisoned.
Some Northerners refused to obey the new law. In his 1849 essay “Civil Disobedience,” Henry David Thoreau wrote that if the law “requires you to be the agent [cause] of injustice to another, then I say, break the law.” Northern juries refused to convict people accused of breaking the new law. People gave money to buy freedom for enslaved people. Free African Americans and whites formed a network, or interconnected system, called the Underground Railroad to help runaways find their way to freedom. Democrat Franklin Pierce became president in 1853.
He intended to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act.

The Kansas-Nebraska Act
guiding question What was the Kansas-Nebraska Act?
In 1854 Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois introduced a bill to settle the issue of slavery in the territories. It organized the region west of Missouri and Iowa as the territories of Kansas and Nebraska. Both were north of 36°30’ N latitude, the line that limited slavery. Before the law, they would have been free, giving the free states more votes in the Senate and angering the South.
Douglas hoped to make his plan acceptable to both the North and South. He proposed repealing the Missouri Compromise and letting the voters in each territory vote on whether to allow slavery. He called his proposal “popular sovereignty.

This idea, which is central to the American system of government, means that the people are the source of all government power. Douglass popular sovereignty came to mean a particular method for deciding the question of slavery in a place.
Northerners protested. The plan allowed slavery in areas that had been free for years. Southerners supported the bill. They expected Kansas to be settled mostly by slaveholders from Missouri. They would, of course, vote to keep slavery legal. With some support from Northern Democrats and the backing of President Pierce, the Kansas-Nebraska Act passed in 1854. Conflict in Kansas
Supporters of both sides rushed to Kansas. Armed pro-slavery supporters known as border ruffians (BOHR«duhr RUH»fee»uhns) crossed the border from Missouri just to vote. When elections took place, only about 1,500 voters lived in Kansas, but more than 6,000 people voted. The pro-slavery group won.
Kansas established laws supporting slavery. Slavery opponents refused to accept the laws. They armed themselves, held their own elections, and adopted a constitution banning slavery. By January 1856, Kansas had two rival governments.
In May 1856, slavery supporters attacked the town of Lawrence, an antislavery stronghold. When John Brown, a fervent abolitionist, heard of the attack, he vowed to “strike terror” against the foes of abolition. Brown led an attack that killed five supporters of slavery. Newspapers wrote about “Bleeding Kansas” and “the Civil War in Kansas.” A civil war is war between citizens of the same country. In October 1856, federal troops arrived to stop the bloodshed.

The 1854 Congressional Elections
Antislavery Whigs and Democrats joined with Free-Soilers to form the Republican Party. One of the party’s major goals was the banning of slavery in new territories. In 1854 the Republicans chose candidates to challenge the pro-slavery Whigs and Democrats in state and congressional elections.
The Republicans quickly showed strength in the North. In the election, they won control of the House of Representatives and several state governments. Unlike the Republicans, almost three-fourths of the Democratic candidates from free states lost in 1854.
In contrast, Republican candidates received almost no support in the South. At the same time, the Democrats, having lost members in the North, were becoming a largely Southern party. This division would be even more apparent in the presidential

The Presidential Election of 1856
The Whig Party, torn apart over slavery, did not offer a candidate in 1856. Republicans chose Californian John C. Fremont, a famed western explorer. The party platform called for free territories. Its campaign slogan was “Free soil, Free speech, and Fremont.”
The Democratic Party nominated James Buchanan of Pennsylvania. He was a diplomat and former member of Congress. Buchanan tried to appeal to Southern whites. The Democratic Party endorsed the idea of popular sovereignty.
The American Party, or Know-Nothings, grew quickly between 1853 and 1856 by attacking immigrants. The party nominated former president Millard Fillmore as its candidate. Yet this party was also divided over the issue of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. When the Know-Nothings refused to call for a repeal of the act, many Northern supporters left the party.
The vote in 1856 was divided along rigid sectional lines. Buchanan took all the Southern states except Maryland. Fremont won 11 of the 16 free states but did not get any electoral votes from south of the Mason-Dixon Line.

Dred Scott v. Sandford
guiding question Why was the Dred Scott case important?
I
i
Dred Scott was an enslaved African American bought by a doctor in Missouri, a slave state. In the 1830s, the doctor moved with Scott to Illinois, a free state, then to the Wisconsin Territory. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 banned slavery there. Later the doctor returned with Scott to Missouri.
In 1846 antislavery lawyers helped Scott sue for his freedom. Scott claimed he should be free since he had lived in areas where slavery was illegal. Eleven years later, the case reached the Supreme Court. At issue was Scott’s status, but the case also gave the Court a chance to make a landmark ruling on the issue of slavery.
The Court Rules
In 1857 Chief Justice Roger B. Taney (TAW*nee) delivered the Court’s opinion: Dred Scott was still enslaved. The Court ruled that African Americans, enslaved or free, were not citizens. Therefore, Scott had no right to bring a lawsuit. Taney wrote that living on free soil did not make Scott free. An enslaved person was property. The Fifth Amendment prohibited the taking of property without “due process.”
Finally, Taney wrote that Congress had no power to ban slavery. The Missouri Compromise, which

Not even voters could ban slavery because it would mean taking someone’s property. In effect, Taney said that the Constitution protected slavery.
Reaction to the Decision
The Court’s decision upheld what many white Southerners believed: Nothing could legally stop slavery. It ruled that limiting the spread of slavery, the Republicans’ main issue, was unconstitutional.
Republicans and other antislavery groups were outraged. They called the decision “a wicked and false judgment” and “the greatest crime” ever committed in the nation’s courts.

BIOGRAPHY
Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865)
Just a few years before becoming a national leader, Lincoln was relatively unknown. From a poor rural family, Lincoln knew the importance of education to success. As a young man, he had mostly taught himself and in time became a lawyer. Lincoln was intensely opposed to slavery. He served in the Illinois state legislature and the U. S. Congress. In 1858, he ran for the Senate against Stephen A. Douglas. Although Lincoln lost the election, he gained national attention as a leading Northern voice against slavery.
CRITICAL THINKING
Speculating Why do you think Lincoln won fame in spite of losing the race for the Senate?
Lincoln and Douglas
guiding QUESTION How did Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas play a role in the challenges to slavery?
The Illinois Senate race of 1858 was the center of national attention. The contest pitted the current senator, Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, against a rising star in the Republican Party, named Abraham Lincoln.
People considered Douglas a possible candidate for president in the 1860 election. Lincoln, far less known outside of his state, challenged Douglas to a series of debates. Douglas reluctantly agreed.
The Lincoln-Douglas Debates
Lincoln and Douglas debated seven times. The face-offs took place in Illinois cities and villages during August, September, and October of 1858. Thousands of spectators came to the debates. Newspapers provided wide coverage. The main topic, or subject of discussion, was slavery.
During the debate at Freeport, Lincoln pressed Douglas about his views on popular sovereignty. Lincoln asked whether the people of a territory could legally exclude slavery before becoming a state.
Douglas replied that voters could exclude slavery by refusing to pass laws that protected the rights of slaveholders. Douglass response, which became known as the Freeport Doctrine, satisfied antislavery followers, but it cost Douglas support in the South.
Douglas claimed that Lincoln wanted African Americans to be fully equal to whites. Lincoln denied this. Still, Lincoln insisted that African Americans should enjoy rights and freedoms:
PRIMARY SOURCE
& But in the right to eat the bread... which his own hand earns, [an African American] is my equal and the equal of [Senator] Douglas, and the equal of every living man.
—Abraham Lincoln, August 21,1858
The real issue, Lincoln said, was “between the men who think slavery a wrong and those who do not think it wrong. The Republican Party think it wrong.”

John Brown and Harpers Ferry
After the 1858 election, Southerners felt threatened by Republicans. Then, an act of violence added to their fears.
On October 16, 1859, the abolitionist John Brown led a group on a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. His target was a federal arsenal (AHRSmuhl), a storage site for weapons. Brown hoped to arm enslaved African Americans and start a revolt against slaveholders. Abolitionists had paid for the raid.
The Lincoln-Douglas debates have been described as "the most famous war of words in history."

The 1860 Election
G u ID i N G Q u E st i o N What was the importance of the election of 1860?
In the presidential election of 1860, the big question was whether the Union would continue to exist. Sectionalism divided the nation more than ever.
The issue of slavery split the Democratic Party. Northern Democrats supported popular sovereignty. They nominated Stephen Douglas. Southern Democrats vowed to uphold slavery. Their candidate was John C. Breckinridge.
Moderates from the North and South formed the Constitutional Union Party. The Constitutional Unionists took no position on slavery. They chose John Bell as their candidate.
The Republicans nominated Abraham Lincoln. They wanted to leave slavery alone where it existed—but also to ban it in the territories. Still, white Southerners feared that a Republican victory would promote slave revolts as well as interfere with slavery.
With the Democrats divided, Lincoln won a clear majority of electoral votes. Voting followed sectional lines. Lincoln’s name did not even appear on the ballot in most Southern states. He won every Northern state, however. In effect, the more populous North outvoted the South.

CRITICAL THINKING
Analyzing Why do you think secessionists used the same slogans as those used in the Revolutionary War?
Looking for Compromise
The Republicans had promised not to stop slavery where it already existed. Yet white Southerners did not trust the Republicans to protect their rights. On December 20,1860, South Carolina voted to secede from the Union.
In other Southern states, leaders debated the question of secession, or withdrawal from the Union. Meanwhile, members of Congress tried to find ways to prevent it. Senator John Crittenden of Kentucky suggested a series of amendments to the Constitution. They included a protection for slavery south of 36°30’ N latitude—the line set by the Missouri Compromise—in all territories “now held or hereafter acquired.”
Republicans rejected, or refused to accept, Crittenden’s idea. They had just won an election by promising to stop slavery’s spread into any territories. “Now we are told ...” Lincoln wrote, “the government shall be broken up unless we surrender to those we have beaten.”
Leaders in the South also rejected the plan. “We spit upon every plan to compromise,” exclaimed one Southern leader. “No human power can save the Union,” wrote another.
The Confederacy Established
By February 1861, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and Georgia had joined South Carolina and seceded. Delegates from these states met to form a new nation. Calling themselves the Confederate States of America, they chose Jefferson Davis as their president.
Southerners used states' rights to justify secession. Each state, they argued, had voluntarily chosen to enter the Union. They defined the Constitution as a contract among the independent states. They believed the national government had broken the contract by refusing to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act and by denying Southern states equal rights in the territories. As a result, Southerners argued, the states had a right to leave the Union. The Public Reacts to Secession
Not all white Southerners welcomed secession. Church bells rang, and some people celebrated in the streets. To other Southerners, the idea of secession was alarming. Virginian Robert E. Lee expressed concern about the future. “I only see that a fearful calamity is upon us,” he wrote.

490 Toward Civil War
Some Northerners approved of the Southern secession. If the Union could survive only by giving in to slavery, they declared, then let the Union be destroyed. Still, most Northerners believed that the Union had to be preserved. As Lincoln put it, the issue was “whether in a free government the minority have the right to break up the government whenever they choose.”
Lincoln Takes Over
As always, several months passed between the November election and the start of the new president’s term. Buchanan would remain in office until March 4, 1861. In December 1860, Buchanan sent a message to Congress. He said that the Southern states had no right to secede from the Union. He added that he had no power to stop them from doing so.
As Lincoln prepared for his inauguration, people throughout the United States wondered what he would say and do. They wondered, too, what would happen in Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Delaware, Maryland, and Arkansas. These slave states had not yet seceded, but their decisions were not final. If the United States used force against the Confederates, the remaining slave states also might secede.

Fighting at Fort Sumter
guiding question What did the attack on Fort Sumter signify?
The day after taking office, Lincoln received a message from the commander of Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort on an island guarding Charleston Harbor. The message warned that the fort was low on supplies and the Confederates demanded its surrender.
Lincoln responded in a message to Governor Francis Pickens of South Carolina that he was sending an unarmed group to the fort with supplies. He promised Union forces would not “throw in men, arms, or ammunition” unless they were fired upon.
Jefferson Davis ordered his forces to attack Fort Sumter before the Union supplies could arrive. Confederate guns opened fire on April 12, 1861. Union captain Abner Doubleday witnessed the attack from inside the fort:
PRIMARYSOURCE
«Showers of balls... and shells poured into the fort in one incessant stream, causing great flakes of masonry to fall in all directions. 99
—quoted in Fort Sumter
Meanwhile, high seas kept Union ships from reaching the fort. Facing a hopeless situation, the Union surrendered the fort on April 14. Despite heavy bombardment, no one had died.
With the loss of Fort Sumter, Lincoln decided he had to act. He issued a call for troops. Volunteers quickly signed up. In reaction to Lincolns call, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas voted to join the Confederacy. The Civil War had begun.

Did the South Have the Right to Secede?
When Abraham Lincoln began his first term as president on March 4,1861, seven Southern states had already voted to secede from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America.
The Confederacy’s president, Jefferson Davis, had taken office earlier, on February 18,1861. Each man’s inaugural address presented a different view on whether a state has the right to secede.

JEFFERSON DAVIS
« Our present position... illustrates the American idea that government rests upon the consent of the governed, and that it is the right of the people to alter or abolish a government whenever it becomes destructive of the ends for which it was established. The declared purpose of the compact of Union from which we have withdrawn was to 'establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, to provide for the common defence, to promote the general welfare, and to secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity'; and when in the judgment of the sovereign States now comprising this Confederacy it [no longer meets] the purposes for which it was ordained, and ceased to answer the ends for which it was established, a peaceful appeal to the ballot box declared that, so far as they are concerned, the government created by that compact should cease to exist. In this they merely asserted a right which the Declaration of Independence of July 4,1776, defined to be inalienable. W —Jefferson Davis

The Story
Matters...
In November 1860, voters elect a self-educated lawyer from Illinois named Abraham Lincoln to be president of the United States. Even before Lincoln is inaugurated, South Carolina and six other Southern states secede from the Union. As he waits to take office, Lincoln sees the nation he is to lead spiral downward toward civil war.
Lincoln does not give up. He believes "[a] house divided against itself cannot stand," and he guides the nation until it is once again united.

The Two Sides
QUESTION
Why does conflict develop? 
,'x-\ *
«	i I X
IT MATTERS BECAUSE
Both the North and the South had strengths and weaknesses that helped determine their military strategies.
Two Very Different
guidingquestion What were the goals and strategies of the North and the South?
The Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865, profoundly changed the nation. The war divided many families. Neither side imagined, however, that the four years of fighting would lead to so much suffering. By the end of the war, more than 600,000 Americans had lost their lives. Many thousands more were wounded in battle.
Division in the Border States
For most states, choosing sides in the Civil War was easy. The border states of Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, however, were bitterly divided. Slavery existed in all four states, though it was generally not as widespread as in the Confederate states. All four of these states had close ties to the North and the South.
The border states were vital to the strategy of the Union. Missouri could control parts of the Mississippi River and major routes to the West. Kentucky controlled the Ohio River. Delaware was close to the key Union city of Philadelphia. Maryland, perhaps the most important of the border states, was close to Richmond, the Confederate capital. Most significantly,

Washington, D.C., lay within the state. If Maryland seceded, the North’s capital would be surrounded.
President Lincoln worked tirelessly to keep the four border states in the Union. In September 1861, he wrote:
PRIMARY SOURCE
ii I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.... We would as well consent to separation at once, including the surrender of this capitol. 99

22A Analyze the leadership qualities of elected and appointed leaders of the United States such as George Washington, John Marshall, and Abraham Lincoln.
22B Describe the contributions of significant political, social, and military leaders of the United States such as Frederick Douglass, John Paul Jones, James Monroe, Stonewall Jackson, Susan B. Anthony, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
29D Identify points of view from the historical context surrounding an event and the frame of reference which influenced the participants.
In the end, Lincoln was successful. Still, many border state residents supported the Confederacy. The president had to work hard to restrain these opponents of the war.
Strengths and Weaknesses
When the war began, each side had advantages and disadvantages compared to the other. How each side used its strengths and weaknesses would determine the war’s outcome.
The North had a larger population and more resources than the South. The South had other advantages, such as excellent military leaders and a strong fighting spirit. Also, because most of the war was fought in the South, the Confederacy knew the land and had the will to defend it.
The Goals of War
Each side had different goals in fighting the Civil War. The
Confederacy wanted to be an independent nation. To do this, it
did not have to invade the North or destroy the Union army. It
just needed to fight hard enough and long enough to convince	i
Northerners that the war was not worth its cost.

In contrast, the North wanted to restore the Union. In President Lincoln’s view, states had no constitutional right to secede from the Union. Its forces had to invade the South and force the breakaway states to give up their quest for independence. Although slavery was an underlying cause of the war, Lincoln’s original aim was not to end slavery. He wrote in 1862:

If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. 99 —from Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writer
Confederate Strategies
The basic strategy of Confederate president Jefferson Davis was to conduct a defensive war. This meant that it would hold as much territory as possible. Southerners felt that if they showed determination to be independent, Northerners would tire of the war.
The South also tried to win the support of Great Britain and France, whose economies suffered when the war disrupted the export of Southern cotton. Southerners hoped the British and French might pressure the North to end the war.
Union Strategies
The North’s war plan came from General Winfield Scott, hero of the war with Mexico. He knew that the North would have to defeat the South completely.

To do this, Scott proposed the so-called Anaconda Plan, which took its name from a type of snake that squeezes its prey to death. First, the Union would blockade, or close, Southern ports. This strategy would keep supplies from reaching the Confederacy and prevent the South from exporting its cotton crop. Second, the North would seek to gain control of the Mississippi River.
This would split the Confederacy in two and cut Southern supply lines. Another goal of the Union forces was the capture of Richmond, Virginia—the Confederate capital.

The Civil War was more than a war between the states. It turned brother against brother and neighbor against neighbor. Kentucky senator John Crittenden had two sons who became generals.
One fought for the Confederacy, the other for the Union. Even President Lincoln’s wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, had relatives in the Confederate army.
Men of all ages rushed to enlist (ihn«LIHST) in, or join, the Union or Confederate army.	*
Some did so out of patriotism. Others thought

Later in the war, the Union army changed this policy. The Confederacy refused to consider having African Americans fight until the war’s final, desperate days. They did not want to give enslaved people weapons.
High Hopes
When the war began, each side expected a quick victory. Northerners could not imagine the Confederates holding out for long against the Union’s greater resources. Confederates believed the North could never subdue the fighting spirit of the South. Both sides were wrong. In the end, the war lasted far longer than most Americans could have guessed.
Who Were the Soldiers?
Soldiers came from every region of the country and all walks of life. Most came from farms. Almost half of the North’s troops and more than 60 percent of the South’s had owned or worked on farms.
By the summer of 1861, the Confederate army had about 112,000 soldiers. They were sometimes called Rebels. The Union had about 187,000 soldiers, also known as Yankees. By the end of the war, about 900,000 men had fought for the Confederacy and about 2.1 million men had borne arms for the Union. The Union army included just under 200,000 African Americans. About 10,000 Mexican Americans served in the war.

Most of the time the soldiers lived in camps. Camp life had its pleasant moments of songs, stories, letters from home, and baseball games. At other times, a soldier’s life was a dull routine of drills, bad food, marches, and rain.

The Horrors of War
In spite of fleeting moments of calm, the reality of war was always close by. Thousands of casualties overwhelmed medical facilities. After the Battle of Shiloh, the wounded lay in the rain for more than 24 hours waiting for treatment. A soldier recalled, “Many had died there, and others were in the last agonies as we passed. Their groans and cries were heartrending.”
Faced with these terrible realities, many men deserted. About 1 of every 11 Union soldiers and 1 of every 8 Confederates ran away because of fear, hunger, or sickness.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
Neither side gained a strong advantage during the war's early years.
War on Land and at Sea
guiding question Whatwastheoutcomeofthefirstmajorbattleofthewar?
While the Union and the Confederacy mobilized their armies, the Union navy began operations against the South. In April 1861, President Lincoln announced a blockade of all Confederate ports. The stage was set for fighting at sea as well as on land.
First Battle of Bull Run
Tension mounted in the summer of 1861, leading to the first major battle of the Civil War. On July 21, about 30,000 Union troops commanded by General Irvin McDowell attacked a smaller Confederate force led by General P.G.T. Beauregard.
The fighting took place in northern Virginia, near a small river called Bull Run. Hundreds of spectators from Washington, D.C., watched the battle from a few miles away.
Both sides lacked battle experience. At first, the Yankees drove the Confederates back. Then the Rebels rallied, inspired by General Thomas Jackson. Another Confederate general noted that Jackson was holding his position “like a stone wall.” This earned him the nickname “Stonewall” Jackson. The Confederates then unleashed a savage counterattack that broke the Union lines. As they retreated, Union troops ran into civilians fleeing in panic.

The loss shocked Northerners, who now realized that the war could be long and difficult. President Lincoln named a new general, George B. McClellan, to head the Union army in the East-called the Army of the Potomac—and to train the troops.
Although dismayed over Bull Run, President Lincoln was also determined. He put out a call for more army volunteers. He signed two bills requesting thousands to serve in the infantry, cavalry, and navy for up to three years. In addition, victories in the West would soon give a boost to Northern spirits and also increase enlistment.
Control of the West
In the West, the major Union goal was to control the Mississippi River and its tributaries (TRIH.byuh.tehr.eez), the smaller rivers that fed it. With control of the river, Union ships could prevent Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas from supplying the eastern Confederacy. Union gunboats and troops would also be able to use the rivers to move into the heart of the South.
The battle for the rivers began in February 1862. Union forces captured Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. Naval commander Andrew Foote and army general Ulysses S. Grant led the assault. Soon afterward, Grant and Foote moved against Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River. The Confederates realized they had no chance of saving the fort. They asked Grant what terms he would give them to surrender. Grant replied, “No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted.” “Unconditional Surrender” Grant became the North’s new hero.
A
Battle Between Ironclads The Union blockade of Confederate ports posed a real threat to the Confederacy. Southerners hoped to break it with a secret weapon—the Merrimack. The Merrimack was a damaged frigate that had been abandoned by the Union. The Confederates rebuilt the wooden ship and covered it with iron. They renamed their new ironclad (EYE»uhrn«klad) the Virginia.
On March 8, 1862, the Virginia attacked Union ships in the Chesapeake Bay. Union shells just bounced off its sides. Some Union leaders feared the Virginia would destroy the Union navy, steam up the Potomac River, and bombard Washington, D.C.
By this time, however, the North had an ironclad of its own. The Monitor rushed southward to face the Virginia. On Marc the two ironclads met in battle. Neither ship won, but the stirring clash raised spirits in both the North and the Sout
To create the Virginia, the Confederate navy took what remained of a burned Union warship, covered it in iron, and equipped it with 10 guns. On its bow they placed an iron ram so the ship could steer into another ship and puncture its hull.

The Battle of Shiloh
Meanwhile, in the West, General Grant and about 40,000 troops headed south toward Corinth, Mississippi, a major railroad junction. In early April 1862, the Union army camped at Pittsburg Landing, 20 miles (32 km) from Corinth, near Shiloh Church. Additional Union forces joined Grant from Nashville.
Confederate leaders decided to strike before more troops arrived to reinforce the Union. Early on the morning of April 6, Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and P.G.T. Beauregard led Confederate forces in a surprise attack. The battle lasted two days. It was a narrow victory for the Union, but the losses were enormous. Together, the two armies suffered more than 23,000 casualties (KA*zhuhl»teez)—people killed, wounded, captured, or missing.
After Shiloh, Union troops laid siege to Corinth, forcing the Confederates to withdraw. The Union army occupied the town on May 30. Memphis, Tennessee, fell to Union forces on June 6. The North seemed well on its way to controlling the Mississippi River.

War in the Eastern States
GUIDING question How did the Union respond to important defeats in the East in 1862?
While the two sides fought for control of Tennessee and the Mississippi River, the Union was trying to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. Close to the Union, Richmond was vulnerable to attack. Confederate armies fought hard to defend it. Confederate forces in the East enjoyed much more success than their western counterparts.
Confederate Victories
Southern victories in the East were largely the result of the leadership of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. The two generals knew the terrain and could move forces quickly. They were also expert at inspiring troops. As a result, Confederate forces managed to defeat much larger Union forces.

Later that included men from ages 17 to 50. Some exceptions were allowed. A man with money could hire a substitute to serve for him. Later, a man with 20 or more enslaved people did not have to serve. At first, the North offered a bounty (BAUN«tee), or a sum of money, to encourage volunteers. In March 1863, it also passed a draft. Men aged 20 to 45 had to register. As in the South, a man could avoid the draft by hiring a substitute or paying $300. Many workers earned less than $500 a year and could not afford these options.
People in several Northern cities rioted to protest the draft.
The New York City draft riots in July 1863 were the worst. As the first names were drawn, rioters attacked government and military buildings. Then mobs turned their attacks against African Americans. Many white workers had opposed the Emancipation Proclamation, fearing freed African Americans would take their jobs. After four days, more than 100 people were dead. Federal troops finally stopped the riots.

520 The Civil War
The white South felt the economic strain even more sharply than the North. Many of the battles of the Civil War took place on Confederate soil, destroying farmland and railroad lines. The Union naval blockade prevented the shipping of trade goods.
Vital materials could not reach the Confederacy. Salt was in such short supply that women scraped the floors of smokehouses to recover it. Food shortages led to riots in Atlanta, Richmond, and other cities. The South also suffered much worse inflation. As early as 1862, citizens were begging Confederate leaders for help. Positive Changes
To honor service in the war, President Lincoln created the Medal of Honor in 1861. It is awarded to members of the armed forces for acts of bravery. Jacob Parrott, a 19-year-old private, was the first to receive the Medal. Surgeon Mary Edwards Walker was the only woman to receive the Medal during the Civil War. Sergeant William Harvey Carney, an African American, was awarded the Medal for his role during the attack on Fort Wagner, South Carolina. More than 3,400 people have received the Medal of Honor.
Then, in 1862, Lincoln signed two laws that encouraged population growth and educational opportunity. The Homestead Act allowed individuals to claim, for a small fee, up to 160 acres of land on the Great Plains. The homesteader could receive title to the land after living and making improvements on the land for five years. Through the Morrill Act of 1862, the federal government gave huge land grants to states to establish colleges. These new educational institutions—which included the colleges that are now Texas A&M University and the historically African American Prairie View A&M University—greatly expanded access to higher education in the United States.

Across Five Aprils
by Irene Hunt
Irene Hunt (1907-2001) was born in Pontiac, Illinois, more than 40 years after the Civil War ended. Her father died when she was seven years old. Hunt graduated from the University of Illinois in 1939.
She taught French and English in Illinois public schools until she retired to write full-time in 1969. She wrote many books for young people and won a Newbery Medal for her second novel,
Up a Road Slowly. Hunt died in 2001.
First published in 1965, Across Five Aprils was Irene Hunt’s first novel. It is the story of Jethro Creighton, a nine-year-old boy living in Indiana during the Civil War. In this excerpt, he and his mother are at home when a letter arrives from one of Jethro’s older brothers, who is fighting for the Union.

'A fam'ly needs to be alone when one of these letters comes/ he said in answer to Ellen's invitation. 'I'd be pleased if you'd let me know what the boy has to say—later on when Matt has the time to drop over.'
Jenny had gone with her father to see about some stock, and Jethro was alone in the cabin with his mother. When Ed Turner was gone, she handed the letter to Jethro.

The envelope was crumpled and stained, the letter written in pencil in a round, childish hand. It was probably among the first three or four letters that young Tom had ever written.

IAL QUESTION
Why does conflict develop? It matters because
Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg marked a turning point in the war.
Southern Victories
guiding question What factors contributed to the early success ofthe Confederate forces!
The military leadership of Generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson was a key factor in the Confederates’ military success in the East. With their knowledge of the land and ability to inspire troops, these two generals often defeated larger Union forces.
The Battle of Fredericksburg
After Antietam, Robert E. Lee moved his army out of Maryland into Virginia. This encouraged the newly named Union commander, General Ambrose Burnside, to march his troops toward the Confederate capital at Richmond. Lee intercepted the Union army near Fredericksburg. Lee’s forces dug trenches in hills south of the town. This gave them the advantage of higher ground from which to fight. On December 13, 1862, Union forces attacked. Lee’s entrenched (ihn.TREHNCHT) troops drove them back with heavy losses. Devastated, Burnside resigned. Victory at Chancellorsville
In May 1863, Lee met Union forces led by General Joseph Hooker in the Battle of Chancellorsville. General Lee again showed daring and a brilliant command of tactics. Although Hooker had

twice as many men, Lee divided his forces. Some Confederate troops confronted the main Union force. Others under the leadership of Stonewall Jackson secretly marched to a spot at the far end of the Union line. The risky plan worked perfectly. Jackson’s army surprised the Union force with a crushing attack on its flank (FLANGK), or side. Lee struck from the front.
Caught between the two Confederate forces, Hooker eventually withdrew his men.
The Confederate victory came at a high cost. In the confusion of battle, Confederate soldiers fired on and wounded Stonewall Jackson by mistake. Surgeons amputated Jackson’s arm, prompting Lee to say, “He has lost his left arm, and I have lost my right.” Worse, Jackson developed pneumonia. After a week of suffering, he died. His death cost the South one of its great leaders. It also affected the morale of its army and its citizens.
Problems With Union Leadership
In contrast, Union leadership in the East disappointed the president. In less than a year, a frustrated Lincoln saw three different generals try and fail to lead the Union to victory.
The first, Major General George McClellan, commanded the Union forces at the Battle of Antietam in March 1862. Although he was expert at preparing for battle, he was overly careful and slow to act. Said Lincoln, “If McClellan doesn’t want to use the army, I’d like to borrow it for a while.” The last straw came when, after victory at Antietam, McClellan failed to obey Lincoln’s order to follow the retreating Confederate troops and destroy them.
Lincoln pushed his next commander, General Ambrose Burnside, to take aggressive action. Burnside quickly lost the president’s favor after his crushing loss at Fredericksburg.
Next, Lincoln appointed Major General Joseph Hooker, who had often been critical of other generals. Hooker s attitude matched the president’s. “May God have mercy on General Lee, for I will have none,” he declared. Despite Hooker s confidence, Lee’s much smaller army crushed Hooker s forces at Chancellorsville. Hooker soon resigned.
Lincoln’s next commander needed to prove himself quickly. Major General George Meade took command three days before one of the war’s great battles, at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

BIOGRAPHY
Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson (1824-1863)
Thomas Jackson was born in Virginia. At the age of 18, he moved north to attend the military academy at West Point. He went on to a short and unremarkable career in the United States Army. During the 1850s, he taught at the Virginia Military Institute. At that time, he showed more interest in art than in war.
When the Civil War started, Jackson was not widely known in the military. That changed at the First Battle of Bull Run, when Jackson won his nickname "Stonewall." By 1863 he had become one of the Confederacy's top leaders.

African American Soldiers
Beginning with the Revolutionary War, African Americans have had a long history of serving with distinction in the U.S. military. When the draft ended in 1973, African American enrollment in the armed forces increased. Today, African Americans make up about 17 percent of the active forces and 15 percent of the Reserves and National Guard.

African Americans in the Civil War
GUIDINGQUESTION
What role did African Americans play in military efforts? At first, both the North and the South barred African Americans from serving in their armies. As time passed, the North relaxed its rules.
Excluded in the South
Even though African Americans made up more than 30 percent of the smaller Southern population, Confederate leaders would not allow them to enlist. Only in the last days of the war, when defeat drew near, did they consider it. Confederate leaders feared that, once armed, African American soldiers would attack their fellow troops or even begin a general revolt.
Enlisted in the North
At first, President Lincoln resisted calls to enlist African Americans in the Union army. He feared that such a policy would be unpopular in the border states.
By 1862, though, it was clear that the North needed more soldiers in order to defeat the Confederacy. Many African Americans were eager to fight. As a result, Congress decided to reverse past policy and allow the formation of all-African American regiments.
These new Union soldiers were in a tough position. Many white Union regiments doubted their fighting ability. Others resented them. Many Southern troops also especially hated the Union’s African American soldiers. They often focused their fiercest fire on African American regiments.
Despite this, African Americans joined. By the end of the war, they made up about 10 percent of the Union army. Some were freed people from the North. Others had fled enslavement in the South. These men fought hard and effectively, too. As one white Union officer wrote about an all-African American Kansas regiment:

The best-known African American regiment was the 54th Massachusetts. Founded in 1863, the 54th was under the command of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, who came from a Boston abolitionist family. Later that year, the 54th served on the front lines in an assault on Fort Wagner in South Carolina. Confederate gunfire caused nearly 300 casualties in the 54th alone, including Colonel Shaw. Though the Union could not capture the fort, the 54th became famous for the courage and sacrifice of its members. It would also serve with distinction in other battles, such as the Battle of Olustee in Florida.

In spring of 1863, the Confederates had the upper hand.
Their victory at Chancellorsville ruined Union plans to attack Richmond. Lee was emboldened. He decided to take the war once more into the North, hoping to impress France and Britain.
The Confederate strategy was similar to that of the colonies in the Revolutionary War. Though far outnumbered, the colonies won the support of France—and the war. Now, France and Britain missed the goods, especially cotton, that Southern planters had once supplied. If the Confederates appeared to be winning, those nations might help their cause.

The Battle of Gettysburg
In July 1863, a small town in southern Pennsylvania became the site of one of the most decisive battles in the Civil War. Gettysburg was not a capital, a key port, or the location of a fort. It was almost an accident that such serious fighting took place there.
The Confederates entered the town looking for supplies. General Lee hoped to avoid fighting in a landscape he did not know well. It was there, however, that he encountered the enemy. When Lee’s troops crawled out of Gettysburg four grueling days later, they had suffered 25,000 casualties. The Union—the victor—lost 23,000.
The battle started at 7:30 a.m. on July 1. Outnumbered Union troops retreated to a section of high ground called Cemetery Ridge. Reinforcements arrived for both sides. On the second day of fighting, Southern generals tried to drive Union forces from hills named Big Round Top and Little Round Top. In furious
fighting, Union forces under General George Meade held their positions.
SKILLS PRACTICE_________________________________
Before reading your text, look for bold-faced terms. Find
their definitions in the selection or the glossary. Then use a thesaurus to find other meanings for the words.
The next day, Lee ordered an attack designed to “create a panic and virtually destroy the [Union] army.” First, the Confederates fired nearly 140 cannons at the Union lines. Then, General George Pickett led thousands of Confederate troops in an attack on the Union’s position at Cemetery Ridge. Putting themselves directly in the line of fire, they advanced across open land in what came to be remembered as Pickett’s Charge.
At first, it seemed that Pickett’s Charge might work. The Confederates broke the first line of Union defense. In the end, however, half of those who started the attack lay dead or wounded on the ground. Lee later wrote, “The army did all it could. I fear I required of it impossibilities.”
Gettysburg ended the Confederates’ hope of gaining help from Britain and France. The South had hoped to receive two ironclads from the British and use them to sweep Union shipping from the Atlantic. However, in October 1863, the British government decided not to release the ships.
The Battle of Vicksburg
On July 4, the day that Lee retreated from Gettysburg, the Confederacy suffered another major blow. The important river city of Vicksburg, Mississippi, fell under the control of Union troops led by Ulysses S. Grant.
Grant had first attacked Vicksburg in April. His army surrounded the 30,000 Confederate troops there. In May, Grant began a siege of the town, preventing food and supplies from reaching the Confederates. Union gunships on the river supported Grant’s 77,000 troops by firing thousands of shells into the city.
This painting shows Union forces fighting their way to the Confederate lines at Vicksburg, Mississippi, in May 1863.
CRITICAL THINKING
Analyzing Visuals Do you think this painting was meant for a Union audience or a Confederate audience? Explain your answer.
The siege lasted 47 days. There were more than 9,000 Confederate and 10,000 Union casualties, and many soldiers died of disease or starvation. Despite heavy losses of soldiers, fewer than 20 citizens of Vicksburg were killed in the long siege.
A few days after Vicksburg fell, the Confederacy lost Port Hudson in Louisiana, its last stronghold on the Mississippi River. The Union had split the South in two. Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas were now cut off. The tide of the Civil War had turned.
Lincoln's Address at Gettysburg
On November 19,1863, officials and citizens gathered to dedicate the Soldiers’ National Cemetery at Gettysburg. At the ceremony, former governor of Massachusetts Edward Everett delivered a two-hour speech. After him, President Abraham Lincoln spoke for about two minutes. In 272 words, Lincoln honored the soldiers and their cause, and stated his vision for the country.

guidingquestion IV/iflf events occurred at the end ofthe war?
By 1864 Union forces had the South surrounded. Union ships blocked the Confederate coast, reducing the trade goods getting out and supplies getting in. The Union also controlled the Mississippi River, cutting off the western Confederate states from those in the East. The South seemed ready to fall—if the Union could come up with the right plan of attack. General Grant would be the one to draw up such a plan.
General Grant Takes Charge
Ulysses S. Grant had been only an average student. He failed as a farmer and in business. Yet he became a brilliant soldier. He led Union troops to victory at Shiloh and Vicksburg and at another key battle in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In March 1864, President Lincoln put General Grant in charge of all the Union armies.
President Lincoln liked that Grant was a man of action. Now in charge, Grant wasted little time coming up with a plan to finish the war. He would deliver killing blows from all sides. His armies would move on to Richmond, the Confederate capital. At the same time, General William Tecumseh Sherman would lead attacks across the Deep South.

Grant soon put his strategy into action. In May and June of 1864, Grant’s army confronted Lee’s smaller force in a series of three battles near Richmond, Virginia. These were the Battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, and Cold Harbor. At each battle, Confederate lines held at first, but Grant quickly renewed the attack. “Whatever happens, there will be no turning back,” Grant promised Lincoln. He was determined to march southward, attacking Lee’s forces relentlessly and in spite of heavy losses until the Confederacy surrendered.
Grant Moves South Toward Richmond
The Wilderness was a densely wooded area about halfway between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia. Here, on May 5,1864, the six bloodiest weeks of the war began. For two days, Union and Confederate forces struggled among a tangle of trees through which they could hardly see. A Union private said, “It was a blind and bloody hunt to the death.”
At the Battle of the Wilderness, Lee had only about 60,000 men, while Grant had more than 100,000. Both sides suffered huge casualties. Grant, who lost 17,000 men, cried in his tent at the end of the second day. Meanwhile, brushfires raged through the forest. The fires burned alive 200 wounded men. On the morning of the third day, with no clear winner, Grant moved his forces south toward Richmond.
The next battles took place at nearby Spotsylvania Court House and at Cold Harbor. On June 2, the night before the third battle began, a Union general observed that men were “writing their names and home addresses on slips of paper and pinning them to the backs of their coats” to help people identify their bodies. The war seemed hopeless. Grant, however, was determined. He explained to the White House, “I propose to fight it out on this line, if it takes all summer.”
In a space of 30 days, Grant lost 50,000 of his troops. His critics in the North called him a “butcher.” Lincoln, however, stood by his general. “I can’t spare this man,” Lincoln is reported to have said. “He fights.” As he fought, the Confederates were also losing men—losses their smaller army could not survive.

David Farragut led the U.S. Navy to some of its greatest victories in the Civil War.
!
Farragut Blockades Mobile Bay
The highest-ranking officer in the Union navy was David Farragut. The son of a Spanish military man, Farragut had joined the navy when he was only 12 years old. In August 1864, he led a fleet of 18 ships through a narrow channel into Mobile Bay in Alabama. His mission was to gain control of the bay. Faced with stiff resistance, Farragut prepared for battle. To make sure he had a good view, he climbed high into the ship’s rigging and had himself tied in place.
The Confederates had forts on both sides of the channel, and they had mined the water with torpedoes. Unwilling to
back down, Farragut shouted his famous order: “Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!” The mission succeeded in blocking the last Southern port east of the Mississippi.
The Election of 1864
In the North, opposition to the war grew stronger through much of 1864. It seemed unlikely that Lincoln could win reelection in November. His loss could mean an end to the war and recognition of the Confederacy as an independent country. White Southerners clung to this hope.
After Union troops captured Atlanta and blocked Mobile Bay, however, weary Northerners began to believe again that victory was possible. In November, President Lincoln won a second term. He took 55 percent of the popular vote and 212 to 21 electoral votes over the Democratic candidate, General George B. McClellan.
Many interpreted Lincoln’s reelection as a clear sign from the voters: They wanted a permanent end to slavery. On January 31, 1865, Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment, which banned slavery in the United States.

534 The Civil War
Sherman's March to the Sea
Still, the Confederacy fought on. The Union was determined to break the South’s will to continue the fight. To break this will, Sherman burned much of the city of Atlanta in November 1864. Sherman then had his troops march across Georgia toward the Atlantic, burning cities and crops as they went. This trail of destruction is known as Sherman’s March to the Sea.
Sherman continued his march through the Carolinas to join Grant’s forces near Richmond. Union troops took food, tore up railroad lines and fields, and killed livestock. General Sherman’s march was part of a strategy called total war. Total war involves targeting not only the enemy’s army, but also its land and people. Sherman hoped that by bringing the horrors of the war to the Southern population, he could help end the war.
White Southerners were outraged by Sherman’s march. Thousands of African Americans, however, left their plantations to follow the protection of his army. For them, the March to the Sea was a march to freedom.
Richmond Falls
Meanwhile, Grant continued the siege of Petersburg. Lee and his troops defended the town, but sickness, casualties, and desertion weakened them. On April 2, 1865, the Confederate lines broke and Lee withdrew.
Word of Lee’s retreat soon reached the Confederate president. As the Union army marched toward Richmond, Davis and his cabinet prepared to leave. They gathered documents and ordered that bridges and weapons useful to the enemy be burned. Then they fled the city. An observer wrote:
When the Union army marched into the Confederate capital after the 11-month siege, they found the city in ruins and still burning.

The armory, with its stores of ammunition, exploded. Boom after boom rang through the city, and fires raged out of control.
On April 3, President Lincoln visited the captured town of Petersburg. Later, Lincoln confided to naval officer David Porter, “Thank God I have lived to see this. It seems to me that I have been dreaming a horrid nightmare for four years, and now the nightmare is gone.”
President Lincoln, his son Tad, and a group of military officials arrived in Richmond on April 4 to tour the fallen Confederate capital. As Lincoln walked through the streets, joyful African Americans followed singing, laughing, an reaching out to touch the president.

When one man knelt down to thank him, Lincoln told him, “Don’t kneel to me. You must kneel to God only, and thank Him for your freedom.”
At the home of Confederate president Davis, Lincoln sat wearily for a while on a chair in the president’s office. After visiting two prisons for Confederate prisoners, Lincoln replied to a question about what to do with captured Confederates: “If I were in your place, I’d let ‘em up easy, let ‘em up easy.”

Meeting at Appomattox Court House The formal end of the war came on April 9, 1865. Two days earlier, Grant had asked Lee to surrender, writing, “The result of last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance. At first, Lee had believed he must fight on. Then, the Union captured the train carrying food to his starving troops and completely surrounded his army. Lee knew it was over.
Grant met Lee in the courthouse of Appomattox, Virginia. Grant offered his terms: Lees officers could keep their small firearms, and any soldier with a horse could keep it. Grant also gave 25,000 rations to feed Lees troops. Americas deadliest war had ended.
Throughout the war, music was important to both sides. The song “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” which referenced biblical support for the Union cause as a war for human liberty, became the Union’s battle cry. “Dixie,” written by Daniel Decatur Emmett, was the song adopted by the Confederacy. It is said that Lincoln asked “Dixie” to be played after General Lee surrendered to Union forces.
The Toll of War
More American lives were lost in the Civil War than in any other conflict in American history. The war cost billions of dollars and left many Southern cities and farms in ruins.
The North’s victory saved the Union. The war also made clear that the national government was more powerful than the states. Finally, the war freed millions of African Americans. As you will read, however, the end of slavery left unsettled many of the problems that newly freed African Americans were to face.
Many questions remained. No one yet knew how to bring the Southern states back into the Union, nor what the status of African Americans would be in Southern society. Americans would struggle to answer these questions in the years ahead an era known as Reconstruction.

It Matters because
Plans for Reconstruction after the Civil War proved difficult and divisive.
The Reconstruction Debate
guidingquestion Why did leaders disagree about the South's rejoining the Union?
The Confederate states tried and failed to break away from the United States. Now, they had to rejoin that Union. In addition, the war left the South’s economy and society in ruins. It would take much effort to restore the states that had experienced so much destruction during the war.
Reconstruction (ree»kuhn«STRUHK»shuhn) was the era from 1865 to 1877 during which the former Confederate states were rebuilt and readmitted to the Union. The president and members of Congress had different ideas about how to accomplish these tasks. The debate over Reconstruction led to bitter conflict in the years following the Civil War.
Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan
President Lincoln offered the first plan for bringing Southern states back into the Union. In December 1863, while the Civil War still raged, Lincoln presented his ideas. Lincoln’s plan required voters in each Southern state to take an oath of loyalty to the Union. When 10 percent of the voters in a state had taken the oath, the state could form a new state government. The state would also be required to adopt a new constitution that banned

slavery. Once a state had met these conditions, it could send representatives to Congress. Lincoln’s proposal was known as the Ten Percent Plan.
Lincoln did not want to punish the South after the war ended. He believed that punishment would accomplish little and would slow the nation s healing from the war. Lincoln wanted to see white Southerners who supported the Union take charge of their state governments. He offered amnesty (AM.nuh.stee)— forgiveness for any crimes committed—to those who would swear loyalty to the Union. Only Confederate leaders would not be offered amnesty.
In 1864, three states—Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee— set up new governments under Lincoln’s plan. Congress, however, was not willing to accept the new states. It refused to seat their senators and representatives.
The Radical Republicans
Some members of Congress thought Lincoln’s plan went too easy on the South. A group of Republican representatives favored a more radical approach to Reconstruction. This group was known as the Radical Republicans, or the Radicals. Radical leader Thaddeus Stevens said that Southern institutions “must be broken up and relaid, or all our blood and treasure have been spent in vain.” The Radicals were powerful. The Republican Party controlled Congress, and the Radicals had much influence in the party. Congress could—and did—vote to deny seats to any state that sought to reenter the Union under Lincoln’s plan.
The city of Richmond, Virginia, shown here, was the capital of the Confederacy and an industrial center.

In July 1864, Congress passed its plan for Reconstruction.
The Wade-Davis Bill stated that to rejoin the Union, a state must meet three requirements. First, a majority of the state’s white male adults had to pledge loyalty to the Union. Second, only white males who swore they had not fought against the Union could vote for delegates to a state constitutional convention. Third, all new state constitutions had to ban slavery. The bill also barred former Confederates from holding public office.
Lincoln objected to the harshness of this plan. Lincoln wanted new state governments to be quickly established and the rebuilding of the South to get underway. Because Congress was about to end its session, he was able to “pocket veto” the bill: He refused to sign it, and the bill died after Congress adjourned. Still, the Wade-Davis Bill made President Lincoln realize that he would have to compromise with the Radicals.
Founding the Freedmen's Bureau
In March 1865, Lincoln and Congress together created the Freedmen’s Bureau. Its main purpose was to help African Americans adjust to life after slavery. The Freedmen’s Bureau provided food, clothing, and medical care to poor Southerners, especially those freed from slavery. It set up schools, some staffed with teachers from the North. The bureau helped some people get their own land to farm or find work for fair pay.

Johnson's Reconstruction Plan
guidingquestion How did Lincoln's assassination change the plans for the South to
rejoin the Union!
Events took a dramatic turn on the night of April 14, 1865. As the president enjoyed a play at Ford’s Theatre in Washington,
D.C., actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln in the head. Hours later, Lincoln died.
News of the president’s assassination swept across the nation. African Americans mourned the death of the man who helped bring an end to slavery. White Northerners grieved for the president who had restored the Union.
Vice President Andrew Johnson became president. Although he was a Southerner, Johnson had supported the Union during the Civil War. Johnson had his own ideas about rebuilding the South. His Reconstruction plan gave amnesty to most Southerners who swore loyalty to the Union. However, high-ranking Confederates could receive pardons only by appealing to the president. This part of his plan was meant to humiliate Confederate leaders. He believed that they had tricked other Southerners into secession. Johnson also opposed equal rights for African Americans. “White men alone must manage the South,” he stated.
President Johnson’s plan did require that Southern states outlaw slavery before they could rejoin the Union. They also had to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Passed by Congress in January 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States. By the end of 1865, all former Confederate states except Texas had set up new governments under Johnson s plan. These newly reformed states were now ready to rejoin the Union.

In 1865 former Confederate states began creating new governments based on President Johnsons plan. These states elected leaders to again represent them in the Congress. When the new senators and representatives arrived in Washington, D.C., Congress would not seat them. The Radical Republicans were not willing to readmit the Southern states on Johnsons easy terms. Radicals were determined to make the former Confederacy’s return to the Union difficult for the white South.

Black Codes and Civil Rights
Events in the South strengthened the Radicals’ determination.
By early 1866, legislatures in the Southern states had passed laws called black codes. These laws were designed to limit the freedoms of the newly freed African Americans. Some black codes made it illegal for African Americans to own or rent farms. The laws also made it easy for white employers to take advantage of African American workers. Some black codes allowed officials to fine or even arrest African Americans who did not have jobs. To freed

men and women and their supporters, life under the black codes was little better than slavery.
At the same time, Congress tried to protect the rights of the South’s African Americans. In 1866 it passed a bill that gave the Freedmen’s Bureau new powers. The Bureau could now set up special courts to try persons charged with violating African Americans rights. African Americans could sit on the juries in these courts and judge accused white Southerners.
To combat the black codes, Radical Republicans pushed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 through Congress. This law gave the federal government power to get involved in state affairs to protect African Americans’ rights. It also granted citizenship to African Americans. This act was meant to counter the Supreme Court decision in the 1857 case Dred Scotty. Sandford. The Supreme Court had ruled that African Americans were not citizens.
President Johnson vetoed both bills. He claimed that the federal government was exceeding its authority. Johnson also argued that both bills were unconstitutional. He reasoned that they had been passed by a Congress that did not include representatives from all the states. By raising this issue, he was warning that he would veto any law passed by a Congress in which the South was not represented.
Republicans in Congress were able to override, or defeat, both vetoes, and the bills became law. Radical Republicans began to see that Congress and Johnson would not be able to work together on Reconstruction. They gave up hope of compromising with the president and began to create their own plan for dealing with the South.
The Fourteenth Amendment
Congress did worry that the courts might overturn the Civil Rights Act. It proposed another amendment to the Constitution, which the states ratified in 1868. The Thirteenth Amendment had ended slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment took the next step by stating that:

TODAY
The Fourteenth Amendment
The Fourteenth Amendment aimed to preserve the rights of formerly enslaved people. Today it protects the rights of all Americans from abuse by state governments. Before the Fourteenth Amendment, the Bill of Rights applied only to actions of the federal government. For example, the First Amendment prevented the federal government, but not state governments, from denying freedom of religion. Over time, the Supreme Court has used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply the Bill of Rights to actions of state governments too.
This language protected the citizenship extended to African Americans by the Civil Rights Act of 1866. It guaranteed that citizenship could not later be taken away by passing another law. The amendment made it clear that if a state barred any adult male citizen from voting, that state could lose some representation in Congress.
Another part of the Fourteenth Amendment said that no state could take a person’s life, liberty, or property “without due process of law.” It stated that every person was entitled to “equal protection of the laws.” It also excluded former Confederate leaders from holding any national or state office unless Congress had pardoned them.
Some people considered amending the Constitution to protect African Americans to be an extreme measure. Increasing violence toward African Americans across the South convinced moderate Republicans that an amendment was necessary. Congress required that the Southern states ratify the Fourteenth Amendment as another condition of rejoining the Union. Because most refused to do so at first, the amendment’s ratification was delayed until 1868.

Radical Republicans in Charge
guidingquestion What elements were included in the Radical Republicans'idea of Reconstruction?
President Johnson campaigned against the Radical Republicans in the congressional elections of 1866. He attacked the Fourteenth Amendment and made it a major issue in the campaign. Many Northerners disliked Johnson’s tone. Some feared the clashes between whites and African Americans that were taking place in the South. Voters rejected Johnson’s views, and the Republicans won an overwhelming majority in Congress. This meant that Johnson could no longer prevent them from overriding his vetoes. A period known as Radical Reconstruction began.
The Reconstruction Acts
By 1867, 10 of the former Confederate states had not ratified the Fourteenth Amendment. In response, Congress passed the First Reconstruction Act. This law required that those states form new governments. Only Tennessee, which had ratified the amendment, kept its government and rejoined the Union.
The act divided the 10 defiant states into 5 military districts. Each district would be governed by an army general until new state governments were formed. Former Confederate leaders were banned from serving in these new governments. Each state also had to submit a new state constitution to Congress for approval. Finally, the act guaranteed African American men the right to vote in state elections. The Second Reconstruction Act empowered the army to register voters in each district and to help organize state constitutional conventions.

ow wa laaraaa
Many white Southerners refused to take part in the elections for constitutional conventions and new state governments. Thousands of newly registered African Americans did cast ballots. These developments favored the Republicans, who took control of Southern state governments. By 1868, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South Carolina had set up new governments, ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, and rejoined the Union. By 1870, the remaining three states—Mississippi, Virginia, and Texas—had also been readmitted.
Impeaching the President
The Constitution makes the president the commander in chief of the military. This gave President Johnson control over the military governors created by the First Reconstruction Act.
Because Johnson strongly opposed the Reconstruction Acts, Congress passed a series of laws to limit his power. One of these laws was the Tenure of Office Act. This law stated that the president could not remove government officials, including members of his own cabinet, without the Senate’s approval. Congress wanted to protect Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Stanton was the cabinet official in charge of the military and a supporter of Radical Reconstruction.
Tensions between Johnson and the Radical Republicans continued to grow. In August 1867, while Congress was not in session, Johnson suspended Stanton—temporarily stopped him from working.
When the Senate met again, it refused to approve the suspension. Johnson then fired Stanton. Thus he deliberately violated the Tenure of Office Act. Johnson also appointed people the Radical Republicans opposed to command some of the military districts in the South.
The House of Representatives voted to impeach (ihm»PEECH) President Johnson—that is, formally charge him with wrongdoing. In 1868 the case went to the Senate for a trial. The trial lasted almost three months. Johnson’s defenders claimed that the president had exercised his right to challenge laws he considered unconstitutional. They argued that the House had impeached Johnson for political reasons. Johnson’s critics said that Congress had supreme power to make the laws and that Johnson’s use of the veto interfered with that power.
Academic Vocabulary
suspend to stop temporarily
The Senate did not get the two-thirds majority it needed to convict President Johnson. Some moderate Republicans supported the president, arguing that he should not be removed from office for political reasons. As a result, Johnson remained president until Lincoln s second term ended in 1869. During that time, President Johnson did little to interfere with Congress’s Reconstruction plans.
The Fifteenth Amendment
Most Southern states had rejoined the Union by the time the presidential election of 1868 drew near. Most Americans hoped that the turbulent period of Reconstruction was over. The Republican Party nominated Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant. Supported by African American voters, Grant beat out the Democratic candidate, New York governor Horatio Seymour.
The election results showed that voters still supported Radical Reconstruction.
In 1869 Congress proposed the Fifteenth Amendment. This guaranteed that state and federal governments could not deny the right to vote to any male citizen because of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” Frederick Douglass, who vocally supported the Radical Republicans, traveled throughout the country to speak on behalf of the amendment.
When the states ratified the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870, Republicans thought their job was largely done. They believed that they had succeeded in giving African American men the right to vote. They also thought the power of the vote would allow African Americans to better protect themselves against unfair treatment by white people. Both beliefs would prove to be too optimistic.

Republicans in Charge
guidingquestion How were African Americans discouraged from participating in civic life in the South?
Republicans controlled Southern politics during the Reconstruction period. They were supported by African Americans, some white Southerners, and white newcomers from the North.
African Americans in Government
Though they had fewer rights than white Southerners, African Americans played important roles as voters and as elected officials. For a short time, African Americans held the majority in the lower house of the South Carolina legislature. Overall, the number of African Americans holding top positions in most Southern states during Reconstruction was small, and they did not control any state government. At the national level, 16 African Americans served in the House of Representatives and 2 served in the Senate between 1869 and 1880. The first African American senator, Hiram Revels, had recruited African Americans for the Union Army and served as a chaplain in a Mississippi regiment. He remained there after the war and was elected to the Senate in 1870, leading the way for other African Americans to follow.
As you read, use a diagram like the one shown here to describe improvements in the education of African Americans in the South during Reconstruction.

Scalawags and Carpetbaggers
Some Southern whites supported the Republican Party. These were often pro-Union business leaders and farmers who had not owned enslaved people. Former Confederates who held resentment against those who had been pro-Union called these people scalawags (SKA*lih*wagz), a term meaning “scoundrel” or “worthless rascal.”
Republicans also had the support of many Northern whites who moved to the South after the war. White Southerners called these Northerners carpetbaggers. The term referred to cheap suitcases made of carpet fabric. White Southerners were suspicious of the Northerners’ intentions. Some carpetbaggers were dishonest people looking to take advantage of the South’s difficulties, but most were not. Many sincerely wanted to help rebuild the South.
White Southerners accused Reconstruction governments of corruption (kuh«RUHP»shuhn)—dishonest or illegal actions.
While some officials did make money illegally, there is no evidence that corruption in the South was greater than in the North. Many Southerners were upset by the reforms Republican governments instituted. New schools and improved infrastructure cost money, and state governments raised property taxes to get that money. Many property owners lost their land, causing hardship and resentment.

SKILLS PRACTICE

Resistance to Reconstruction
Life during Reconstruction was difficult for African Americans. Most Southern whites did not want African Americans to have more rights. White landowners often refused to rent land to freed people. Store owners refused them credit. Many employers would not hire them. Many of the jobs available to African Americans were those that whites were unwilling to do.
Secret societies such as the Ku Klux Kian used fear and violence to deny rights to freed men and women. Disguised in white sheets and hoods, Kian members threatened, beat, and killed thousands of African Americans and the whites who supported them. Kian members burned African American homes, schools, and churches. Many Democrats, plantation owners, and other white Southerners supported the Kian. Some saw violence as a way to oppose Republican rule.
In 1870 and 1871, Congress passed several laws to try to stop the growing Kian violence. These laws were not always effective. White Southerners often refused to testify against those who attacked African Americans and their white supporters.

Education and Farming
guidingquestion What were some improvements and some limitations for African Americans?
During the early days of Reconstruction, African Americans built their own schools. Many Northerners came south to teach. In the 1870s, Reconstruction governments created public schools for both races. Soon about 50 percent of white children and 40 percent of African American children attended school in the South.
African Americans also made gains in higher education. Northerners set up academies in the South. These academies grew into a network of colleges and universities for African Americans.
African American and white students usually went to different schools. Few states had laws requiring schools to be integrated (IHN»tuh*grayt»uhd). Schools that were integrated had both white and African American students. Often, integration laws were not enforced.
In addition to education, freed people wanted farmland.
Having their own land would enable them to support their families. Some African Americans bought land with the help of the Freedmen’s Bank. Many freed people—along with many whites—had no choice but to farm land owned by someone else.
In the sharecropping (SHEHR«krah»peeng) system, landowners rented land to sharecroppers, or farmers. Sharecroppers gave a percentage of their crops to the landowner. Landowners often demanded an unfairly large percentage that left sharecroppers with almost nothing to support themselves. For many, sharecropping was little better than slavery.

guidingquestion How did Democrats regain control of Southern governments?
As a general, Ulysses S. Grant had led the North to victory in the Civil War. His reputation as a war hero carried him into the White House in the election of 1868 and to reelection in 1872. Unfortunately, Grant had little experience in politics.
Scandal and corruption plagued Grants presidency. In addition, a severe economic depression began during his second term. A crisis arose when the powerful banking firm of Jay Cooke and Company declared bankruptcy. This triggered a wave of fear known as the Panic of 1873. It set off a depression that lasted much of the decade.
The depression and the scandals in the Grant administration hurt the Republican Party. In the 1874 congressional elections, the Democrats won back control of the House of Representatives. Democrats also made gains in the Senate. These changes cost the Radical Republicans much of their power.
Meanwhile, Southern Democrats worked hard to regain control of their state governments. They got help from groups	i

The Election of 1876
Republicans attempted to keep control of the White House by choosing Ohio governor Rutherford B. Hayes as their candidate for president in 1876. Hayes held moderate views on Reconstruction. Republicans hoped he would appeal to voters in both the North and the South.
Hayes ran against Democrat Samuel Tilden, the governor of New York, in a very close election. Neither got a majority of the electoral votes, mainly because of confusing election returns from three Southern states. These states—Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana—were still under Republican rule. Republicans insisted that many voters in these states favored Hayes, but their votes had not been counted. Congress named a commission to decide which candidate should receive the disputed electoral votes. The commission recommended giving them all to Hayes. Doing this would make Hayes president by one electoral vote.

To ensure that Congress accepted this outcome, Republicans made many promises to the Democrats. One of these was a pledge to withdraw the troops who had been stationed in the South since the end of the Civil War. Shortly after Hayes took office in 1877, the last troops left the South.
Rise of the "New South"
By the 1880s, forward-looking Southerners were convinced that their region must develop an industrial economy. They argued that the South had lost the Civil War because its industry did not match the North’s. Atlanta newspaper editor Henry Grady headed a group that urged Southerners to “out-Yankee the Yankees” and build a “New South.” This “New South” would have industries based on the region’s coal, iron, tobacco, cotton, and lumber resources. Southerners would create this new economy by embracing a spirit of hard work and regional pride.
Southern industry made great gains in the 1880s. Textile mills sprang up across the region. The American Tobacco Company, developed largely by James Duke of North Carolina, came to control nearly all the tobacco manufacturing in the country. By 1890, the South produced nearly 20 percent of the nation’s iron

and steel. Much of the industry was in Alabama, near deposits of iron ore. In Florida, port cities Jacksonville and Pensacola prospered because of strong demand for lumber and other products.
The South possessed a cheap and reliable supply of labor. A railroad-building boom also helped development. By 1870, the railroad system, destroyed by the war, was nearly rebuilt. Between 1880 and 1890, track mileage more than doubled.
The New South's Rural Economy
In spite of these gains, the South did not develop an industrial economy as strong as the North’s. Agriculture remained the South’s main economic activity.
Supporters of the New South hoped to promote small, profitable farms that grew a variety of crops instead of relying on cotton. A different economy emerged, however. Many landowners held on to their large estates. When estates were divided, much of the land went to sharecropping and tenant farming. Neither of these activities was profitable.
Debt also caused problems. Poor farmers used credit to buy supplies. Merchants who provided credit also charged high prices, and farmers’ debts rose. To repay debts, farmers turned to cash crops. As in the past, the
main cash crop was cotton. Higher cotton production	" ?
drove cotton prices down. Lower prices led farmers to plant even more cotton. The growth of sharecropping and the heavy reliance on a single cash crop helped prevent improvements in the conditions of Southern farmers.
Q READING PROGRESS CHECK
Describing Why did Southern industry grow in the late 1800s?
By 1880, a third of the South's farmers were sharecroppers or tenant farmers. Sharecropping and tenant farming were agricultural systems that trapped generations of Southerners in poverty.

Because most Southern African Americans had little education, literacy tests prevented many from voting.
Both poll taxes and literacy tests also kept some whites from voting. To prevent this, some states passed grandfather clauses (GRAND*fah«thuhr KLAHZ»ihz). These laws allowed people to vote if their fathers or grandfathers had voted before Reconstruction. Because African Americans could not vote at that time, they were excluded. Such laws and the constant threat of violence caused African American voting to decline sharply.
After Reconstruction, Southern leaders used a variety of means to prevent African Americans from exercising their right to vote.
Jim Crow Laws
By the late 1800s, segregation had also become common across the South. Segregation (seh«grih*GAY»shuhn) is the separation of the races. Southern states passed so-called Jim Crow laws that required African Americans and whites to be separated in almost every public place. In 1896 the Supreme Court upheld segregation laws in Plessy v. Ferguson. The case involved a Louisiana law that required separate sections on trains for African Americans and whites. The Court ruled that segregation was legal as long as African Americans had access to public places equal to those of whites.
In practice, the separate facilities for African Americans were far from equal. Southern states spent much more money on schools and other facilities for whites than on those for African Americans. Still, this “separate but equal” doctrine gave legal support to segregation for more than 50 years.
Violence against African Americans also rose. One form of violence was lynching (LIHN»cheeng), in which angry mobs killed people by hanging them. Some African Americans were lynched because they were suspected of crimes. Others were lynched because they did not act as whites thought they should.

Exodusters and Buffalo Soldiers
Formerly enslaved people began to leave the South during Reconstruction. They called themselves “Exodusters.” This name came from the biblical book of Exodus, which describes the Israelites’ escape from slavery in Egypt.
During the exodus of the 1870s, more than 20,000 African Americans migrated to Kansas. They hoped their journey would take them far from the poverty that they experienced in the South. Other African Americans escaped the South by becoming soldiers. They served in segregated army units and fought in the western Indian Wars from 1867 until 1896. According to legend, the men were called “buffalo soldiers” by the Apache and Cheyenne. The soldiers adopted the name as a sign of honor and respect. Units of buffalo soldiers answered the nation’s call to arms not only in the West, but also in Cuba, the Philippines, Hawaii, and Mexico.
Reconstruction's Impact
Reconstruction was a success in some ways and a failure in others. It helped the South rebuild its economy. Yet much of the South remained agricultural and economically poor. African Americans gained greater equality and shared power in government, but their advances did not last. In the words of the great African American writer and civil rights leader W.E.B. Du Bois, “The slave went free; stood a brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery.” The seeds of freedom and equality had been planted. Yet African Americans would struggle to gain their full rights for many decades to come.

Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Standards
A
Guide For Students and Parents Welcome to United States History since Reconstruction and United States History Since 1877. This course completes the two-year study of American History that you began in Grade 8. The content of the high school course focuses on the political, economic, and social events that have shaped modern America. You will be viewing and interpreting the period from various perspectives, including historical, geographic, political, economic, and cultural. Together, these perspectives can help you understand how the past has led to our present and to appreciate your role in shaping our future.
You will also examine how our nation’s founding documents—the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights—protect individual rights. These documents also express the nation’s principles of government. Among these are popular sovereignty (government is based on the consent, or agreement, of the people) and limited government (government can do only what the people allow it to do). You will also investigate how the founding documents guarantee the economic freedoms we enjoy today.

Native Americans introduced Europeans to new crops such as corn, cocoa, and tomatoes. Europeans introduced Native Americans to various grains, fruits, and other foods. Europeans also became familiar with Native American inventions such as canoes, moccasins, and toboggans. When Europeans arrived in North America, however, they brought with them infectious diseases to which the Native Americans had no resistance.

Pre-Columbian America
guide ng question How did geography influence the ways Native A merican cultures developed?
No one knows exactly when the first people arrived in America.
Recent research suggests that they may have arrived between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago. In time, Native Americans learned how to raise crops. This shift led to the first permanent villages and to new building methods. Societies became more complex, and civilizations arose, marked by advanced knowledge of trade, government, the arts, science, and language.
Early Civilizations
Anthropologists think the first American civilization arose between 1500 b.c. and 1200 b.c. among the Olmec. They lived in Mesoamerica, the region that today includes central and southern Mexico and Central America. Later, the Maya and the Aztec also developed civilizations in Mesoamerica, building impressive temples and pyramids and establishing trade networks.
After a.d. 300, the Hohokam and the Anasazi began growing crops in North Americas dry Southwest by building elaborate irrigation systems. People in the Eastern Woodlands were developing their own cultures. The Hopewell built geometric earthworks that served as ceremonial centers, observatories, and burial places. By a.d. 900, the Mississippian people had built Cahokia, one of the largest early American cities.
Native Americans of North America
By the 1500s, Native Americans had established an array of cultures suited to their environments. In the Eastern Woodlands, most Native Americans combined hunting and fishing with farming.

In the Southeast, many Native Americans built wooden stockades around their villages for protection. Southwestern peoples farmed corn, beans, and cotton. By the 1500s, the Apache and the Navajo had come to the Southwest.
The Navajo settled in farming villages, but many of the Apache remained nomadic hunters. Hunting also sustained the Sioux and other peoples of the western Great Plains.
The Pacific Northwest was home to fishing peoples. In what is today central California, groups such as the Porno trapped small game and gathered acorns. In the Far North region from Alaska to Greenland, the Inuit and the Aleut hunted sea mammals, polar bears, and caribou.

Early Modern Europe
guiding question What ideas and inventions encouraged Europeans to begin overseas exploration?
As the people of Europe emerged from the Middle Ages, they wanted to find a quick trade route to Asia, the source of many luxury goods. Rulers of Portugal, Spain, France, and England wanted to find a water route to Asia that would bypass the Italian and Arab merchants and traders who controlled trade in the eastern Mediterranean.
Renaissance and Reformation
In Western Europe, an intellectual revolution—the Renaissance—was underway. The arts flowered amid a rebirth of interest in ancient Greek and Roman culture. Europeans rediscovered the works of ancient thinkers and began reading the works of Arab scholars. A renewed commitment to reason helped trigger a scientific revolution. Inventions such as the astrolabe and the compass made sea travel easier.
The caravel was ideal for exploration. These small ships ranged from 70 to 90 feet (23 to 27 m) long, were highly maneuverable, and very fast. Their smaller size enabled them to sail along shallow coastlines and explore up rivers much farther than other ships.
CRITICAL THINKING
Determining Cause and Effect Why might the development ofthe caravel have encouraged European exploration?

Religious changes were taking place as well. In 1517 the German monk Martin Luther called for the reform of the Catholic Church, launching the Protestant Reformation. New churches emerged in Germany and England, including a burgeoning movement known as Puritanism. Puritans hoped to “purify” the new Church of England, but faced challenges after King James I became the English monarch in 1603.
Overseas Exploration Begins
Portugal took the lead in searching for a sea route around Africa to Asia in the early 1400s. Later, Spain funded an expedition by Italian sea captain Christopher Columbus to sail west across the Atlantic. In August 1492, Columbus and his crew left Spain and landed two months later on an island in the Caribbean. Columbus’s news that he had reached
land on the other side of the Atlantic triggered a wave
of European exploration. Soon people realized that Columbus had not reached Asia but instead a continent they did not know. They named the new continent America in honor of Amerigo Vespucci, who explored
the South American coastline for Portugal.

The Spanish and French Establish Colonies
guiding question Why did Spain and France establish colonies in the Americas?
After sailing west from Spain, Columbus reached the Bahamas in October 1492. He then headed farther into the Caribbean, searching for gold. At about that time, Spain and Portugal both claimed control over the Atlantic route to Asia. The Treaty of Tordesillas resolved the rivalry in 1494, and recognized Spain’s claim to most of the Americas.
New Spain
In 1519a Spaniard named Hernan Cortes sailed from Cuba to explore the Yucatan Peninsula. He had heard reports of vast riches in that region and set sail with an army seeking glory and gold. After conquering the peninsula, Cortes, his troops, and Tlaxcalan warriors (enemies of the Aztec) destroyed the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan in 1521. On its ruins, the Spanish built Mexico City, which became the capital of the colony of New Spain. Cortes then sent several expeditions to conquer the surrounding regions. The men who led these expeditions became known as conquistadors, or “conquerors.” Deadly diseases brought by the Spanish killed many native peoples and severely weakened their ability to resist the invaders. The Spanish soon controlled a territory stretching from Florida to California and into South America.
New France
France began exploring eastern North America, funding trips by Jacques Cartier and Giovanni da Verrazano in the early 1500s. In 1602 French king Henry IV authorized a group of French merchants to establish a colony in what is now Canada. They hired Samuel de Champlain to help them. In 1608 Champlain founded Quebec, the eventual capital of New France. The backers of the colony sought fur, and Frenchmen began a brisk trade with Native Americans. In the late 1600s, France began expanding the colony. Explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette reached the Mississippi River,

Settling the Thirteen Colonies
guiding question Forwhat reasons were the thirteen colonies founded?
Soon after Columbus made his historic voyage, England began exploring the eastern part of North America, sending John Cabot on expeditions in 1497 and 1498. It was not until the 1600s, however, that England succeeded in establishing colonies in North America.
Jamestown
English business and government leaders saw colonies as sources of raw materials and as markets for English goods. In 1607 they established Jamestown, the first lasting English settlement, in Virginia. The settlement was funded by a joint-stock company—a group of private investors who supported major projects to gain profits. The Jamestown settlers overcame early troubles with the help of a group of local Native Americans known as the Powhatan Confederacy, and eventually prospered by growing tobacco.
Encouraged by the Virginia Company, more than 4,500 settlers immigrated to Virginia by 1622. Alarmed Native Americans attacked Jamestown. An English court blamed the company’s policies for the settlers’ deaths and revoked its charter. Virginia then became a royal colony.
The New England Colonies
Not all settlers came for economic gain. Some Puritans had decided the Church of England was too corrupt to be reformed. They were called Separatists. In 1620 a group of Separatists, later known as the Pilgrims, set sail from England on the Mayflower to escape persecution for their religious beliefs.
The Pilgrims finally settled near what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts. The colonists drew up the Mayflower Compact, a plan for self-government. Ten years later, facing increasing persecution in England, another group of Puritans arrived in Massachusetts Bay with a charter for their new colony. They founded several towns, including Boston.
Before long, Puritan efforts in Massachusetts to suppress other religious beliefs led to the formation of Rhode Island and Connecticut. Dissenter Roger Williams founded the town of Providence. Anne Hutchinson and others banished from Massachusetts settled in the area and eventually joined their towns to become the single colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Religious freedom became a key part of the colony’s charter. Reverend Thomas Hooker and his congregation moved to the Connecticut River valley and founded the town of Hartford, marking the beginning of the colony of Connecticut, which adopted America’s first democratic constitution in 1639. The territory north of Massachusetts was divided into Maine and New Hampshire, but claimed by Massachusetts. In 1679 New Hampshire became a royal colony. Maine remained part of Massachusetts.
The Middle Colonies
In 1609 Henry Hudson, a navigator hired by Dutch merchants, had discovered what is now the Hudson River valley in New York. The Dutch called the region New Netherland and established their main settlement of New Amsterdam on

Anne Hutchinson arrived in Boston in 1634. There, she held meetings with other women to discuss sermons, express her own beliefs, and evaluate the ministers. Hutchinson stirred up controversy with her views on how salvation could be obtained. She was tried for sedition and banished by the Massachusetts General Court in 1637. Hutchinson, her family, and some followers settled in what is today Rhode Island. She later moved to Long Island, where she was killed in an attack by Native Americans.

Manhattan Island. Charles II seized New Netherland from the Dutch and granted the land to his brother, the Duke of York. Much of the land was renamed New York. The rest became New Jersey, a colony that offered greater land grants, religious freedom, and political rights. In 1681 William Penn, wanting to help his fellow Quakers escape persecution in England, created the colony of Pennsylvania south of New York. The “lower counties” became Delaware.
The Southern Colonies
Farther south, tobacco helped Virginia thrive. Its neighbor colony, Maryland, was a proprietary colony that began in the 1630s to provide a refuge for Catholics who faced persecution in England.
In 1663 King Charles II gave eight friends a vast tract of land named Carolina. This region developed into two distinct areas: North Carolina, with scattered tobacco farms, and South Carolina, where a larger number of settlers established the community of Charles Towne (Charleston), exported deerskins, and grew rice. With a charter from King George II, James Oglethorpe founded Georgia as a place for English debtors to begin a new life.
Most colonists relied on agriculture for their livelihoods. Often, poor English people came to America as indentured servants who agreed to work for four or more years in return for ship’s passage and basic needs. Large Southern landowners also relied on the labor of enslaved Africans.

The American Revolution
guidingquestion Why did the colonists fight a war for independence against Great Britain?
The American colonies experienced rapid population growth. In time, colonists revolted against what they saw as oppressive British rule. They established a new, independent government for themselves.
New Ideas Influence the Colonists
During the 1600s and 1700s, philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment stressed the use of reason and logic to understand natural laws. Enlightenment writer John Locke attempted to use reason to discover natural laws that applied to politics and society. He argued that governments existed because the people who were governed allowed them to exist: “For no government can have a right to obedience from a people who have not freely consented to it; which they can never be supposed to do, till... they are put in a full state of liberty to choose their government.” Lockes ideas influenced Thomas Jefferson and other colonists.
Also in the 1700s, some Americans renewed their Christian faith in what became known as the Great Awakening. The new ideas of Baptists, Presbyterians, and Methodists won many converts. Along with the Enlightenment, this movement emphasized an individualism that inclined American colonists toward political independence.
The Growing Rift With Britain
In the 1750s, Great Britain and France began fighting for control of North America. Both countries relied on Native Americans as allies, and the war became known as the French and Indian War. The British victory in the war left Britain with steep debts and new territories to govern and defend.
Many British leaders thought that the colonies should share in these costs. The American colonists, however, did not like the policies Britain adopted to solve its financial problems.
The Proclamation of 1763 tried to halt colonial expansion into Native American lands west of the Appalachians. King George III wanted to avoid another costly war with the Native Americans, but the colonists, who wanted access to the Ohio River valley, were enraged.
"No Taxation Without Representation" Colonists had been smuggling goods without paying customs duties, so Britain tightened customs and introduced unpopular taxes such as the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act— the first direct tax Britain had levied on the colonists. In October 1765, representatives from nine colonies issued the Declaration of Rights and Grievances, arguing that only representatives elected by the colonists—not Parliament—had the right to tax them. “No taxation without representation” became a popular catchphrase. Colonists boycotted British goods, and Britain repealed the Stamp Act in 1766. In 1767 the Townshend Acts put new customs duties on key British imports and enforced rules against smuggling. Colonial anger turned to violence in 1770, resulting in the Boston Massacre on March 5. Eventually Britain repealed the Townshend Acts.
The resumption of smuggling soon led to strife. Colonists created committees of correspondence to communicate with one another about British activities. In 1773 colonists dumped hundreds of cases of tea off British ships in a protest called the Boston Tea Party. Outraged, Parliament passed the Coercive Acts to punish the colonists for their defiance and the Quebec Act, which extended the boundaries of what was then the Province of Quebec to include much of what is now Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Illinois. Together these laws came to be known as the Intolerable Acts.

This lithograph, titled The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor, was created by engravers Currier & Ives in 1846.
CRITICALTHINKING
Interpreting What was the significance ofthe Boston Tea Party being a physical demonstration? Declaring Independence Opposition to British policies continued to rise. Fifty-five colonial delegates met at the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774. Soon after gathering, they learned that Britain had suspended the Massachusetts Assembly. The Congress responded by approving a plan to boycott British goods.
In the meantime, the suspended Massachusetts Assembly gathered secretly to create a new Massachusetts Provincial Congress and a Committee of Public Safety. They selected John Hancock to be President of the Committee and gave him the power to call up the militia, in effect making Hancock a rival governor to General Gage, whom the British had put in control of Massachusetts. In April 1775, Gage decided to seize control of the militias weapons and supplies that were stored in Concord. As the British troops marched past the town of Lexington on their way to Concord, fighting broke out between the Minutemen militia and the British troops. The first shots of the revolutionary war had been fired.
Three weeks later, as fighting continued in Massachusetts, the Second Continental Congress gathered in Philadelphia. The appointed George Washington to command a new Continental Army made up of the colonial militias. Battles took place in Boston, near Norfolk, Virginia, in North Carolina, and outside Charleston, South Carolina. By July 1776, the Congress had decided the time had come to declare independence and appointed a committee to draft a declaration. The first draft of the Declaration of Independence was written by Thomas Jefferson, then edited and revised by others on the committee including John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman and Robert Livingston. On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress issued the Declaration of Independence.
John Hancock was the first person to sign, followed by 55 other representatives from the colonies. Among the signers were Thomas Jefferson,
10
Roger Sherman, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin. Others included Benjamin Rush who had helped organize the Sons of Liberty in Pennsylvania, and assisted Tom Paine in writing Common Sense; John Witherspoon from New Jersey, who went on to help draft the Articles of Confederation, and Charles Carroll, the sole Catholic signer of the Declaration, and one of the leaders of opposition to Britain in Maryland. With the signing of the Declaration, the thirteen colonies had now become the United States of America and the American Revolution had begun.
The War for Independence
The Continental Army could not match the British army in size, funding, or experience.
It was fighting on home ground, however, and used unconventional tactics.
The British enjoyed early victories, but the American win at Saratoga in 1777 was a turning point in the war. Morale improved, and the French signed a military alliance with the United States and recognized the new nation’s independence.
American troops controlled the frontier, but the British won victories in the South. In 1780 Patriot forces regained
control in the South after the Battle of Kings Mountain. The last major battle of the war was fought at Yorktown, Virginia. Trapped by Washingtons forces and the French navy, General Charles Cornwallis and approximately 8,000 British troops surrendered on October 19, 1781.
Parliament then voted to end the war. Peace talks began in early April 1782, and the Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3, 1783. With the Revolutionary War over, a new nation began to take shape.

Boston: Hotbed of
Revolution The growing dispute between colonists and British authorities centered on the extent of Parliament’s power over the colonies, particularly the power to levy taxes. Boston was a center of protest against British policies. When, on the night of March 5, 1770, British soldiers fired into a crowd, killing or injuring 11 people, colonists were quick to declare the event a “massacre,’" even though exactly what occurred is debatable.
POLITICAL ESSAY,
1767 From what has been said, I think this uncontrovertible conclusion may be deduced, that when a ruling state obliges a dependent state to take certain commodities from her alone, it is implied in the nature of that obligation; is essentially requisite to give it the least degree of justice; and is inseparably united with it, in order to preserve any share of freedom to the dependent state; that those commodities should never be loaded with duties, FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF LEVYING MONEY ON THE DEPENDENT STATE.
Upon the whole the single question is, whether the parliament can legally impose duties to be paid by the people of these colonies only, FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF RAISING A REVENUE, on commodities, which she obliges us to take from her alone, or, in other words, whether the parliament can legally take money out of our pockets without our consent.

POLITICAL ESSAY,
1774 LETTER, 1770
To suppose, that by sending out a colony, the nation established an independent power; that when, by indulgence and favour, emigrants are become rich, they shall not contribute to their own defence, but at their own pleasure; and that they shall not be included, like millions of their fellow subjects, in the general system of representation; involves such an accumulation of absurdity, as nothing but the show of patriotism could palliate.
He that accepts protection, stipulates obedience. We have always protected the Americans; we may therefore subject them to government.
The less is included in the greater. That power which can take away life, may seize upon property. The parliament may enact, for America, a law of capital punishment; it may therefore establish a mode and proportion of taxation.

Declaring Independence
Declaration of Independence was written in
1776, with very few exceptions, the people of the world were governed by monarchs, emperors, and absolute rulers. There had been very little development in political ideas since Roman times that discussed the relationship between the individual and the government.
A reexamination of government began in the Renaissance, and by the time ofthe Enlightenment in the 18th century many new ideas had emerged. Those ideas culminated in the American Declaration of Independence.
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE,
1776 The text of the Declaration of Independence has four parts. The first part is the preamble, which explains why it is being issued. The second part explains the idea of natural rights, and uses that idea to explain the legal justification for declaring independence. The third part, the list of grievances, charges the British with violating the rights ofthe colonies and gives examples. The fourth part is the resolution, where the colonies officially declare their independence.
The Declaration was written by Thomas Jefferson with the help of Benjamin Franklin and John Adams. It was then revised by Congress before being issued. The document draws on the new political theories ofthe Enlightenment. It summarizes these ideas when it states that people are endowed with unalienable rights. This was a revolutionary idea. It means that rights do not come from the government. People have rights no matter what their government says, no matter what laws it passes, and the government cannot take them away.
Second, the Declaration argues that the only reason people create government is to protect their rights. The only legitimate or just powers a government has are the powers it gets from

The Declaration of Independence is very important. It marks the birth ofthe United States, the first modern democratic republic. Its ideas and values have influenced people in other nations, and have helped to transform governments and societies around the world.
THE SECOND TREATISE OF GOVERNMENT,
1689 The political ideas behind the Declaration came from many sources, including Enlightenment writers and classical thinkers such as Aristotle and Cicero. But the greatest influence on American thinking was probably the 17th century English philosopher John Locke, who wrote “Two Treatises of Government” shortly after the English Parliament removed King James II from power and asked William and Mary to become the new monarchs of England:
Men being, as has been said, by Nature, all free, equal and independent, no one can be put out of this Estate, and subjected to the Political Power of another, without his own Consent. The only way whereby any one divests himself of his Natural Liberty and puts on the bounds of Civil Society is by agreeing with other Men to Joyn and unite into a Community, for their comfortable, safe, and
14

peaceable living one amongst another, in a secure Enjoyment of their properties....
Governments are dissolved from within ... when such a single Person or Prince sets up his own Arbitrary Will in place ofthe Laws, which are the Will ofthe Society, declared by the Legislative.... Secondly, when the Prince hinders the legislative from ... acting freely, pursuant to those ends, for which it was Constituted ... Thirdly, When by the Arbitrary Power ofthe Prince, the Electors, or ways of Election are altered, without the Consent, and contrary to the common Interest ofthe People.
... In these and the like Cases, when the Government is dissolved, the People are at liberty to provide for themselves, by erecting a new Legislative, differing from the other, by the change of Persons, or Form, or both as they shall find it most for their safety and good.
THE ENGLISH BILL OF RIGHTS,
1789 The Declaration of Independence contains 18 charges against the king. This list of grievances were patterned after several documents, but the most influential was the English Bill of Rights issued by the English Parliament in 1689:
By assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws and the execution of laws without consent of parliament.... By levying money for and to the use ofthe crown by pretence of prerogative for other time and in other manner than the same was granted by parliament.

In Congress, July 4,1776. The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States
The Preamble The Declaration of Independence has four parts. The Preamble explains why the Continental Congress drew up the Declaration.
impel: force
Natural Rights The second part, the Declaration of Natural Rights, states that people have certain basic rights and that government should protect those rights. John Locke's ideas strongly influenced this part. In 1690 Locke wrote that government was based on the consent of the people and that people had the right to rebel > if the government did not uphold their , right to life, liberty, and property.
endowed: provided
of America,
[Preamble]
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
[Declaration of Natural Rights]
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while
16
evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
[List of Grievances]
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their
despotism: unlimited power
What It Means
List of Grievances The third part ofthe Declaration is a list ofthe colonists' complaints against the British government. Notice that King George III is singled out for blame.

Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislature.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their acts of pretended legislation:
For quartering large bodies of troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
18
For suspending our own Legislature, and declaring themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.
Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

guidingquestion How did the constitutions created during the Revolutionary War attempt to limit the power of government and protect the rights of citizens?
The leaders who created the United States of America knew that they were creating something new. They made a deliberate choice to replace royal rule with a republic. In a republic, power is held by citizens who are entitled to vote. Elected officials are responsible to the citizens and must govern according to laws or a constitution. Political Ideas of the New Nation
In an ideal republic, all citizens are equal under the law, regardless of their wealth or social class. These ideas contradicted traditional practices that restricted the rights of many people on the basis of their race, class, or gender. Despite these contradictions, republican ideas began to change American society. By the end of the Revolution, each state had drawn up its own written constitution. Many, based on the models of Massachusetts and Virginia, called for separate branches of government, two-house legislatures, and a list of rights guaranteed to citizens.
The Articles of Confederation
Initially adopted in 1777 during the Revolution, the Articles of Confederation were ratified in 1781, formally establishing the framework for a central national government. The Articles loosely unified the states under a single governing body, the Congress. There were no separate branches of government, and Congress had only limited powers. After fighting to free themselves from British rule, the states did not want a new government that might become tyrannical.

The U.S. Constitution
guiding question What are the key compromises and provisions incorporated in the US. Constitution?
The young United States faced several political and economic problems after the end of the American Revolution. Many American leaders believed that the new nation would not survive without a strong national government and that the Articles of Confederation had to be revised.
In May 1787, 55 of the most distinguished leaders in the United States met in Philadelphia to discuss weaknesses in the Articles of Confederation. They soon decided that a new form of government was needed. All the delegates supported a national government with the power to levy taxes and make laws that would be binding upon the states. The delegates also accepted the idea of dividing the government into executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Debate and Compromise
Debate arose about how each state should be represented in the legislative branch. The larger states insisted that representation be based on population; smaller states wanted each state to have an equal vote. The convention appointed a special committee to find a compromise. Benjamin Franklin warned the delegates that if they failed to agree, they would “become a reproach and a by-word down to future ages. And what is worse, mankind may hereafter, from this unfortunate instance, despair of establishing governments by human wisdom, and leave it to chance, war, and conquest.”
Roger Sherman of Connecticut suggested the basis of the committee s solution. The legislature would be divided into two houses. In the House of Representatives, the number of a state’s representatives would depend on its population. In the Senate, each state would have equal representation. Voters in each state would elect the members of the House of Representatives, but the state legislatures would choose the senators. This proposal came to be known as the Connecticut Compromise, or the Great Compromise.
PHOTO:
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division [LC-USZC4-4097] The Connecticut Compromise sparked a fresh controversy: whether to count enslaved people when determining how many representatives each state would have in the House of Representatives. Southern delegates wanted to count enslaved people. Northern delegates objected, pointing out that enslaved people could not vote. The matter was settled by the Three-Fifths Compromise. Every five enslaved persons would count as three free persons for determining both representation and taxation. In another compromise, the delegates dealt with the power of Congress to regulate trade, agreeing that the new Congress could not tax exports. They also agreed that it could not ban the slave trade until 1808.
Framework of Government
Next, the delegates focused on the details of the new government. The government was based on the principle of popular sovereignty, or rule by the people. It created a representative system of government in which elected officials speak for the people. To strengthen the central government but still preserve the rights of the states, the Constitution describes a system known as federalism. Under federalism, power is divided between the national and state governments.
The Constitution also provides for a separation of powers by dividing power between three branches of government: the legislative branch, which makes laws; the executive branch, which implements and enforces the laws, among other duties; and the judicial branch, which interprets federal laws and renders judgment in cases involving those laws. A system of checks and balances prevents any one of the three branches from becoming too powerful. Each branch has some ability to limit the power of the other two.
The success of the Constitutional Convention in creating a government that reflected the country’s many viewpoints was, in Washington’s words, “little short of a miracle.” The convention, John Adams declared, was “the greatest single effort of national deliberation that the world has ever seen.” Ratification and the Bill of Rights
On September 28, 1787, Congress voted to submit the Constitution to the states. Each state would hold a convention to ratify, or approve, it. Nine states had to vote to approve the Constitution for it to go into effect. As soon as Americans learned about the new Constitution, they began to argue over whether it should be ratified. The debate took place in state legislatures, in mass meetings, in the columns of newspapers, and in everyday conversations.
Supporters of the Constitution called themselves Federalists. They emphasized that the Constitution would create a federal system, with power divided between a central government and state governments. They hoped the name would remind Americans who feared a central government that the states would retain many of their powers.
Opponents to the Constitution were called Anti-Federalists, a somewhat misleading name, as they were not truly against federalism. They accepted the need for a national government. The real issue, as far as they were concerned, was whether the national government or the state governments would be supreme.
The Federalists’ arguments for ratification were summarized in The Federalist—a collection of 85 essays written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay. The three men published most of the essays in New York newspapers in late 1787 and early 1788. To this day The Federalist remains a valuable resource for understanding how the Constitution was supposed to work and what the Framers wanted to achieve.
James Madison , (1751-1836)
Although many individuals ' contributed to the framing ofthe \ U.S. Constitution, James Madison \ proposed the Virginia Plan, which
defined a separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. He was a leader in the First United States Congress and was responsible for
[ the first 10 amendments ofthe i; Constitution, known as the Bill of
Rights. In 1808 he was elected the fourth president ofthe United States.

Creating a Nation 23
The Federalists knew, however, that the most important votes still lay ahead. The large states of Massachusetts, Virginia, and New York might vote either way. In Massachusetts, opponents of the Constitution included Massachusetts Governor John Hancock and Samuel Adams. Adams refused to support the new constitution unless Federalists gave him a guarantee “that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press, or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States .. . from keeping their own arms;... or to subject the people to unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons, papers or possessions.”
The Federalists moved quickly to meet these objections. They promised to attach a bill of rights to the Constitution once it was ratified. They also agreed to support an amendment that would reserve for the states all powers not given to the federal government. In the end, the promise to add a bill of rights won the vote for ratification in both Massachusetts and Virginia. In New York, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay worked hard to build support. When it became clear the Constitution would go into effect, New York voted by a narrow margin to ratify it as well. Elections for Congress and the new office of president were held in 1788, and in March 1789, the new United States Senate and House of Representatives met for the very first time. George Washington was elected the first president under the new Constitution.
With the new government in effect, one of the very first tasks of the new Congress was to pass the Bill of Rights as promised. James Madison, one of the leaders in Congress, made the Bill of Rights a top priority. He hoped it would demonstrate the good faith of federal leaders and build support for the new government.
In drafting the Bill of Rights, Madison relied heavily on the Virginia Declaration of Rights issued in 1776 and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom that Thomas Jefferson had written in 1786. In late September 1789, Congress agreed on 12 constitutional amendments. They were then sent to the states for ratification, but only 10 were approved. These 10 went into effect and are generally referred to as the Bill of Rights. The first eight protect the rights of individuals against actions of the federal government. The last two set limits on the powers of the new national government. The Ninth Amendment states that the people have other rights not listed. The Tenth Amendment states that any powers not specifically given to the federal government are reserved for the states.

The Rise of Political Parties
guiding question Why did political parties emerge in the new republic, and what were the consequences?
George Washington served as the first president under the new Constitution. Congress created three executive departments and organized the judicial branch. Washington appointed the heads of the executive departments, including Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state and Alexander Hamilton as secretary of the treasury.
Jefferson and Hamilton
One of the new government’s most pressing concerns involved the national debt. Hamilton proposed a plan to pay off the debt and to create a national bank to manage the country’s finances. Jefferson, James Madison, and others
4
opposed the plan, arguing that Congress could not establish a bank because it was not among the federal government s enumerated powers specifically listed in the Constitution. Hamilton disagreed, stating that the bank was among the implied powers—not explicitly listed in the Constitution but necessary for the government to do its job. Hamilton eventually won approval for his program, and the Bank of the United States was established in 1791.
That same year, Congress enacted a tax on whiskey, to bring in much-needed revenue. The tax infuriated many. Some western Pennsylvania farmers resisted tax collectors and destroyed the whiskey stills of those who paid the tax. In August 1794, Washington sent nearly 13,000 troops to put down what was called the Whiskey Rebellion.
The debate over Hamilton’s financial program divided Congress into rival political parties. The Federalists supported Hamilton’s plans and a strong national government. The Democratic-Republicans, led by Jefferson and Madison, favored a limited federal government and more power for the states.
The Election of 1800
Washington’s successor was fellow Federalist John Adams. A series of
unpopular taxes and laws passed during his first term gave Adams a
disadvantage in seeking reelection in 1800. The Democratic-Republican
nominees were Jefferson for president and Aaron Burr for vice president.
Under the Constitution, each state chooses electors—the same number as it has representatives and senators. This group, the Electoral College, then votes for the president. In 1800 each elector was to vote for two people of their choice for president, even if one were nominated for vice president.
When the votes were counted, the Federalist candidates had lost and Jefferson and Burr were tied at 73 votes each. Since neither
had a majority, the House of Representatives had to choose a	GEOGRAPHY CONNECTION

cases
Marbury v. Madison
William Marbury based his request for a court order on the Judiciary Act of 1789, which said that requests for federal court orders go directly to the Supreme Court. In the 1803 case Marbury v. Madison, the Supreme Court decided that part of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional and thus invalid. The Constitution specifies which cases can go directly to the Supreme Court, and court orders are not mentioned. In the Court’s opinion, Marshall wrote:

The Nineteenth Century Begins
guiding question Howdid the United States assert itself as an independent nation?
President Jefferson attempted to limit federal powers and helped expand the size of the country. Later, the United States faced war with Britain.
Jefferson in Office
Thomas Jefferson took office committed to limiting government. He began paying off federal debt, cut government spending, eliminated the hated whiskey tax, and planned to rely on local militia instead of a standing army.
Weakening the Federalists’ control ofthe judiciary was another aim of the new administration. On his last day in office, President Adams had appointed dozens of new Federalist judges and court officers. Jefferson asked the incoming Democratic-Republican Congress to abolish some of the new positions and to withhold the paperwork confirming other appointments. One of those who did not receive his documents, William Marbury, took the matter to the Supreme Court. The Court sympathized with Marbury but ruled in 1803 that it could not issue an enforcement order. According to Chief Justice John Marshall and his colleagues, the law that authorized the Court to write such orders actually was unconstitutional and invalid. The decision established the Courts power of judicial review—the power to declare laws unconstitutional and invalid.

Drawing Conclusions What principle did the ruling in Marbury v. Madison establish? With the help of their Native American guide and interpreter, Sacagawea, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark explored the territory acquired by the Louisiana Purchase.
CRITICAL THINKING
Predicting Consequences Why was the Louisiana Purchase a significant event for the young United States?
Westward Expansion
Under Jefferson, the size of the country increased considerably. The Treaty of Paris of 1783 had already established the Mississippi River as the nations western border. After the defeat of Native Americans in the Northwest Territory and the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, more settlers poured into the region. During Washingtons term, Kentucky and Tennessee had become states, and Ohio followed in 1803.
In 1800 Spain had given Louisiana back to France. To finance his plans for European conquest, the French leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, now offered to sell all of the Louisiana Territory, as well as New Orleans, to the United States. Congress overwhelmingly approved the Louisiana Purchase on April 30, 1803. The United States paid $11.25 million and also agreed to take on French debts of about $3.75 million owed to U.S. citizens. With the purchase, the nation had more than doubled its size.
Even before Louisiana became part of the United States, Jefferson had asked Congress to fund a secret expedition into the Louisiana Territory. After receiving approval from Congress, Jefferson chose Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to lead the expedition. During their explorations, they found a path through the Rocky Mountains and eventually reached the
Pacific Ocean.
The War of 1812
In 1809 James Madison succeeded Jefferson as president, and a foreign-relations crisis loomed. The British regularly seized American ships at sea and often practiced impressment, a legalized form of kidnapping that forced people into military service. Britain claimed the right to stop American ships and search for British deserters. On several
26
occasions they impressed American citizens into service as well. Americans in the West also blamed Britain for encouraging attacks by Native Americans along the frontier. President Jefferson had tried economic sanctions against Britain with the Embargo Act of 1807, but the actions mostly hurt the American economy.
Like Jefferson, President Madison first responded with economic measures. After several attempts, the measures finally began to have the desired effect. Unfortunately, word of British cooperation came too late—Congress had already declared war against Britain.
At the beginning of the War of 1812, conquering Canada was the primary objective of the United States. U.S. forces were victorious on Lake Erie and Lake Champlain. The British, however, easily entered Washington, D.C. They dispersed the poorly trained militia defending the capital and set fire to the White House and the Capitol. In Baltimore, however, the city militia inflicted heavy casualties on the British. British forces bombarded Fort McHenry throughout the night of September 13,1814, and then abandoned their attack. The sight of the U.S. flag still flying over the fort at dawn inspired Francis Scott Key to write “The Star-Spangled Banner,” which became the national anthem.
As battles raged, peace talks began in the Belgian city of Ghent. The Treaty of Ghent, signed on December 24, 1814, ended the war and restored prewar boundaries, but did not mention impressment. At about the same time, British and U.S. forces faced each other in New Orleans. Unaware that a treaty had been signed, U.S. general Andrew Jackson led his troops to a decisive victory over the British in the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815. Jackson became a national hero.
The War of 1812 increased the prestige of the United States overseas and generated a new spirit of patriotism and national unity. The American victory also weakened the Federalist Party, which had strongly opposed war with Britain.

HANDBOOK
it Matters Because
The Constitution is the mosf important document of the United States. It serves as the framework of national government and the source of American citizens'basic rights. To preserve self-government, all citizens need to understand their rights and responsibilities.
Major Principles
guiding question Woiv does the Constitution lay the framework for individual rights and a balanced representative government?
The principles outlined in the Constitution were the Framers' solution to the complex problems of a representative government. The Constitution rests on seven major principles of government: (1) popular sovereignty, (2) republicanism, (3) limited government, (4) federalism, (5) separation of powers, (6) checks and balances, and (7) individual rights.

Popular Sovereigntyand Republicanism
The opening words of the Constitution, "We the people," reinforce the idea of popular sovereignty, or “authority of the people." In the Constitution, the people consent to be governed and specify the powers and rules by which they shall be governed.
The Articles of Confederation’s government had few powers, and it was unable to cope with the many challenges facing the nation. The new federal government had greater powers, but it also had specific limitations. A system of interlocking responsibilities kept any one branch of government from becoming too powerful.
Voters are sovereign, that is, they have ultimate authority in a republican system. They elect representatives and give them the responsibility to make laws and run the government. For most Americans today, the terms republic and representative democracy mean the same thing: a system of limited government in which the people are the final source of authority.

Comstock/PunchStock Limited Government
Although the Framers agreed that the nation needed a stronger central authority, they feared misuse of power. They wanted to prevent the government from using its power to give one group special advantages or to deprive another group of its rights. By creating a limited government, they restricted the government’s authority to specific powers granted by the people.
The delegates to the Constitutional Convention were very specific about the powers granted to the new government. Their decision to provide a written outline of the government’s structure also served to show what they intended. Articles I, II and III of the Constitution describe the powers of the federal government and the limits on those powers. Other limits are set forth in the Bill of Rights, which guarantees certain rights to the people.
Federalism
In establishing a strong central government, the Framers did not deprive states of all authority. The states gave up some powers to the national government but retained others. This principle of shared power is called federalism. The federal system allows the people of each state to deal with their needs in their own way, but at the same time, it lets the states act together to deal with matters that affect all Americans.
The Constitution defines three types of government powers. Certain powers belong only to the federal government. These enumerated powers include the power to coin money, regulate interstate and foreign trade, maintain the armed forces, and create federal courts (Article I, Section 8).
The second kind of powers are those retained by the states, known as reserved powers, including the power to establish schools, set marriage and divorce laws, and regulate trade within the state. Although reserved powers are not specifically listed in the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment says that all powers not granted to the federal government “are reserved to the States.”
The third set of powers defined by the Constitution is concurrent powers—powers the state and federal governments share. They include the right to raise taxes, borrow money, provide for public welfare, and administer criminal justice. Conflicts between state law and federal law must be settled in a federal court. The Constitution declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land.”

2	Drawing Conclusions Why is it important that the legislative branch can override a presidential veto?
Separation of Powers
To prevent any single group or institution in government from gaining too much authority, the Framers divided the federal government into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. Each branch has its own functions and powers. The legislative branch, Congress, makes the laws.
The executive branch, headed by the president, carries out the laws. The judicial branch, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts, interprets and applies the laws.
In addition to giving separate responsibility to separate branches, the membership of each branch is chosen in different ways. The president nominates federal judges, and the Senate confirms the appointments.
People vote for members of Congress. Voters cast ballots for president, but the method of election is indirect. On Election Day, the votes in each state are counted. The candidate who receives the majority receives that state’s electoral votes, which total the number of senators and representatives the state has in Congress. Electors from all states meet to formally elect a president. A candidate must win a majority of votes in the Electoral College to win. Checks and Balances
The Framers who wrote the Constitution deliberately created a system of checks and balances in which each branch of government can check, or limit, the power of the other branches. This system helps balance the power of the three branches and prevents any one branch from becoming too powerful. For example, imagine that Congress passes a law. The president can reject the law by vetoing it. Congress, however, can override, or reverse, the president’s veto if two-thirds of the members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives vote again to approve the law.

Individual Rights
In 1791 the states ratified 10 amendments to the Constitution to protect certain basic rights, including freedom of speech, religion, and the right to a trial by jury. Congress approved these 10 amendments and referred to them as the Bill of Rights. Over the years, 17 more amendments have been added to the Constitution. Some give additional rights to American citizens and some modify how the government works. Included among them are amendments that abolish slavery, guarantee voting rights, authorize an income tax, and set a two-term limit on the presidency.

guiding question Howis the legislative branch organized, and what are its functions?
The legislative branch includes the two houses of Congress: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Congress has two primary roles: to make the nations laws and to decide how to spend federal funds.
The government cannot spend any money unless Congress appropriates, or sets aside, funds. All tax and spending bills must originate in the House of Representatives and be approved in both the House and the Senate before moving to the president to be signed.
Congress also monitors the executive branch and investigates possible abuses of power. The House of Representatives can impeach, or bring formal charges against, any federal official it suspects of wrongdoing or misconduct. If an official is impeached, the Senate acts as a court and tries the accused official. Officials who are found guilty may be removed from office.
The Senate has certain additional powers. Two-thirds of the Senate must ratify treaties made by the president. The Senate must also confirm presidential appointments of federal officials such as department heads, ambassadors, and federal judges.
All members of Congress have the responsibility to represent their constituents, the people of their home states and districts. As a constituent, you can expect your senators and representative to promote national and state interests. Congress members introduce thousands of bills—proposed laws—every year. Because individual members of Congress cannot possibly study all these bills carefully, both houses form committees of selected members to evaluate proposed legislation.
Standing committees are permanent committees in both the House and the Senate that specialize in a particular topic, such as agriculture, commerce, or veterans’ affairs. These committees are usually divided into subcommittees that focus on a particular aspect of an issue. The House and the Senate also form temporary select committees to deal with issues requiring special attention. These committees meet only until they complete their task.
Occasionally the House and the Senate form joint committees with members from both houses. These

committees meet to consider specific issues. One type of joint committee, a conference committee, has a special function. If the House and the Senate pass different versions of the same bill, a conference committee meets to work out a compromise bill acceptable to both houses.
Once a committee in either house of Congress approves a bill, it is sent to the full Senate or House for debate. After debate the bill may be passed, rejected, or returned to the committee for further changes. When both houses pass a bill, it goes to the president. If the president approves the bill and signs it, the bill becomes law. If the president vetoes the bill, it does not become law unless Congress takes it up again and votes to override the veto.

The President's Roles
The president plays a number of different roles in government. These roles include serving as the nation’s chief executive, chief diplomat, commander in chief of the military, chief of state, and legislative leader.
Chief Executive As chief executive, the president is responsible for carrying out the nations laws.
Chief Diplomat As chief diplomat, the president directs foreign policy, appoints ambassadors, and negotiates treaties with other nations.
Commander in Chief As commander in chief of the armed forces, the president can give orders to the military and direct its operations. The president cannot declare war; only Congress holds this power. The president can send troops to other parts of the world for up to 60 days but must notify Congress when doing so. The troops may remain longer only if Congress gives its approval or declares war.
Chief of State As chief of state, the president is symbolically the
representative of all Americans. The president fulfills this role when receiving foreign ambassadors or heads of state, visiting foreign nations, or honoring Americans.
Legislative Leader The president serves as a legislative leader by proposing laws to Congress and working to see that they are passed. In the annual State of the Union address to the American people, the president presents his goals for legislation in the upcoming year.
The Executive at Work
Many executive offices, departments, and independent agencies help the president carry out and enforce the nation’s laws. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) is made up of individuals and agencies that directly assist the president. Presidents rely on the EOP for advice and for gathering information needed for decision making.
The executive branch has 15 executive departments, each responsible for a different area of government. For example, the Department of State carries out foreign policy, and the Department of the Treasury manages the nation’s finances. The department heads have the title of secretary, and are members of the president’s cabinet. The cabinet helps the president set policies and make decisions.
President Barack Obama signs a bill into law. As chief executive, the president is responsible for carrying out the laws of the nation.

Alex Wong/Getty Images News/Getty Images The Qualities of an Effective Leader
The multiple roles imposed on the president makes his ability to lead the nation very challenging. Throughout American history various presidents have been both praised and criticized for their leadership. Being an effective leader in a federal constitutional republic requires a number of important qualities.
As chief of state and chief diplomat, the president represents the nation to the American people and to the world. To be effective, a president must demonstrate principles and conviction, yet be optimistic and friendly, open to others, and able to communicate clearly and effectively. Great leaders can inspire their people to greatness with their words, their confidence, and their determination.
As a legislative leader, the president must be able to compromise, to understand different points of view and to work with many different personalities in Congress while at the same time understanding clearly what principles and goals should be upheld. A president that bows to political pressures too often will be seen as weak or vacillating, but a president who
The Constitution Handbook :
refuses to negotiate and compromise with Congress will be seen as stubborn, aloof, or ineffective.
As commander-in-chief, the president has to be decisive and willing to make difficult decisions. At the same time, presidents must be willing to listen to advice and the expertise of those serving under them. The president is the final decision maker when the nation is at war, and his or her decisions can impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people. A president who refuses to act when necessary will be seen as timid and indecisive, which can embolden the nations enemies.

But if the president moves too quickly, it will be seen as reckless or dangerous.
As the head of an enormous and complex bureaucracy, the president must resist the temptation to go into too much detail on every little issue. There is not enough time to do so. Instead, an effective chief executive must have the ability to choose good people that can be trusted to implement the president s goals within the executive departments. The president must support the team he or she has chosen and be loyal to them. An effective president will set high expectations, clear goals, and will lead by example.
At the same time, presidents have to hold their people and themselves accountable for any failures, and be willing to learn from mistakes.
As the chief executive responsible for carrying out the nation’s laws and upholding the Constitution, the president, above all, needs integrity. Presidents have to implement laws they disagree with; they cannot allow personal feelings to interfere with their decisions or distort their judgment. They cannot give in to corruption and use their office for personal gain. Nor should they make decisions purely on the basis of what will get them reelected. The president, as the leader of a democratic republic, should listen

to the people. But presidents must also reconcile competing demands and goals, and lead the nation in a way that upholds the Constitution and the nation’s founding ideals and principles.

Explaining What functions does the president fulfill as Legislative Leader?
The Judicial Branch
guiding question Howdoes the judicial branch function to review and evaluate laws and interpret the Constitution?
Article III of the Constitution calls for the creation of a Supreme Court and “such inferior [lower] courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.” The federal courts of the judicial branch review and evaluate laws and interpret the Constitution in making their decisions.
District and Appellate Courts
United States district courts are the lowest level of the federal court system. These courts consider criminal and civil cases that come under federal authority, such as kidnapping, federal tax evasion, claims against the federal government, and cases involving constitutional rights, such as free speech. There are 94 district courts, with at least one in every state.
The appellate courts, or courts of appeal, consider district court decisions in which the losing side has asked for a review of the verdict. If an appeals court disagrees with the lower court’s decision, it can overturn the verdict or order a retrial. There are 14 appeals courts: one for each of 12 federal districts, one military appeals court, and an appellate court for the federal circuit.
The Supreme Court
The Supreme Court is the final authority in the federal court system. It consists of a chief justice and eight associate justices. Most of the Court’s cases come from appeals of lower court decisions. Only cases involving
foreign diplomats
or disputes between states can begin in the Supreme Court.
Supreme Court Independence The president appoints the Court’s justices for life, and the Senate confirms the appointments. The public has no input. The Framers hoped that by appointing judges, they would be free to evaluate the law with no concern for pleasing voters.
Judicial Review The role of the judicial branch is not described in detail in the Constitution, but the role of the courts has grown as powers implied in the Constitution have been put into practice. In 1803 Chief Justice John Marshall expanded the power of the Supreme Court by striking down an act of Congress in the case of Marbury v. Madison.
Although not mentioned in the Constitution, judicial review has become a major power of the judicial branch. Judicial review gives the Supreme Court the ultimate authority to interpret the meaning of the Constitution.

Rights and Responsibilities
guiding question What are the protections and freedoms the Constitution and the Bill of Rights provide Americans?
All citizens of the United States have certain basic rights, but they also have specific responsibilities. Living in a system of self-government means ultimately that every citizen is partly responsible for how society is governed and for the actions the government takes on his or her behalf.
The Rights of Americans
The rights of Americans fall into three broad categories: to be protected from unfair actions of the government, to receive equal treatment under the law, and to retain certain basic freedoms.
Protection From Unfair Actions Parts of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights protect all Americans from unfair treatment by the government or the law. Among these rights are the right to a lawyer when accused of a crime and the right to a trial by jury when charged with a crime. In addition, the Fourth Amendment protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures. This provision requires police to have a court order before searching a person’s home for criminal evidence. To obtain this, the police must have a very strong reason to suspect someone of a crime.
Equal Treatment All Americans, regardless of race, religion, or political beliefs, have the right to be treated the same under the law. The Fifth Amendment states that no person shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Due process means that the government must follow procedures established by law and guaranteed by the Constitution, treating all people equally. The Fourteenth Amendment requires every state to grant its citizens “equal protection of the laws.”
Basic Freedoms The First Amendment describes our basic freedoms—freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and the right to petition. In a democracy, power rests in the hands of the people. Therefore, citizens in a democratic society must be able to exchange ideas freely. The First Amendment allows citizens to criticize the government, in speech or in the press, without fear of punishment.
In addition, the Ninth Amendment states that the rights of Americans are not limited to those in the Constitution. Over the years, this has allowed Americans to assert other basic rights that have been upheld in court or assured by amending the Constitution.
Limits on Rights The rights of Americans are not absolute.
They are limited based on the principle of respecting everyone's rights equally. For example, many cities and towns require groups to obtain a permit to march on city streets. Such laws do limit free speech, but they also protect the community by ensuring that the march will not endanger other people.
In this and other cases, the government balances an individuals rights, the rights of others, and the community's health and safety. Most Americans are willing to accept some limitations on their rights to gain these protections as long as the restrictions are reasonable and apply equally to all. A law banning all marches would violate the First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly and be unacceptable. Similarly, a law preventing only certain groups from marching would be unfair because it would not apply equally to everyone.

Citizens' Responsibilities
Citizens in a democratic society have both duties and responsibilities.
Duties are actions required by law. Responsibilities are voluntary actions. Fulfilling duties and responsibilities ensures good government and protects rights.
Duties One basic duty of all Americans is to obey the law. Laws serve three important functions. They help maintain order; they protect the health, safety, and property of all citizens; and they make it possible for people to live together peacefully. If you believe a law is wrong, you can work through your representatives to change it.
Americans also have a duty to pay taxes. The government, uses tax money to defend the nation, to build roads and bridges, and to assist people in need. Americans often benefit from services provided by the government. Another duty of citizens is to defend the nation. All males aged 18 and older must register with the government in case the nation needs to call on them for military service. Military service is not automatic, but a war could make it necessary.
The Constitution guarantees all Americans the right to a trial by a jury of their equals. For this reason, you may be called to jury duty when you reach the age of 18. Having a large group of jurors on hand is necessary to guarantee the right to a fair and speedy trial. You also have a duty to serve as a trial witness if called to do so.
Most states require you to attend school until a certain age. School is where you gain the knowledge and skills needed to be a good citizen. In
The Constitution H(^nc^i^(^iok ■
responsive
take action
school you learn to think more clearly, to express your opinions more accurately, and to analyze the ideas of others. These skills will help you make informed choices when you vote.
Responsibilities The responsibilities of citizens are not as clear-cut as their duties, but they are as important because they help maintain the quality of government and society. One important responsibility is to be well informed. Knowing what your government is doing and expressing your
open and quick to thoughts about its actions helps to keep it responsive to the wishes of the people. You also need to be informed about your rights and to assert them when necessary. Knowing your rights helps preserve them. Other responsibilities include accepting responsibility for your actions and supporting your family.
To enjoy your rights to the fullest, you must be prepared to respect the rights of others. Respecting the rights of others also means respecting the rights of people with whom you disagree. Respecting and accepting others regardless of race, religion, beliefs, or other differences is essential in a democracy.
Vote, Vote, Vote! Perhaps the most important civic responsibility of American citizens is to vote when they reach the age of 18. Voting allows you to participate in the democratic process and to guide its direction.
When you vote for people to represent you in government, you will be exercising your right of self-government. If you disapprove of the job your representatives are doing, it will be your responsibility to help elect other people in the next election.
In addition to voting, there are other ways you can participate in the democratic process. You can let your representatives know what you think about issues through email, letters, telephone calls, petitions, and by taking part in public meetings or political rallies. You can join a political party and help campaign for a candidate that you support. Political parties are always looking for volunteers to help. In addition, membership in a party will let you play a role in choosing who runs as candidates for election. And the time may come when you too may want to participate by running for office.
Participating in the democratic process reflects our patriotism. We live in a constitutional democratic republic. The national ethos, the beliefs and ideas Americans all share as a community, includes the belief that the best and most effective government is government of, for, and by the people. The only way to live up to those beliefs is to embrace them by participating in the democratic process.
The Constitution’s preamble states that the goal of the people of the United States is “to form a more perfect union.” Because the United States is a government of the people and a democratic republic, it becomes “more perfect” and moves closer to its goals when all of its people, in all of their variation and diversity, participate. If someone does not participate, the union does not have their input and is less likely to reflect a balance of all of the needs, concerns, and goals of the people. This make it harder to achieve justice, peace, security, liberty or to promote the general welfare.
If we truly love the country then we want it to succeed, and if there are aspects to it that you do not like, the best way to change them is by getting involved in politics and working to bring about the changes you think are needed. Patriotism is not standing by while others act; patriots act so as to help make their country better.
The United States is made up of people who have come from all over the world, sometimes to escape violence or poverty or oppression, and sometimes seeking employment, education, and more opportunity.

Whatever their reasons, each immigrant who becomes a citizen promises in their oath of allegiance that “I support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same . . .” As citizens of a self-governing democratic republic, all American citizens share a common bond in that they stand for certain self evident truths: “that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”

Understanding Symbols and Mottos
guiding question Howdo thesymbols and mottos of the United States help to define American society?
All nations make use of symbols. A symbol is something that stands for something else. It is a short-hand way of remembering all the qualities and ideas embodied in something. Nations use symbols to remind people what the nation represents. They are also a statement of sovereignty. When a nation’s flag is flown over something, it is saying that it belongs to the nation. Similarly, when a national seal is put on a document, it is saying that the document is an official statement of the nation. Symbols remind people of their nation’s history, values, and goals. They evoke patriotism and pride. Perhaps most important, they remind people that, despite their differences, they are all united in one national community.
The American Flag
The best known and most visible symbol of the United States is the flag, sometimes nicknamed the Stars and Stripes, the Star-Spangled Banner, the Red, White and Blue, or Old Glory. The Continental Congress approved the design of the flag in June 1777. The 13 alternating stripes on the flag represent the original 13 colonies that founded the United States. Each star in the blue field represents one state.
The stars were a metaphor for the new nation. Stars in the night sky are grouped into constellations, or patterns. The stars on the flag represent that the United States is a new constellation, a new arrangement in the world.
The colors used on the flag have been said to have at least two meanings. They are the same colors as used on the British flag, and so remind the United States of its origins as British colonies. They are also the same colors used on the Great Seal of the United States, which was designed before the flag and have specific meanings. Red for strength and courage, white for purity and innocence, and blue for perseverance, vigilance, and justice.
E
Pluribus Unum On July 4, 1776, nearly a year before the Continental Congress decided on the design for a flag, it began work on the Great Seal of the United States. A seal is a type of signature. Most nations have an official symbol that they use to “seal,” or sign official documents, and treaties with other nations. Seals date to the days when letters and documents would be signed and sealed by melting wax onto them and then pressing a symbol into the wax “sealing” the envelope closed. They are also commonly put on coins and currency to show that the money has been officially issued by a particular country.
The Great Seal has two sides. On the one side is an eagle holding a banner with the Latin motto “E Pluribus Unum,” which means “Out of
The Constitution Handbook 3
Many, One.” This vmotto refers to the creation of a nation from 13 separate colonies. Today, it also is used to describe the United States as a country of many peoples from many different cultures, races, and backgrounds united into one nation. The motto was never made the official motto of the United States, but it has been used on American coins since the late 1700s.
On the same side of the seal, the eagle also clutches an olive branch with 13 leaves in one claw and 13 arrows in the other claw, symbolizing the nations power in war and peace. The Eagle also carries a shield with red and white stripes and a blue field. Thirteen stars, symbolizing the original 13 colonies fly above the eagle.
On the opposite side of the seal are symbols that often puzzle people. There is an unfinished pyramid with 13 levels and the date 1776 in Roman numerals at it base. It represents the 13 colonies and the idea that the United States is a work in progress and not yet finished. A pyramid was chosen because it represents strength and duration, like the pyramids of Egypt that have lasted for thousands of years. Hovering over the pyramid is an eye in a triangle. The triangle looks like the capstone, or top of the pyramid and the eye is intended to represent God watching over the nation. Above the eye are the Latin words “Annuit Coeptis”, which means “He approves the undertaking,” indicating God approves of the new nation. Below the pyramid are the Latin words “Novus Ordo Seclorum” meaning “new order of the ages” referring to the idea that the United States as a democratic republic, was a new way of organizing society in the world.
Star Spangled Banner
The Star Spangled Banner is the national anthem of the United States. Its lyrics were first written down as a poem in 1814 by Francis Scott Key after he watched the British attack Fort McHenry during the War of 1812. The poem describes Key watching anxiously in the early morning dawn to see if
The American flag is one of the most easily recognizable symbols of the United States.

the flag is again raised over the “the land of the free and home of the brave” The song became popular in the 1800s, and was played regularly on July 4th. In 1889, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Tracy ordered that it be played whenever the Navy raised the American flag, but the song was not made the official national anthem of the United States until 1931.
In God WeTrust
The official motto of the United States is “In God We Trust.” The origins of the phrase probably dates to the national anthem. In the fourth verse of the Star Spangled Banner is the phrase: “And this be our motto: “In God is our Trust.” But the motto was not approved by Congress at the time and for much of its history, the United States did not have an official motto.
The phrase was used as a battle cry by some units in the Union army, and in the late 1800s, after the Civil War, Congress approved the phrase “In God We Trust” for use on American coins. Since 1938, all United States coins have had this phrase inscribed on them. In 1956,
with the United States in the midst of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, Congress declared the national motto to be “In God We Trust.”
The motto was meant to assert the general American belief in God, and to contrast it with the communist belief in atheism. In 1957, the phrase began to be used on American paper currency as well.
In recent years, the motto has become controversial, with some people arguing that it violates the First Amendments ban on government establishing a religion. Lower courts, as well as the Supreme Court, have repeatedly ruled that the motto, and its use on coins and currency, is not a violation of the First Amendment because it serves a ceremonial, not a religious purpose, and does not constitute the creation of a state church.

Voting Procedure Originally, senators were chosen by the legislators of their own states. The Seventeenth Amendment changed this, so that senators are now elected by their state's people. There are 100 senators, 2 from each state.
What Might Have Been
Electing Senators South Carolina delegate Charles Pinckney suggested during the Convention that the members of the Senate come from four equally proportioned districts within the United States and that the legislature elect the executive every seven years.

Section 3 .The Sena
Trial of Impeachments One of
Congress's powers is the power to impeach—to accuse government officials of wrongdoing, put them on trial, and, if necessary, remove them from office. The House decides if the offense is impeachable. The Senate acts as a jury, and when the president is impeached, the Chief Justice of the United States serves as the judge.
A two-thirds vote of the members present is needed to convict impeached officials. What punishment can the Senate give if an impeached official is convicted?

The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.
[3.] No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.
[4.] The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.
[5.] The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of the President of the United States.
[6.] The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all
Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.
[7.J Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.

Pay and Privileges To strengthen the federal government, the Founders set congressional salaries to be paid by the United States Treasury rather than by members' respective states. Originally, members were paid $6 per day. In 2011, all members of Congress received a base salary of $174,000.

Section 8. Powe
ed to Congress

Elastic Clause The final enumerated power is often called the "elastic clause This clause gives Congress the right to make all laws "necessary and proper" to carry out the powers expressed in the other clauses of Article I. It is called the elastic clause because it lets Congress "stretch" its powers to meet situations the Founders could never have anticipated.
Almost from the beginning, this phrase was a subject of dispute. The issue was whether a strict or a broad interpretation of the Constitution should be applied. The dispute was first addressed in 1819, in the case of McCulloch v. Maryland, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a broac interpretation. The Court stated that the elastic clause allowed Congress to use its powers in any way that was not specifically prohibited by the Constitution. What does the phrase "necessary and proper" in the elastic clause mean?

Original Rights A writ of habeas corpus issued by a judge requires a law official to bring a prisoner to
j court and show cause for holding the i prisoner. A bill of attainder is a bill | that punishes a person without a jury
trial. An "ex post facto" law is one that makes an act a crime after the act has
I been committed. What does the j Constitution say about bills j of attainder?

Article II.
The Executive Branch
Article II creates an executive branch to carry out laws passed by Congress. Article II lists the powers and duties of the president, describes qualifications for office and procedures for electing the president, and provides for a vice president.
Term of Office Alexander Hamilton also provided his own governmental outline at the Constitutional Convention. Some of its most distinctive elements were that both the executive and the members of the Senate were "elected to serve during good behaviour," meaning there was no specified limit on their time in office.
Former Method of Election In the
election of 1800, the top two candidates received the same number of electoral votes, making it necessary for the House of Representatives to decide the election. To eliminate this problem, the Twelfth Amendment, added in 1804, changed the method of electing the president stated in Article II, Section 3. The Twelfth Amendment requires that the electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president.
Section 10
[1.] No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or
Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.

[3.] No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.
Article II
Section 1
[1.] The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows.
[2.] Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.
[3.] The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if no person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House

But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President.
[4.] The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.
[5.] No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.
[6.] In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.
[7.] The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.

Only Congress can make laws under the Constitution, but executive orders are considered part of the president's duty to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed."This power is often used during emergencies. Over time, the scope of executive orders has expanded. Decisions by federal agencies and departments are also considered to be executive orders.

Reasons for Removal From Office This section states the reasons for which the president and vice president may be impeached and removed from office. Only Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton have been impeached by the House. Richard Nixon resigned before the House could vote on possible impeachment.
Article III.
The Judicial Branch
The term judicial refers to courts. The Constitution set up only the Supreme Court but provided for the establishment of other federal courts. The judiciary of the United States has two different systems of courts. One system consists of the federal courts, whose powers derive from the Constitution and federal laws. The other includes the courts of each of the 50 states, whose powers derive from state constitutions and laws.

Section 3. New States and Territories
New States Congress has the power to admit new states. It also determines the basic guidelines for applying for statehood. Two states, Maine and West Virginia, were created within the boundaries of another state. In the case of West Virginia, President Lincoln recognized the West Virginia government as the legal government of Virginia during the Civil War. This allowed West Virginia to secede from Virginia without obtaining approval from the Virginia legislature.

The Amendments
This part ofthe Constitution consists of changes and additions.The Constitution has been amended 27 times throughout the nation's history.
The Constitution 53
The Bill of Rights
The first 10 amendments are known as the Bill of Rights (1791). These amendments limit the powers of the federal government. The First Amendment protects the civil liberties of individuals in the United States. Yet, the amendment's freedoms are not absolute. They are limited by the rights of other individuals. What freedoms does the First Amendment protect?

Amendment 5
Rights of the Accused This amendment contains protections for people accused of crimes. One ofthe protections is that government may not deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. This means that the government must follow proper constitutional procedures in trials and in other actions it takes against individuals. According to Amendment V, what is the function of a grand jury?

Amendment 6
Right to Speedy and Fair Trial
A basic protection is the right to a speedy, public trial. The jury must hear witnesses and evidence on both sides before deciding the guilt or innocence of a person charged with a crime. This amendment also provides that legal counsel must be provided to a defendant. In 1963, in Gideon v. Wainwright, the Supreme Court ruled that if a defendant cannot afford a lawyer, the government must provide one to defend him or her. Why is the right to a "speedy" trial important?

The people of the United States established a constitution and survived a second war with Britain. In antebellum America—the period before the Civil War—Americans faced a new question: Could they work together to create a strong and prosperous nation?
The Nation Matures
guidingquestion How did the United States develop politically and economically in the early 1800s?
I
After the War of 1812, the United States entered an "Era of Good Feelings.” A sense of nationalism swept the country. Riding this wave of nationalism was Democratic-Republican James Monroe, the nation’s fifth president. The Missouri Compromise
The Era of Good Feelings could not ward off the nation’s growing sectional disputes. Missouri’s application for statehood as a slave
\ state stirred up the divisive issue of whether slavery should expand \ westward. In 1819 the Union consisted of 11 free and 11 slave states.
Admitting any new state would upset the balance in the Senate and touch off a bitter struggle over political power. Many Northerners opposed extending slavery into the West, believing it to be morally wrong. The South feared that if slavery could not expand, then new free states would give the North enough votes in the Senate to outlaw slaveholding.
A solution emerged when Maine, which for decades had been part of Massachusetts, requested admission to the Union as a separate state. Th Senate voted to admit Maine as a free state and Missouri as a slave
state. This solution to the controversy kept the balance in the Senati Senator Jesse Thomas of Illinois then proposed an amendment that would prohibit slavery in the Louisiana Purchase territory north of Missouri s southern border. Slavery could expand into Arkansas Territo south of Missouri, but not in the rest of the Louisiana Purchase.
62
By a very close vote, carefully managed by Henry Clay of Kentucky, the House of Representatives voted to accept the Missouri Compromise. However, this merely postponed a debate over the future of slavery.
American Nationalism
Following the War of 1812, the Federalist Party rapidly lost political influence. Partisan infighting had largely ended because only one major political party—the Democratic-Republicans—remained. As Monroe’s presidency began, focus shifted from world affairs to national growth.
In 1823—while many of Spain’s colonies were fighting for independence— President Monroe proclaimed what became known as the Monroe Doctrine. It declared the United States’s opposition to European interference in the Americas.
The charter of the First Bank of the United States had expired in 1811.
In 1816 Representative John C. Calhoun of South Carolina introduced a bill proposing the Second Bank of the United States. The bill passed, giving the bank power to issue national currency and to control state banks.
Inexpensive British goods threatened to put American manufacturers out of business. Congress responded with the Tariff of 1816. Unlike earlier revenue tariffs, which provided income for the federal government, this tariff was a protective tariff that worked to raise the prices of imports.
Under Chief Justice John Marshall, the Supreme Court issued decisions that helped strengthen the national government. Between 1816 and 1824, Marshall interpreted the Constitution broadly to support federal power.
In the 1819 case McCulloch v. Maryland, the Court decided that Congress had the authority to establish the Second Bank of the United States. It ruled that the federal government could use any method that was necessary and proper for carrying out its powers as long as the method was not expressly forbidden by the Constitution. The ruling meant that a state could not interfere with a federal agency working within that state’s borders.
Industrialization and the Transportation Revolution
The Industrial Revolution, which had begun in Europe, spread to the United States during this time. Businesses began large-scale manufacturing using complex machines and organized workforces in factories. As transportation expanded, manufacturers sold their wares nationwide or abroad instead of just locally.
In 1806 Congress funded a major east-west highway called the National Road. Private businesses and state and local governments also built roads and canals. The invention of the steamboat transformed river transportation.
By 1835, more than 700 steamboats, called riverboats, traveled on the nation’s waterways. Railroads also appeared in the early 1800s. Industrialist Peter Cooper built the Tom Thumb, a tiny but powerful locomotive. The new trains helped settle the West and expand trade across the country.

predominantly most frequent or common
Not all Americans welcomed the new immigrants. In the 1800s, many Americans were anti-Catholic, and the arrival of predominantly Catholic
Irish and German immigrants led to the rise of nativist groups and , push for laws banning immigrants from holding public office. In 1854 delegates from some of these groups formed the American Party, which came to be called the Know-Nothings.
Owners ofthe early factory mills expressed a paternalistic concern for their workers. The relationship between management and labor, however, became more strained whenever prices slumped and wages dropped. By 1860, factory workers numbered roughly 1.3 million. Men, women, and children alike typically toiled for 12 or more hours a day. Hoping to gain higher wages or shorter workdays, some workers began to organize in labor unions. During the late 1820s and early 1830s, about 300,000 men and women belonged to some form of union. Most employers refused to bargain with them, and the courts often saw them as unlawful conspiracies that limited free enterprise.
Despite the trend toward urban and industrial growth, agriculture remained the country’s leading economic activity. Until the late 1800s, farming employed more people and produced more wealth than any other kind of work. Northern farmers produced enough to sell their surplus in the growing Eastern cities and towns. As one Ohio newspaper reporter wrote in 1851: “As far as the eye can stretch in the distance nothing but corn and wheat fields are to be seen; and on some points in the Scioto Valley as high as a thousand acres of corn may be seen in adjoining fields, belonging to some eight or ten different proprietors.”

The Land of Cotton
g u i d i n g q u e st i o n How did the emergence of "King Cotton " affect the South and its inhabitants?
In 1793 Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, a device that removed the seeds from cotton.
CRITICAL THINKING
Making Inferences How did the cotton gin affect cotton production? Farming was even more important in the South, which lagged behind the North in industrialization. The South had few big cities and less industry. Compared with the many textile mills and factories in the North, the South had only scattered iron works, textile mills, and coal, iron, salt, and copper mines. Together, these accounted for only 16 percent of the nation’s total manufacturing. The South thrived on the production of several major cash crops, including cotton, tobacco, rice, and sugarcane. No crop would play a greater role in the Souths fortunes during this period than cotton. At first, however, profits from cotton were small, owing to the great amount o( labor needed to produce it.
Cotton Becomes King
Removing cotton seeds by hand from the fluffy bolls, or cotton pods, was so tedious that it took a worker an entire day to separate a pound of cotton lint. In 1793 Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin— gin being short for engine—a machine that quickly removed cotton seeds from the bolls. Cotton production soared, and by 1860, Southern cotton accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total export trade ofthe United States. Southerners began saying, rightly, “Cotton is King.”
Cotton was grown in a wide belt stretching from inland South aro ma west into Texas. The spread of cotton plantations boosted th< ou ern economy, and this greatly increased the demand for enslavec a or. ongress had outlawed the foreign slave trade in 1808.

2 Drawing Conclusions Why did cotton occupy such a large percentage of slave labor?
However, a high birthrate among enslaved women—encouraged by slaveholders—kept the population growing.
Slavery
The overwhelming majority of enslaved African Americans toiled in the fields on small farms. Some became house servants, while others worked in trades. All enslaved persons suffered indignities. State slave codes forbade enslaved men and women from owning property, leaving a slaveholder’s premises without permission, or testifying in court against a white person. Laws even banned them from learning to read and write.
Many enslaved men and women found ways to actively resist the dreadful lifestyle forced on them. Some quietly staged work slowdowns. Others broke tools or set fire to houses and barns. Still others risked beatings or mutilations by running away. Some enslaved persons turned to violence, killing their owners or plotting revolts.
Free African Americans occupied an ambiguous position in Southern society. In cities like Charleston and New Orleans, some were successful enough to become slaveholders themselves. Almost 200,000 free African Americans lived in the North, where slavery had been outlawed, but they still faced discrimination. Nonetheless, free African Americans in the North could organize their own churches and voluntary associations. They also were able to earn money from the jobs they held.

The Age of Jackson
guiding question How wouldyou evaluate the "Age of Jackson"?
Andrew Jackson was elected president in the election of 1828, supported by rural and small-town voters. As president, Jackson actively tried to make the government more inclusive. He wanted ordinary citizens to play a role in government, and he supported the spoils system—the practice of giving people government jobs on the basis of party loyalty. Jackson had not been in office long before he had to focus on a national crisis that highlighted the growing rift between the North and the South.
South Carolina bought many needed goods from England and as a result, had to pay the high tariffs levied on those goods. When another tariff law was passed in 1832, South Carolina adopted an ordinance of nullification declaring
spoils system the practice of handing out government jobs to supporters of the winning candidate

In Andrew Jackson's Inaugural Address, he declared his intention to move all Native Americans to the Great Plains.

Name two Native American groups in the northern half of the United States that were forced to relocate, the tariffs to be unconstitutional. Jackson regarded nullification as treason and sent a warship to Charleston. When Congress passed a bill that lowered tariffs gradually, South Carolina repealed its nullification of the tariff law.
Along with the nullification crisis, Jackson dismantled the Second Bank of the United States. Like most Westerners, and many working people in the East, he regarded the Bank as a monopoly that benefited the wealthy elite. He vetoed a bill that would have extended its charter and then withdrew all the government’s deposits, severely weakening the bank.
In his Inaugural Address, Jackson had declared his intention to move all Native Americans to the Great Plains. In 1830 Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act. The Cherokee in Georgia appealed to the Supreme Court, hoping to gain legal recognition of their territorial rights. Chief Justice Marshall supported this right in two decisions, both of which Jackson refused to carry out. In 1838 Martin Van Buren, Jacksons successor, sent in the army to forcibly move the Cherokee. Roughly 2,000 Cherokee died in camps while waiting for the westward march. On the journey, which became known as the Trail of Tears, about 2,000 others died of starvation, disease, and exposure.

Reforming Society guiding question M/to common characteristics did reform movements of this era share?
temperance moderation in or abstinence from consuming alcohol
During the mid-1800s, a number of reformers argued that no social vice caused more crime, poverty, or family hardship than the excessive consumption of alcohol. They advocated temperance, or moderation in the consumption of alcohol. Temperance groups formed across the country, preaching the evils of alcohol and urging people to give up liquor. In 1833 a number of groups formed a national organization, the American Temperance Union. In 1851 Maine passed the first state prohibition law, an example 12 other states followed by 1855. Other states passed “local option” laws, which allowed towns and villages to ban liquor sales.
66
Prisons, Asylums, and School Reform
Some reformers focused on providing better facilities for prisoners and the insane. Many states replaced their overcrowded prisons with penitentiaries so prisoners would be rehabilitated, and by the beginning of the Civil War, most states had established public mental institutions to keep the mentally ill out of the prison system.
Many reformers sought to establish a system of public education. They focused on establishing elementary schools to teach all children the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and to instill a work ethic.
Women's Rights
By the mid-1800s, the development of factories separated the home from the workplace. Men often left home to go to work, while women tended the home. As the reform movements of the 1830s grew, some women set out to create more educational opportunities and began promoting new ideas about their role in society. In 1848 activists Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton organized the Seneca Falls Convention in New York. The convention issued the Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions, better known as the Seneca Falls Declaration. It began with words expanding on the Declaration of Independence: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal. . . .” Stanton proposed that they focus on suffrage, or the right to vote, and the convention narrowly passed her proposal. Abolitionism
Of all the reform movements that began in the early 1800s, the most divisive was the one calling for abolition, or the immediate end to slavery. It polarized the nation and helped bring about the Civil War. Many of the nation’s founders knew that the United States would have difficulty remaining true to its ideals of liberty and equality if it did not emancipate, or free, all enslaved people. Some religious groups argued that slavery was a sin.
Free African Americans took a prominent role in the movement. One of the most famous was Frederick Douglass, who had escaped from slavery in Maryland. Another key abolitionist was Sojourner Truth. She gained her freedom in 1827 when New York freed all enslaved persons in the state. Her eloquent and deeply religious antislavery speeches attracted huge crowds. a READING PROGRESS CHECK

Tocqueville’s
Democracy in America
In 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville, o French lawyer, was commissioned by the French government to study American prisons. While in America, Tocqueville traveled to the Michigan frontier and as far south as New Orleans, but spent most of his time in New England. He became convinced that there was something exceptional about American society. Between 1835 and 1839, he published a two volume book, Democracy in America. The book is regarded as one of the great works of political thought because of its discussions of liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, populism, and laissez-faire economics. Tocqueville argued that these five attributes made America exceptional in the world. America’s social and economic equality enabled the United States to have a remarkable amount of political liberty.
Tocqueville believed the political liberty found on the American frontier helped keep people equal and led to individualism and free economic exchange, both of which benefited America because they were constrained by democratic institutions.
DEMOCRACY AND EQUALITY
Among the novel objects that attracted my attention during my stay in the United States, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of condition among the people. I readily discovered the prodigious influence that this primary fact exercises on the whole course of society; it gives a peculiar direction to public opinion and a peculiar tenor to the laws; it imparts new maxims to the governing authorities and peculiar habits to the governed.
I soon perceived that the influence of this fact extends far beyond the political character and the laws of the country, and that it has no less effect on civil society than on the government; it creates opinions, gives birth to

The emigrants who colonized the shores of America in the beginning of the seventeenth century somehow separated the democratic principle from all the principles that it had to contend with in the old communities of Europe, and transplanted it alone to the New World. It has there been able to spread in perfect freedom and peaceably....
EQUALITY AND THE FRONTIER
Tocqueville believed social equality in the United States prevented the growth of an aristocracy and ensured popular democracy. In the excerpt below, he outlines how this equality combined with the open American frontier made the United States unique among nations and led to the development of capitalism.
The social condition of the Americans is eminently democratic; this was its character at the foundation of the Colonies, and is still more strongly marked at the present day. I have stated ... that great equality existed among the emigrants who settled on the shores of New England. The germ of aristocracy was never planted in that part of the Union.
I do not mean that there is any deficiency of wealthy individuals in the United States; I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money has taken stronger hold on the affections of
68

men, and where the profounder contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of property. But wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and experience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations in the full enjoyment of it.
This picture ... still gives a very imperfect idea of what is taking place in the new States of the West and South-west. At the end of the last century a few bold adventurers began to penetrate into the valleys of the Mississippi, and the mass of the population very soon began to move in that direction: communities unheard of till then were seen to emerge from the wilds.... and in the Western settlements we may behold democracy arrived at its utmost extreme....
PUBLIC GOOD FROM INDIVIDUALISM
Individualism was a new concept in the 1800s and Tocqueville worried that it would cause people to pursue their self-interest at the expense of others. Tocqueville believed Americans had found ways to combine individual economic activity with democratic institutions so as to benefit rich and poor.
Individualism is a novel expression, to which a novel idea has given birth. Our fathers were only acquainted with egotism. Egotism is a passionate and exaggerated love of self.... Individualism is a mature and calm feeling,
which disposes each member of the community to sever himself from the mass of his fellow-creatures; and to draw apart with his family and his friends; so that, after he has thus formed a little circle of his own, he willingly leaves society at large to itself....
The great advantage of the Americans is that they have arrived at a state of democracy without having to endure a democratic revolution; and that they are born equal, instead of becoming so.... The Americans have combated by free institutions the tendency of equality to keep men asunder, and they have subdued it....
In the United States the more opulent citizens take great care not to stand aloof from the people; on the contrary, they constantly keep on easy terms with the lower classes: they listen to them, they speak to them every day. They know that the rich in democracies always stand in need of the poor....
It would seem as if every imagination in the United States were upon the stretch to invent means of increasing the wealth and satisfying the wants of the public. The best-informed inhabitants of each district constantly use their information to discover new truths which may augment the general prosperity; and if they have made any such discoveries, they eagerly surrender them to the mass of the people.

Oregon and Texas
At first, empresarios, or colonization agents, had encouraged Americans to settle the Mexican region of Texas. Tensions developed, however, and the settlers decided to separate and create their own government. The people of Texas fought for their independence from Mexico. Losses at the Alamo and Goliad galvanized the Texans. They defeated the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto in April 1836.
The citizens of Texas voted in favor of joining the United States However, Texas wished to be admitted to the Union as a slave state, which antislavery leaders in Congress opposed. The annexation of Texas became a key issue in the presidential race of 1844.

Democratic candidate James K. Polk promised to annex Texas. He and the Democrats also demanded the right to all of the Oregon Country, which was then jointly controlled by the United States and Britain.
Polk won the election. In February 1845, Congress passed a joint resolution to annex Texas. Britain and the United States agreed to divide Oregon along the 49th parallel the following year. Americans received the land that later became the states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.

War With Mexico
Texas’s entry into the Union outraged Mexico. Polk’s plans to acquire California added to the conflict. In November 1845, the president tried to buy California, but Mexico’s president refused to meet with the U.S. envoy.
In January 1846, Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to lead troops across the Nueces River into territory claimed by both the United States and Mexico. He wanted Mexican troops to fire the first shot, because then he could more easily win support for a war. On May 9, news arrived that a Mexican force had attacked Taylor’s men. Four days later, the Senate and House both overwhelmingly voted in favor of the war.
Even before war with Mexico was officially declared, settlers in northern California had begun an uprising. The settlers had little trouble overcoming the weak official Mexican presence in the territory. On June 14, 1846, they declared independence and proclaimed California the Bear Flag Republic. Despite the loss of California and defeat in several battles,
Mexico refused to surrender. Then Polk sent General Winfield Scott to seize Mexico City. After a six-month campaign beginning in the Gulf Coast city of Veracruz, Scott’s forces captured Mexico’s capital in September 1847.
A few months later, the war was over. On February 2,1848,
Mexico’s leaders signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Mexico gave the United States more than 500,000 square miles (1,295,000 sq. km) of territory, which is now the states of California, Nevada, and Utah, as well as most of Arizona and parts of New Mexico,
Colorado, and Wyoming. Mexico accepted the Rio Grande as the southern border of Texas. In return, the United States paid Mexico $15 million and took over $3.25 million in debts the Mexican government owed to U.S. citizens.

Slavery and Westward Expansion
GUIDING QUESTION
How did the political system attempt toresolve the issues of sectionalism and slom (c. 1820-1913)
Born into slavery in Maryland, Harriet Tubman struggled early against the system's brutality. She escaped to freedom in 1849. About crossing into Pennsylvania, she later wrote: "I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person. There was such a glory over every thing; the sun came like gold through the trees, and over the fields, and I felt like I was in Heaven." After Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, Tubman returned to the South 19 times to guide enslaved people along the Underground Railroad to freedom. Slaveholders offered a bounty of $40,000 for her capture.
When California applied for statehood, attempts by Congress to find a compromise on slavery further heightened opposing viewpoints. Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan suggested that the citizens of each new territory should be allowed to decide for themselves if they wanted to permit slavery This idea came to be called popular sovereignty.
As the 1848 presidential election approached, both major candidates-Democrat Lewis Cass and Whig General Zachary Taylor-remained vague on the issues. On Election Day, Taylor won a narrow popular victory, but umn mnrp than half of the electoral vote.
Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act
In January 1848, gold was found in the Sierra Nevada in California. News of the find swept the nation, and the California Gold Rush was on. To maintair order, Californians decided to seek statehood and applied to enter the Unic as a free state in December 1849. At the time, the Union consisted of 15 fre states and 15 slave states. If California tipped the balance, the slaveholding states would become a minority in the Senate.
A few Southern politicians began to talk of secession. In early 1850, Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky proposed allowing a compromise measure:
PRIMARY SOURCE
« California, with suitable boundaries, ought, upon her application, to be admitted as one of the State of this Union, without the imposition by Congress of any restriction in respect to the exclusion or introduction of slavery within those boundaries.99
—from a speech to Congress, January 29,18

CRITICAL THINKING
Analyzing Primary Sources What do you think Tubman meant when she wrote: "I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person"? popular sovereignty
before the Civil War, the idea that people living in a territory had the right to decide by voting if slavery would be allowed there
Clay further proposed that the rest of the newly acquired land from Mexicc be organized without restrictions on slavery. He also called for Congress to be prohibited from interfering with the domestic slave trade and to pass a stronger law to help Southerners recover enslaved African Americans who had fled to the North.
At first, Congress did not pass Clays bill, in part because President Taylor opposed it. Then, Taylor died unexpectedly in July. Vice President Millard Fillmore succeeded him and quickly threw his support behind the measure, which had been divided into several smaller bills. By September, Congress had passed all parts of the Compromise of 1850.
Henry Clay had conceived the Fugitive Slave Act as a measure to benefi slaveholders. The law, however, actually hurt the Southern cause by creatin; active hostility toward slavery among many Northerners. Under this law, a slaveholder or slave catcher had only to point out alleged runaways to have them taken into custody. The accused then would be brought before a federal commissioner. With no right to testify on their own behalf, African Americans had no way to prove their cases. An affidavit asserting that the captive had escaped from a slaveholder, or testimony by white witnesses, was all a court needed to order the person sent to the South.
The Underground Railroad helped many African Americans escape from the South. This informal network helped thousands of enslaved persons fle< north. Conductors” transported runaways in secret. The most famous conductor was Harriet Tubman, who was herself a runaway.
A mjor stop on the railroad was Cincinnati, Ohio, where author Harriet
f i iOWe. a f°r many years. She was inspired to “write something that would make this whole nation feel what an accursed thing slavery is.”
72
Her book, Uncle Toms Cabin, was first published in 1852. Stowe’s powerful depiction changed Northern perceptions of slavery.
The Crisis Over Kansas
The opening of the Oregon Territory and the admission of California to the Union convinced many people of the need for a transcontinental railroad. The location of the railroad’s eastern starting point was debated. Many Southerners favored the southern route, from New Orleans to San Diego. Democratic senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois wanted the eastern starting point to be in Chicago. Knowing a northern route would run through the unsettled lands west of Missouri and Iowa, he prepared a bill to organize the region into a new territory to be called Nebraska. Key Southern committee leaders prevented this bill from coming to a vote in the Senate. They made it clear that before Nebraska could be organized, Congress had to repeal part of the Missouri Compromise and allow slavery in the new territory.
Douglas finally agreed to repeal the antislavery provision of the Missouri Compromise and to divide the region into two territories. Nebraska would be to the north, adjacent to the free state of Iowa; Kansas would be to the south, west of the slave state of Missouri. This looked like Nebraska was intended to be free territory, while Kansas was intended for slavery. Warned that the South might secede without such concessions, President Franklin Pierce finally gave his support to the bill. Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act in May 1854.
Hordes of Northerners hurried into Kansas to create an antislavery majority. Before the March elections of 1855, however, thousands of armed Missourians—called “border ruffians” in the press—crossed the border to vote illegally, helping to elect a pro-slavery legislature. Furious antislavery settlers countered by drafting their own constitution that banned slavery.
By January 1856, Kansas had two territorial governments, one opposed to slavery and the other supporting it. As more Northern settlers arrived, border ruffians began attacks. “Bleeding Kansas,” as newspapers dubbed the territory, had become the scene of a territorial civil war.

BIOGRAPHY
Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896)
In 1832 Harriet Beecher Stowe moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, right across the river from the slave state of Kentucky. She met fugitive slaves, employed a formerly enslaved woman, and learned about slavery from Southern friends. After moving to Maine, she began writing Unde Tom's Cabin, based on her experiences in Ohio and antislavery readings. The novel, which humanized the plight of the enslaved, was an instant sensation and further hardened the positions of both abolitionists and slaveholders.

split the party. During the congressional elections of 1854, many former Northern Whigs joined forces with a few antislavery Democrats and the Free-Soil Party. This coalition was officially organized as the Republican Party i, 1856. The party was determined to prevent Southern planters from gaining control ofthe federal government. Republicans did not agree on abolishing slavery, but they did agree that it had to be kept out of the territories.
At the same time, the American Party, also known as the Know-Nothing: was making gains. This anti-Catholic, nativist party opposed immigration. The party began to come apart, however, when members from the Upper South and the North split over the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Most Northern Know-Nothings were absorbed into the Republican Party.
In the 1856 presidential election, three candidates mounted a serious challenge. Democrat James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, who had campaign on the idea that only he could save the Union, won the election. Just two day after Buchanan’s inauguration, the Supreme Court ruled in a landmark cast involving slavery, Dred Scott v. Sandford.
Dred Scott was an enslaved Missouri man who had been taken north to work in free territory for several years. After he returned with his slaveholde to Missouri, Scott sued for his freedom, arguing that living in free territory had made him a free man. Dred Scott’s case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which found against him. While Southerners cheered the Dred Scott decision, Republicans called it a “willful perversion” of the Constitution. After the Dred Scott decision, the conflict in “Bleeding Kansas” intensified.

DRED SCOTT
v. SANDFORD, 1857 Background to the Case Between 1833 and 1843, enslaved African American Dred Scott and his wife Harriet had lived in the free state of Illinois and in the part ofthe Louisiana Territory that was considered free under the Missouri Compromise. When he was returned to Missouri, Scott sued his slaveholder, based on the idea that he was free because he had lived in free areas, and won. That decision was reversed by the Missouri Supreme Court, and Scott's case went to the U.S. Supreme Court.
How the Court Ruled
Chief Justice Roger B. Taney delivered the Supreme Court's ruling in the Dred Scott case. The decision made Scott and his family a topic for the nation's press.
The 7-2 decision enraged many Northerners, and delighted many in the South. In his lengthy opinion for the Court, Chief Justice Taney ruled that African Americans—enslaved or free—were not citizens ofthe United States. Thus, Scott had no rights under the Constitution and no right to sue in federal court. Further, Taney decreed that Congress did not have the authority to ban slavery in the territories. This made the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional.

The Union Dissolves
GUIDING QUESTION
W/wf events led to the secession of the Southern states? In 1859 abolitionist John Brown seized an arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in an attempt to begin an insurrection, or rebellion, against slaveholders. His arrest and execution made him be viewed as a martyr in a noble cause by some and a sign of Northern aggression by others.
The Election of 1860
John Browns raid on Harpers Ferry became a turning point for the South.
In April 1860, Democrats from across the nation gathered in Charleston, South Carolina, to choose their nominee for president. When Northerners rebuffed the idea of a federal slave code in the territories, 50 Southern delegates stormed out of the convention. In June 1860, the Democrats reconvened in Baltimore. Again, Southern delegates walked out. The remaining Democrats then chose Stephen Douglas as their candidate. The Southern Democrats nominated their own candidate.
Republicans, realizing they stood no chance in the South, needed a candidate who could sweep most of the North. They nominated Abraham Lincoln, who had gained a national reputation through a series of debates with Douglas in 1858. Although not an abolitionist, Lincoln believed that slavery was morally wrong, and he opposed its spread into the Western territories. With the Democrats divided, Lincoln won the election.
The South Secedes
Many Southerners viewed Lincolns election as a threat to their society and culture, and saw no choice but to secede. Shortly after Lincolns election, the South Carolina legislature called for a convention. On December 20, 1860, amid marching bands, fireworks, and militia drills, the convention voted unanimously to repeal the states ratification of the Constitution and dissolve its ties to the Union. By February 1, 1861, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas had also voted to secede, and declared themselves to be a new nation—the Confederate States of America—or the Confederacy. Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia seceded in April 1861. A minority in these states did not want to leave the Union, but the majority of Southerners viewed secession as similar to the Revolution—a necessary course of action to uphold people’s rights.

Living Under Slavery
Enslaved persons were not free. That fundamental fact meant they could be sold and separated from their families. They could not legally marry or leave their slaveholder s property without permission. Slaveholders held such power that they controlled access to basic life necessities and could physically punish, even kill, the people they held in slavery without breaking the law.
AUTOBIOGRAPHY, 1845
Colonel Lloyd kept from three to four hundred slaves on his home plantation, and owned a large number more on the neighboring farms belonging to him.... The overseers of these, and all the rest of the farms, numbering over twenty, received advice and direction from the managers of the home plantation. This was the great business place. It was the seat of government for the whole twenty farms.... If a slave was convicted of any high misdemeanor, became unmanageable, or evinced a determination to run away, he was brought immediately here, severely whipped, put on board the sloop, carried to Baltimore, and sold to Austin Woolfolk, or some other slave-trader, as a warning to the slaves remaining....
The men and women slaves received, as their monthly allowance of food, eight pounds of pork, or its equivalent in fish, and one bushel of corn meal. Their yearly clothing consisted of two course linen shirts, one pair of linen trousers, like the shirts, one jacket, one pair of trousers for winter, made of coarse negro cloth, one pair of stockings, and one pair of shoes; the whole of which could not cost more than seven dollars. The allowance of the slave children was given to their mothers, or the old women having the care of them. The children unable to work in the field had neither shoes, stockings, jackets, nor trousers, given to them; their clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts per year. When these failed them, they went naked until the next allowance-day. Children from seven to ten years old, of both sexes, almost naked, might be seen at all seasons of the year.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY, 1861
Reader, it is not to awaken sympathy for myself that I am telling you truthfully what I suffered in slavery. I do it to kindle a flame of compassion in your hearts for my sisters who are still in bondage, suffering as I once suffered.
I once saw two beautiful children playing together. One was a fair white child; the other was her slave, and also her sister. When I saw them embracing each other, and heard their joyous laughter, I turned sadly away from the lovely sight. I foresaw the inevitable blight that would fall on the little slave’s heart. I knew how soon her laughter would be changed to sighs. The fair child grew up to be a still fairer woman. From childhood to womanhood her pathway was blooming with flowers, and overarched by a sunny sky. Scarcely one day of her life had been clouded when the sun rose on her happy bridal morning.
How had those years dealt with her slave sister, the little playmate of her childhood? She, also, was very beautiful; but the flowers and sunshine of love were not for her. She drank the cup of sin, and shame, and misery, whereof her persecuted race are compelled to drink.
In view of these things, why are ye silent, ye free men and women ofthe north? Why do your tongues falter in maintenance of the right? Would that I had more ability! But my heart is so full, and my pen is so weak! There are noble men and women who plead for us, striving to help those who cannot help themselves. God bless them! God give them strength and courage to go on! God bless those, every where who are laboring to advance the cause of humanity!

The Opposing Sides
guiding question What were the advantages and disadvantages for the North and the Soi at the start of the war?
Although the South had many experienced officers to lead its troo in battle, the North had several economic advantages. In 1860 the population of the North was about 22 million, while the South had about 9 million people, more than one-third of whom were enslaved In 1860 almost 90 percent of the nations factories were located in the Northern states, which could provide troops with ammunition and other supplies more easily. The South had only half as many miles of railroad track as the North. Northern troops could more easily disrupt the Southern rail system and prevent the movement of supplies and troops.
The Union also controlled the national treasury and could expe< continued revenue from tariffs. Many Northern banks held large reserves of cash, which they lent the government by purchasing bon In contrast to the Union, the Confederacy’s financial situation was poor, and it became worse over time. Most Southern planters were ii debt and unable to buy bonds. Southern banks were small and had f cash reserves, so they could not buy many bonds, either. The best hope for the South to raise money was by taxing trade. But the Unio navy quickly blockaded Southern ports, reducing trade. The Confederacy enacted direct taxation of its people, but many Southerners refused to pay. The Confederacy was forced to print paper money, causing rapid inflation in the South.

The Early Stages
guiding question When did the war change from a battle over preserving the Union to a war to end slavery? What caused this change?
The Civil War began in April 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon federal troops in Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. Confederate president Jefferson Davis claimed that the seceding states were fighting for the same “sacred right of self-government” that had inspired the American Revolution and that the Confederacy would “seek no conquest... all we ask is to be let alone.”
First Battle of Bull Run
Soon after the war began, Lincoln approved an assault on Confederate troops gathered near Manassas Junction, Virginia. The First Battle of Bull Run started well for the Union, but the tide turned when reinforcements helped the Confederates defeat the Union forces. The outcome made it clear that the North would need a large, well-trained army to prevail against the South.
The War in the West
The Union blockaded Southern ports along the Atlantic, but the South used small, fast ships to smuggle goods past the blockades. In April 1862, Union forces seized New Orleans, the South’s largest city, and gained control of the lower Mississippi River.
In early 1862, Union general Ulysses S. Grant began a campaign on the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. Control of these rivers would split Tennessee and provide the Union with a route into Confederate territory.
All of Kentucky and most of western Tennessee eventually fell.
The War in the East
While Grant fought in the West, Union general George B. McClellan’s forces set out to capture Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital. In late June 1862, Confederate general Robert E. Lee began a series of attacks on McClellan’s

forces. Together the two sides suffered more than 30,000 casualties. On September 17,1862, Lee’s forces met McClellans at Antietam (an-TEE-tuhm) Creek. The fight was the bloodiest one-day battle in American history, ending with nearly 6,000 soldiers killed and another 17,000 wounded. McClellan did not break Lee’s lines, but he inflicted so many casualties that Lee decided to retreat to Virginia.
The Battle of Antietam was a crucial victory for the Union. The British government had been ready to intervene in the war as a mediator if Lees invasion had succeeded. Now the British decided to wait and see how the war progressed. The South’s defeat at Antietam had an even more important political impact in the United States. It convinced President Lincoln that th time had come to end slavery in the South.
The Emancipation Proclamation
Most Democrats opposed ending slavery, while Republicans were divided. With Union casualties rising, however, many Northerners began to agree that slavery had to end, both to punish the South and to make the soldiers’ sacrifices worthwhile. On September 22, 1862, Lincoln publicly announce! that he would issue the Emancipation Proclamation—a decree freeing all enslaved persons in states still in rebellion after January 1, 1863. Because the Proclamation freed enslaved African Americans only in states at war with the Union, it did not address slavery in the border states. By its very existence, however, the Proclamation transformed the conflict over preserving the Union into a war of liberation.

As 1863 began, there was no end to the war in sight. More than two years of battle lay ahead for Americans, and the casualties would continue to rise steeply.

The operation accomplished, the surgeon would look around with a deep sigh, and then—'Next!' 99

It was in this field of battlefield medicine that the only woman ever to win the Medal of Honor made her contribution. Mary Edwards Walker was one of the few women before the Civil War to earn a medical degree. When the Civil War erupted, she volunteered to help the Union Army and worked as a surgeon near the front lines. She frequently crossed enemy lines to treat civilians, and on one such mission in 1864 she was arrested as a spy, and imprisoned for four months. For her contributions to the war effort, she was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1865.
Vicksburg
Gaining control of the Mississippi River was a vital element of the Union strategy for winning the Civil War. If the Union could capture Vicksburg, Mississippi, the last major Confederate stronghold on the river, then the North could cut the South in two. In May 1863, Grant launched two assaults on Vicksburg, but the city’s defenders repulsed both attacks and inflicted high casualties. Grant decided to put the city under siege by cutting off its food and supplies and bombarding it until its defenders gave up. On July 4, 1863, with his troops starving, the Confederate commander at Vicksburg surrendered. Gettysburg
Meanwhile, in Virginia, Lee had been able to defeat Union forces at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. Emboldened by these victories, Lee decided in June 1863 to launch another invasion of the North. At the end of June, as Lee’s army foraged in the Pennsylvania countryside, some of his troops headed into Gettysburg, hoping to seize a supply of shoes.
When they arrived near the town, they discovered two brigades of Union cavalry. On July 1, 1863, as Confederates pushed the Union troops out of the town, the main forces of both armies hurried to the scene ofthe fighting. On July 2, Lee attacked, but the Union troops held their ground. The following day, Lee ordered nearly 15,000 men under the command of General George E. Pickett and General A. P. Hill to make a massive assault. The attack, known as Pickett’s Charge, caused 7,000 casualties in less than half an hour, but failed to break the Union lines. “... [A] 11 this has been my fault,” said Lee. “It is I that have lost this fight.
Lee’s troops retreated to Virginia. At Gettysburg, the Union suffered 23,000 casualties, the South an estimated 28,000, more than one-third of Lee’s entire force. The disaster at Gettysburg proved to be the turning point ofthe war in the East. The Union’s victory strengthened the Republicans politically and ensured once again that the British would not recognize the Confederacy. For the remainder of the war, Lee’s forces remained on the defensive, slowly giving ground to the advancing Union army.

The Thirteenth Amendment
More Union successes followed. General Grant succeeded in securing control ofthe Mississippi River. Lincoln rewarded him appointing him general in chief of the Union forces. Grant then began a relentless series of attacks against Lees forces, slowly pushing deeper into Virginia. In June 1864, Grant forces reachec the fortifications outside the city of Petersburg. Instead of attacking, he put the city under siege. As the siege dragged on, support for the war declined, and Lincoln expected to lose the 1! presidential election. In September 1864, however, General William Tecumseh Sherman captured Atlanta and then began a march to sea, pillaging and destroying railroads, warehouses, ra and factories. Shermans success revitalized northern support for
the war, and Lincoln won in a landslide.
The president interpreted his reelection as a mandate from the voters end slavery permanently by amending the Constitution. The Senate had passed an amendment the previous spring, but Lincoln and Congressiona Republicans had to build a coalition of anti-slavery Democrats to get the amendment passed in the House of Representatives.
On January 31, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, banning slavery in the United States, narrowly passed the House of Representatives and went to the states for ratification. It took the remainder of the year, but by December 1865, enough states had ratified the amendme for it to go into effect. The Thirteenth Amendment marked a culmination o the abolition movement that had begun in the years after the American Revolution. It also finally applied the founding principles ofthe Declaration Independence, the self-evident truths, as the Declaration put it, “that all mei are created equal” and had an unalienable right to liberty.
The War Ends
By the spring of 1865, Lee knew that time was running out. On April 1, 1865, Union troops cut the last rail line into Petersburg, Virginia. Lee’s troops attempted to escape Grant’s forces in the area, but Union cavalry blocked the road. With his battered troops surrounded and outnumbered, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House on Apr 9,1865. Grants generous terms of surrender guaranteed that the Union woi not prosecute Confederate soldiers for treason. When Grant agreed to let Confederates take their horses home “to put in a crop to carry themselves and their families through the next winter,” Lee thanked him, saying the kindness would “do much toward conciliating our people.”
With the war over, Lincoln delivered a speech describing his plan to restore the Southern states to the Union. In the speech, he mentioned including African Americans in Southern state governments. One listener, actor JohnWilkes Booth, sneered to a friend, “That is the last speech he w ever make. Although his advisers had repeatedly warned him not to appe; unescorted in public, Lincoln went to Fords Theatre with his wife to see a play on the evening of April 14, 1865.

guiding question IV/wf important decisions had to be made concerning the fate ofthe seceded states and the rights of those freed from slavery?
At the end of the Civil War, the South was a defeated region with a devastated economy. While some Southerners were bitter over the loss, for many, rebuilding their land and their lives was more important. The president and Congress grappled with the difficult task of Reconstruction.
Opposing Plans for Reconstruction
In December 1863, President Lincoln offered a general amnesty, or pardon, to Southerners who took an oath of loyalty to the United States and accepted the Unions requirements concerning slavery. However, certain Confederate officials and military officers were not included in the offer.
In his Second Inaugural Address in March 1865, Lincoln spoke of ending the war “with malice toward none, with charity for all.”
Resistance to Lincoln’s plan surfaced among a group of Republicans in Congress known as Radical Republicans. They wanted to prevent the leaders of the Confederacy from returning to power. They also wanted the federal government to guarantee African Americans their right to vote.
Vice President Andrew Johnson, a Democrat from Tennessee, assumed the presidency after Lincolns death. His 1865 plan for Reconstruction closely resembled Lincoln’s, and offered amnesty to all former citizens of the Confederacy except for former Confederate officials and wealthy planters. Many congressional Republicans were outraged when Southerners elected many former Confederate officials to Congress. They were further angered when Southern state legislatures passed a series of laws known as black codes that limited African Americans’ rights.
The Fourteenth Amendment

Historically Black Colleges
Ending the Civil War was about more than bringing the former Confederate states back into the Union. It was also about helping freed African Americans transition from enslavement to freedom. Increased education was key in this effort. Florida A& M University traces its origins back to 1887. Originally named the State Normal College for Colored Students, the school’s first president was Thomas DeSaille Tucker, an attorney. Tucker was only the second teacher at the school and presided over its first fourteen years. The school became Florida’s land-grant college for African Americans and received financial aid from the Morrill Land Grant Act. Today, Florida A & M continues the tradition of educating African Americans as one of the premier historically black institutions of higher education in the United States.
EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS
During Reconstruction, secret sodetic such as the White League and the Pale Faces formed to prevent Africai Americans from exercising their rights. The largest of these groups, the Ku Klux Kian, used violence to drive out carpetbaggers and intimidate African Americans. Other white extremist organizations included the Red Shirts and the Knights of the White Camellia. The Red Shirts originated in Mississippi and the Knights of the White Camellia first formed in New Orleans.
Defending Do you think the cartoon texl is correct in its assertion that these groups were "worse than slavery*? Explain.
In March 1867, Congressional Republicans passed the Military Reconstruction Act dividing the former Confederacy, except for Tennesse which had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866, into five military districts. In order for the former Confederate states to regain control oft! state government and be allowed to elect members to Congress, they had give the right to vote to all adult male citizens, regardless of race, and rati; the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Fourteenth Amendment was a turning point in American politic; and legal history. Since its ratification in 1868, it has been used to expand federal power over the states, and to extend civil rights through its equal protection clause. It also led to the doctrine of incorporation, the idea tha the Bill of Rights applies to state governments, not just the federal government. Although it did not prevent Southern states from imposing restrictions on African Americans in the late 19th century, the Fourteenth Amendment would empower the African American civil rights movement and help ensure its success in the 1950s and 1960s.
The Fifteenth Amendment
In the meantime, tensions between Radical Republicans and Johnson increased and eventually the House of Representatives voted to impeach t president. The impeachment trial in the Senate ended one vote short of convicting Johnson. Although Johnson remained in office, he did not run for re-election in 1868. That year the Republicans nominated General Gr< for president. Grant won easily and Republicans kept control of Congress
Republicans moved rapidly to expand their Reconstruction program. Recognizing the importance of African American suffrage, Congress pass the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution. This amendment declared that the right to vote “shall not be denied...on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” By March 1870, enough states had ratifi< the amendment to make it part of the Constitution. Radical Reconstructs had a dramatic impact on the South, particularly in the short term. It changed Southern politics by bringing hundreds of thousands of African
84
Americans into the political process for the first time. It also began to change Southern society. As it did so, it angered many white Southerners, who began to fight back against the federal government’s policies.
The South During Reconstruction
By the autumn of 1870, all former Confederate states had rejoined the Union.
The Freedmens Bureau worked to feed and clothe war refugees and help formerly enslaved people. A large number of Northerners traveled to the South, where many were elected or appointed to positions in the new state governments. Southerners called these newcomers carpetbaggers because some arrived with their belongings in suitcases made of carpet fabric. Local residents saw them as intruders seeking to exploit the South. Some white Southerners did work with the Republicans and supported Reconstruction. Other Southerners called such supporters scalawags—an old Scots-Irish term for weak, underfed, worthless animals.
Having gained the right to vote, African American men entered into politics with great enthusiasm. They served as legislators and administrators for nearly all levels of government. Republicans built a coalition of poor Southern-born white farmers, African Americans, and Northern carpetbaggers to elect Republican candidates.
Compromise of 1877
After Ulysses S. Grant became president in 1869, scandals and economic pressures damaged his administration. In the 1870s, Democrats began to regain power in the South. The 1876 presidential election pitted Republican Rutherford B. Hayes against Democrat Samuel Tilden. On Election Day, 20 electoral votes were disputed, including 19 in the three Southern states controlled by Republicans. The Compromise of 1877 emerged. Historians are not sure if a deal really took place, but the compromise reportedly included a promise to pull federal troops out of the South in return for a Republican victory. This did in fact happen within a month of Hayes taking office; however, it is also true that the nation and Republican leaders were ready to end Reconstruction.

The Emancipation
Proclamation The secession of
the Southern states was prompted by fear that the institution of slavery was under attack. The Civil War, however, began as a battle over the question ofthe right ofthe Southern states to secede. When Abraham Lincoln decided to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, he put ending slavery at the heart of the Union effort. In doing so, he changed the meaning of the war. The proclamation was the first bold step in the abolition of slavery throughout the nation.
POLITICAL SPEECH,
1861 [The Confederate States of America’s] constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution—African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status ofthe negro in our form of civilization.... The prevailing ideas entertained by... most ofthe leading statesmen at the time ofthe formation ofthe old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation ofthe laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically....
Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery—subordination to the superior race—is his natural and normal condition.
H.
Stephens, vice president of the Confederate States of America, March 21,1861
POLITICAL SPEECH,
1862 Mr. Speaker... the people ofthe loyal States know that slavery lies at the bottom of all our troubles.

LETTER, 1863
My dear Sir—
... After the commencement of hostilities I struggled nearly a year and a half to get aloni without touching the ‘institution’ [of slavery]; c when finally I conditionally determined to tow it, I gave a hundred days fair notice of my purpose, to all the States and people, within which time they could have turned it wholly aside, by simply again becoming good citizen ofthe United States. They chose to disregard and I made the peremptory proclamation on what appeared to me to be a military necessil And being made, it must stand. As to the Stat not included in it, of course they can have the rights in the Union as of old. Even the people
86

the states included, if they choose, need not to be hurt by it. Let them adopt systems of apprenticeship ... conforming substantially to the most approved plans of gradual emancipation; and, with the aid they can have from the general government, they may be nearly as well off, in this respect, as if the present trouble had not occurred, and much better off than they can possibly be if the contest continues persistently.
—Abraham Lincoln, letter to Major General John A. McClernand, January 8,1863
LETTERS, 1862
To Abraham Lincoln, president ofthe United States:
... On the face of this wide earth, Mr. President, there is not one disinterested,
A
Horace Greeley, editor of A President Abraham Lincoln the weekly “New Yorker" and founder of the “New York Tribune". determined, intelligent champion ofthe Union cause who does not feel that all attempts to put down the Rebellion, and at the same time uphold its inciting cause, are preposterous and futile—that the Rebellion, if crushed out tomorrow, would be renewed within a year if Slavery were left in full vigor—that Army officers who remain to this day devoted to Slavery can at best be but halfway loyal to the Union—and that every hour of deference to Slavery is an hour of added and deepened peril to the Union.
—Horace Greeley, editor ofthe New York Tribune, August 19,1862
Dear Sir—
... If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them—if there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them.
My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or destroy slavery—if I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.

Understanding
Historical Eras
Why Learn This Skill?
Have you ever heard someone refer to music from "the 60s" or art from the Renaissance? Has your history teacher ever referred to the Middle Ages, or to the Gilded Age, or to the Cold War era? In each case, they are referring to an historical era. An era is a period of time in history that has distinct characteristics. Historians divide history into eras as a form of shorthand. Instead of having to refer to "the time when many people were out of work; the Great Plains were suffering dust storms, and the government was creating programs to help people," historians can simply refer to "The Great Depression." Understanding historical eras makes learning history easier. By breaking history into chunks, it is easier to remember what was happening and why.
Some era, like the Industrial Era, become known for the rapid growth of urban areas.
Learning the Skill
To be an historical era, a period of time has to have a common set of major characteristics. These characteristics are based on a combinatic of the unique politics, economics, technology, social issues, culture, and major events that we shaping people's lives at the time. It is not alwa clear when an era begins or ends. Some of the things common in one era may continue into tl next era, but usually several major things change, leading historians to identify it as a new era.
Historians often use a major event to mark the break or turning point that leads to a new era. Historians also break up history different! depending on what they are studying. An historian looking at international events regarc the 1920s and 1930s as the "Interwar Era" between World War I and World War II. But ar historian looking at economics sees the boomii 1920s as very different from the depression of the 1930s.
Because the history of the United States is short, the historical eras people use tend to be only a few decades long at most. Modern American history is usually said to begin in If
The reason 1877 is chosen as the start is because it marks the last year when political debates still involved the issues of the Civil W< and Reconstruction. After 1877, historians generally agree that the United States began tc change and deal with issues unrelated to the Civil War era.
These are the major eras of American histc since 1877 that most historians reference:
•	The Industrial Era, or Gilded Age, 1877-1900
•	The Progressive Era & World War I, 1900-1920
•	The Roaring 20s, or The New Era, 1920-1929
•	The Great Depression, or New Deal, 1929-1939
•	World War II, 1939-1945
•	Post War America, 1945 to the present
88
PHOTO:
Francis Miller/Time & Life Pictures/Getty Images; TEXT: Martin Luther King, Jr., “I Have a Dream,” August 28,1963. Reprinted by The decades since the end of World War II have been a time of great change, and historians disagree over how best to divide it into historical eras.
Many historians see 1945 to 1991 as an historical era, because 1945 marks the start of the Cold War and 1991 marks the end of the Soviet Union.
Others focus on events within the United States. Some like to divide the post-war era into decades, "the 50s," "the 60s,"
"the 70s" etc., because they see dramatic cultural changes in each decade. Others prefer to divide the post-war years into eras based on major political, economic, or technological changes, including the following:
•	Post-War America, 1945-1953
•	Civil Rights Era, 1954-1968
•	Vietnam Era, 1965-1975
•	The Conservative Resurgence, 1976-1992
•	End of the Century, 1980-2000
•	The Technology Revolution, 1981-present
•	The Post-9/11 Era, 2001-present
•	The Great Recession, 2007-present
Whatever era is used, the best way to understand it is to focus on the major characteristics that make it different from other times in history. Learning those characteristics will help you remember American history, and you will be able to make connections and generalizations about history more easily.
Practicing this Skill
Open up your textbook or the online student edition website. Look through the different chapters and lessons paying attention to the headings and topics to get a sense of the major characteristics of each era. Then answer the following questions:
Certain individuals often represent eras in iconic ways. Martin Luther King, for instance, has become an icon ofthe Civil Rights Era.

Miners, ranchers, and farmers led the way to the expansion ofthe western territories. Homesteading allowed settlers to claim acres of land to cultivate and build new lives. With the building of railroads to connect the western states to the East, the population quickly grew. For centuries this land was home to many groups of Native Americans. The settling ofthe West altered their way of life forever.

Boomtowns
In 1859 a prospector named Henry Comstock staked a claim near Virginia City, Nevada. When others found a rich source nearby Comstock claimed he owned the land and quickly struck a deal to share the fortune. He later sold his claim for thousands of dollars, not realizing that the sticky, blue-gray clay that made mining in the area difficult was nearly pure silver ore worth millions.
News of the Comstock Lode, as the strike came to be called, brought a flood of prospectors to Virginia City. So many people arrived that, in 1864, Nevada was admitted as the thirty-sixth state in the Union. This occurred many times in the American West. News of a mineral strike would start a stampede of prospectors. Almost overnight, tiny frontier towns were transformed into small cities. Virginia City, for example, grew from a town of a few hundred people to nearly 30,000 in just a few months. It had an opera house, shops with furniture and fashions from Europe, several newspapers, and a six-story hotel.
These quickly growing towns were called boomtowns. The term boom refers to a time of rapid economic growth. Boomtowns were

owdy places. Prospectors fought over claims, and thieves haunted the treets and trails. Often, law and order” was enforced by vigilance :ommittees self-appointed volunteers who would track down and punish vrongdoers. In some cases, they responded with their own form of justice, )ut most people respected the law and tried to deal firmly but fairly with ;he accused.
Eventually, the mines that supported the boomtown economy would be used up. A few boomtowns were able to survive when the mines closed, but many of them did not. Instead, these boomtowns went “bust”—a term borrowed from card games in which players lost all of their money. In Virginia City, for example, the silver mines were exhausted by the 1880s, and most residents moved on; only about 500 people remained by 1930. Other towns were completely abandoned and became ghost towns.
Mining Leads to Statehood
After gold was discovered in 1858 in Colorado near Pikes Peak, miners rushed to the area, declaring “Pikes Peak or Bust.” Many panned for gold without success and headed home, complaining of a “Pikes Peak hoax.” In truth, the Colorado mountains contained plenty of gold and silver, although much of it was hidden beneath the surface and hard to extract. Deep deposits of lead mixed with silver were found at Leadville in the 1870s. News of the strike attracted as many as 1,000 newcomers a week, making Leadville one of the West’s most famous boomtowns. This bonanza spurred the building of railroads through the Rocky Mountains and transformed Denver, the supply point for the mining areas, into the second-largest city in the West, after San Francisco.

The discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and copper in Montana drew miners to the region in the 1870s When the railroads were completed, many farmers and ranchers settled the area. In 1889 Congress admitted three new states: North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana.
In the Southwest, the Arizona Territory followed a similar pattern. Miners had already begun moving to Arizona in the 1860s and 1870s to work one ofthe nation’s largest copper deposits. When silver was found at the town of Tombstone in 1877, it set off a boom that attracted a huge wave of prospectors to the territory.
The boom lasted about 30 years, and during that time Tombstone became famous for its lawlessness. Marshal Wyatt Earp and his brothers gained their reputations during the famous gunfight at the O.K. Corral there in 1881. Although Arizona did not grow as quickly as Colorado, Nevada, or Montana, by 1912 it had enough people to apply for statehood, as did the neighboring territory of New Mexico.
hydraulic mining method of mining by which water is sprayed at a very high pressure against a hill or mountain, washing away large quantities of dirt, gravel, and rock and exposing the minerals beneath the surface
Miners used high-pressure water to wash loose earth into ditches. The ditches carried the water and earth into riffle boxes that agitated the water, causing the silver or gold to settle out. The leftover debris, called tailings or"slickens,"was then washed into a nearby stream.
CRITICAL THINKING
Determining Cause and Effect How might this mining practice have helped miners in their search for minerals?
Mining Technology
Extracting minerals from the rugged mountains of the American West required ingenuity and patience. Early prospectors extracted shallow deposits of ore in a process called placer mining, using simple tools like picks, shovels, and pans.
Other prospectors used sluice mining to search riverbeds more quickly than the panning method. A sluice diverted the current of a river into trenches. The water was directed to a box with metal “riffle” bars that caused heavier minerals to settle to the bottom of the box. A screen at the end kept the minerals from escaping with the water and sediment.
When deposits near the surface ran out, miners began hydraulic mining to remove large quantities of earth and process it for minerals. Miners sprayed water at very high pressure against the hill or mountain they were mining. The water pressure washed away the dirt, gravel, and rock and exposed the minerals beneath the surface.
Changes to the Land
Hydraulic mining began in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It effectively removed large quantities of minerals and generated millions of dollars in gold. Unfortunately, it also had a devastating effect on the local environment. Millions of tons of silt, sand, and gravel were washed into local rivers. This sediment raised the riverbed. As a result, the rivers began overflowing their banks, causing major floods that wrecked fences, destroyed orchards, and deposited rocks and gravel on what had been good farm soil, destroying thousands of acres of rich farmland. In the 1880s, farmers fought back by suing the mining companies. In 1884 federal judge Lorenzo Sawyer ruled in favor of the farmers. He declared hydraulic mining a “public and private nuisance” and issued an injunction stopping the practice.
Congress eventually passed a law in 1893 allowing hydraulic mining if the mining company created a place to store the sediment. By then, most mining companies had moved to quartz mining—the kind of mining familiar to people today—in which deep mine shafts are dug, and miners go underground to extract the minerals.

Ranching and Cattle Drives
GUIDING QUESTION
Why was cattle ranching an important business for the Great Plains? The lure of the Great Plains brought other Americans west to herd cattle. The Texas longhorn, a cattle breed descended from Spanish cattle introduced two centuries earlier, was well adapted to this region and flourished on scarce water and tough prairie grasses. By 1865, some 5 million roamed the Texas grasslands. Another boon to cattle ranching was the open range, a
vast area of grassland that the federal government owned. Here, ranchers could graze their herds free of charge and unrestricted by private property.
The Long Drive Begins
Prior to the Civil War, ranchers had little incentive to round up the longhorns and move them to market. Beef prices were low, and moving cattle to eastern markets was not practical. But during the war, eastern cattle had been slaughtered in huge numbers to feed the armies of the Union and the Confederacy. After the war, beef prices soared. Also, by this time, railroads had reached the Great Plains, heading to towns in Kansas and Missouri. Ranchers and livestock dealers realized that if they could move their cattle to the railroad, the longhorns could be sold for a huge profit and shipped east to market.
In 1866 ranchers rounded up about 260,000 longhorns and drove them to Sedalia, Missouri—the first “long drive.” Other cattle trails soon opened, including the route to Abilene, Kansas, as the railroads expanded in the West. Cowboys from major ranches went north with the herds, which could number anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 cattle.
CRITICAL THINKING
Making Generalizations What effect did the increased ability to move cattle to different parts ofthe country have on the cattle industry? adapt to change in order to meet the demands of a certain environment or circumstance

The End of the Open Range
Before long, sheep herders moved their flocks onto the range and farmers came in, breaking up the land for their crops. Eventually, hundreds of square miles of fields were fenced cheaply and easily with a new invention—barbed wire. The fences blocked the cattle trails. The cattle industry faced other struggles. Prices plunged in the mid-1880s, and many ranchers went bankrupt. The harsh winter of 1886-1887 buried the Plains in deep snow. Many cattle froze or starved to death.
Although it survived these terrible blows, the cattle industry was changed forever. The era of the open range ended, and cowboys became ranch hands. From then on, herds were raised on fenced-in ranches.

Settling the Hispanic Southwest
guidingquestion What was the relationship like between Hispanics in the Southwest and new settlers?
For centuries, much of what is today the American Southwest belonged to Spain’s empire. After Mexico won its independence, the region became the northern territories of the Republic of Mexico. When the United States defeated Mexico in 1848, it acquired this vast region. According to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war, the region’s residents retained their property rights and could become American citizens.

Changing Demographics in the Southwest
In California, the Spanish mission system had collapsed by the early 1800s. In its place, a society dominated by a landholding elite had emerged. These landowners owned vast haciendas—ranches that covered thousands of acres. The heavy influx of “Forty-Niners” during the California gold rusho 1849, however, changed this society dramatically. California’s population grew from about from 14,000 to around 100,000 in less than two years and its demographic pattern changed dramatically. Suddenly, Hispanic Californians were vastly outnumbered.
Some Hispanic Californians welcomed the newcomers and the economic growth that resulted. Others distrusted the English-speaking prospectors, who tried to exclude them from the mines. When California achieved statehood in 1850, Hispanics served in many state and local offices. Increasingly, however, the original Hispanic population found its status diminished, and Hispanics were often relegated to lower-paving and less desirable jobs.
As they had done with Native Americans, settlers from the East clashed with Mexican Americans over land. Across the region, many Hispanics lost their land to the new settlers. Mexican American claims to the land often
dated back to Spanish land grants. These grants were hundreds of years old and defined the boundaries of property in vague terms. When more than one person claimed ownership of a property, American courts frequently held that the old land grants were insufficient proof of ownership. This allowed others to stake claim to the property. In some instances, outright fraud was used to take land illegally from Mexican Americans.
The cattle boom of the 1870s and 1880s had a tremendous impact on Hispanics in the Southwest, where many had long worked as vaqueros (the Spanish word for “cowboys”). Spanish vaqueros had a long history of sharing their techniques for managing cattle. They shared methods of branding with Florida cattlemen as far back in history as when Florida was a Spanish colony. This interaction with American cowboys enriched the English language with such Spanish words as hirint. lasso, and stampede.
In the mid-19th century, most Hispanics in the Southwest lived on large haciendas where they worked in the fields or helped tend cattle.

Clashes and Compromises in the Southwest
With the increasing demand for beef in the eastern United States, English-speaking ranchers wanted to expand their herds and claimed large tracts of land of Mexican origin. In some cases, the Hispanic population fought back. In New Mexico, residents of the town of Las Vegas were outraged when English-speaking ranchers tried to fence in land that had long been used by the community to graze livestock. In 1889 a group of Hispanic New Mexicans calling themselves Las Gorras Blancas (“The White Caps”) raided ranches owned by English speakers, tore down their fences, and burned their barns and houses. Attempts were made to call in federal troops to stop the raids, but the president refused to send them. The raids finally ended in 1891.
Despite the influx of English-speaking settlers, Hispanics in New Mexico remained more influential in public affairs than did their counterparts in California and Texas.
Hispanics remained the majority, both in population and in the territorial legislature. In addition, a Hispanic frequently served as New Mexico’s territorial delegate to Congress.
As more railroads were built in the 1880s and 1890s, the population of the Southwest continued to swell. The region attracted not only Americans and European immigrants from the East but also immigrants from Mexico. Mexican immigrants worked mainly in agriculture and on the railroads. In the growing cities of the Southwest—such as El Paso, Albuquerque, and Los Angeles—Hispanics settled in neighborhoods called barrios. These neighborhoods had Spanish-speaking businesses and Spanish-language newspapers, and they helped keep Hispanic cultural and religious traditions alive. As native Californian Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo explained in 1890:
A fancily dressed vaquero, known as a charro, poses for a photo in 1890.

Reading and Creating a Thematic Map
Why Learn This Skill?
You will often encounter thematic maps when studying history. Knowing how to read and create a thematic map will help you understand the information this type of map presents.
Learning the Skill
A thematic map takes data about a region and puts it on a map using colors and symbols that show how the data connects to geographical features. Thematic maps usually portray information about the politics, economy, society, culture, climate, or history of a geographic area. A land use map is an example of a thematic map. It uses colors and symbols to show things such as where crops are grown, where mines are located, or the population density. Another example is an historical map that uses symbols, arrows, and colors to show the routes followed by explorers or how borders change over time.
geographic features have to be included? This decision is usually based on the patterns you want to show.
•	Decide what symbols and colors best present the data. Should the symbols change size or color for different sets of data? Does the map need to show things changing over time?
•	Prepare your map key carefully.
When reading a thematic map, follow these steps:
•	Read the title: This will help you understand the map's theme, location, time period, and type of data being shown.
•	Read the Map Key: Thematic maps use symbols and colors to convey information. Sometimes the symbols change size to indicate if more or less of something exists at that point on the map.
•	Study the map and draw conclusions: Look for patterns on the map. They reveal how the data presented by the thematic symbols and colors relates to the geographic features.
When creating a thematic map, follow these steps:
•	Identify the data you want to present.
•	Decide what kind of map you need.
What region do you want to show? What
Practicing this Skill
Analyze thematic map "Mining Helps Build a Nation" then answer the following questions:
1.	What part of the United States does the map show?
2.	What symbols are used to depict mining activities?
3.	What other information does the map provide?
4.	Use the patterns on the map to list the states in order of their gold and silver discoveries. Explain why you put them in the order you did.
Applying the Skill
Create your own thematic map. Research where different types of crops were grown in the American west from 1870 to 1900. Use the thematic map to show key events and the geographic patterns that resulted from farming and ranching in the west.

Farming the Plains



> Why would people take on the challenges of

It Matters Because
The Homestead Act encouraged settlers to move to the Great Plains. Although life was difficult, settlers discovered that they could grow wheat using new technologies. By 1890, the land had been settled and cultivated, and there was no longer a true frontier in the United States.
The Beginnings of Settlement
guiding question What encouraged settlers to move wesf to the Great Plains?
The Great Plains is a vast region of prairie roughly west of the Mississippi River and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. Although the population of the Great Plains grew steadily after the Civil War, the settlers faced many challenges. Summer temperatures could top 100°F. Prairie fires were a frequent danger. Sometimes swarms of grasshoppers destroyed crops. Winter brought terrible blizzards and extreme cold. A settler who experienced the fierce winters wrote in her diary on March 12, 1884:

This is the Dakota boomer's exhilarating weather! W —from The Checked Years: A Bonanza Farm Diary, 1884-1888
In this dry grassland, trees grew naturally only along rivers and streams. Without trees to use as timber, many settlers cut chunks of sod, densely packed soil held together by grass roots, to build their homes. To obtain water, they had to drill wells more than 100 feet deep and operate the pump by hand. Land once thought to be worthless was eventually transformed into Americas wheat belt. Major Stephen Long, who explored the region with an army expedition in 1819, called it the “Great American Desert”:

During the late 1800s, the construction and development ofthe railroads stimulated growth. Railroad companies sold land along the rail lines at low prices and provided credit to prospective settlers. Pamphlets and posters spread the news across Europe and America that cheap land could be claimed by anyone willing to move.
In 1862 the government encouraged settlement on the Great Plains by passing the Homestead Act. For a small registration fee, an individual could file for a homestead—a tract of public land available for settlement. A homesteader could claim up to 160 acres of land and receive title to it after living there for five years. The Homestead Act provided a legal metho< for settlers to acquire clear title to property on the frontier. With their property rights assured and the railroads providing lumber and supplies, settlers began moving to the Plains in large numbers.
g READING PROGRESS CHECK
Analyzing What developments of the late 1800s attracted settlers to endure the hardships ofthe Great Plains?
Technology and the Wheat Belt
guiding question What new metho ds and technologies revolutionized agriculture and made it practical to cultivate the Plains?
The harsh dry climate and densely packed soil ofthe Great Plains required new farming methods and technological innovations in order for settlement to begin. One new farming method, called dry farming, was to plant seeds deep in the ground, where there was enough moisture for them to grow. By the 1860s, Plains farmers were using steel plows, threshing machines, seed drills, and reapers. These new machines made dry farming possible. Still, soil on the Plains could blow away during a dry season. As the population grew, the impact of the sodbusters, as those who plowed the Plains were called, helped change the environment. Many farmers eventually lost their homesteads through the combined effects of drought, wind erosion of the soil they had loosened, and overuse ofthe land.
Large landholders could buy mechanical reapers and steam tractors that made it easier to harvest a large crop. Threshing machines knocked kernels loose from the stalks. Mechanical binders tied the stalks into bundles for collection. These innovations were well suited for harvesting wheat, a crop that could endure the dry conditions of the Plains.
During the 1880s, many farmers from the states of the old Northwest Territory moved to the Great Plains to take advantage of the inexpensive land and new technology. The Wheat Belt began at the eastern edge of the Great Plains and covered much of the Dakotas and parts of Nebraska and Kansas. The new machines allowed a family to bring in a substantial harvest on a wheat farm of several hundred acres. Some wheat farms covered up to 65,000 acres. These were called bonanza farms because they yielded big profits. Like mine owners, bonanza farmers formed companies, invested in property and equipment, and hired laborers as needed.
104
Farmers Fall on Hard Times
The bountiful harvests in the Wheat Belt helped the United States become the world’s leading exporter of wheat by the 1880s. Then things began to go wrong. A severe drought struck the Plains in the late 1880s, destroying crops and ruining the soil. In addition, competition from other wheat-producing nations increased. By the 1890s, a glut of wheat on the world market caused prices to drop.
Some farmers tried to make it through these difficult times by mortgaging their land—that is,
they borrowed money from a bank based on the value of their land. If they failed to meet their mortgage payments, they forfeited the land to the bank. Some who lost their land continued to work it as tenant farmers, renting the land from its new owners. By 1900, tenants cultivated about one-third of the farms on the Plains.
Technology helped make it possible to farm the vast open grasslands of America. Here, horse-drawn farm equipment is used to gather hay in the 1880s.
Closing the Frontier
On April 22, 1889, the government opened one of the last large territories for settlement. Within hours, thousands of people raced to stake claims in an event known as the Oklahoma Land Rush. The next year, the Census Bureau reported that there was no longer a true frontier left in America. In reality, there was still a lot of unoccupied land, and the Homestead Act continued to encourage new settlement into the 1900s, but the “closing of the frontier” marked the end of an era. It worried many people, including historian Frederick Jackson Turner. Turner believed that the frontier had provided a “safety-valve of social discontent.” It was a place where Americans could always make a fresh start.
Most settlers did indeed make a fresh start, adapting to the difficult environment of the Plains. Water from their deep wells enabled them to plant trees and gardens. Railroads brought lumber and brick to replace sod as a building material, coal for fuel, and manufactured goods from the East, such as clothes and household goods. Small-scale farmers rarely became wealthy, but they could be self-sufficient. Typical homesteaders raised cattle, chickens, and a few crops. The real story of the West was about ordinary people who settled down and built homes and communities through great effort.

Interpreting Statistics
Why Learn This Skill?
Statistics are collections of data. They are often presented in charts and graphs and play an important role in inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is when we use evidence to make broad generalizations. Inductive reasoning does not prove something is true. Instead, when you reach a conclusion through inductive reasoning, you decide how probable, or likely, it is to be true. Inductive arguments can be strong or weak, not right or wrong. They help us make predictions and form hypotheses that we can test to see if they are true. Learning to interpret statistics improves inductive reasoning and helps us make better predictions. Learning the Skill
Use the following steps to help you interpret statistical information:
•	Scan the chart or graph, reading the titles and labels to get an idea of what is being shown.
•	Examine the statistics shown, looking for increases and decreases, similarities and differences.
•	Look for a correlation. When two pieces of data appear to be related, we say there is a correlation between them. In a positive correlation, as one number rises, the other number rises. In a negative correlation, as one number rises, the other number falls. For example, the percentage of overweight people has increased since 1970. At the same time the percentage of people living in the suburbs has also increased since 1970. There is a positive correlation between these two numbers.
•	Determine the conclusions you can draw. A correlation does not imply causation. Just because two numbers appear to have a relationship does not mean the one set of data causes the other. Using the example above, you might think being overweight makes you live in the suburbs. But you have to ask whether that is probable. In this case, it seems more likely there are independent reasons causing both numbers to rise. On the other hand, using inductive reasoning,
TEKS 30C, 31B
we can create a hypothesis to explain the relationship. For example, living in the suburbs might mean people exercise less because they don't walk to work. Asa result, they gain weight. Having used the statistics to create a hypothesis, wecannoi use other means to check if it is true.

Struggles ofthe Plains Indians
guiding question Howdid westward migration change the Plains Indians'way of life?
For centuries the Great Plains were home to many groups of Native Americans. Some lived in farming and hunting communities, but many were nomads who roamed the land following their main source of food—the buffalo. The Plains Indian nations were divided into bands, ranging from a few dozen to several hundred people, who lived in extended family groups and respected nature.
The settlers who migrated to the Plains deprived these Native Americans of their hunting grounds, broke treaties that guaranteed them land, and often forced them to relocate. Native Americans resisted by attacking settlers’ property and occasionally going to war with them.
The Dakota Sioux Uprising
In 1862 the Dakota people (part of the Sioux) had a conflict with the settlers in Minnesota. The Sioux had agreed to live on a reservation in exchange for annuities that frequently never reached them. At the time, many Dakota lived in poverty and faced starvation. When local traders refused to provide food on credit, the Dakota protested by launching a rebellion that killed hundreds of settlers.
A military tribunal sentenced more than 300 Dakota to death after the uprising. After reviewing the evidence, however, President Lincoln reduced the number condemned to death to 38. Others fled the reservation when federal troops arrived and became exiles in a region that bore their name—the Dakota Territory.

Red Cloud's War
The Dakota Territory was home to another group of Sioux, the Lakota, nomads who had won control of their hunting grounds from other Native Americans. Their chiefs were Red Cloud, Crazy Horse, and Sitting Bull. In December 1866, the U.S. Army was building forts along the Bozeman Trail, the path to the Montana gold mines. Crazy Horse tricked the fort’s commander into sending Captain William Fetterman and about 80 soldiers out to pursue what they thought was a small raiding party.
Hundreds of waiting warriors wiped out the unit, an event that becam known as Fetterman’s Massacre, marking the start of “Red Cloud’s War.” The Sioux continued to resist any military presence in the region, and in 1868 the army abandoned its posts along the trail.
Native Americans are attacked by U.S. troops at Sand Creek.

Sand Creek Massacre
In Colorado, tensions began to rise in the 1860s between miners entering the territory in search of silver and gold and the Cheyenne and Arapaho who alre; lived there. As the number of settlers increased, bands of Native Americans began raiding wagon trains and ranches. By the summer of 1864, dozens of homes had been burned and an estimated 200 settlers killed. The governor persuaded the Native Americans to surrender at Fort Lyon, where he promise food and protection. Those who failed to report would be subject to attack
Although a number of Native Americans surrendered, many others did not. In November 1864, Chief Black Kettle brought several hundred Cheyenne to the fort to negotiate a peace deal. Fort Lyon’s commander, Major Scott Anthony, allowed the chief to make camp at nearby SandCre while he awaited orders. Shortly afterward, Colonel John Chivington oftl Colorado Volunteers attacked Black Kettle’s camp, even though the Cheyenne were there to negotiate.
What actually happened at Sand Creek is unclear. Some witnesses stated that Black Kettle had been flying both an American flag and a white flag of truce, which Chivington ignored. Others reported that the American troops fired on the unsuspecting Native Americans and then brutally murdered hundreds of women and children. Still others described a savage battle in which both sides fought ferociously for two days. Few soldiers died, but the number of Native Americans reported killed varied from 69 to 600. Thetn of what happened at Sand Creek is still debated.

A
Doomed Plan for Peace As conflicts escalated with Native Americans, Congress took action. In 1 Congress formed an Indian Peace Commission, which proposed creating two large reservations on the Plains, one for the Sioux and another for Native Americans of the southern Plains. Federal agents would run the reservations, and the army would deal with any groups that refused to report or remain there.
The Indian Peace Commission’s plan was doomed to failure. Althouj negotiators pressured Native American leaders into signing treaties, they could not ensure that those leaders or their followers would abide by th< Nor could anyone prevent settlers from violating their terms. The Native Americans who did move to reservations faced many ofthe same con itions that drove the Dakota Sioux to violence—poverty, despair, ar the corrupt practices of American traders.

The Last Native American Wars
guidingquestion IVere Native Americans justified in leaving the reservations and refusing further relocation by the government?
By the 1870s, many Native Americans had left the reservations in disgust. They preferred hunting buffalo on the open plains. The buffalo were rapidly disappearing, however, as professional buffalo hunters sought hides for markets in the East and other hunters killed for sport. When buffalo blocked rail traffic, the railroads killed them and fed the meat to workers. The army, determined to force Native Americans onto reservations, encouraged buffalo killing. By 1889, very few buffalo remained.
Battle of the Little Bighorn
In 1876 prospectors overran the Lakota Sioux reservation in the Dakota Territory to mine gold in the Black Hills. The Lakota saw no reason to abide by a treaty that settlers were violating, so many left the reservation to hunt near the Bighorn Mountains in Montana. The government responded by sending an expedition accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer and the Seventh Cavalry. Custer underestimated the fighting capabilities of the Lakota and the Cheyenne. On June 25, 1876, he launched an attack on one of the largest groups of Native American warriors ever assembled on the Great Plains. The Native American forces rapidly defeated Custer and his more than 200 soldiers, killing them all. Newspaper accounts portraying Custer as a victim of a massacre produced a public outcry in the East, and

George Custer (1839-1876)
George Custer graduated at the bottom of his West Point class, but through heroism during the Civil War, he became a general at age 23. The Cheyenne called him "Yellow Hair" because he wore his curly blond hair to his shoulders. President Grant removed Custer from his post for testifying about corruption in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but he was soon reinstated—a decision that cost him his life and those of his troops.
the army stepped up its campaign on the Plains. Sitting Bull and his followers fled to Canada, but the other Lakota were forced to return to the reservation and give up the Black Hills.
Flight of the Nez Perce
Farther west, the Nez Perce people, led by Chief Joseph, refused to be moved to a smaller reservation in Idaho in 1877. When the army came to relocate them, they fled their homes and embarked on a journey of more than 1,300 miles. Finally, in October 1877, Chief Joseph acknowledged that the struggle was over. He and his followers were then exiled to Oklahoma. Tragedy at Wounded Knee
Native American resistance came to a final, tragic end on the Lakota Sioux reservation in 1890. Defying government orders, the Lakota continued to perform the Ghost Dance, a ritual that celebrated a hoped-for day of reckoning when settlers would disappear, the buffalo would return, and Native Americans would be reunited with their dead ancestors.
Federal authorities had banned the ceremony, fearing it would lead to violence. They blamed the latest defiance on Sitting Bull, who had returnee from Canada, and sent police to arrest the chief. Sitting Bull’s supporters tried to stop the arrest. In the exchange of gunfire that followed, Sitting Bu was killed and a group of Ghost Dancers fled the reservation. On Decembei 29, 1890, a battle ensued at Wounded Knee ('reek in South Dakota, taking the lives of 25 U.S. soldiers and approximately 200 Lakota men, women, and children.
Americanization and the Dawes Act
Some Americans had long opposed the mistreatment of Native Americans. In her 1881 book A Century of Dishonor, Helen Hunt Jackson detailed the years of broken promises and injustices. Her descriptions of events such as the Sand Creek Massacre sparked new debate on the issue. Some Americans believed the solution was Americanization. They thought that Native Americans should be encouraged to abandon their traditional tribal culture and assimilate into American society by learning English, adopting Anieric culture and values, and eventually becoming American citizens. Beginning in the 1880s, the Bureau of Indian Affairs sponsored the creation of Indian

Due to a cumbersome system of handling the administration of Indian laws, the agents of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) had many opportunities for personal enrichment and an invitation for large-scale corruption. Secretary ofthe Interior Carl Schurz attempted to cleanse the BIA of corruption and prevent the War Department from regaining management of Indian affairs.

boarding schools separate from reservations. By 1902, some 25 schools had been set up. Officials then pressured parents to send children to these schools. There they were required to speak English, choose an English name, dress in American-style clothes, cut their hair to match American styles, attend church, and learn vocational skills. Over time the schools became controversial. They were often underfunded and poorly maintained, and discipline was strict. Some students found the schools repressive, and many cases of abuse were reported.
A second Americanization strategy was to encourage Native Americans to abandon the reservation system and become independent landowners. In 1887 Congress passed the Dawes Act, which altered the reservation system by dividing reservation land into allotments for farming or ranching.
Under the act, 160 acres were allotted to each head of household, 80 acres to each single adult, and 40 acres to each child. Any land remaining after allotments would be sold to American settlers, with the proceeds going into a trust for Native Americans. Citizenship would be granted to Native Americans who stayed on their allotments for 25 years.
While some Native Americans succeeded as farmers or ranchers, many had little training or enthusiasm for either pursuit. They often found their allotments too small to be profitable, so they leased them. In addition, some Native American groups had grown attached to their reservations and hated to see them divided into homesteads. Few stayed long enough to qualify for citizenship.
In the end, the assimilation policy proved a dismal failure. Native American culture on the Plains was doomed because it depended on buffalo for food, clothing, fuel, and shelter. When the herds were wiped out, there was no way to sustain the traditional way of life. Although the Dawes Act failed in its goals, American reformers continued to advocate for assimilation. In the early 1900s, reform groups such as the Friends of the Indians and the Indian Rights Association began to push for citizenship for all Native Americans believing it would encourage greater assimilation. Finally, in 1924 Congress passed the Citizenship Act, granting all Native Americans citizenship. In 1934 the Indian Reorganization Act reversed the Dawes Act’s policy of assimilation. It restored some reservation lands, gave Native Americans control over those lands, and permitted them to elect their own governments.

Inventions, such as the telephone and the lightbulb, spurred economic development. Railroads accelerated the nation's industrialization and linked the country together. Corporations could produce goods more efficiently. With industrialization came the benefits of new products versus the struggles of low wages, long hours, and difficult working conditions.

C

g u i di ng qLi estion Why was the United States successful at industrialization?
Although the Industrial Revolution reached the United States in the early 1800s, most Americans still lived on (arms when the Cavil War began in 1861. After the war, industry rapidly expanded, and millions of Americans left their farms to work in mines and factories. By the early 1900s, the United States was the world s leading industrial nation. Its gross national product (GNP) —the total value of all goods and services that a country produces during a year—was roughly three times greater than it had been in the late 1860s. Natural Resources
An abundance of raw materials was one reason for the nation's industrial success. The United States had vast natural resources, including timber, coal, iron, and copper. This meant that American companies could obtain resources cheaply and did not have to impor them from other countries. Many of these resources were located in the American West. The settlement of the West helped accelerate industrialization, as did the transcontinental railroad. Railroads took settlers and miners to the West and carried resources back to the Eas
At the same time, people began using a new resource: petroleum. Even before the automotive age, petroleum was in high demand becam it could be turned into kerosene. The American oil industry was built on the demand for kerosene, a fuel used in lanterns and stoves. The industry began in western Pennsylvania, where residents had long noticed oil bubbling to the surface of area springs and streams. In 1859 Edwin Drake drilled the first oil well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, and by 1900, oil fields had been drilled from Pennsylvania to Texas. As oil production rose, it fueled economic expansion.
118
A
Large Workforce The human resources available to American industry were as important as natural resources in enabling the nation to industrialize rapidly. Between 1860 and 1910, the population ofthe United States nearly tripled. This population growth provided industry with a large workforce and created greater demand for consumer goods.
Population growth stemmed from two sources—large families and a flood of immigrants. Because of better living conditions, more children survived and grew to adulthood. At the same time, social and economic conditions in parts of Europe and China convinced many people to immigrate to the United States in search of a better life. Between 1870 and 1910, more than 17 million immigrants arrived in the United States.

MAKING INFERENCES
What can you infer about the difficulties that inventors faced
during the late 1800s?
to invent new products and to improve products invented by others. He first achieved international fame in 1877 with the invention of the phonograph. Two years later he perfected the electric generator and the light bulb. His laboratory then went on to invent or improve several other devices, including the battery and the motion picture. In 1882, Owen Latimer, who worked for Edison, invented a process for making cheap long-lasting carbon filaments for light bulbs. With this invention, electric lighting became increasingly affordable. In 1889 several Edison companies merged to form the Edison General Electric Company (today known as GE).
The revolution in electricity took another step forward when engineer George Westinghouse developed an alternating current (AC) system to distribute electricity over long distances using transformers and generators. With this innovation, electricity began to improve living standards rapidly. City streets became safer as streetlights were installed. Electric trolley cars improved commute times to work, and new electric devices in the home made domestic chores easier and less time consuming. AC current and transformers are still used today to distribute electricity.
Innovation using electricity also launched a revolution in communication In 1874 Alexander Graham Bell began experimenting with ways to transmit sound via an electric current of varying intensity. In 1876 he succeeded. His device, which became known as the telephone, transformed communication and helped improve the nation’s standard of living, f amily members could quickly get in touch with each other; businesses could place orders much more quickly, and news of events that might shape personal and business choices could be obtained in time for better decisions to be made. In 1877 Be founded the Bell Telephone Company, which eventually became the America Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T).

In ways big and small, technology improved the standard of living. Shortly after the Civil War, Thaddeus Lowe invented an ice-making machine—

enabling people to obtain low-cost ice year round for ice boxes that kept food fresh. A few years later, in the early 1870s, Gustavus Swift hired an engineer to develop a refrigerated railroad car. Swift shipped the first refrigerated load of fresh meat in 1877. The widespread use of refrigerated shipping containers enabled fresh food, especially meat, to be shipped long distances. As a result, the price of food began to drop and the quality of food people could obtain year round rose dramatically.
The pace of innovation continued rapidly throughout the late 1800s. In 1873, Christopher Scholes invented the typewriter. In 1886, Josephine Cochrane developed the automatic dishwasher. In 1888 George Eastman patented the first handheld camera—the Kodak camera. In 1893, Frank and Charles Duryea built the first gasoline-powered carriage. Power-driven sewing machines and cloth cutters rapidly moved the clothing business from small tailor shops to large factories. Similar changes took place in shoemaking. Large factories began using new processes and inventions to mass-produce shoes efficiently and inexpensively and could pass those savings on to their customers in the form of lower prices. By the early 1900s, tailors and cobblers had nearly disappeared. Prices of many other products also dropped as the United States industrialized.

Evaluating Which invention do you think has had the most lasting influence?
Free Enterprise
guidingquestion Howdid laissez-faire economics promote industrialization?
Another important reason the United States industrialized rapidly was the nation’s free enterprise system. In the late 1800s, the profit motive attracted many people of high ability and ambition into business. Entrepreneurs— people who risk their capital in organizing and running a business— believed they could make money in manufacturing and transportation.
Many of the new inventions that transformed society would not have been possible without entrepreneurs willing to risk their money to help develop and implement their inventions. Many entrepreneurs from New England, who had accumulated money by investing in trade, fishing, and textile mills, invested their money in factories and railroads. An equally important source of private capital was Europe, especially Great Britain. Foreign investors saw great opportunities for profit in the United States.
The Benefits of Laissez-Faire
Part of what attracted entrepreneurs to invest in American businesses was society’s and government’s support in principle for the idea of laissez-faire (leh.say.FAR), a French phrase meaning “let people do as they choose.” Supporters of laissez-faire believe that the government should not interfere in the economy other than to protect private property rights and maintain peace. They argue that if the government regulates the economy, it increases costs and eventually hurts society more than it helps.
Laissez-faire relies on supply and demand rather than the government to regulate wages and prices. Supporters believe a free market with competing companies leads to greater efficiency and creates more wealth for everyone. Laissez-faire advocates also support low taxes and limited government debt to ensure that private individuals, not the government, will make most of the decisions about how the nation’s wealth is spent.

The Government's Relationship to Business
In many ways, the United States practiced laissez-faire economics in the 1; 1800s. State and federal governments kept taxes and spending low. Theyd not impose costly regulations on industry or try to control wages andprfc In the late 1800s, the United States was also one of the largest free trade areas in the world. Unlike Europe, which was divided into dozens of countries, each with tariffs, the entire United States was open to trade. Th Constitution bans states from imposing tariffs, and there were few regulations on commerce or immigration. Supporters of laissez-faire say these factors played a major role in the country’s rapid economic growth.
In other ways, however, the government went beyond laissez-faire an< introduced policies intended to promote business. Since the early 1800s, leaders in the North and the South had different ideas about the proper ri of the government in the economy. Northern leaders wanted high tariffs I protect manufacturers from foreign competition and supported federal subsidies for companies building roads, canals, and railroads. Southern leaders opposed subsidies and favored low tariffs to promote trade and tc keep the cost of imported goods low.
The Civil War ended the debate. After the southern states seceded,th Republican-controlled Congress passed the Morrill Tariff greatly increasi tariff rates. By 1865, tariffs had nearly tripled. Congress also gave vast tra of western land and nearly $65 million in loans to western railroads and public lands with mineral resources for much less than their market valu Historians still debate whether these policies helped the economy grow.
High tariffs, however, contradicted laissez-faire ideas. When the nati raised tariffs on foreign goods, other countries raised their tariffs on American goods. This hurt American companies trying to sell goods abr particularly farmers who sold their products overseas. Despite these problems, many business leaders and members ot Congress believed tari were necessary. Few believed that new American industries could comp< with established European factories without tariffs to protect them. Late the early 1900s, after American companies had become large and efficiei business leaders began to push for free trade. They believed they could r compete internationally and win sales in foreign markets.

Linking the Nation
guiding question How did the transcontinental railroad transform the West?
In 1865 the United States had about 35,000 miles of railroad track, almost all of it east of the Mississippi River. After the Civil War, railroad construction expanded dramatically. By 1900, the United States had more than 200,000 miles of track.
The Transcontinental Railroad
The railroad boom began in 1862 with the Pacific Railway Act. This act gave two corporations—the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific—permission to build a transcontinental railroad. It also offered each company land along its right-of-way.
Under the direction of engineer Grenville Dodge, a former Union general, the Union Pacific Railroad began pushing westward from Omaha, Nebraska, in 1865. The railroad workers of the Union Pacific included Civil War veterans, newly recruited Irish immigrants, frustrated miners and farmers, cooks, adventurers, and ex-convicts. At the height of the project, the Union Pacific employed about 10,000 workers.
The Central Pacific Railroad began as the dream of engineer Theodore Judah. He sold stock in his fledgling Central Pacific Railroad Company to four Sacramento merchants: Leland Stanford, Charley Crocker, Mark Hopkins, and Collis P. Huntington. These “Big Four” eventually made huge fortunes. Stanford became governor of California, served as a U.S. senator, and founded Stanford University. Because of a shortage of labor in California, the Central Pacific Railroad hired about 10,000 workers from China. It paid them

Workers completed the transcontinental railroad in only four years, de the physical challenges. Each mile of track required 400 rails, and each rail 10 spikes. The Central Pacific, starting from the west, laid a total of 688 mi track. The Union Pacific laid 1,086 miles. On May 10, 1869, hundreds of spectators gathered at Promontory Summit, Utah.

Railroads Spur Growth
The transcontinental railroad was the first of many lines that began crisscrossing the nation after the Civil War. By linking the nation, rail increased the markets for many products, spurring industrial growth. Railroad companies also stimulated the economy by spending huge amounts of money on steel, coal, timber, and other materials.
Large rail companies consolidated hundreds of small, unconnected railroads to create large, integrated railroad systems. Meanwhile, new locomotive technology and the invention of air brakes enabled railroat put longer and heavier trains on their lines. When combined with the i integrated rail systems, operations became so ef f icient that the average per mile for a ton of freight dropped from two cents in I860 to three-quarters of a cent in 1900.
Railroads Help Close the Frontier
Building railroad lines often required more money than most private investors could raise on their own. To encourage railroad constructioi across the Great Plains, the federal government gave land grants to m railroad companies. The railroads then sold the land to settlers, reales companies, and other businesses to raise money to build the railroad. During the 1850s and 1860s the federal land grant system gave railroa< more than 120 million acres of public land, an area larger than New England, New York, and Pennsylvania combined.

including the Union Pacific and Central Pacific, received enough land to cover most of the cost of building their lines.
The land was only valuable, however, if the railroads could sell it. To convince people to move west, railroads and real estate companies offered the land at low prices and provided credit to settlers. Pamphlets, posters, and newspaper advertisements enticed people to move west. The building of the railroads themselves offered further encouragement, as settlers no longer had to migrate the entire distance on their own. They could take the train to a location near the land they bought. In all of these ways, the railroads helped move settlers onto the Great Plains and thereby close the American frontier.

Robber Barons
guiding question Howdid government grants to build railroads result in large-scale corruption?
The great wealth many railroad entrepreneurs acquired in the late 1800s led to accusations that they had built their fortunes by swindling investors and taxpayers, bribing officials, and cheating on their contracts and debts. Jay Gould was perhaps the most notoriously corrupt railroad owner who practiced “insider trading” and manipulated stock prices. Bribery occurred frequently, partly because government was so deeply entangled in funding the railroads. Railroad investors discovered they could make more money by selling free government land grants than by operating a railroad and some bribed political representatives to vote for more grants.

JAY GOULD: ROBBER BARON
Railroad owners became condemned as robber barons as the American public increasingly began to suspect them of bribery, cheating, and swindling.
The Credit Mobilier Scandal
Corruption in the railroad industry became public in 1872 with the Credit Mobilier scandal. Credit Mobilier was a construction company set up by several stockholders of the Union Pacific Railroad, including Oakes Ames, a member of Congress. To convince Congress to give the railroad more grants, Ames sold other members of Congress shares at a price well below their market value.
During the election campaign of 1872, a letter appeared in the New YorkSiu
listing members of Congress who had bought shares. 1 he Credit Mobilier scandal produced widespread anger and led to the impression that railroad entrepreneurs were “robber barons”—people who loot an industry and become
rich unethically.
The Great Northern Railroad
Not all railroad men were robber barons. James J. Hill was clearly not. Hill built the Great Northern Railroad from Wisconsin and Minnesota to
Washington state without any federal land grants or subsidies. He planned the railroads route to pass by existing towns in the region and offered low fares to settlers who homesteaded along his route. He also identified products that were in demand in China, including cotton, textiles, and flou and hauled those goods to Washington to ship to Asia. This way, his railroa efficiently hauled goods both east and west, instead of simply sending good east and coming back empty like other railroads. The Great Northern became the most successful transcontinental railroad and one ofthe few railroads ofthe time that was not eventually forced into bankruptcy.

It Matters Because
Following the Civil War, large corporations developed that could consolidate business functions and produce goods more efficiently. Retailers began using new techniques to attract consumers.
The Rise of Big Business
guiding question What advantages do large corporations have over small businesses?
By 1900, big business dominated the economy, operating vast complexes of factories and distribution facilities. The corporation, an organization owned by many people but treated by law as though it were a person, made big business possible. Stockholders own corporations through shares of ownership called stock. Selling stock allows a corporation to raise money while spreading out the financial risk. Before the 1830s, few corporations existed because entrepreneurs had to convince state legislatures to issue them charters. In the 1830s, however, states began allowing companies to become corporations and issue stock without a charter from the legislature.
The freedom to form a corporation was one of the great benefits of the laissez-faire approach to economics in the later half of the 1800s. With the money raised from selling stock, corporations could invest in new technologies, hire large workforces, and purchase machines. This greatly increased their efficiency. They achieved economies of scale, in which the cost of manufacturing is decreased by producing goods quickly in large quantities.
All businesses have fixed costs and operating costs. Fixed costs are costs a company pays even if it is not operating (loans, mortgages, and taxes). Operating costs are incurred when running a company (wages, shipping costs, buying raw materials). Small manufacturers usually had low fixed costs but high operating costs. If sales dropped, it was cheaper to shut down temporarily. Big manufacturers, however, had the high fixed costs of building and maintaining a factory, while operating costs were low. Operating

costs, such as wages, were such a small part of total costs that it made sense
to continue operating, even in a recession.
In these circumstances, big corporations had several advantages. They could produce more goods at a lower cost and could stay open in bad economic times by cutting prices to increase sales. Rebates from the railroads further lowered their operating costs. Of course, this also led eventually to one ofthe major costs of laissez-faire economics: small businesses, many family owned, that could not compete with large corporations were forced out of business.

Consolidating Industry
guidingquestion What new business strategies allowed businesses to weaken or eliminate competition
Although a laissez-faire economy benefited consumers because the intense competition led to falling prices, business leaders did not like the intense competition that had been forced on them. Cutting prices to beat the competition also cut into profits. This situation demonstrated one ofthe potential costs of laissez-faire. With no regulations governing their competition, companies were also free to make deals with each other to fix prices by organizing pools, or agreements to keep prices at a certain level. Another term for a pool that is used today is cartel.
American courts and legislatures, however, were suspicious of pools because they interfered with competition and property rights. As a result, even though the laissez-faire economy meant that companies could try to fi prices, companies that formed pools found that it also meant they had no legal protection and could not enforce their pool agreements in court. Asa result pools generally broke apart whenever one member cut prices to steal

Andrew Carnegie and Steel
The remarkable life of Andrew Carnegie illustrates the rise of big business in the United States. A Scottish immigrant, Carnegie went to work at age 12 in a textile factory. He worked his way up to become secretary to Thomas Scott, a superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad. When Scott was promoted, Carnegie became the new superintendent.
Carnegie bought shares in iron mills and factories that made sleeping cars and railroad locomotives, as well as a company that built railroad bridges. By his early 30s, he quit his job to concentrate on his investments. As part of his business activities, Carnegie often traveled to Europe. On one trip, he met Sir Henry Bessemer, who had invented a new process for making high quality steel efficiently and cheaply. After meeting Bessemer, Carnegie opened a steel mill in Pittsburgh in 1875 and began using the
Bessemer process. He boasted about how cheaply he could produce steel:

To make his company more efficient, Carnegie began the vertical integration of the steel industry. A vertically integrated company owns all of the different businesses on which it depends for its operation. Instead of paying companies for coal, lime, and iron, Carnegies steel company bought coal mines, limestone quarries, and iron ore fields. Vertical integration saved money and enabled many companies to expand.
Rockefeller and Standard Oil
Successful business leaders also pushed for horizontal integration, or combining many firms engaged in the same type of business into one large

Perhaps the most famous example of an industrialist who achieved almo complete horizontal integration of his industry is John D. Rockefeller. Through a series of buyouts, Rockefeller’s Standard Oil began to horizontally integrate the oil industry.

New Business Organizations
Many Americans feared monopolies because they believed that a monopol could charge whatever it wanted for its products. They argued that one of the costs of laissez-faire economics was that it created large powerful corporations that could control prices, and manipulate politicians and laws to ensure that they did not face any new competition.
Supporters of laissez-faire disagreed. They asserted that monopolies ha to keep prices low because raising prices would allow competitors to reappear and offer products at a lower price. In some industries, even though a company had a near monopoly in the United States, it was not really a monopoly because it was competing on a global scale. Standard Oi for example, came very close to having a monopoly in the United States, bi it was competing against European oil companies and the competition forced the company to keep its prices low in the late 1800s and early 1900s
Trusts In the late 1800s, in an effort to stop horizontal integration and the ris of monopolies, many states made it illegal for one company to own stock in another company. It did not take long, however, for companies to find ways around the laws. In 1882 Standard Oil formed the first trust, a new way of merging businesses that did not violate the law. A trust is a legal arrangement that allows one person to manage another person’s property. The person who manages that property is called a trustee.
Instead of buying a company outright, Standard Oi 1 had stockholders give their stocks to a group of Standard Oil trustees. In exchange, the stockholders received shares in the trust, which entitled them to a portion the trust’s profits. Since the trustees did not own the stock but were merely managing it, they were not violating any laws. The trustees could control a group of companies as if they were one large merged company.
Holding Companies In 1889 the state of New Jersey further accelerated the rise of big business with a new incorporation law. This law allowed corporatioi set up in New Jersey to own stock in other businesses. Many companies immediately used the law to create holding companies. A holding company does not produce anything. Instead, it owns the stock of companies that do produce goods. The holding company manages the companies it owns, effectively merging them into one large enterprise.
Investment Banking Another increase in the size of corporations began in the 1890s, when investment bankers began helping to create holding compank Investment bankers specialized in helping companies issue stock. Companies would sell large blocks of stock to investment bankers at a discount. The bankers would then find the investors and sell the stock for a profit. Perhaps th most successful investment banker was J. P. Morgan.
In the mid-1890s, investment bankers began merging many of America arge corporations into holding companies and then selling their stock. In 1901, J.P. Morgan bought out Andrew Carnegie. He then merged Carnegie
Steel with other large steel companies into an enormous
holding company called the United States Steel Company. U.S.
Steel was worth $1.4 billion, the first billion-dollar company
in American history.
Seiling the Product
The creation of giant manufacturing companies in the United States pushed retailers to expand in size as well. The vast array of products that American industries produced led retailers to look for new ways to attract consumers. N. W.
Ayer and Son, the first advertising company, began creating large illustrated ads instead of relying on the old small print line ads previously used in newspapers. By 1900, retailers were spending over $90 million a year on advertising in newspapers and magazines.
Advertising attracted readers to the newest retail business, the department store. In 1877 advertisements billed John Wanamaker s new Philadelphia department store, the Grand Depot, as the “largest space in the world devoted to retail selling on a single floor.” When it opened, only a handful of department stores existed in the United States.
Soon hundreds sprang up, providing a huge selection of products in one large building.
Chain stores, a group of retail outlets owned by the same company, first appeared in the mid-1800s. In contrast to department stores, chain stores such as Woolworth’s focused on offering low prices.
To reach the millions of people who lived in rural areas, retailers began issuing mail-order catalogs. Two of the largest mail-order retailers were Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck and Co. Their huge catalogs were widely distributed through the mail. They used attractive illustrations and appealing descriptions to advertise thousands of items for sale.

Working in the United States
Why did workers try to form unions in the late 1800s?
There were many benefits of laissez-faire economics in the late 1800s, including rapid industrialization, dramatic innovation, and improving standard of living, but the laissez-faire idea that governments should avoid regulating the economy had costs as we Working conditions in factories and mines were difficult and ofter dangerous. Many workers performed dull, repetitive tasks in dangerous, unhealthy working conditions. Workers breathed in lir dust, and toxic fumes. Heavy machines lacking safety devices led t injuries. With no regulations governing workplace safety or trainii requirements, workers had no recourse when they were poorly treated other than to quit and look for a new job.
Despite these conditions, industrialism led to a dramatic rise i the standard of living. The average worker’s wages rose by 50 perc between 1860 and 1890. Nevertheless, the uneven division of incc between the wealthy and the working class caused resentment am workers. In 1900 the average industrial worker made 22C per hou and worked 59 hours per week.
Deflation, or a rise in the value of money, added to tensions. Between 1865 and 1897, deflation caused prices to fall, which increa: the buying power of workers’ wages. Although companies cut wages regularly in the late 1800s, prices fell even faster, so that wages were actually still going up in buying power. Workers, however, resented getting less money. Eventually, many concluded that they needed a union to bargain for higher wages and better working conditions.
i
Early Unions
There were two basic types of industrial workers in the United States in the 1800s craft workers and common laborers. Craft workers, such as machinists, iron molders, stonecutters, shoemakers, and printers, had special skills and training. They received higher wages and had more control over their time. Common laborers had few skills and received lower wages.
In the 1830s, as industrialization began to spread, craft workers began to form trade unions. By 1873, there were 30 national trade unions in the United States. Among the largest and most successful were the Iron Molders’ International Union, the International Typographical Union, and the Knights of St. Crispin—the shoemakers’ union.

Opposition to Unions
Employers often had to negotiate with trade unions because the unions represented workers whose skills they needed. Employers, however, generally viewed unions as conspiracies that interfered with property rights. Business leaders particularly opposed industrial unions, which united all the workers in a particular industry.
Companies used several techniques to stop workers from forming unions. They required workers to take oaths or sign contracts promising not to join a union. They hired detectives to identify union organizers. Workers who tried to organize a union or strike were fired and placed on a blacklist—a list of “troublemakers”—so that no company would hire them. Companies used "lockouts" to break up existing unions. They locked workers out of the property and refused to pay them. If the union called a strike, employers would hire replacements, or strikebreakers.
Efforts to break unions often succeeded because there were no laws giving

workers the right to form unions or requiring owners to negotiate with them. Government policies toward unions did not really reflect a commitment to laissez-faire economics. Instead of staying out of economic disputes, and allowing workers to confront owners and work out their disagreements on their own, the government’s relationship toward business shifted toward policies that supported business owners and impeded the development of unions. Courts frequently ruled that strikes were “conspiracies in restraint of trade” for which and labor leaders were often fined or jailed. Eventually even state militias and federal troops would be used to break up strikes.

Industrialization 133
Part ofthe reason for the government’s objection to unions and collective action by workers was the perception that unions were un-American. In the 1800s, the ideas of Karl Nlarx, called bdarxism, became very influential in Europe. Marx argued that the basic force shaping capitalist society was the class struggle between workers and owners. He believed that workers would eventually revolt, seize control of the factorie: and overthrow the government. Eventually, Marx thought, the state would disappear, leaving a communist society where classes did not exist.
While many labor supporters agreed with Marx, a few supported anarchism. Anarchists believe that society does not need any government. In the late 1800s, anarchists assassinated government officials and setoff bombs across Europe, hoping to begin a revolution.
During the same period, tens of thousands of European immigrants headed to America. Anti-immigrant feelings were already strong in the United States and, as people began to associate immigrant workers with radical ideas, they became suspicious of unions. These fears, and concerns for law and order, often led officials to use the courts, the police, and even the army to crush strikes and break up unions.

guidingquestion What made it difficult for union workers to create large industrial unions?
Although workers attempted on many occasions to create large industrial unions, they rarely succeeded. In many cases, the confrontations with owners and the government led to violence and bloodshed.
The Great Railroad Strike
The Panic of 1873 was a severe recession that struck the American economy and forced many companies to cut wages. The economy had still not recovered when, in July 1877, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced it was cutting wages for the third time. In Martinsburg, West Virginia, workers walked off the job and blocked the tracks.
As word spread, railroad workers across the country walked off the job. The strike eventually involved some 80,000 railroad workers and affected two-thirds of the nation’s railways. Angry strikers smashed equipment, tore up tracks, and blocked rail service in New York City, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Chicago. The governors of several states called out their militias. In many places, gun battles erupted between the militia and the strikers.
Declaring a state of “insurrection,” President Rutherford B. Hayes sent federal troops to Martinsburg, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and elsewhere. It took 12 bloody days for police, state militias, and federal troops to restore order. By the time the strike collapsed, more than 100 people lay dead, and over $10 million in railroad property had been destroyed. The violence of this strike alarmed many Americans and only further contributed to the idea that allowing workers to organize was dangerous to society.
The Knights of Labor
The Knights of Labor, founded in 1869, took a different approach to labor issues. Its leader, Terence Powderly, opposed strikes in favor of boycotts and arbitration, in which a third party helps workers and employers reach an agreement. Unlike other unions, the Knights welcomed women and African Americans. They called for an eight-hour workday, equal pay for women, no child labor, and worker-owned factories.
The Haymarket Riot In 1886 supporters of the eight-hour workday called for a nationwide strike on May 1. On May 3, Chicago police intervening in a fight on a picket line opened fire on the strikers, killing four. The next day, about 3,000 people gathered to protest the shootings in Chicago’s Haymarket Square. Someone threw a bomb, police opened fire, and workers shot back, injuring about 170 people and killing 10 policemen. Eight men were arrested for the bombing. Though evidence against them was weak, public anger resulted in eight convictions. Four were executed.
Union critics used the Haymarket riot to claim that dangerous radicals dominated the unions. One of the men arrested was a member of the Knights of Labor. The blow to the Knights’ reputation along with lost strikes led to a decline in their membership and influence.
The Homestead and Pullman Strikes
In the summer of 1892, another labor dispute led to bloodshed. A steel mill owned by Andrew Carnegie in Homestead, Pennsylvania, was managed by Henry Clay Frick, an anti-union business partner. Frick proposed cutting
| wages by 20 percent. He then locked out employees (who were members of | the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers) and had the 1 Pinkerton Detective Agency bring in replacements. When the Pinkertons I and strikebreakers approached the plant, the strikers resisted. Over the next
In 1894 a former quarry foreman named Jacob Coxey organized unemployed workers and began a march on Washington to demand jobs on public works projects. The marchers were known as'Toxey's Army."

closed shop an agreement in which a company agrees to hire only union members
14 hours, Pinkertons and strikers clashed, leaving several dead and dozens injured. The governor of Pennsylvania sent in the militia to protect the strikebreakers, and four months later, the strike collapsed. >
In 1894 the Pullman Palace Car Company slashed workers wages without lowering rents and prices in the company town. American Railway Union (ARU) workers refused to handle Pullman cars, and railroads around to a near halt. Railroad managers arranged to have U.S. mail cars attached to the Pullman cars, and President Cleveland sent in federal troops to keep the mail running. A federal court then issued an injunction, or formal order, to halt the boycott. Both the strike and the ARU collapsed. The Supreme Court later upheld the right to issue such an injunction. This gave business a powerful tool for dealing with labor unrest.

Identifying Central Ideas How did major strikes prevent large industrial unions from maintaining power and influence?
New Unions Emerge
How were the new industrial unions different from the older trade unions?
Although workers often shared the same complaints about wages and working hours, unions took different approaches to how they tried to improve workers’ lives. Trade unions remained the most common type of labor organization, but unskilled workers were not represented by trade unions. New types of unions emerged to support these workers.
Samuel Gompers concentrated his efforts on improving working conditions and believed that a just society was built on a fair labor policy.
Drawing Conclusions How do you
think Gompers would view a society that did not allow labor unions?
The Rise of the AFL
The American Federation of Labor (AFL) was the dominant labor organization of the late 1800s. In 1886 leaders of several national trade un created the AFL. It focused on promoting the interests of skilled workers.
Samuel Gompers was the first president of the AFL, a position heh almost continuously until 1924. While other unions became involved ir politics, Gompers tried to concentrate on “pure and simple” unionism, focusing on wages, working hours, and working conditions. He was willing to use strikes to create change but preferred to negotiate.
The AFL had three main goals. First, it tried to convince companies recognize unions and agree to collective bargaining. Second, it pushed closed shops, meaning that companies could hire only union member: Third, it promoted an eight-hour workday. By 1900, the AFL was the b union in the country with more than 500,000 members. Still, at that ti the AFL represented less than 15 percent of all nonfarm workers. Mos members were white men, because the unions discriminated against African Americans, and only a few would admit women.
i ne iww
In 1905 a group of labor radicals, many of them socialists, created th< Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Nicknamed “the Wobblies,” IWW wanted to organize all workers according to industry, without making distinctions between skilled and unskilled workers. The IW\ endorsed using strikes and declared: “The working class and the

Formulating Questions What is one question that you could ask to begin researching women in the industrial workforce? wage cuts after 10 weeks. The Lawrence strike was the Wobblies’ greatest victory. Most IWW strikes failed. The IWW never gained a large membership, in part because its radical philosophy and controversial strikes led many to condemn the organization.
Women and Organized Labor
After the Civil War, the number of female wage earners began to increase. By 1900, women made up more than 18 percent ofthe labor force. The types of jobs women did outside the home reflected society’s ideas about what constituted “women’s work.”
About one-third of women wage earners worked as domestic servants. Another third worked as teachers, nurses, sales clerks, and office clerical workers. The remaining third were industrial workers, often in the garment industry or food-processing plants.
Women were paid less than men even when they performed the same jobs. It was assumed that a woman had a man helping support her, and that a man needed higher wages in order to support a family. Most unions excluded women.
One of the most famous labor leaders of the era was Mary Harris Jones, also known as “Mother Jones.” Jones worked as a labor organizer for the Knights of Labor before helping organize mine workers. Her public speaking abilities made her a very successful organizer, leading John D. Rockefeller to dub her “the most dangerous woman in America.”
In 1900 Jewish and Italian immigrants who worked in the clothing business in New York City founded the International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union (ILGWU), which represented female and male workers in the women’s clothing industry. Membership expanded rapidly, and in 1909 a strike of some 30,000 garment workers won the ILGWU recognition in the industry, better wages, and benefits for employees.
In 1903 Mary Kenney O’Sullivan and Leonora O’Reilly decided to establish a separate union for women. With the help of Jane Addams and Lillian Wald, they established the Women’s Trade Union League (WTUL), which pushed for an eight-hour workday, a minimum wage, an end to evening work for women, and the abolition of child labor.

CHAPTER 4
Place and Time: United States 1865-1896
Drawn to cities by jobs available in America's growing industries, the urban population of the United States grew from around 10 million in 1870 to more than 30 million by the turn of the century. Immigrants from Europe, Africa, Asia, Canada, Mexico, and South America began looking for better work and a higher standard of living. Rural Americans also began moving to the cities. Industrialization led to urbanization, new political parties, new art and literature, and different ideas about government's role in society. Industrialization brought changes to society, including new social classes and increased segregation for African Americans. New philosophies and movements sprang up to respond to all of these changes.

continued on p. 146
Between 1865, the year the Civil War ended, and 1914, the year World War I began, nearly 25 million people immigrated to the United States. Most, nearly 24 million, came from Europe, but moi than 1.3 million Canadians moved south ofthe border, over 425,0( Latin Americans came north, and more than 450,()()() Asians arrive as well during those years.
European Immigration
Europeans immigrated to the United States for many reasons. Man came because they were poor and American industries had plenty jobs available or because they had special skills. Europe’s industria cities, however, also offered plenty of jobs, so economic factors do not entirely explain why people migrated. Many immigrants came to the United States not just to find work, but to escape the restrictions of social class in Europe that kept them trapped at the bottom of society. In some cases, as in Italy, high rents and a chole: epidemic encouraged people to leave. In Poland and Russia, land shortages, unemployment, high taxes and a long military draft caused emigration. Others, especially Jews living in Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, fled to escape religious persecution. Ellis Island
Most immigrants passed through Ellis Island, a tiny island in New York Harbor. There, a huge three-story building served as the processing center for many of the immigrants arriving from Europ
after 1892. In Ellis Islands enormous hall, crowds of immigrants filed past doctors for an inspection. Those who failed inspection might be separated from their families and returned to Europe. A medical examiner who worked there later described how “hour after hour, ship load after ship load . . . the stream of human beings with its kaleidoscopic variations was . . . hurried through Ellis Island by the equivalent of‘step lively’ in every language of the earth.”
About 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954.
Changing Demographics and Culture
By the late 1890s, more than half of all immigrants entering the United States were from eastern and southern Europe, including Italy, Greece, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Serbia.
This period of immigration is known as “new” immigration.
The “old” immigration, which occurred before 1890, had been primarily of people from northern and western Europe.
This wave of immigrants changed the culture of America’s cities and the demographics of its workforce. Although every immigrant group had some of its members working in every type of job and profession available, certain patterns emerged. Skilled Italian bricklayers and stonemasons contributed to the construction of many homes, churches and buildings in American cities. Polish immigrants often became coal miners, meatpackers and steel workers. Jewish immigrants often worked in the garment industry or as common laborers, although many became merchants as well. Irish immigrants, often among the poorest to arrive in America, frequently ended up as railroad workers, miners, dockworkers, ditch-diggers, and factory workers. And members of all ethnic groups also headed west to settle the Great Plains as farmers and ranchers.
By the 1890s, immigrants made up a large percentage of the population of major cities, including New York, Chicago, Milwaukee, and Detroit. Immigrants lived in neighborhoods that were often separated into ethnic groups, such as “Little Italy” or the Jewish “Lower East Side” in New York City. There they spoke their native languages and re-created the churches,
Immigrants migrated to the United States from all across Europe seeking an opportunity to better their lives.

synagogues, clubs, and newspapers of their homelands. Because immigra tended to settle near others from their homeland, regional demographic patterns also emerged. For example: although there were large numbers c every ethnic group in New York City, Italians, Russians, and Jews were m likely to remain there, while large numbers of Germans, Swedes, and Pole moved to Midwestern cities such as Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and Chicago. Many Germans also moved to Texas to become farmers. Large numbers o Irish settled in the northeast and upper Midwest, and they were the large: ethnic group in Boston.
The wave of immigration in the late 1800s also brought about a cultui shift in American religion. In 1850 Catholics were only five percent ofthe population. By the early 1900s, they made up 17 percent of the total, and had become the single largest religious denomination in the country. Whi there had been Catholics in America from the earliest days when Lord Baltimore founded Maryland colony as a refuge for English Catholics, American culture had been overwhelmingly Protestant in its outlook and religious perspective. That began to change in the late 1800s as the United States became more culturally diverse.
Catholics were not the only contributors to a new religious diversity ii American culture. The large number of Greeks and Russians arriving in tl nation meant that the number of Orthodox Christians began to increase a well. And as persecution mounted in Russia, Poland, and Romania in the 1880s, a mass migration of East European Jews began. Most settled in Nev York City and elsewhere on the east coast, but Jewish communities appear all across the United States. By the early 1920s, nearly 2 million Jews had settled in America.

Asian Immigration
The first large wave of Asian immigration to the United States began in thi years following the Civil War. In the mid-1800s, China was suffering from severe unemployment, poverty, famine, and a civil war, known as the Taiping Rebellion. These problems convinced tens of thousands of Chinest to head to the United States, as did news of the California Gold Rush. Almost all were young men in their teens or twenties seeking work, or hoping to strike it rich in the gold fields.
Chinese immigrants settled mainly in west coast cities, especially San Francisco. Although many headed to the gold fields, most failed to make much money and took jobs as laborers and servants. Some became merchants or skilled at a trade. Many helped build the Central Pacific Railroad. Initially, Asian immigrants arriving in San Francisco were inspected at a two-story shed on the wharf. In 1910, California opened a barracks on Angel Island for Asian immigrants. There immigrants waited, sometimes for months, for their hearings.

immigration in the 1840s and 1850s. By the late 1800s it was focused mainly on Asians, Jews, and eastern Europeans.
Nativists opposed immigration for many reasons. Some feared that the influx of Catholics from countries such as Ireland, Italy, and Poland would swamp the mostly Protestant United States. Many labor unions argued that immigrants undermined American workers because they would work for low wages and accept jobs as strikebreakers.
Nativists Organize
Increased feelings of nativism led to the founding of two major antiimmigrant organizations. The American Protective Association, founded by Henry Bowers in Iowa, in 1887, was an anti-Catholic organization. Its members vowed not to hire or vote for Catholics and the organization lobbied for restrictions of Catholic immigration to the United States. The APA built a large following in the Midwest and Northeast of the United States. On the west coast, where sentiment against the Chinese was very strong, widespread racial violence erupted. Denis Kearney, an Irish immigrant, formed the Workingman’s Party of California to fight Chinese immigration. The party won seats in the California legislature and made opposition to Chinese immigration a national issue.
Congress Passes New Immigration Laws
Opposition to immigration led Congress to pass several laws designed to limit the massive number of immigrants arriving in the United States.
Most of these were vetoed by the presidents of the era. In 1882, however, President Chester Arthur signed two bills—the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and the Immigration Act of 1882. The Chinese Exclusion Act barred Chinese immigration for 10 years, and prevented Chinese already in the United States from becoming citizens. The Chinese in the United States organized a letter-writing campaign, petitioned Arthur, and filed suit in federal court, all to no avail. The ban on Chinese immigration was renewed in 1892, and then made permanent in 1902. It was not repealed until 1943.

Urban America 147
The Immigration Act of 1882 imposed a head tax of 50 cents on each immigrant who arrived by ship at a United States port. The law also gave immigration officials the authority to reject immigrants who had a crimir record, were mentally disabled, or who were unable to take care of themselves “without becoming a public charge.”
For most of American history, the borders had been open, and virtual anyone who could get to the United States could settle there. State andlo governments controlled the ports and border crossings. The Immigration Act of 1882 began federal oversight of immigration and gave responsibilit to the Treasury Department to issue regulations, hire immigration agents and build inspection stations. One of the purposes of the head tax was to pay for the cost of the agents and offices needed to inspect immigrants. T law triggered a debate in American politics over the correct policies and regulations to adopt toward immigrants. The debate has continued to the present day.
Immigrant Optimism
Despite the difficulties of the journey, the challenges of finding work, anc the anger of nativists, many immigrants to the United States remained optimistic—in part because of what they were fleeing from, and in part because of what they discovered upon arriving. Although many Americai were poor and faced very difficult lives, there was no widespread famine, war or rebellion, unlike parts of China and Europe. There was no rigid d system. Immigrants understood that even though they were poor, theycc attempt to improve their position in life and were not permanently trappi because of the class into which they were born. In addition, wages wereh as compared to much of the world; jobs were plentiful, even if difficult ar sometimes demeaning, and there remained a lot of cheap land on the Gre Plains for those wishing to strike out on their own. In short, there was an opportunity to be free that many immigrants had never experienced befo and it created both optimism and a sense of possibility.

Identifying Bias and Points of View
Why Learn This Skill?
Everyday social media, talk shows, blog posts, text messages, and email flood us with opinion and commentary. In order to understand and assess what we see, hear, and read, and then make good decisions and choices, we need to be able to detect bias and a source's point of view, so as to evaluate the information we are receiving.
Learning the Skill
Everyone has bias—or tendency to look at information based their own experiences, knowledge, prejudices, and emotional reactions. People's biases and points of view are based on many factors including age, gender, race, ethnic background, economic class, religion, education, location, occupation, relationships, and personal experiences. All of these things need to be taken into account when looking for bias in a point of view.
To determine a point of view and detect bias in written, oral, or visual materials, follow these steps:
1.	What argument is being made? What are you being asked to think, do, feel, or believe? This is the point of view.
2.	Gather information about the author.
Is there anything that would cause the author to have a particular bias?
3.	Assess motivation. Will the author benefit from people adopting their point of view? Who will benefit?
4.	Determine the context. What was going on when the argument was made?
5.	Examine the language or visual imagery being used. Is it emotional? Do the words or pictures have positive or negative overtones? Are facts included that can be verified? Does the author use a lot of metaphors or analogies?
6.	Apply prior knowledge about the subject. Does the point of view match other sources? If necessary, research other sources on the subject and compare them to the author's viewpoint.
Practicing this Skill
Detecting Bias in Visuals Examine the cartoon by Thomas Nast published in 1871. It was drawn soon after New York City decided to fund Catholic schools.
1.	How would you describe the image's emotional content?
2.	Thomas Nast was an immigrant who had converted to Protestantism from Catholicism. At the time, he also supported the Republican Party. What might that suggest about his point of view?
3.	Based on your knowledge of the late 1800s, what bias and point of view is being depicted in this cartoon?

SOUhChb The Immigrant
Experience Ellis Island operated as a federal immigration station from 1892 to 1954. More than 20 million people passed through on their way to a new life in the United States. After a long journey across the Atlantic, immigrants would be subject to long lines for medical and legal inspections, which would determine if they were permitted entry into the United States. For more than 80 percent of immigrants, the process took only a matter of hours. For the less fortunate, it took days or weeks. These excerpts provide first-hand accounts of two different immigrant experiences—one of a Chinese boy entering the United States from San Francisco, and the other of a Solvenian immigrant’s experience at Ellis Island.

MEMOIR,
Arriving on Ellis Island, 1906 “A group of Slovenian immigrants, of which this writer was one, arrived in New York from ... Austria.... It was a beautiful morning in May 1906. After leaving the French ship LA TOURAINE, we were transported to Ellis Island for landing and inspection. There we were ‘sorted out’ as to the country we came from and placed in a ‘stall’ with the letter ‘A’ above us. (‘A’ was for Austria).
There were at least a hundred Slovenian immigrants. We separated ourselves, as was the custom at home—men on the right and women and children on the left. All of us were waiting to leave for all parts of the United States.
The day was warm and we were very thirsty. An English speaking immigrant asked the nearby guard where we could get a drink of water. The guard withdrew and returned shortly with a pail of water, which he set before the group of women. Some men stepped forward quickly to have a drink, but the guard pushed them back saying: ‘Ladies first!’ When the women learned what the guard had said, they were dumbfounded, for in Slovenia ... women always were second to men.... Happy at the sudden turn of events, one elderly lady
stepped forward, holding a dipper of water, and proposed this toast:
‘Zivijo Amerika, kjer so zenske prve!’
(Long live America, where women are first!)’

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
Native-born Americans and immigrants were drawn to cities by the jobs available in America's growing industries. The new, modern cities developed skyscrapers, public transportation systems, and neighborhoods divided by social class. In many cities, political machines controlled city government.
Americans Migrate to the Cities
guidingquestion Howdoyou think life in big cities was different from life on farms and in small towns?
Most of the immigrants who arrived in the United States in the late 1800s lacked both the money to buy farms and the education to obtain higher-paying jobs. Thus, they settled in the nation’s growing cities and took jobs in the rapidly expanding factories of the United States. At the same time, rural Americans also began moving to the cities. Farmers moved to cities because urban areas offered betterpaying jobs than did rural areas. Many young men and women growing up on farms in the east, where cheap land was no longer available, preferred to build a life in the cities instead of becoming settlers on the distant Plains. Cities had much to offer, too—electric lights, running water, modern plumbing, plus attractions such as museums, libraries, and theaters.
As a result, after the Civil War, the United States steadily change from a rural nation to an urban one. New York City, which had mor than 800,000 inhabitants in 1860, grew to almost 3.5 million by 190( During the same period, Chicago swelled from some 109,000 residents to more than 1.6 million. The United States had only 131 cities with populations of 2,500 or more residents in 1840; by 1900, there were more than 1,700 such urban areas. By 1920, more Americans lived in urban areas than rural areas.
As city populations grew, the rising value of land provided an incentive to try new strategies of urban development. Some businessmen built upward rather than outward. Tall, steel frame

buildings called skyscrapers began to appear. To move people around cities quickly, various kinds of mass transit developed. At first, almost all cities relied on the horsecar, a railroad car pulled by horses. In 1890 horsecars moved about 70 percent of urban traffic in the United States. More than 20 cities, beginning with San Francisco in 1873, installed cable cars, which were pulled along tracks by underground cables. Then, in 1887, engineer Frank J. Sprague developed the electric trolley car. The country’s first electric trolley line opened the following year in Richmond, Virginia.
In the largest cities, congestion became a severe problem.
Chicago responded by building an elevated railroad, while Boston, followed by New York, built the first subway systems. g READING PROGRESS CHECK
Summarizing What attracted people to cities in the 1800s?
Separation by Class
guiding question How did the living conditions of the urban working class differ from those of other social classes?
In the growing cities, the upper, middle, and working classes lived in separate and distinct parts of town. The boundaries between neighborhoods can still be seen in many American cities today.
During the last half of the 1800s, the wealthiest families established fashionable districts in the heart of a city. As their homes grew larger, wealthy women increasingly relied on more servants, such as cooks, maids, butlers, nannies, and chauffeurs, and spent a great deal of money on social activities. In an age in which many New Yorkers lived on $500 a year, socialite Cornelia Sherman Martin spent $360,000 on a dance.
American industrialization expanded the middle class, which included doctors, lawyers, engineers, managers, social workers, architects, and teachers. Many middle-class people moved away from the central city to escape the crime and pollution and to be able to afford larger homes. Some used new commuter rail lines to move to “streetcar suburbs.”
In the late 1800s, wealthier families had at least one live-in servant. This gave the woman of the house more time to pursue activities outside the home, including “women’s clubs.” At first these clubs focused on social and educational activities, but over time “club women” became active in charitable and reform activities. In Chicago, for example, the Women’s Club helped establish juvenile courts and exposed the terrible conditions at the Cook County Insane Asylum.
Few families in the urban working class could hope to own a home.
Most spent their lives in crowded tenements, or multifamily apartment buildings. The first tenement in the United States was built in 1839. In New
Before the mid-1800s, few buildings exceeded four or five stories. To make wooden and stone buildings taller required thick lower walls. This changed when steel companies began mass-producing cheap steel girders and steel cable.

Most working-class families lived in apartments, often only a single room in size. They had no servants, and typically husbands and wives both had to work.
York City, three out of four residents squeezed into dark and crowded tenements. To supplement the average industrial worker’s annual income of $445, many families rented preci space to a boarder. Zalmen Yoffeh, a Jewish immigrant journalist, lived in a New York tenement as a child. He recall his family’s everyday struggle:
PRIMARY SOURCE
« With one dollar a day [our mother] fed and clothed an ever-growing family. She took in boarders. Sometimes this helped; at other times it added to the burden of livin bmm.. Boarders were often out of work and penniless; how could one turn a hungry man out made all our clothes. She walked blocks to reach a place where meat was a penny cheaper, where bread

Within the working class, some people were better off than others. For example, white native-born men earned higher wages than African American men, immigrants, and women. One economist estimated that 64 percent of working-class families began to rely on more than one wage earner. In some cases, the whole family worked, including the children. The dangerous working conditions faced by child workers, and the lact that they were not in school, alarmed many reformers.
A growing number of women took jobs outside the home. White native-born women were better educated than other women. Thus, many found jobs as teachers, clerks, or secretaries. Many women, however, wen domestic servants, with immigrant women filling these jobs in the North and African American women doing such work in the South.

City living posed the risks of crime, violence, fire, disease, and pollution. The rapid growth of cities made these problems worse and complicated the ability of urban governments to respond to these problems.
Crime was a growing problem in American cities. Minor criminals, such as pickpockets, swindlers, and thieves, thrived in crowded urban living conditions. Major crimes multiplied as well. From 1880 to 1900, the murder rate jumped sharply from 25 per million people to more than 100 per million people.
Disease and pollution posed even bigger threats. Improper sewage disposal contaminated city drinking water and triggered epidemics of typhoid fever and cholera. Though sewer systems existed in the 1870s, pollution remained a severe problem. Horse manure was left in the street
bached smoke, and soot and built up from coal or wood fires.
The political machine, an informal political group designed to gain and keep power, came about partly because cities had grown much faster than their governments.

every big employer in the district and in the whole city, for that matter, and they ain’t in the habit of sayin’ no to me when I ask them for a job.”
The party bosses also controlled the city’s finances. Many machine politicians grew rich as the result of fraud or graft, gaining money or power illegally. Outright fraud occurred when party bosses accepted bribes from contractors who were supposed to compete fairly to win contracts to build streets, sewers, and buildings. Corrupt bosses also sold permits to their friends to operate public utilities, such as railroads, waterworks, and power systems. Tammany Hall, the New York City Democratic political machine, was the most infamous such organization. William “Boss” Tweed was its leader during the 1860s and 1870s. Tweed’s corruptness led to a prison sentence in 1874.
City machines often controlled all the city services, including the police department. In St. Louis, the “boss” never feared arrest when he called out to his supporters at the police-supervised voting booth, “Are there any more repeaters out here that want to vote again?”
Opponents of political machines, such as cartoonist Thomas Nast, blasted corrupt bosses. Defenders argued that political machines provided necessary services and helped assimilate new city dwellers.

In 1873 Mark Twain and Charles Warner wrote a novel entitled The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today. Historians later adopted the term and applied it to the era in American history that began about 1870 and ended around 1900. The era was in many ways a time ot marvels. Amazing new inventions led to rapid industrial growth. Cities grew in size and people thronged the crowded streets. Wealthy entrepreneurs built spectacular mansions. Skyscrapers reached to the sky, and electric lights banished the darkness.
By calling this era the Gilded Age, Twain and Warner were sounding an alarm. Something is gilded if it is covered with gold on the outside but made of cheaper material inside. A gilded age might appear to sparkle, but critics pointed to corruption, poverty, crime, and great disparities in wealth between the rich and the poor.
Whether the era was golden or merely gilded, it was certainly a time of great cultural activity. Industrialism and urbanization altered the way Americans looked at themselves and their society, and these changes gave rise to new values, new art, and new entertainment.
The Idea of Individualism
One ofthe strongest beliefs of the era—and one that remains stron today—was the idea of individualism. Many Americans firmly believed that no matter how humble their origins, Americans coub rise in society and go as far as their talents and commitment woul< ta e them. No one expressed the idea of individualism better than
156
Horatio Alger, who wrote more than 100 “rags-to-riches” novels. In his books, a poor person goes to the big city and, through a combination of hard work and luck, becomes successful. Even though such dramatic jumps upward in social standing were not commonplace, Alger’s popular books convinced many young people that no matter how many obstacles they faced, success was possible.
Social Darwinism
Another powerful idea of the era was Social Darwinism. This philosophy, loosely derived from Charles Darwin’s theories, strongly reinforced the idea of individualism.
Herbert Spencer British philosopher Herbert Spencer applied Darwin’s theory of evolution and natural selection to human society. In his 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, Darwin argued that plant and animal life had evolved over millions of years by a process he called natural selection. In this process, those species that cannot adapt to the environment in which they live gradually die out, while those that do adapt, thrive, and live on.
Spencer used this theory to argue that human society also evolved through competition and natural selection. He said that society became better because only the fittest people survived. Spencer and others, such as American scholar William Graham Sumner, became known as Social Darwinists and their ideas as Social Darwinism. “Survival of the fittest” became the catchphrase of their philosophy. Some industrial leaders used Social Darwinism to justify their support of laissez-faire capitalism. This economic doctrine opposed any government programs that interfered with business. Darwinism and the Church Many devout Christians found Darwin’s conclusions offensive. They rejected the theory of evolution because they believed it contradicted the Bible’s account of creation. Some clergy, however, concluded that evolution might have been God’s way of creating the world. One of the most famous ministers of the era, Henry Ward Beecher, called himself a “Christian evolutionist.”
Carnegie's Gospel of Wealth Andrew Carnegie advocated a gentler version of Social Darwinism that he called the Gospel of Wealth. This philosophy held that wealthy Americans should engage in philanthropy, using their fortunes to create the conditions that would help people help themselves. Building schools and hospitals, for example, was better than giving handouts to the poor. Carnegie funded the creation of public libraries in cities across the nation because libraries provide the information people needed to get ahead in life.

The Rebirth of Reform
GUIDING question What methods and philosophies were developed for helping the urban poor?
The tremendous changes that industrialism and urbanization brought triggered a debate over how best to address society s problems. Some Americans embraced the ideas of individualism and Social Darwinism. Others disagreed, arguing that society’s problems could be fixed only if Americans and their government began to take a more active role in regulating the economy and helping those in need.
Challenging Social Darwinism
In 1880 journalist Henry George published Progress and Poverty, a discussion of the American economy that quickly became a national best seller. George observed, “The present century has been marked by a prodigious increase in wealth-producing power.” 'This should, he asserted have made poverty “a thing of the past.” Instead, he claimed, the “gull between the employed and the employer is growing wider; social contras are becoming sharper.” In other words, laissez-faire economics was niakii society worse—not better.
Most economists now argue that Georges analysis was Hawed. Industrialism did make some Americans very wealthy, but it also improvi the standard of living for most others as well. At the time, however, Americans in the midst of poverty did not see improvement. Georges ide spurred reformers to challenge Social Darwinism.
A young newsboy sells papers on a street corner in 1910.
Lester Frank Ward In 1883 Lester Frank Ward published Dynamic Sociology, in which he argued that humans were different from animals because they had the ability to make plans to produce the future outcomes they desired. Wards ideas came to be known as Reform Darwinism. People, he insisted, had succeeded in the world because of their ability to cooperate. Government, he argued, could regulate the economy, cure poverty, and promote education more efficiently than competition in the marketplace could.
Looking Backward Writer Edward Bellamy promoted another altern to Social Darwinism and laissez-faire economics. In 1888 he published Looking Backward, a novel about a man who falls asleep in 1887 and awakens in the year 2000 to find that the nation has become a perfect society with no crime, poverty, or politics. In this fictional society, the government owns all industry and shares the wealth equally with all
mencans. Bellamy’s ideas were essentially a form of socialism. Naturalism in Literature Criticism of industrial society also appean chai? Ure	Style of writing known as naturalism. Naturalists

Among the most prominent naturalist writers were Stephen Crane,
Jack London, and Theodore Dreiser. Stephen Crane’s novel Maggie, A Girl of the Streets (1893) told the story of a girl’s descent into prostitution and death. Jack Londons tales of the Alaskan wilderness demonstrated the power of nature over civilization. Theodore Dreiser’s novels, such as Sister Carrie (1900), painted a world where people sinned without punishment and where the pursuit of wealth and power often destroyed their character.
Naturalist literature drew people’s attention to the issues and problems facing American society as a result of rapid industrialization and urbanization, issues such as poverty, violence, safety, disease, and isolation. The literature had a positive impact in that it encouraged readers to look at social problems. It encouraged some people to become reformers, and to try to help the less fortunate. But the literature also had a negative impact. By downplaying heroism and the ability of people to make a difference in their life, it discouraged people from taking action, and encouraged envy and resentment toward people of different social classes.
Naturalism also implicitly asked readers to consider whether individualism and laissez-faire was leading to the best possible society. So it was not surprising that readers of naturalist literature might conclude that the way to make things better was by government intervention. Whether that was a positive or negative impact of the literature depended on whether a person thought an increased government role in society and the economy was a good idea.
Helping the Urban Poor
The plight of the urban poor prompted some reformers to find new ways to help. The Social Gospel movement worked to better conditions in cities according to the biblical ideals of charity and justice. Washington Gladden, a minister, was an early advocate who popularized the movement in writings such as Applied Christianity (1887). Walter Rauschenbusch, a Baptist minister from New York, became the leading voice in the Social Gospel movement.
The Church, he argued, must “demand protection for the moral safety of the people.” The Social Gospel movement inspired many churches to build gyms, provide social programs and child care, and help the poor.
The Salvation Army and the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) also combined faith and an interest in reform. The Salvation Army offered practical aid and religious counseling to the urban poor. The YMCA tried to help industrial workers and the urban poor by organizing Bible studies, citizenship training, and group activities. The YMCA also provided low-cost boarding houses for young men. The head of the Chicago YMCA, Dwight L. Moody, was a gifted preacher whose revival meetings drew thousands of people. Moody rejected both the Social Gospel movement and Social Darwinism. He believed the way to help the poor was not by providing them with services but by redeeming their souls and reforming their character.
The settlement house movement began as an offshoot of the Social Gospel movement. In the late 1800s, idealistic reformers—including many college-educated women—established settlement houses in poor, often heavily immigrant neighborhoods. The reformers lived in these settlement houses, which were community centers offering everything from medical care and English classes to kindergartens and recreational programs. Jane Addams opened Hull House in Chicago in 1889. Jewish reformer Lillian Wald founded the Henry Street Settlement in New York City. Both women were a powerful force in social work and the settlement house movement.

Public Education
As the United States became increasingly industrialized and urbanized, i needed more trained and educated workers. The number ol public schoc increased dramatically after the Civil War. The number ol children attending school rose from 7,562,000 in 1870 to 15,503,000 in 1900. Pub schools were often crucial to the success of immigrant children. At schoi they were taught English and learned about American history and cultu a process known as Americanization.
Schools also tried to instill discipline. Grammar schools divided students into grades and drilled them in punctuality, neatness, and efficiency—necessary habits for the workplace. Vocational education in high schools taught skills required in specific trades. 1 lowever, children cities had greater access to education than those in rural areas. Many African Americans also faced education inequalities. Some started theii own schools, following the example of Booker T. Washington, who four the Tuskegee Institute in 1881.

Realism in Art & Literature
A new movement in art and literature called realism began in the 1800s arwm tried to explain the natural world scientifically, artists and wi
ned to portray the world realistically. Realist artists did not generally
160
choose heroic or historical topics. Nor did they try to idealize people as romantic artists had done. Instead they painted ordinary people doing ordinary things. Among the best known of the realist painters are John Singer Sargent and Thomas Eakins. Much of the work they did was portraiture formal paintings in realistic detail of people posing for the artist. Eakins, however, was also known for paintings that depicted people in action. He painted men rowing, athletes playing baseball, a family out for a carriage ride, doctors performing surgery and scientists in action in their laboratories. The realist style captured many of the characteristics of the era such as clothing styles, social relationships, the differences between the social classes, and the way people looked doing ordinary things in life.
Writers also attempted to capture the world as they saw it. In several novels, William Dean Howells presented realistic descriptions of American life. For example, his novel The Rise of Silas Lapham (1885) described the attempts of a self-made man to enter Boston society. Also an influential literary critic, Howells was the first to declare Mark Twain an incomparable American genius.
Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens, published his
masterpiece, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, in 1884. In this novel, the title character and his friend Jim, who has escaped from slavery, float down the Mississippi River on a raft. Twain wrote in local dialect with a lively sense of humor. Through the innocent eyes of his characters who question right and wrong in American society as they encounter it, Twain gave readers a humorous yet critical account of racism, violence, and poverty in the nation. Popular Culture
Popular culture changed considerably in the late 1800s. Industrialization improved the standard of living for many people, enabling them to spend money on entertainment and recreation. Increasingly, urban Americans divided their lives into separate units—that of work and that of home.
People began “going out” to public entertainment.
In cities, saloons often outnumbered groceries. As a place for social gathering, saloons played a major role in the lives of male workers. Saloons

offered drinks, free toilets, water for horses, and free newspapers for customers. They even offered the first “free lunch”: salty food that made patrons thirsty and eager to drink more. Saloons also served as political centers, and saloonkeepers were often key figures in political machines.
Working-class families and single adults could find entertainment at new amusement parks such as New York City’s Coney Island. Amusements such as water slides and railroad rides cost only a nickel or dime. People also began watching professional sports. Formed in 1869, the first professional baseball team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings. In 1903 the first official World Series was played between the Boston Americans and the Pittsburgh Pirates. Football gained in popularity and by the late 1800s had spread to public colleges.
As work became less strenuous, many people looked for activities involving physical exercise. Tennis, golf, and croquet became popular. In 1891 James Naismith, athletic director for a college in Massachusetts, invented a new indoor game called basketball.
Tin Pan Alley
People also enjoyed comic theater and music. Adapted from French theater, vaudeville took on an American flavor in the early 1880s with its hodgepodge of animal acts, singers, comedians, acrobats, and dancers. Like
Urban America 161
vaudeville, ragtime music echoed the hectic pace of city life. Its syncopate rhythms grew out of the music of riverside honky-tonks, saloon pianists, and banjo players, using the patterns of African American music. Scott Joplin, one ofthe most important African American ragtime composers, became known as the King of Ragtime. He wrote his most famous piece, “The Maple Leaf Rag,” in 1899.
From the early 1880s to the late 1930s, the music industry in America was centered in New York City. The part of the city where many music publishers and songwriters were located became known as Tin Pan Alley. The name is thought to have come from a sarcastic description of the sou of many pianos playing different ragtime songs all at once—that it soundi like tin pans banging together. Tin Pan Alley musicians and publishers m most of their money by selling sheet music. Very few people owned phonographs in the 1880s and 1890s, but many homes had pianos, banjos and other instruments, and people would play popular songs for themseh and their families. Musicians, known as pluggers, put on performances tc advertise songs and get people to buy the sheet music.
The negative impact of Tin Pan Alley, especially in its early years, wa: that it also continued to promote racial stereotypes. Much of Tin Pan AU style and sound derived from African American songs and music but wit themes and content that appealed to white Americans. A portion of the music published, especially in the 1880s and 1890s, included racial jokes ideas that probably played a role in sustaining the racism of the era and t social separation of whites and African Americans.
Despite this, Tin Pan Alley’s positive impact on America was much greater than its negative impact. It was largely responsible for the birth o the modern music industry and made possible the careers of such famou songwriters as Irving Berlin, George Cohan, Ira Gershwin, ('ole Porter, Scott Joplin and many others. Some of the most popular songs of the era still known today, including “Hello!

guiding question Why was civil service reform needed?
Up until the 1880s, most jobs in the federal government were subject to the spoils system. After candidates won election and took office, they fired all of the people who worked for the government, and gave the jobs to people who had supported their election. This practice of rewarding political supporters with government jobs is known as patronage. Supporters of patronage claimed it was necessary to ensure that government workers stayed loyal to the elected representatives of the people. But after the Civil War, many Americans came to believe patronage made the government inefficient and corrupt.
Civil Service Reforms
When Rutherford B. Hayes became president in 1877, he tried to end patronage by firing officials who had been given jobs because of their support of the party and replacing them with reformers.
His actions split the Republican Party between “Stalwarts” (who supported patronage), “Halfbreeds” (who backed some reform), and reformers. No reforms were passed. In 1880 the Republicans nominated James Garfield, a “Halfbreed,” for president and Chester A. Arthur, a “Stalwart,” for vice president. Despite the feud over patronage, the Republicans managed to win the election. A few months later, President Garfield was assassinated by a man angry that he had not been given a government job.
Garfield’s assassination turned public opinion against the spoils system. In 1883 Congress passed the Pendleton Act, requiring that

Cleveland narrowly won the election, and then he faced supporters who expected him to reward them with jobs. Reformers, on the other hand, expe him to increase the number of jobs under the civil service system. Cleveland chose a middle course and angered both sides. Soon, however, economic issi replaced the patronage reform debate.

Debating Economic Policy
By the 1880s, the American people had become increasingly concerned ab the power of large corporations, fearful they were controlling prices and wages, and corrupting the government. Small businesses and farmers had become particularly angry at the railroads. While large corporations could negotiate rebates and lower rates because of the volume of goods they shipped, others were forced to pay much highe rates. Eventually many states passed laws regulating railro rates. In 1886 the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Wab St, Louis, and Pacific Railway v. Illinois that only the federj government could regulate interstate commerce. Public pressure forced Congress to act, and in 1887 Cleveland sif the Interstate Commerce Act. This was the first federal la^ regulate interstate commerce.
The law limited railroad rates to what was “reasonab and just,” outlawed rebates, and made it illegal to charge higher rates for shorter hauls where the short haul wasp of a longer haul. The law also created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC); the nation’s first independent regulatory agency. The ICC was not very effective in regulating the industry because it had to tab railroads to court, prove they were violating the law, thei the court to enforce the ICC s rulings.
Despite its weaknesses, the creation of the ICC had $ benefits. By banning rebates and higher rates for short h it reduced some of the pressure on farmers and small businesses who were struggling to compete with large companies.

High tariffs also forced other nations to respond in kind, making it difficult for farmers to export surpluses. In December 1887 President Cleveland proposed lowering tariffs. The Democratic House passed moderate tariff reductions, but the Republican Senate rejected the bill.
In 1888 the Republicans and their presidential candidate, Benjamin Harrison, received large campaign contributions from industrialists who benefited from high tariffs. Cleveland and the Democrats campaigned against high tariff rates. In one of the closest presidential elections in American history, Harrison lost the popular vote but won the electoral vote, giving Republicans control of the White House.
In 1890 Representative William McKinley pushed through a bill that cut some taxes and tariff rates but increased rates on other goods. The McKinley Tariff, intended to protect American industry from foreign competition, instead helped trigger a steep rise in the price of all goods. In 1890 Congress also passed the Sherman Antitrust Act to curb the power of the large business combinations known as trusts. The act prohibited any “combination ... or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States.”

Unrest in Rural America

guiding question What kinds of problems did farmers face?
Populism was a movement to increase farmers’ political power and work for legislation in their interest. An economic crisis following the Civil War led farmers to join the Populist movement. New technology enabled farmers to produce more crops, but increased supply caused prices to fall. High tariffs also made it hard for farmers to sell their goods overseas. In addition, mortgages with large banks and rail shipping costs that continued to increase made the farmers’ difficulties worse.
The Money Supply
greenback a unit of paper currency first issued by the federal government during the Civil War
currency papermoneyusedasa medium of exchange
inflation an ongoing increase in prices and decrease in the value of money
Some farmers thought adjusting the money supply would solve their problems. During the Civil War, the government had expanded the money supply by issuing millions of dollars in greenbacks, paper currency that could not be exchanged for gold or silver coins. When currency is issued that cannot be exchanged for a commodity, like gold or silver, it is called fiat currency. It holds value only because the government says it does. The increased money supply without an increase in goods for sale caused
inflation, or a decline in the value of money. As the paper money lost value, the prices of goods soared.
After the Civil War ended, the United States had three types of currency in circulation—greenbacks, gold and silver coins, and national banknotes backed by government bonds. To get inflation under control, the federal government stopped printing greenbacks and began paying off its bonds. In 1873 Congress also decided to stop making silver into coins. These decisions meant
that the money supply was insufficient for the country’s growing economy. As the economy expanded, deflation—an increase in the value of money and a decrease in prices—began.
Deflation hit farmers especially hard. Falling prices meant that they sold their crops for less and then had to borrow money for seed and other

In 1873 the nation plunged into a severe recession, and farm income fell sharply. Grangers responded by pressuring states to regulate railroad and warehouse rates. To reduce harmful competition among farmers, the Grangers also tried creating organizations called cooperatives in whic member farmers worked together to increase prices and lower costs.

Populists also adopted proposals that were designed to appeal to organized labor. Ideas such as an eight-hour workday and immigration restrictions were put forth as appealing options.

The Election of 1896
guiding question Why did the Populists support the Democratic candidate—William Jennings Bryan—in 1896?
As the election of 1896 approached, leaders of the People’s Party decided to make the free coinage of silver the focus of their campaign and to hold their convention after the Republican and Democratic conventions. They believed, correctly, that the Republicans would endorse a gold standard.
They also expected the Democrats to nominate Grover Cleveland, even though Cleveland favored a gold standard. The People’s Party hoped that when it endorsed silver, pro-silver Democrats would choose the Populists.
Unfortunately, their strategy failed. William Jennings Bryan made an impassioned pro-silver speech at the convention and won the Democratic nomination.
PRIMARYSOURCE
« Having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world supported by the commercial interests, the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere, we will answer their demand fora gold standard by saying to them: You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns; you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.99
—from Bryan's speech at the Democratic National Convention, 1896
The Populists faced a difficult choice: endorse Bryan and risk undermining their identity as a party, or nominate their own candidate and risk splitting the silver vote. They chose to support Bryan.
The Republicans appealed to workers with the promise that McKinley would provide a “full dinner pail.” Also most business leaders supported the Republicans, convinced that unlimited silver coinage would ruin the country. Many employers warned workers that if Bryan won, businesses would fail and unemployment would rise further. McKinley’s reputation as a moderate on labor issues and as tolerant toward ethnic groups helped improve the Republican Party’s image with urban workers and immigrants. When the votes were counted, McKinley had won with a decisive victory.
Evaluating Populism's Impact
Discouraged by defeat, the Peoples Party declined after 1896. The Populist goal of using the federal government to ease the economic hardships of farmers and regulate big business failed, primarily because of
graduated income tax
a tax based on the net income of an individual or business and which taxes different income levels at different rates

the party’s inability to appeal successfully to urban workers in the north Populist ideas, however, were not forgotten and continued to influence t political debate. In the years ahead many items on the Populist program would be realized, including the eight hour workday, restrictions on immigration, and a graduated income tax. Ironically, the key Populist gc of increasing the money supply came about almost immediately followii the election, as gold from the Klondike and new gold mines in South Af flooded into the world’s economy.
The Klondike Gold Rush
In August 1896, an American prospector discovered gold near the Klonc River in the Yukon territory of northern Canada. When the news reache San Francisco and Seattle the following year the last great gold rush in American history began. Within months, an estimated 100,000 peoples! out for the Klondike determined to strike it rich.
Physical geographic factors made getting to the Klondike very diffici The region was extremely remote. The most direct route was to book passage to the ports of Dyea or Skagway, then hike approximately 30 mil over the mountains before sailing the final 500 miles down the Yukon Ri to Dawson City, the nearest settlement to the gold fields. Prospectors we required to bring a year’s worth of supplies so as to ensure no one starve^ death in the remote region. To do that, each person had to bring in nearl ton of material. Boomtowns full of hotels, storehouses, saloons, and gent stores popped up. Prices soared as merchants sought to supply tools, foo shelter, transportation and entertainment to the prospectors pouring inti the region. Hundreds died; some from the cold, some from starvation, others from avalanches, accidents while climbing mountains or crossing frozen lakes, or from outbreaks of dysentery and typhoid fever.
By 1899, the gold rush was over, although companies using heavy equipment continued to expand gold production into the early 1900s. Fe than 40,000 people made it to the gold fields and only about 4,000 found gold. Of those, only a few hundred became wealthy. The gold rush helpei develop lower Alaska. It also poured millions of dollars into the nation’s money supply without requiring a return to silver coins or paper currenc Mild inflation set in; credit became easier to obtain, and farmers and workers were less distressed. In 1900, the United States officially adopted gold-based currency with the passage of the Gold Standard Act.

After Reconstruction ended, Southern states began passing laws that weakened the rights of African Americans by introducing segregation and denying voting rights. African American leaders struggled to protect civil rights and improve their quality of life.
Resistance and Repression
guiding question Howdid African Americans resist radsm and try to improve their way of life following Reconstruction?
After Reconstruction, many African Americans in the rural South lived in poverty. Most were sharecroppers, landless farmers who gave their landlords a large portion of their crops as rent. Sharecropping usually left farmers in chronic debt. Many eventually left farming and sought jobs in Southern towns or headed west to claim homesteads.
In the mid-1870s, Benjamin “Pap” Singleton became convinced that African Americans would never be given a chance to get ahead in the South. He began urging African Americans to move west, specifically to Kansas, and form their own independent communities. His ideas soon set in motion a mass migration. In less than two months, approximately 6,000 African Americans left their homes in the rural South and headed to Kansas. The newspapers called it “an Exodus,” like the ancient Jews escape from Egyptian bondage referred to in the Bible. The migrants themselves came to be known as “Exodusters.” The first Exodusters, many possessing little more than hope and the clothes on their backs, arrived in Kansas in the spring of 1879.
While some African Americans fled the South, others joined poor white farmers who had created the Farmers’ Alliance. Alliance leaders urged African Americans to form a similar organization. In 1886 African American farmers established the Colored Farmers’ National Alliance, which numbered about 1.2 million members by 1890.

Imposing Segregation
guiding question What laws didSouthern states pass to impose segregation and deny African Americans their voting rights?
After Reconstruction ended in 1877, the rights of African Americans wei gradually undermined. Attempts to unify whites and African Americans failed. Instead, a movement to diminish the civil rights of African Americans gained momentum as the century ended.
Taking Away the Vote
The Fifteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying citizens the rigl to vote on the basis of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude? However, it does not bar states from denying the right to vote on other grounds. In the late 1800s, Southern states began imposing restrictions. Though they did not mention race, they were meant to make it hard or impossible for African Americans to vote.
In 1890 Mississippi began requiring all citizens registering to votetc pay a poll tax of $2, a sum beyond the means of most poor African Americans or poor whites. Mississippi also instituted a literacy test, requiring voters to read and understand the state constitution. Few African Americans born after the Civil War had been able to attend sch< and those who had grown up under slavery were largely illiterate. Even those who knew how to read often failed the test because officials deliberately picked passages that few people could understand. Other Southern states adopted similar restrictions. The number of African Americans registered to vote in Southern states fell drastically between 1890 and 1900.
Election officials were far less strict in applying the poll tax and literacy requirements to whites, but the number of white voters also fell
significantly. To let more whites vote, Louisiana introduced the
grandfather clause. This allowed any man to vote if he had an ancestor who could vote in 1867. This provision, adopted in several Southern states, exempted most whites from voting restrictions.
Legalizing Segregation
African Americans in the North were often discriminated against, but segregation/ or the separation of the races, was different in the South. Southern states passed laws that rigidly enforced discrimination. These laws became known as Jim Crow laws.
In 1883 the Supreme Court set the stage for legalized segregation when it overturned the Civil Rights Act of 1875. That law had prohibited keeping people out of public places on the basis of race and barred racial discrimination in selecting jurors. The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment provided only that “no state” could deny citizens equal protection under the law. Private organizations, such as hotels, theaters, and railroads, were free to practice segregation.
Encouraged by the Supreme Court’s ruling and by the decline of congressional support for civil rights, Southern states passed a series of laws establishing racial segregation in virtually all public places. Southern whites and African Americans could no longer ride together in the same railroad cars or even drink from the same water fountains.
In 1892 an African American named Homer Plessy challenged a Louisiana law that forced him to ride in a separate railroad car from whites.

PLESSY v. FERGUSON, 1896
Background to the Case
When Homer Adolph Plessy, a light-skinned man who was one-eighth African American, took a seat in the whites-only section of an East Louisiana Railway train and refused to move, he was arrested. Convicted of breaking a Louisiana law enacted in 1890, Plessy appealed his case to the Louisiana Supreme Court, then to the United States Supreme Court. The incident was planned in advance to test the statute to emphasize the folly ofthe law.
A conductor orders an African American off a whites-only train car in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
How the Court Ruled
The Court upheld the right of states to make laws that sustained segregation. The majority of justices wanted to distinguish between political rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and social rights. Although the words separate but equal do not appear in the Court's responses, the ruling ofthe Court allowed forthe separation ofthe races in public facilities. This phrase came to describe a condition that persisted until 1954.

BIOGRAPHY
Ida B. Wells (1862-1931)
Born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, Ida B. Wells is best known for her strong criticism of lynching, which she called "our country's national crime." Wells's political and reform activities included other issues such as segregation and women's suffrage. In 1913 she marched with an integrated group of suffragists in Washington, D.C. Wells married Chicago lawyer and editor Ferdinand L. Barnett in 1895. In 1910 she formed the Negro Fellowship League. She and her husband moved to an all-white Chicago neighborhood to challenge restrictive housing agreements.
CRITICAL THINKING
Describing How did Ida B. Wells try to stop the practice of lynching?
lynch to execute, by hanging, without lawful approval
He was arrested for riding in a “whites-only” car. In 1896 the Supreme Court in Plessy v Ferguson, upheld the Louisiana law and the doctrine “separate but equal” facilities for African Americans. The ruling establis the legal basis for discrimination in the South for more than 50 years. h public facilities for African Americans in the South were always separate they were far from equal.

The African American Response
GUIDING QUESTION
How did African American community leaders respond to legalized segregation': Historian Rayford Logan characterized the last decade of the nineteenth century and the opening of the twentieth century as the nadir, or low pc of African American status in American society. The African American community responded to violence and discrimination in several ways. 1 B. Wells, Mary Church Terrell, Booker T. Washington, and W.E.B. Du Bi each used different approaches to address these issues.
Ida B. Wells
In the late 1800s, mob violence increased in the United States, particulai in the South. Between 1890 and 1899, there was an average of 154 peopl lynched—executed, by hanging, without a legal trial—each year.
In 1892 Ida B. Wells, a fiery young African American woman from Tennessee, launched a fearless crusade against lynching. After a mob dri Wells out of town, she settled in Chicago and continued her campaign. In 1895 she published a book denouncing mob violence and demanding “a fair trial by law for those accused of crime, and punishment by law af honest conviction.” Although Congress rejected an antilynching bill, the number of lynchings decreased significantly in the 1900s, due in part to efforts of activists such as Wells.
Mary Church Terrell
One lynching victim had been a close friend of Mary Church Terrell, a college-educated woman who had been born during the Civil War. This death, and President Benjamin Harrisons refusal to publicly condemn lynching, started Terrell on her lifelong battle against lynching, racism, and sexism. Terrell w orked with woman suffrage workers such as Jane Addams and Susan B. Anthony. She helped found the National Association for the Advancement < Colored People. She also formed the Women Wage Earner’s Association, wl assisted African American nurses, waitresses, and domestic workers.
Terrell led a boycott against department stores in Washington, D.C., tha refused to serve African Americans. In an address to the National Americar Woman Suffrage Association, Terrell said, “With courage, born of success achieved in the past, with a keen sense of the responsibility which we shall continue to assume, we look forward to a future large with promise and
ope. Seeking no favors because of our color, nor patronage because of c needs, we knock at the bar of justice, asking an equal chance.”
*•«■>» iur compromise
ne	most famous African Americans of the late nineteenth
was the influential educator Booker T. Washington. He proposed t i-. an, mer^ans concentrate on achieving economic goals rathe pohtical ones. In 1895 Washington summed up his views in a spee
172
a mostly white audience in Atlanta. Known as the Atlanta Compromise, the speech urged African Americans to postpone the fight for civil rights and instead concentrate on preparing themselves educationally and vocationally for full equality.
PRIMARY SOURCE
U
The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremest folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than of artificial forcing.... It is important and right that all privileges of the law be ours, but it is vastly more important that we be prepared for the exercises of these privileges. The opportunity to earn a dollar in a factory just now is worth infinitely more than the opportunity to spend a dollar in an opera-house. W
T.
Washington, from Up From Slavery, 1901 Du Bois Rejects Compromise
The Atlanta Compromise speech provoked a strong challenge from W.E.B. Du Bois, the leader of a new generation of African American activists. In his 1903 book The Souls of Black Folk, Du Bois explained why he saw no advantage in giving up civil rights, even temporarily. He was particularly concerned with protecting and exercising voting rights. “Negroes must insist continually, in season and out of season,” he wrote, “that voting is necessary to proper manhood, that color discrimination is barbarism.” In the years that followed, many African Americans worked to win the vote and end discrimination. The struggle, however, would prove to be a long one.

The Story Matters...
International economic and military competition convinced the United States that it must become a world power, on par with Britain and Spain. By acquiring new lands before and after the Spanish-American War, the United States became more prominent, but it also took on new responsibilities. In the late 1800s, the United States increased its trade and military presence in East Asia and Latin America. By the early 1900s, it had created an American empire.

Place andTime: United States 1872-1917
U.S. economists, politicians, and other leaders recognized that economic growth could only come through expansion into foreign markets. With that in mind, the United States embarked on a path toward imperialism that included colonization and the acquisition of new territory. One strategic acquisition was the Panama Canal. After agreeing to pay for the rights to the project and the land around it, President Roosevelt pushed for the canal's completion. William Gorgas, a U.S. Army surgeon, helped control a major obstacle facing the construction of the Panama Canal: disease.

It Matters Because
During the late 1800s, the desire to find new markets, increase trade, and build a powerful navy caused the Uni States to become more involved in international affairs.
Building Support for Imperialism
guiding question Why did the United States assert itself as a world power?
Following the Civil War, most Americans showed little interest ir expanding their nation’s territory outside the United States. Instead, they focused on reconstructing the South, settling the W and building up industry. In the 1880s, economic and military competition from Europe and a growing feeling of cultural superiority convinced many Americans that the United States should become a world power.
A
Desire for New Markets Many European nations were expanding overseas, a development called the New Imperialism. Imperialism is the economic and political domination of a strong nation over weaker ones. Europe nations expanded their power overseas for many reasons. They needed to import raw materials for manufacturing. High tariffs ii industrialized nations—intended to protect domestic industries-reduced trade, forcing companies to look for new markets overse Investment opportunities had also slowed in Western Europe, so Europeans began looking overseas for places to invest their capita
To protect their investments, European nations began exertin control over territories, making some into colonies and others ini protectorates. In a protectorate, the imperial power protected lo rulers against rebellions and invasion. In return, rulers usually ha to accept Europeans advice on how to govern their countries.
As the United States industrialized, many Americans noticed the expansion of European power overseas and took an interest i the new imperialism. Many concluded that the nation needed ne^ overseas markets to keep its economy strong.

A
Feeling of Superiority Certain key ideas encouraged Americans to support the nations expansion overseas. Historian John Fiske argued that English-speaking nations had superior character, ideas, and systems of government. Many Americans linked his ideas, known as Anglo-Saxonism, with the idea of Manifest Destiny. These Americans believed the nation was destined to expand overseas to spread its civilization to others.

—John Fiske, from "Manifest Destiny," Harper's Magazine, 1885
protectorate a country that is technically independent but is actually under the control of another country
expansion the act or process of increasing or enlarging the extent, number, volume, or scope
Another influential advocate of Anglo-Saxonism was Josiah Strong, a popular American minister in the late 1800s. Strong linked Anglo-Saxonism to Christian missionary ideas. His ideas influenced many Americans. “The Anglo-Saxon,” Strong declared, “[is] divinely commissioned to be, in a peculiar sense, his brother’s keeper.” By linking missionary work to Anglo-Saxonism, Strong convinced many Americans to support an expansion of American power overseas.
Building a Modern Navy
As these ideas gained support, the United States became more assertive in foreign affairs. In 1888 the country risked war to prevent Germany from taking control of Samoa. The crisis ended peacefully. However, it led some Americans to believe that the United States would be shut out of foreign markets if it did not build up its navy and acquire bases overseas.

DBQ
IDENTIFYING CENTRAL
IDEAS
Why do you think establishing "resting places" is a key issue for developing naval power? U.S. naval officer Captain Alfred T. Mahan helped build public supp for a navy when he published The Influence of Sen Power Upon History ii 1890. Mahan pointed out that many prosperous nations had a large fleet merchant ships to trade with the world and a large navy to defend the nation’s trade. Mahan’s book helped build public support for a big navy. Two powerful senators, Henry Cabot Lodge and Albert J. Beveridge, use their position to convince Congress to support a new navy. In the execu branch, Benjamin Tracy, secretary of the navy under President Harrison John D. Long, secretary of the navy under President McKinley, and his assistant secretary Theodore Roosevelt, all supported Mahan’s ideas.
By the 1890s, several different ideas had come together. Business leaders wanted new markets overseas. Anglo-Saxonism had convinced many Americans they were destined to expand into the world, while growing European imperialism threatened U.S. security. These ideas, along with Mahan’s book, convinced Congress to authorize a large modern navy.

American Expansion in the Pacific
guidingquestion Why did the United States look to the Pacific for new markets?
From the earliest days of the Republic, Americans had expanded their nation by moving westward. When looking overseas for new markets, th United States naturally looked to the Pacific.
Perry Opens Japan
In 1852 President Millard Fillmore ordered Commodore Matthew C. Pei to negotiate a trade treaty with Japan. In 1853 warships under Perry’s command entered Edo Bay (now Tokyo Bay). Japan’s rulers, fearing the influence of Western ideas, had limited contact with the West. After seei t e warships, however, the Japanese realized they were not powerful
enough to resist modern weapons. In 1854, Japan signed the Treaty of Kanagawa, giving the United States trading rights at two Japanese ports.
Annexing Samoa and Hawaii
As trade with Asia grew, the United States needed ports for its ships to refuel and resupply as they crossed the Pacific. Pago Pago, in the Samoan Islands, had one of the finest harbors in the South Pacific. In 1878 the United States negotiated permission to open a base there. An 1899 agreement divided Samoa between Germany and the United States.
More important was Hawaii. Americans found that sugarcane grew well in Hawaii, and planters established sugar plantations there. In 1875 the United States signed a treaty exempting Hawaiian sugar from tariffs. This action was taken to aid Hawaii during an economic recession and prevent Hawaii from turning to Britain or France for help. When the treaty was up for renewal, the United States insisted Hawaii grant it exclusive rights to a naval base at Pearl Harbor.
In 1887, wealthy sugar planters led by Sanford Dole forced the Hawaiian king to accept a new constitution that limited the king’s authority. The planters eventually wanted to make Hawaii part of the United States. Tensions grew worse when Congress passed a new tariff in 1890. The tariff gave subsidies to American sugar producers, making Hawaiian sugar more expensive. The planters knew that if Hawaii joined the United States, they too would get the subsidies. The next year, Queen Liliuokalani ascended the Hawaiian throne and tried to restore the monarchy’s authority.
In response, the planters overthrew the queen. Backed by the American ambassador and U.S. Marines, the planters forced Liliuokalani to give up power, and asked Dole to serve as president of the new Hawaiian Republic. Dole then requested the United States annex Hawaii. President Cleveland, who opposed imperialism, tried instead to restore the queen to power, but Hawaii’s new leaders refused. Instead, they decided to wait until a new president took office. In 1898, under President McKinley, the United States annexed Hawaii and McKinley chose Dole to be Hawaii’s first governor.

The Coming of War
Academic Vocabulary • intervene • volunteer
guiding question Why was the United States willing to go to war with Spain overfuba?


Cuba was one of Spain’s oldest colonies in the Americas. Its sugarcane plantations generated considerable wealth for Spain an produced nearly one-third of the world’s sugar in the mid-1800s. Until Spain abolished slavery in 1886, about one-third ot the Cut population was enslaved and forced to work for wealthy landowners on the plantations.
In 1868 Cuban rebels declared independence and launched a guerrilla war against Spanish authorities. Lacking internal suppo the rebellion collapsed a decade later. Many Cuban rebels then fl« to the United States, including their leader, Jose Marti.
By the early 1890s, the United States and Cuba had become closely linked economically. Cuba exported much ot its sugar to the United States, and Americans had invested approximately $50 million in Cuba’s sugar plantations, mines, and railroads. Th economic ties created a crisis in 1894, when the United States imposed a new tariff on sugar that devastated Cuba’s economy. With Cuba in financial distress, the Cuban rebels launched a nev rebellion in February 1895. Marti died during the fighting, buttl rebels seized control of eastern Cuba, declared independence, an formally established the Republic of Cuba in September 1895. America Supports Cuba
When the uprising began, President Cleveland declared the United St neutral. However, stories of Spanish atrocities in two major newspape the New York Journal and the New York World, swayed many America in the rebels favor. The news reports, in which writers exaggerated ot
184
made up stories to attract readers, became known as yellow journalism.
Although some stories were invented, Cubans indeed suffered horribly.
The Spanish sent nearly 200,000 troops to put down the rebellion. The rebels destroyed a considerable amount of property, some belonging to Americans, hoping to provoke American intervention in the war. To prevent villagers from helping the rebels, the Spanish herded hundreds of thousands of rural men, women, and children into “reconcentration camps,” where tens of thousands died of starvation and disease.
Calls for War
In 1897 William McKinley became president of the United States. In September 1897, he asked Spain whether the United States could help negotiate an end to the conflict, so that the United States would not have to intervene in the war. Spain removed Weyler from office and offered the Cubans autonomy, but only if Cuba remained part of the Spanish Empire. The rebels refused to negotiate.
Spain’s concessions enraged many Spanish loyalists in Cuba. In January 1898, the loyalists rioted in Havana. McKinley sent the battleship USS Maine to Havana to protect Americans living there. Then, on February 15, 1898, the Maine exploded in Havana Harbor. To this day, no one is sure why the Maine exploded. Many Americans believed the Spanish did it. “Remember the Mainel” became the rallying cry for war against Spain.
McKinley faced tremendous pressure to go to war. Within the Republican Party, jingoism—aggressive nationalism—was very strong. On April 11, 1898, McKinley asked Congress to authorize the use of force. On April 19, Congress proclaimed Cuba independent, demanded that Spain withdraw from the island, and authorized the president to use armed force. On April 24, Spain declared war on the United States.

The U.S. Navy was ready for war with Spain. The navy blockaded Cuba, and Commodore George Dewey, commander of the American naval squadron based in Hong Kong, was ordered to attack the Spanish fleet based in the Philippines, then a Spanish colony. American naval planners wanted to prevent the Spanish fleet from sailing east to attack the United States.

When trying to learn a lot of new ideas, names, and events, use the words who, what, when, and where to ask questions. As you read about the war between Spain and the United States, use words you know in the questions.
President McKinley sent the battleship Maine to Cuba to help Americans evacuate. When the ship exploded, an enraged nation blamed Spain, although the explosion may have originated within the ship. "Remember the Maine1." became the battle cry for war.

Rough Rider and future president Theodore Roosevelt
The Battle of Manila Bay
On May 1, 1898, the American ships in Deweys squadron entered Manila Bay in the Philippines. They quickly destroyed the Spanish fleet. Dewey’s quick victory surprised McKinley. Hastily, the army assembled 20,000 troop to sail from San Francisco to the Philippines. On the way, the Americans also seized the island of Guam, another Spanish possession.
While waiting for the American troops to arrive, Dewey contacted Emilio Aguinaldo, a Filipino revolutionary leader who had staged an unsuccessful uprising against the Spanish in 1896. Now, while Aguinaldo and his rebels took control of most of the islands, American troops seized the Philippine capital of Manila.
American Forces in Cuba
The Spanish in Cuba were not prepared for war. Their soldiers were weak and sick, and their warships were old with untrained crews. If the United States could defeat the Spanish fleet, Spain would not be able to supply its troops in Cuba. Eventually, Spain would have to surrender.
The U.S. Army was not prepared for war, either. The army had recruited volunteers but lacked proper resources to train and equip them. One volunteer cavalry unit was a rough mix of cowboys, miners, and law officers known as the “Rough Riders.” Theodore Roosevelt was second in command.
Between June 22 and 24, some 17,000 U.S. troops had landed east of Santiago, Cuba. The Spanish fleet, well protected by powerful shore-based guns, occupied Santiago Harbor. Americans wanted to capture those guns to drive the Spanish fleet out of the harbor and into battle with the American fleet waiting nearby.
On July 1, American troops attacked Spanish positions near Santiago and the San Juan Heights. The Rough Riders and the all African American 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments attacked and held Kettle Hill, then assists in the capture of San Juan Hill. In Santiago the Spanish commander orders the Spanish fleet to flee the harbor. On July 3, American warships attacked them, destroying every Spanish vessel. Later, the Spanish in Santiago surrendered, leaving American troops to occupy nearby Puerto Rico.

Summarizing On what two fronts was the Spanish-American War fought?
An American Empire
guiding question How did the United States develop an overseas empire?
As American and Spanish leaders met to discuss the terms for a peace treaty, Americans debated what to do about their newly acquired lands. Cuba would receive its independence as promised, and Spain had agreed to the U.S. annexation of Guam and Puerto Rico. The big question was what to do with the Philippines. The United States faced a difficult choice—remain true to its republican ideals or become an imperial power that ruled a foreign country without the consent of its people. The issue sparked an intense political debat< The Debate Over Annexation
Many people emphasized the economic and military benefits of taking the Philippines. It would provide another Pacific naval base, a stopover on the way to China, and a large market for American goods. Others believed America had a duty to help “less civilized” peoples. “Surely this Spanish >

has not been a grab for the empire,” commented one minister, “but a heroic effort [to] free the oppressed and to teach millions of ignorant, debased human beings thus freed how to live.”
Not all Americans supported annexation. An anti-imperialist movement quickly formed and many prominent Americans voiced their opposition to the United States becoming an imperial power. Andrew Carnegie argued that the cost of empire far outweighed the economic benefits. Samuel Gompers, the head of the American Federation of Labor, worried that competition from cheap Filipino labor would drive down American wages. The social worker and reformer Jane Addams and the writer Samuel Clemens both believed imperialism violated American principles and traditions. Many people argued that it was inconsistent for a democratic-republic founded on the idea of self-government to rule over others who would have no say in who was appointed to rule them.
Despite the objections of anti-imperialists, President McKinley ultimately decided to annex the islands. He later explained his reasoning as follows:
PRIMARY SOURCE
« When I next realized that the Philippines had dropped into our laps I confess I did not know what to do with them. I sought counsel from all sides—Democrats as well as Republicans—but got little help....
And one night late it came to me this way—I don't know how it was, but it came: (1) That we could not give them back to Spain—that would be cowardly and dishonorable; (2) that we could not turn them over to France and Germany—our commercial rivals in the Orient—that would be bad business and discreditable; (3) that we could not leave them to themselves—they were unfit for self-government— and they would soon have anarchy and misrule over there worse than Spain's was; and (4) that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them, and by God's grace do the very best we could by them, as our fellow-men for whom Christ also died.99
—James Rusling, "Interview with President William McKinley," The Christian Advocate, January 1903
McKinley’s thinking blended the ideas of many military and business leaders with the ideas of Anglo-Saxonism. On December 10, 1898, the United States and Spain signed the Treaty of Paris, under which Cuba became independent. Also, the United States acquired Puerto Rico and Guam and paid Spain $20 million for the Philippines. After an intense debate, the Senate approved the treaty in February 1899.
A
Turning Point The year 1898 was a major turning point in American history. In just a few short months, the United States had defeated a European nation, demonstrated that its navy was one of the most powerful in the world, and had acquired its own empire. The reputation of the United States for being a nation that did not involve itself in global affairs was shattered. Increasingly the world’s other great powers had to take American perspectives and policies into account, and in the years ahead the United States would find itself drawn into issues and events thousands of miles from its own shores. After 1898, the United States had become a world power.
The Platt Amendment
Although the United States had promised to grant Cuba its independence, conditions were attached to the new Cuban constitution. The Platt Amendment, submitted by Senator Orville Platt, specified the following:
(1) Cuba could not make any treaty with another nation that would weaken its independence; (2) Cuba had to allow the United States to buy or lease
Becoming a World Power 187
naval stations in Cuba; (3) Cuba’s debts had to be kept low to prevent foreign countries from landing troops to enforce payment; and (4) the United States would have the right to intervene to protect Cuban independence and keep order. The Platt Amendment, which effectively made Cuba an American protectorate, remained in effect until its repeal in 1934.
Governing Puerto Rico
In 1900 Congress passed the Foraker Act, establishing a civil government for Puerto Rico. The law provided for an elected legislature, and a governor and executive council that were appointed by the U.S. president. Congress gradually allowed Puerto Ricans greater self-government. In 1917 it granted Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship. Thirty years later, Puerto Ricans were allowed to elect their own governor. A debate eventually began over whether Puerto Rico should become a state, become independent, or continue as a self-governing commonwealth of the United States. The debate over Puerto Rico’s status continues today.
Rebellion in the Philippines
In 1899 Emilio Aguinaldo ordered his troops to attack the American soldiers who had been sent there. Aguinaldo wanted the Philippines to be independent. To fight the Filipino guerrillas, the U.S. military established reconcentration camps to separate Filipino guerrillas from civilians. Thousands died from disease and starvation. Many U.S. soldiers died fighting the guerrillas.
While American troops fought the guerrillas, the first U.S. civilian governor of the islands, William Howard Taft, tried to win over the

Filipinos by improving education, transportation, and health care. These reforms slowly reduced Filipino hostility. In March 1901, American troops captured Aguinaldo. On July 4, 1902, the United States declared the war over. Gradually the Filipinos gained more control over their government. By the mid-1930s, they elected their own congress and president. In 1946 they gained full independence from the United States.

-35-
The Economic Effects of the War
In 1897, the year before the war, Americans had invested roughly $700 million in business ventures overseas. By 1904, they had invested over $2.5 billion. The war made Cuba safe again and American investment in sugar plantations and mining surged. Hawaii was now an American territory and companies there no longer had
to pay tariffs to ship goods to the United States, making it attractive to investors. Puerto Rico was in a similar position. American investors revived the island’s sugar industry and expanded its tobacco industry. American investments in the Philippines helped build railroads, open mines, and expanded its sugar industry as well.
All of these developments came at a cost. Together, the war with Spain and the battle against the Filipino guerrillas had cost some $400 million. Over 5,400 men had died in the war with Spain, and another 4,200 died fighting Filipino guerrillas. The war also led to a steady increase in naval spending, from $64 million in 1899 to $135 million in 1912. The spending helped stimulate parts of the economy related to shipbuilding, though it also diverted money from investment in other areas. But as a new world power with far flung bases and territories, the United States now needed a larger naval force to project its power and safeguard its interests. tl READING PROGRESS CHECK

American Diplomacy in Asia
guiding question Why did the United States want to eliminate spheres of influence in Chin
In 1899 the United States was a major power in Asia, with naval bases all across the Pacific. Operating from those bases, the United States Navy—by then the world’s third-largest navy—could exert American power anywhere in East Asia. The nation’s main interest in Asia, however, was not conquest but commerce. Between 1895 and 1900, U.S. exports to China quadrupled. Although China bought only about two percent of U.S. exports, the vast Chinese markets excited American business leaders, especially those in the textile, oil, and steel industries.
The Open Door Policy
In 1894 war erupted between China and Japan over Korea, which was client state dependent upon China. Western observers were astonishe( when Japan easily defeated China’s massive military. The war showed that Japan had mastered Western technology and that China was weaker than anyone had thought. In the peace treaty, China recognize Koreas independence and gave Japan territory in Manchuria.
The Russians were concerned about Japan’s rising power. They did not want Japan to acquire the territory in Manchuria because it bordered Russia. Backed by France and Germany, Russia forced Japan to return the Manchurian territory it had acquired. Then, in 1898, Russia demanded China lease the territory to Russia instead.
Leasing meant the territory would still belong to China, even though a foreign government would maintain overall control. Soon Germany, France, and Britain also demanded “leaseholds” in Chin<
190
Each leasehold became the center of a country’s sphere of influence, an area where a foreign nation controlled economic development.
U.S. politicians and businessmen worried that China would be divided among the Europeans and Americans would not be allowed to do business there. President McKinley and Secretary of State John Hay both supported what they called an Open Door policy, which would allow all countries to trade with China.
In 1899 Hay asked countries with leaseholds in China not to discriminate against other nations wanting to do business in their sphere of influence. Each nation responded by saying it accepted the Open Door policy but would not follow it unless all the others agreed. Once Hay had received assurances from all of the nations with leaseholds, he declared that the United States expected the other powers to uphold the policy. The policy helped the U.S. economy by ensuring that American companies could continue to trade with China.
The Boxer Rebellion
While foreign countries debated access to Chinas market, secret Chinese societies organized to fight foreign control and influence. One group, the Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists, was known to Westerners as the Boxers. In 1900 this group decided to destroy both the “foreign devils” and their Chinese Christian converts, whom they believed were corrupting Chinese society.
In what came to be called the Boxer Rebellion, the Boxers and some Chinese troops attacked foreign embassies in Peking (now Beijing) and Tientsin (now Tianjin), killing more than 200 foreigners, including many Christian missionaries. After the German ambassador to China was killed, eight nations—Germany, Austria-Hungary, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the United States—intervened. A large multinational force rescued the foreigners and ended the rebellion.
During the crisis, Secretary of State John Hay worked with British diplomats to persuade the other powers not to partition China. In a second set of Open Door notes, Hay convinced the participating powers to accept compensation from China for damages caused by the rebellion. After some discussion, the powers agreed not to break up China into European-controlled colonies.

to Congress in which he stated what came to be known as the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. It stated that the United States would intervene in Latin American affairs when necessary to maintain economic and political stability in the Western Hemisphere.
The goal of the Roosevelt Corollary was to prevent European powers from using the debt problems of Latin America to justify intervening in the region. The United States first applied the Roosevelt Corollary in the Dominican Republic, which had fallen behind on its debt payments to European nations. In 1905 the United States began collecting customs tariffs in the Dominican Republic, using the Marine Corps as its agent.
Dollar Diplomacy
Roosevelt’s successor, William Howard Taft, placed less emphasis on military force and more on economic development. Taft believed that supporting Latin American industry would increase trade and profits for American businesses and lift Latin America countries out of poverty and social disorder. His policy came to be called dollar diplomacy.
To give Europeans less reason to intervene in Latin American affairs, Taft’s administration worked to replace European loans with loans from American banks. In 1911 American bankers began making loans to Nicaragua to support its shaky government. The next year, civil unrest forced Nicaragua’s president to ask for greater assistance. U.S. marines entered Nicaragua, replaced the customs collector with an American agent, and formed a committee to control the customs commissions. U.S. troops supported the government and customs until 1933.

Woodrow Wilson's Diplomacy in Mexico
guiding question How did "moral diplomacy" shape President Wilson's foreign policy?
“It would be the irony of fate,” said Woodrow Wilson just before he was inaugurated in 1913, “if my administration had to deal chiefly with foreign affairs.” Wilson’s experience and interest were in domestic policy. He was a university professor before entering politics and was a committed progressive. Foreign affairs, however, absorbed much of Wilson’s time and energy as president.
Wilson opposed imperialism. He believed that democracy was essential to a nation’s stability and prosperity. He wanted the United States to promote democracy to create a world free of revolution and war. He hoped the United States would lead by moral example, but his first international crisis thwarted that hope.
The Mexican Revolution
For more than 30 years, Porfirio Diaz ruled Mexico as a dictator. During Diazs reign, Mexico became much more industrialized, but foreign investors owned the new railroads and factories that were built. Most Mexican citizens remained poor and landless. In 1910 discontent erupted into revolution. Francisco Madero, a reformer who seemed to support democracy, constitutional government, and land reform, led the revolution. Madero, however, was an unskilled administrator. Worried about Madero’s plans for land reform, landowners plotted against him. In 1913 General Victoriano Huerta seized power, and Madero was murdered.
94
Huertas brutality repulsed Wilson, who refused to recognize the new government. Instead, Wilson announced a new policy. To win U.S. recognition, groups that seized power in Latin America would have to establish a government based on law, not on force. Wilson believed that, without U.S. support, Huerta soon would be overthrown. Meanwhile,
Wilson ordered the navy to intercept arms shipments to Huerta’s government. He also permitted Americans to arm Huerta’s opponents. Wilson Sends Troops Into Mexico
In April 1914, American sailors visiting the Mexican city of Tampico were arrested after entering a restricted area. After their release, their commander demanded an apology. The Mexicans refused. Wilson saw the refusal as an opportunity to overthrow Huerta. Soon after Congress authorized the use of force, Wilson learned that a German ship was unloading weapons at the Mexican port of Veracruz. Wilson immediately ordered American warships to Veracruz, where U.S. Marines forcibly seized the city.
Although the president expected the Mexican people to welcome his action, anti-American riots broke out. Wilson then accepted international mediation to settle the dispute. Venustiano Carranza, whose forces had acquired arms from the United States, became Mexico’s president.
Mexican forces opposed to Carranza conducted raids into the United States, hoping to force Wilson to intervene. In March 1916, Pancho Villa (VEE*yuh) and a group of guerrillas—armed fighters who carry out surprise attacks—burned the town of Columbus, New Mexico, killing 17 Americans. Wilson responded by sending about 5,800 troops under General John J. Pershing across the border to find and capture Villa. The expedition ended without success.
Wilson’s Mexican policy damaged U.S. foreign relations. The British ridiculed the president’s attempt to “shoot” the Mexicans into self-government. Latin Americans regarded his “moral imperialism” as no improvement over Theodore Roosevelt’s “big stick” diplomacy. In fact, Wilson followed Roosevelt’s example in the Caribbean. In 1914 he negotiated exclusive rights for naval bases and a canal with Nicaragua. In 1915 he sent marines into Haiti to put down a rebellion. In 1916 he sent troops into the Dominican Republic to set up a government he hoped would be more stable and democratic than the current regime.

« The protection of [naval] stations must depend either upon direct military force, as do Gibraltar and Malta, or upon a surrounding friendly population, such as the American colonists once were to England, and, it may be presumed, the Australian colonists now are. Such friendly surroundings and backing, joined to a reasonable military provision, are the best of defenses.... Colonies attached to the mother-country afford, therefore, the surest means of supporting abroad the sea power of a country. In peace, the influence ofthe government should be felt in promoting by all means a warmth of attachment and a unity of interest which will make the welfare of one the welfare of all, and the quarrel of one the quarrel of all; and in war, or rather for war, by inducing such measures of organization and defense as shall be felt by all to be a fair distribution of a burden of which each reaps the benefit.”

Many imperialists admit that our trade with the Philippines themselves will not nearly be worth its cost; but they say that we must have the Philippines as a foothold, a sort of power station, for the expansion of our trade on the Asiatic continent, especially in China. Admitting this, for argument's sake, I ask what kind of a foothold we should really need. Coaling-stations and docks for our fleet, and facilities for the establishment of commercial houses and depots. That is all. And now I ask further, whether we could not easily have had these things if we had, instead of making war upon the Filipinos, favored the independence ofthe islands. Everybody knows that we could.
We might have those things now for the mere asking, if we stopped the war and came to a friendly understanding with the Filipinos to-morrow.”

But the time has come to inquire seriously what will happen when our forests are gone, when the coal, the iron, the oil and the gas are exhausted, when the soils shall have been still further impoverished and washed into the streams, polluting the rivers, denuding the fields and obstructing navigation.99

** The first principle of conservation is development, the use ofthe natural resources now existing c this continent for the benefit ofthe people who live here now. There may be just as much waste in neglecting the development and use of certain natural resources as there is in their destruction....
Conservation stands emphatically for the development and use of water-power now, without delay. It stands for the immediate construction of navigable waterways... as assistants to the railroads....
In addition... natural resources must be developed and preserved for the benefit ofthe many, and not merely for the profit of the few.w

The Rise of Progressivism
guiding question Who were progressives, and what did they believe caused social problems
Progressivism was a collection of different ideas and activities, not a tightly organized political movement with a specific set of goals. Rather, it was a series of responses to problems in American societ that had emerged from the growth of industry. Progressives had many different ideas about how to fix the problems they saw in American society.

continued on the next page
Who Were the Progressives?
Progressivism was partly a reaction against laissez-faire economics and its emphasis on an unregulated market. Progressives generally believed that industrialization and urbanization had created many social problems. After seeing the poverty of the working class and the filth and crime of urban society, reformers began doubting the free market’s ability to address those problems.
Progressives belonged to both major political parties. Most were urban, educated, middle-class Americans. Among their leaders were journalists, social workers, educators, politicians, ar members of the clergy. Most agreed that government should take more active role in solving society’s problems. At the same time, they doubted that the government in its present form could fix those problems. They concluded that government had to be fixe< before it could be used to fix other problems.
One reason progressives thought they could improve society was their strong faith in science and technology. The applicatior scientific knowledge had produced the lightbulb, the telephone,
202
and the automobile. It had built skyscrapers and railroads. Science and technology had benefited people; thus, progressives believed using scientific principles could also produce solutions for society.
The Muckrakers
Among the first people to articulate progressive ideas was a group of crusading journalists who investigated social conditions and political corruption. President Theodore Roosevelt nicknamed these writers "muckrakers" because of what he perceived as their obsession with scandal and corruption. Widely circulated, cheap newspapers and magazines helped spread the muckrakers’ ideas.
Muckrakers uncovered corruption in many areas. Some, such as Ida Tarbell and Charles Edward Russell, concentrated on exposing the unfair practices of large corporations. Other muckrakers targeted government and social problems. Lincoln Steffens reported on vote stealing and other corrupt political practices of political machines.
Still other muckrakers concentrated on social problems. In his influential book How the Other Half Lives (1890), Jacob Riis published photographs and descriptions of the poverty, disease, and crime that afflicted many immigrant neighborhoods in New York City. By raising awareness of these problems, the muckrakers stimulated calls for reform.
H READING PROGRESS CHECK

guidingquestion Howdid progressives hope to make government more efficient and responsive to citizens?

In 1900 the political machine running Galveston, Texas, failed to help the city recover from a devastating hurricane, so local business leaders convinced the state to allow them to take control.
Making Government Efficient
One group of progressives drew its ideas for increasing government efficiency from business. Theories of business efficiency first became popular in the 1890s. Books such as Frederick W. Taylor’s The Principles of Scientific Management (1911) described how a company could increase efficiency by managing time, breaking tasks down into small parts, and using standardized tools—a scientific approach to business that some progressives wanted to extend to government.
Progressives saw corruption and inefficiency in city government. Many municipal leaders traditionally chose political supporters and friends to run city departments, even though these people often knew little about managing city services.
Progressives supported proposals to reform city government. One, a commission plan, divided city government into several departments, with each one under an expert commissioner’s control. A second, a council-manager system, employed a city manager who was hired by the city council. In both systems, experts play a major role in managing the city. Galveston, Texas, adopted the commission system in 1901. In other cities, political machines were weakened by having officials elected city-wide instead of by neighborhoods.
Democratic Reforms
Another group of progressives focused on making government more democratic and more responsive to citizens. Many believed that the key to improving government was to make elected officials more responsive and accountable to voters.
Wisconsin became a “laboratory of democracy”under the leadership of its governor, Robert M. La Follette, who attacked the way political parties ran their conventions. Party bosses controlled the selection of convention delegates and the nomination of candidates. La Follette pressured the state legislature to pass a law requiring parties to hold a direct primary, in which all party members could vote for a candidate to run in the general election.
The direct primary soon spread to other states. Other progressives also pushed for additional reforms: the initiative, the referendum, and the recall. The initiative permits citizens to introduce legislation and requires the legislature to vote on it. Typically, citizens have to gather a certain number of signatures on a petition to make the initiative legally binding. In an indirect initiative, the proposed law goes to the legislature first. If the legislature refuses to act on it, it goes on the ballot for the public to vote on it. A direct initiative goes directly to the public for a vote.
A referendum allows citizens to vote on proposed laws directly. In some states, if the legislature passes certain laws, such as a change to taxes, the new law has to be approved by the public in a referendum. Referendums are also used to repeal existing laws. Both the referendum and the initiative gave reformers the power to bypass or overrule the legislature if it refused to support something the people wanted. The idea of the initiative and the referendum was more popular in the West and Midwest. Today, 26 states allow some form of initiative and/or referendum. Since 1904, more than 2000 statewide referendums have been initiated by citizens.
The recall provided voters an option to demand a special election to remove an elected official from office before his or her term had expired. Today, nineteen states allow citizens to recall state officials, and at least 29 states allow recalls of local officials. Recalls are frequent for local officials.

In what direction did support for woman suffrage generally move throughout the country before 1920? Hundreds of city council members, school board members, and mayors have been recalled over the over the years but, as of 2013, only 20 state legislators have been recalled and only two governors.
Progressives also targeted the U.S. Senate. The U.S. Constitution originally directed each state legislature to elect two senators. Political machines and business interests often influenced these elections. Some senators, once elected, repaid their supporters with federal contracts and jobs. To counter corruption in the Senate, reformers called for the direct election of senators by voters. In 1912 Congress passed a direct-election amendment. In 1913 the amendment was ratified and became the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although direct election was meant to end corruption, it also removed one of the state legislatures’ checks on federal power.
H READING PROGRESS CHECK
Summarizing How did progressives hope to solve problems through

Woman Suffrage
guidingquestion Why did the progressives support the woman suffrage movement?
At the first women’s rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848, Elizabeth Cady Stanton convinced the delegates that winning suffrage the right to vote—should be a priority. Decades later, this right still had not been gained. It became a major goal for female progressives.
Early Challenges
The woman suffrage movement started slowly. Suffragists were threatened and called unfeminine and immoral. Many ofthe movements supporters were abolitionists as well, and in the years before the Civil War, ending slavery took priority over womens voting rights.
After the Civil War, Congress introduced the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to grant citizenship to African Americans and voting rights to African American men. Leaders of the woman suffrage movement wanted

The Progressive Movement 205
BIOGRAPHY
Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906)
Susan B. Anthony left teaching to join the temperance and antislavery movements in the early 1850s. She found that the male leaders of both movements discriminated against women so she turned to the women's rights movement.
She was the president ofthe National American Woman Suffrage Association, from 1892 to 1900. She lectured constantly on the right of women to vote, often to hostile audiences, and traveled extensively, lobbying state legislators to pass suffrage laws. Her ultimate goal was an amendment to the United States Constitution that would recognize a woman's right to vote in every state. On her 86th birthday in 1906, she attended a dinner in her honor and spoke briefly, concluding her remarks with these words: "Failure is impossible!" She was right, but did not live to see the Nineteenth Amendment, that gave women the right to vote, ratified in 1920.
these amendments to give women the right to vote as well. They were disappointed when established politicians refused.
The debate over these two amendments split the movement into two groups: the New York City-based National Woman Suffrage Association, founded by Stanton and Susan B. Anthony in 1869, and the Boston-based American Woman Suffrage Association, led by Lucy Stone and Julia Ward Howe. The first group wanted to focus on passing a constitutional amendment. The second believed that the best strategy was convincing state governments to grant women the right to vote first. This split weakened the suffrage movement. By 1900, only Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Colorado had granted women full voting rights.
Building Support
In 1890 the two groups united to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). The movement still faced the challenge of convincing women to become politically active. As the Progressive movement gained momentum, however, many women realized that they needed the vote to promote reforms and pass labor laws. Women began organizing events, handing out pamphlets, and delivering speeches. Many leaders of the suffrage movement were also able to lobby state and federal legislators directly. Lobbying is when you contact a political leader personally, explain your concern, and try to convince them to vote fora legislation that supports your causes. Often lobbyists promise to support the legislator financially when they run for reelection in return for their support. To gain influence with legislators and make their lobbying more effective, suffrage leaders raised funds for legislators who supported suffrage and campaigned for their election even though they could not actually vote for them. They also worked to defeat legislators who opposed women’s suffrage.
Quaker social worker and former NAWSA member Alice Paul founded the National Woman’s Party (NWP). The NWP emphasized non-violent protest to promote women’s right to participate in the democratic process. Its members picketed, blocked sidewalks, chained themselves to lampposts, and went on hunger strikes if arrested. Suffragist Rose Winslow and several other women, including Alice Paul, were arrested for picketing the White House. After being sentenced to seven months in jail, Winslow and other women prisoners went on a hunger strike.

BIOGRAPHY
We have been in solitary for five weeks.... I have felt quite feeble the last few days—faint, so that I could hardly get my hair brushed, my arms ached so. But today I am well again.... [Alice Paul] dreaded forcible feeding frightfully, and I hate to think how she must be feeling.... I am really all right. If this continues very long perhaps I won't be. All the officers here know we are making this hunger strike [so] that women fighting for liberty may be considered political prisoners.... [W]e don't want women ever to have to do this over again. **
—Rose Winslow, quoted in Jailed for Freedom, 1920
The hunger strikers were force fed in prison, and the story gathered a lot of attention in the press, creating a national scandal. Equally disturbing was a police attack on a group of woman protestors that left several women with concussions and broken ribs.
The United States had entered World War I a few months before, and President Wilson was trying to portray the United States as fighting for freedom and democracy. As a result the NWP’s protests may have helped convince Wilson to publicly ask Congress to pass an amendment giving women the right to vote. Wilson may also have been influenced by the public support that NAWSA had given him.
While the NWP had focused on non-violent protest, the leader of NAWSA, Carrie Chapman Catt, had organized the suffrage movement for one final nationwide push for suffrage. She used the organization’s funds to support politicians who backed suffrage. She convinced the organization to support President Wilson’s re-election in 1916 and then supported the president when he took the country into war in 1917. As more states granted women the right to vote, Congress began to favor a constitutional amendment. In 1918 the House of Representatives passed a woman suffrage amendment. In the Senate, however, the amendment failed by two votes.
During the midterm elections of 1918, Catt used NAWSA’s resources to defeat two antisuffrage senators. In 1919 the Senate passed the amendment by slightly more than the two-thirds vote needed. On August 26, 1920, after three-fourths of the states had ratified it, the Nineteenth Amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote went into effect.

Reforming Society
guiding question What problems did social-welfare progressives attempt to reform?
While many progressives focused on reforming the political system, others focused on social problems, such as crime, illiteracy, alcohol abuse, child labor, and the health and safety of Americans. These social-welfare progressives created charities to help the poor and disadvantaged. They also pushed for new laws they hoped would fix social problems.
Women were prominent leaders of the social-welfare progressives. Most women in the progressive movement came from the middle or upper class, and felt a responsibility toward working class women. The main issues that working class women faced were poverty, safety, and abuse. Because the culture ofthe time generally expected fathers and husbands to work and provide for their families, women and children who lost their husbands and fathers were seen as exceptionally vulnerable and likely to be forced into
Florence Kelley (1859-1932)
Progressive Florence Kelley dedicated her life to campaigning for reforms. While working at Chicago's Hull House in the 1890s, she conducted research that encouraged the passage ofthe first law banning children younger than 14from factory work. Later, she contributed to the foundation ofthe United States Children's Bureau to protect children. Her research on the effects of long workdays on women's health contributed to the Supreme Court's decision in Muller v. Oregon.

DRAWING CONCLUSIONS
Based on this excerpt, what insight does Addams's description offer about the progressives'view of child labor and the conditions in factories?
poverty. Society also believed that women were more physically vulnerabk than men, and for progressives the idea that poor women and their childn might be forced into difficult and dangerous working conditions was an important women’s issue.
Child Labor
Probably the most emotional progressive issue was the campaign against child labor. Children had always worked on family farms, but mines and factories presented more dangerous and unhealthy working conditions. Muckraker John Spargo’s 1906 book, The Bitter Cry ofthe Children, present detailed evidence of child labor conditions. It told of coal mines that hired thousands of 9- or 10-year-old “breaker boys” to pick slag out of coal, payin them 60 cents for a 10-hour day. It described how the work bent their backs permanently and often crippled their hands. Reports like these convinced states to pass laws that set a minimum age for employment and established other limits on child labor, such as maximum hours children could work. A the same time, many states began passing compulsory education laws, requiring young children to be in school instead of at work.
Health and Safety Codes
Many adult workers also labored in difficult conditions. Factories, coal mine and railroads were particularly dangerous. When workers were injured or killed on the job, they and their families received little or no compensation. Progressives joined union leaders to pressure states for workers’ compensatic laws. These laws established insurance funds that employers financed. Workers injured in accidents received payments from the funds.
In two cases, Lochnerv. New York (1905) and Muller v. Oregon (1908), the U.S. Supreme Court addressed government’s authority to regulate business to protect workers. In the Lochner case, the Court ruled that a New York law forbidding bakers to work more than 10 hours a day was unconstitutional, saying the state did not have the right to interfere with th liberty of employers and employees. In the Muller case, which involved women working in laundries in Oregon, however, the Court upheld the state’s right to limit hours.
The different judgments were based on gender differences. The Court state that healthy mothers were the state’s concern and, therefore, the limits on women’s working hours did not violate their Fourteenth Amendment rights.
In the Lochner case, the Court had adhered to a strict construction of the Constitution and decided that government did not have the power to interfere in the right of an employer and employee to make a contract. In the Miller case the Court had been more activist. It interpreted the Constitution so as to give government the power to regulate the workplace because of perceived public need to keep women safe by treating them differently from men.
On March 25, 1911, a tragedy occurred in New York City that led to ne^ reforms. A fire on the top floors of the Triangle Shirtwaist Company caused nearly 150 of the factory s 500 workers to lose their lives. The disaster illustrated that fire precautions and inspections were inadequate. In response, New York created a Factory Investigating Commission and soon passed new laws that reformed the labor code.
Some progressives also favored zoning laws as a method of protecting the public. These laws divided a town or city into zones for commercial, residential, or other development, thereby regulating how land and buildings could be used. Building codes set minimum standards for light,
208
air, room size, and sanitation and required buildings to have fire escapes. Health codes required restaurants and other facilities to maintain clean environments for their patrons.
Zoning laws created a constitutional question. The Fifth Amendment ofthe Constitution says that no one shall be “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” If the government takes something of value from someone, it is supposed to pay for it. As governments began to impose zoning laws on communities to improve sanitation, safety, and the quality of life, individuals and businesses began to complain that they were losing the use of their property. They argued that the government should compensate them for the loss.
In Hadacheck v. Sebastian (1915), a brick-maker argued that he needed clay on his land to make bricks and that zoning laws forcing him to move his kiln deprived him of his Fifth Amendment rights. The Court disagreed finding that the zoning laws were a constitutional use of a government’s police power to protect public health. In 1922, in Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon, however, the court narrowed its interpretation. A coal company owned the rights to mine under a piece of land but a law prohibited mining below land that supported buildings on the surface. The Court agreed that the law had gone too far. Under its Fifth Amendment rights, the coal company had been deprived of its property and was owed compensation.
The case established that the government does not have an unlimited right to regulate property use. At some point government regulation of property, even when done in the public interest, does require compensation.

The temperance movement gained a key victory in 1917 when Congress passed the Eighteenth Amendment. Prohibition went into effect in 1920, after the amendment was ratified.
► CRITICALTHINKING
Summarizing Why did the temperance movement push for the prohibition of alcoholic beverages?
The Prohibition Movement
Many progressives blamed alcohol for many of society’s problems. Society at the time tended to view drinking alcohol as acceptable for men, not women, and men consumed the vast majority of all the alcohol produced. As a result social-welfare progressives focused on the problems that alcohol abuse created for women. Settlement-house workers knew that wages were often spent on alcohol instead of the family, and that drunkenness often led to physical abuse, illness, poverty, and abandonment. From these concerns emerged one ofthe major women’s issues of the era, the temperance movement, which advocated that people stop, or at least moderate, their alcohol consumption.
Women were important leaders of the temperance movement. In 1874 a group of women formed the Womans Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). In 1879, Frances Willard became president of the WCTU and held the post for nearly 20 years. Under her leadership, the temperance movement grew to a national movement with significant political influence. In addition to temperance, Willard convinced the WCTU to support women’s suffrage and champion many social welfare causes, including prison reform, equal pay for women, protections for children, and the eight hour day. By 1911, the

SKILLS PRACTICE
There are many new words in this lesson, including initiative, referendum, primary, suffrage, prohibition, lobbying and others. Discuss the new words with a partner. If a word reminds you of any past experience, tell your partner about the experience.
WCTU had nearly a quarter of million members. In 1893 evangelical Protestant ministers formed another group, the Anti-Saloon League. When the temperance movement began, it concentrated on reducing alcohol consumption. Later it pressed for prohibition—laws banning the manufactu: transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages.
Despite significant opposition, especially from working-class voters, support for prohibition grew steadily. By 1916, nineteen states had introduced some form of prohibition on alcohol, and leaders of the prohibition movement began to push for a constitutional amendment banning the manufacture, transportation, or sale of alcohol in all ofthe United States. In 1919, the amendment was ratified. It went into effect in January 1920.
Progressives Versus Big Business
Many progressives agreed that big business needed regulation. Some believed the government should break up big companies to restore competition. This led to the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, Others argued that big business was the most efficient way to organize the economy. They pushed for government to regulate big companies and prevent them from abusing their power. The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), created in 1887 to regulate the railroads, was an early example of this kind of thinking.
Some activists even went so far as to advocate socialism—the idea that the government should own and operate industry for the community. They wanted the government to buy up large companies, especially industries that affected everyone, such as railroads and utilities. At its peak, socialism had some national support. Eugene V. Debs, the former leader of the American Railway Union, won nearly a million votes as the American Socialist Party candidate for president in 1912. Most progressives and most Americans, however, believed in the superiority of the American system of free enterprise.

Making Generalizations
Why Learn This Skill?
Have you heard statements such as "Only tall people play basketball well/' or "Dogs make better pets than cats"? Do you accept these statements at face value, or do you stop and consider whether or not they are valid?
Look for a conclusion or common element that fits all the facts. Make a generalization from these common elements.
Test your generalization to see if you can falsify it. Look for facts to support or disprove it.
Learning the Skill
The statements listed above are called generalizations. A generalization is a broad statement about a topic. A generalization takes facts from specific cases and then makes an inference that certain general conclusions can be derived from those facts. At a minimum, to be valid, a generalization must be based on accurate information.
Let's examine the generalization, "Only tall people play basketball well." We can find many examples of tall basketball players, but there are also many shorter players who excel at this sport. In other words we can find facts that disprove the generalization.
Suppose that you want to make a generalization about the relative danger of airplane travel compared to automobile travel. First, you would collect accident statistics involving airplanes and cars. Your next step would be to classify the information into categories. Then you would look for relationships between these categories. For example, you might put the airplane and automobile statistics in separate categories. You might also categorize the number of accidents and the number of fatalities. Finally, you should make a generalization that is consistent with most of the facts you gathered.
To Make and Test Generalizations, follow these steps:
•	To make a valid generalization, first collect information about a topic. This information must consist of accurate facts, not opinions.
•	Compare and contrast what those facts are telling you.
Practicing this Skill
Reread the lesson "The Roots of Progressivism" and examine the above photo of immigrants in New York in the early 1900s. Then answer these questions:
1.	What categories of progressives were there?
2.	A progressive muckraker, Jacob Riis, took the photo below. What kinds of issues is he trying to show in the photo?

Roosevelt Revives the Presidency
guidingquestion How much do you think a president's personal beliefs should shape national policy?
Theodore Roosevelt became president at age 42—the youngest person ever to take the office. In international affairs, he believed i Social Darwinism, which held that nations were in competition ar only the strongest would survive. Domestically, however, he was a committed progressive. He believed that government should balance the needs of competing groups in American society on behalf of the public interest. His reform programs soon became known as the Square Deal.
Roosevelt Takes on the Trusts
Roosevelt thought that trusts and other large business organizatioi were efficient and part of the reason for the prosperity of the Unit States. Yet he also felt that the monopoly power of some trusts hur
the public interest. He wanted to ensure that trusts did not abuse their power.
His first target was J. P. Morgan’s railroad holding company, Northern Securities. The company planned an exchange of stock that would merge existing railroad systems, creating a monopoly on railroad traffic in the Northwest. Farmers and business owner feared that without railroad competition, shipping rates would rif and reduce their profits. In 1902 Roosevelt ordered the attorney general to sue Northern Securities under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The suit charged Northern Securities with restraint of trade.

The suit puzzled J. P. Morgan, who asked what could be done to fix the problem. Unmoved, Roosevelt proceeded with the case. In 1904, in Northern Securities v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that Morgan’s firm had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. Roosevelt was hailed as a “trustbuster,” and his popularity with the public grew.
Northern Securities and the Commerce Clause
The Supreme Court’s decision in the Northern Securities case marked yet another shift in the relationship between the federal government and private business. Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution states that “The Congress shall have Power ... To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States. . . .” It was agreed that the Constitution gives the federal government the power to regulate commerce between the states, not within a state. But the definition of what actually constituted “interstate commerce” was open to interpretation.
In the late 1800s, the Court had applied a very strict interpretation of the commerce power. For example, when a sugar company gained control of 98 percent of the sugar industry, the Court ruled in U.S. v. E.C. Knight (1894), that the Sherman Anti-Trust Act could not be applied because the sugar was manufactured within a state. Manufacturing, the Court said, did not involve interstate commerce, even though the sugar was sold across state lines.
In the Northern Securities case, the Court began broadening its interpretation. Northern Securities was based in one state and was simply buying stock in other companies, but the Court, in a narrow 5-4 decision, decided the Antitrust Act could still be applied. In dissent, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes warned that the decision created a slippery slope: If the act before us is to be carried out according to what seems to me the logic ofthe argument... I can see no part ofthe conduct of life with which, on similar principles, Congress might not interfere.” Over time, his comment has proved accurate. It would take many decades and several Supreme Court decisions, but the interpretation ofthe commerce clause of the Constitution has been gradually expanded allowing the federal government more and more power to regulate private business.

arbitration settling a dispute by agreeing to accept the decision of an impartial outsider
The Coal Strike of 1902
As president, Roosevelt believed that it was his job to keep society operating efficiently by helping settle conflicts between different groups and their interests. In the fall of 1902, he put this belief into practice.
He worked to help resolve a coal strike between mine owners and nearly 150,000 members ofthe United Mine Workers (UMW). The UMW wantec increased pay, reduced hours, and union recognition. If the strike had dragged on, the nation would have faced a coal shortage that could have shut down factories and left many homes unheated.
Roosevelt urged the UMW and the mine owners to accept arbitration—a settlement negotiated by an outside party. The union agreed to arbitration. The mine owners refused, however, until Roosevelt threatened to order the army to run the mines. By intervening in the dispute, he took the first step toward establishing the federal government as an honest broker between powerful groups in society.
Regulating Big Business
Despite his lawsuit against Northern Securities and his role in the coal strike, Roosevelt believed that most trusts were good for the economy and that the costs of antitrust action outweighed its benefits. He agreed with th opponents of trust-busting who argued that companies generally formed trusts because it was the most efficient way to do business. Breaking up a trust would make an industry less efficient and drive up costs for the publi Furthermore, by taking a company to court, the government created uncertainty in the industry until the case was resolved. Business leaders would not know how to plan or what to expect, and that too would distort the economy and make it less efficient.
Roosevelt generally accepted these arguments against antitrust action, and he was also keenly aware that America’s biggest companies were now competing globally against foreign companies. U.S. Steel had formed a tru: in the United States, but it was competing against huge European steel companies in Britain, France, and Germany. Standard Oil had formed a tri in the United States, but it was competing globally against Burmah Oil in Britain (today known as BP), Royal Dutch Petroleum (today known as She Oil), and many other companies. Antitrust action against an American company might cripple its ability to compete internationally.
As a progressive, Roosevelt valued efficiency, and he believed that the United States had to be a world power, militarily and economically, in ord to prosper. But as a progressive, he also distrusted large concentrations of power and the potential for corruption and harm to the public good. So instead of aggressively seeking to break up trusts, he proposed to create a federal agency to investigate corporations and publicize the findings. He believed the most effective way to prevent big business from abusing its power was to keep the public informed.
In 1903 Roosevelt convinced Congress to create the Department of Commerce and Labor. The following year, this department began investigating U.S. Steel, a gigantic holding company that had been createc in 1901. Worried about a possible antitrust lawsuit, the company’s leader; met privately with Roosevelt. They offered to open their files for examination. In exchange, the Department of Commerce and Labor wou privately tell the company about any problems and allow them to fix the problems quietly. Roosevelt accepted this “gentlemen’s agreement,” as he called it, and soon made similar deals with other companies. These deals
214
gave him the ability to regulate big business without having to sacrifice economic efficiency by breaking up the trusts.
In keeping with his belief in regulation, Roosevelt pushed the Hepburn Act through Congress in 1906. The act was intended to strengthen the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) by giving it the power to set railroad rates. At first, railroad companies were suspicious of the ICC. However, the railroads eventually realized they could work with the commission to set rates and regulations that limited competition and prevented new competitors from entering the industry. By 1920, the ICC had begun setting rates at levels intended to ensure the industry’s profits.
By 1905 consumer protection had become a national issue. As Americans read news stories by muckrakers and listened to the concerns of progressive reformers, they increasingly felt that the costs of a laissez-faire approach to the economy outweighed the benefits. That year, a muckraker journalist named Samuel Hopkins Adams published several articles in Collier’s magazine describing the patent medicine business. Many companies patented and marketed potions they claimed would cure a variety of ills. Many of these medicines were little more than alcohol, colored water, and sugar. Others contained caffeine, opium, cocaine, and other dangerous compounds. Consumers had no way to know what they were taking, nor did they know whether the medicines worked as claimed. Many Americans were equally concerned about the food they ate. Dr. W. H. Wiley, chief chemist at the United States Department of Agriculture, had issued reports documenting dangerous preservatives, including formaldehyde and borax, being used in what he called ‘ embalmed meat.”
For similar reasons, food preparation businesses came under scrutiny. In 1906 Upton Sinclair published a novel, The Jungle, based on his close observations of the slaughterhouses of Chicago. The appalling conditions in the meatpacking industry, as described by Sinclair, enraged consumers.
Roosevelt and Congress responded with the Meat Inspection Act, passed in 1906. It required federal inspection of meat sold through interstate commerce and required the Agriculture Department to set standards of cleanliness in meatpacking plants. The Pure Food and Drug Act, passed on the same day in 1906, prohibited the manufacture, sale, or shipment of impure or falsely labeled food and drugs.
These two acts marked yet another change in the relationship between government and business. In both cases, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was given authority to inspect business operations and ensure that products were safe before they could be sold to the public. Initially, the Bureau of Chemistry at the U.S. Department of Agriculture was in charge of enforcing the Pure Food and Drug Act. The Bureau later became the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, that continues to regulate food and drugs today. The benefits ofthe new laws were obvious. Consumers were less likely to become sick and could expect that products actually contained the ingredients on their labels. The costs of the law, as with other regulations ofthe economy, meant that companies had to charge more for their products. Putting labels on products cost money, and companies passed that on to consumers. Given
| what Wiley had found in peoples food prior to the law, many Americans and I government leaders thought the costs were worth it.

Roosevelt was an enthusiastic outdoorsman, and he valued the country’s minerals, animals, and rugged terrain. He cautioned against unregulated use of public lands and argued that conservation should be the guiding principle in managing the United States s natural resources.
In his 1907 annual message to Congress, Roosevelt said: “[T]o waste, to destroy our natural resources, to skin and exhaust the land instead of using it so as to increase its usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of our children the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to them amplified and developed.”
Western Land Development
Roosevelt quickly applied his philosophy in the dry Western states, where farmers and city dwellers competed for scarce water. In 1902 Roosevelt supported passage of the Newlands Reclamation Act. This act authorized th use of federal funds from public land sales to pay for irrigation and land development projects. The federal government thus began transforming the West’s landscape and economy on a large scale.
Roosevelt also backed efforts to save the nation’s forests. He supported careful management of the timber resources of the West. He appointed his close friend Gifford Pinchot to head the United States Forest Service, established in 1905.
As progressives, Roosevelt and Pinchot both believed that trained experts in forestry and resource management should manage the nation’s forests. These professional managers would apply the same scientific standards to the landscape that others were applying to managing cities an industry. With the president’s support, Pinchot’s department drew up regulations to control lumbering on federal lands. Roosevelt also added more than 100 million acres to the protected national forests and established five new national parks and 51 federal wildlife reservations.
Roosevelt's Legacy
President Theodore Roosevelt changed the role of the federal government. F used his power in the White House to present his views, calling it his “bully pulpit. Increasingly, Americans began looking to the federal government to solve the nation’s economic and social problems.
Under Roosevelt, the power of the executive branch of government ha dramatically increased. The Interstate Commerce Commission, through t Hepburn Act, could set rates. The Department of Commerce and Laboi could monitor business. And the attorney general could rapidly brinj antitrust lawsuits under the Expedition Act. In addition, Roosevelt concern for the environment and for protection of the wild areas the United States helped develop a national parks system that preceded the establishment of the National Park Service in 19b H READING PROGRESS CHECK

Examining What were President Roosevelt's views on conservation, ai how did he act on those views?
Taft's Reforms
guiding question How did President Taft's beliefs differ from the progressives'beliefs?
Roosevelt believed William Howard Taft, his secretary of war, was the ideal person to continue his policies. Taft easily secured the Republican nomination and won the election of 1908. The Democratic candidate,
William Jennings Bryan, lost for a third time.
Taft Angers Progressives
Like many progressives, Taft believed high tariffs limited competition, hurt consumers, and protected trusts. Roosevelt had warned him to stay away from tariff reform because it would divide the Republican Party. Nevertheless, Taft called Congress into special session to lower tariff rates. The tariff debate did, indeed, divide the Republican Party into two groups: the progressives, who favored tariff reduction, and conservative Republicans, who wanted to maintain high tariffs. As negotiations dragged on, Taft’s support for tariff reductions waned. Finally, he signed into law the Payne-Aldrich Tariff, which hardly cut tariffs at all and actually raised them on some goods. Progressives felt outraged by Taft’s decision.
In 1909 Taft further angered progressives by replacing Roosevelt’s secretary of the interior, James R. Garfield, with Richard A. Ballinger. Garfield was an aggressive conservationist; Ballinger was a conservative corporate lawyer. Once in office, Ballinger tried to open nearly a million acres of public lands to private development. Gifford Pinchot accused Ballinger of planning to give valuable public lands in Alaska to a private business group for his own profit. Taft’s attorney general investigated the charges and decided they were unfounded. Not satisfied, Pinchot went to the press and asked Congress to investigate. Taft fired Pinchot for insubordination, or disobedience to authority. The congressional investigation cleared Ballinger.
By the second half of Taft’s term of office, many Americans had become so frustrated with him that the congressional elections of 1910 resulted in a sweeping Democratic victory. Democrats took the majority in the House, and Democrats and progressive Republicans gained control of the Senate from conservative Republicans.

Taft's Achievements
Despite his political problems, Taft also had several successes. Although Roosevelt was nicknamed the trustbuster, Taft actually brought twice as mani antitrust cases in four years as his predecessor had in seven. In other areas, Tafi also pursued progressive policies. In 1912 he established the Childrens Bureau, This agency investigated and publicized the problems of child labor.
The Ballinger-Pinchot controversy aside, Taft was also a dedicated conservationist. In 1910 Taft set up the Bureau of Mines to monitor the activities of mining companies, expand national forests, and protect waterpower sites from private development. The bureau helped make
possible many new technologies in the field of mining.
Although disturbed by stories of Taft’s “betrayal” of his progressivism, Roosevelt refused to criticize the president. He soon became impatient. In 1907, while president, Roosevelt had approved the purchase ofthe Tennessee Coal and Iron Company by U.S. Steel. In October 1911, Taft declared thatth deal violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. Roosevelt believed Taft’s focus on breaking up trusts was destroying the system of cooperation and regulation that he had seti with big business. In November 1911, Roosevelt publicly criticized Taft for this decision.
After Roosevelt broke with Taft, it was only a matter of time before progressives convinced Roosevelt to reenter politics. In late February 1912, Roosevelt announced h< would enter the presidential campaign of 1912 and attempt to replace Taft as the Republican nominee for president.
Taft disappointed Roosevelt, who attempted to unseat him in the 1912 Republican nomination.

Drawing Inferences
Why Learn This Skill?
Just as you are about to leave home to catch your school bus, you hear a radio report. There is a traffic jam near the bus garage. Your bus is late. Although no one told you, you conclude that the traffic jam probably made the bus late, and you use your phone to call a friend for a ride home. You have made an inference. From the limited facts available, you formed a conclusion. By combining facts and general knowledge, you made an inference about the reasons the bus was late. Making inferences is an important skill because we live in a world of imperfect knowledge. We cannot always have all the facts, but we have to make decisions based on what we do know. Many times, having only some of the facts is enough to reach a conclusion that lets you make a decision, if you have been careful about the inferences you have made.
Learning the Skill
Learning how to make inferences will help you draw conclusions about particular situations. To make accurate inferences, follow these steps:
•	Read or listen carefully for stated facts and ideas.
•	Review what you already know about the topic or situation.
•	Think about similar experiences you have had in the past to help understand the current situation.
•	Use logic and common sense to form a conclusion about the topic or situation.
•	If possible, find information that confirms or disproves your inference.
•	Recognize that you don't have all the information you need, and you might be wrong.
•	Decide whether to act on your inference.
Practicing this Skill
On December 8,1903, Samuel Langley was | ready for his second attempt at flying a manned,
1 self-propelled aircraft. This had never been done J before. Langley used a $50,000 U.S. government

grant to build a plane based on unmanned aircraft designs, adding a very powerful engine. The plane broke apart on takeoff and crashed into the Potomac River.
In contrast, Wilbur and Orville Wright used a little more than $1,000 of their personal savings to build an aircraft. The brothers carefully studied the problems with previous planes and designed one with better wings, a more efficient propeller, and a strong but light engine. On December 17,1903, these intrepid Americans made the first manned, powered flight in history on the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

Picking the Candidates
Believing that President William Howard Taft had failed to live up to progressive ideals, Theodore Roosevelt informed seven state governors that he was willing to accept the Republican nomination “My hat is in the ring!” he declared. “The fight is on.”
The struggle for control of the Republican Party reached its climax at the national convention in Chicago in June 1912. Conservatives rallied behind Taft. Most progressives supported Roosevelt. When it became clear that Taft’s delegates controlled the nomination, Roosevelt decided to leave the party and campaign as an independent.
Declaring himself “fit as a bull moose,” Roosevelt became the presidential candidate for the newly formed Progressive Party, which quickly became known as the Bull Moose Party. Because Ta: had alienated so many groups, the election of 1912 became a contest between two progressives: Roosevelt and the Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson.
After a university teaching career that culminated in his becoming the president of Princeton University, Woodrow Wilson entered politics as a firm progressive. As the governor of New Jersey, he pushed through many progressive reforms.
* Eleven electors in California voted for Roosevelt and two for Wilson.
He introduced the direct primary, established utility regulatory boards, and allowed cities to adopt the commissioner form of government. In less than two years, New Jersey became a model of progressive reform.
Wilson Versus Roosevelt
The election of 1912 was a contest between two progressives with different approaches to reform. Roosevelt accepted large trusts as a fact of life and set out to create proposals to increase regulation. He favored laws to protect women and children in the labor force and supported workers’ compensation for those injured on the job. Roosevelt called his program the New Nationalism.
Wilson countered with what he called the New Freedom. He criticized Roosevelt’s New Nationalism for supporting “regulated monopoly.”
Wilson argued that Roosevelt’s approach gave the federal government too much power in the economy and did nothing to restore competition.
Wilson believed that freedom outweighed efficiency.
As expected, Roosevelt and Taft split the Republican voters. Wilson won the Electoral College with 435 votes. He won the election even though he received less than 42 percent of the popular vote. For the first time since Grover Cleveland’s election in 1892, a Democrat was elected president.

Income Taxes and the 16th Amendment
Article 1, section 2 ofthe Constitution states that “Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers...” A direct tax is a tax imposed directly on a person or their property. If the federal government wants to tax property, it has to make sure the tax is proportionate among the states based on their population. If a state has 20 percent ofthe people in the country, it has to pay 20 percent of the taxes, regardless of whether the state is poor or wealthy. This requirement makes it very difficult for Congress to pass direct taxes.
An indirect tax is a tax that someone pays, but the tax burden falls on someone else. For example, if a company pays a tax for each car it makes, it simply includes that tax in the price of the car. The person who really pays the tax is the consumer, but they pay it indirectly. Sales taxes, excise taxes, and tariffs are all indirect taxes. An income tax on wages is also an indirect tax. It is actually an indirect tax on an employer. Employers know workers have to pay income taxes. So they have to pay high enough wages that workers will still take the job knowing they will pay income taxes. If there were no income taxes, employers could pay workers less and still get them to take the job.
Up until the early 1900s, the federal government had raised most of its money using sales taxes, excise taxes, and tariffs. As the progressive movement began, many progressives began to argue that income taxes were the best way to fund the federal government. An income tax could be graduated. You could tax wealthy people at a higher percentage than poor people. A graduated income tax is sometimes called a progressive tax.
In 1894, Congress imposed income taxes on wealthy Americans. The following year, the Supreme Court struck down the income tax law because it was not just a tax on wages, but a tax on all types of income. If a person earned income because they rented property, or because they owned stocks that paid dividends, they still had to pay the income tax. The Supreme Cour declared that an income tax that included income from property was a direct tax, not an indirect tax, and since it had not been divided proportionately among the states, it was unconstitutional.
The Court’s decision frustrated progressives. It meant that income taxes could be put on wages, and fall on working class Americans, but that rich people who earned most of their income from property could not be taxed on that income. Soon afterward, progressives began pressing for a Constitutional amendment that would allow the federal government to tax income, no matter its source, and without having to divide it proportionate! among the states. Both President Roosevelt and President Taft supported the amendment as did many political leaders in both parties. In February 1913, the 16th amendment allowing for taxes on incomes was ratified by the states.
A little over two months later, and only five weeks after taking office, President Wilson appeared before Congress, the first president to do so since John Adams. He had come to present his bill to reduce tariffs and introduce a federal income tax. Wilson personally lobbied members of Congress to support the tariff reduction bill. Not even Roosevelt had taken such an active role in promoting legislation. In 1913 Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1913, also known as the Underwood-Simmons Act, and Wilson signed it into law. This law reduced the average tariff on imported goods to about 30 percent of the value of the goods and provided for levying
222
a federal graduated income tax. The income tax was intended to replace the revenue lost by the tariff reductions.
Reforming the Banks
The United States had not had a central bank since the 1830s. Periodic economic depressions that had occurred after that time had destroyed numerous small banks, wiping out many of their customers’ life savings.
To restore public confidence in the banking system, Wilson supported a federal reserve system. Banks would have to keep part of their deposits in one of 12 reserve banks, providing a cushion against unexpected financial losses. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 created the regional reserve banks, supervised by a Board of Governors appointed by the president. The Board could set the interest rates the reserve banks charged other banks, thereby indirectly controlling the nations interest rates and the amount of money in circulation.
The Federal Reserve Act became one of the most significant pieces of legislation in American history. It created an independent agency that began to use monetary policy to manage the nation’s economy. Monetary policy refers to policies that adjust a nation’s money supply in order to regulate the economy. If the Federal Reserve sets interest rates low, businesses and individuals will generally borrow more money. This increases the amount of money in circulation and causes the economy to grow. If interest rates are raised, people borrow less, which slows the economy, but also reduces inflation. Generally speaking, the goal of monetary policy is to contract the money supply if inflation is too high, and expand the money supply if the economy is in a recession and unemployment is too high.
Antitrust Action
During his campaign, Wilson had promised to restore competition to the economy by breaking up monopolies. After the election, he realized that Roosevelt had been right: big businesses were more efficient and unlikely to be replaced by smaller, more competitive firms. Wilson decided against pursuing the monopolies. Progressives in Congress, however, continued to demand action against big business. In 1914, at Wilson’s request, Congress created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to monitor American business. The FTC had the power to investigate companies and issue “cease and desist” orders against those it found to be engaging in unfair trade practices, or practices that hurt competition. If a business disagreed with its rulings, it could take the FTC to court.
Wilson did not want the FTC to break up big business. Instead, it was to work toward limiting unfair trade practices. He deliberately appointed conservative business leaders as the FTC’s first commissioners. Unsatisfied by Wilson’s approach, progressives in Congress responded by passing the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914. The act outlawed certain practices that restricted competition such as price discrimination, or charging different customers different prices. The passing ofthe Clayton Antitrust Act corrected deficiencies in the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.
Before the law passed, labor unions lobbied Congress to exempt unions. As a result, the Clayton Antitrust Act stated that its provisions did not apply to labor organizations or agricultural organizations. When the bill became law, Samuel Gompers, the head ofthe American Federation of Labor, called the act the workers’ “Magna Carta” because it gave unions the right to exist.

New Roles for Government
Progressivism made important changes in the political life of the United States. Before this era, most Americans did not expect the government to pass laws protecting workers or regulating big business. In fact, many courts had previously ruled the passage of such laws unconstitutional. By the end of the Progressive Era, however, both legal and public opinion ha' shifted. Increasingly, Americans expected the government, particularly th federal government, to play a more active role in regulating the economy

Du Bois and other African American leaders believed that voting rights were essential to end lynching and racial discrimination. “The power ofthe ballot we need in sheer self-defense,” Du Bois said, “else what shall save us from a second slavery? Freedom too, the long-sought we still seek,—the freedom of life and limb, the freedom to work and think, the freedom to love and aspire. Work, culture, liberty,—all these we need, not singly, but together.”
In 1908 race riots in Springfield, Illinois, shocked many people, including Mary White Ovington, a settlement house worker. She had been studying African Americans in New York, determined to do something to improve their situation. Other progressives, including Jane Addams of Hull House and muckrakers Ida Wells-Barnett and Lincoln Steffens, joined Ovington in calling for change. Capitalizing on Springfield as Abraham Lincoln’s hometown and on the centennial of his birthday on February 12, 1909, they organized a national conference in Springfield to take stock of the progress in emancipation. At a second conference the following year, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was born. Through Du Bois, the members learned of the Niagara Movement, and the two groups eventually merged.
African Americans were not the only minority group facing discrimination. Jewish people also lived in fear of mob violence. In 1913 Leo Frank, a Jew being tried in Atlanta for a murder that the facts proved he did not commit, was sentenced to death. Although his sentence was changed to life imprisonment, a mob lynched him two years later.
In this context, lawyer Sigmund Livingston started the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) to combat stereotypes and discrimination. According to its 1913 charter, the ADL’s “ultimate purpose [was] to secure justice and fair treatment to all citizens alike and to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens.” The ADL worked to remove negative portrayals of Jews in movies, in print, and on stage. For example, the League protested a World War I army manual that claimed Jews were likely to pretend to be sick to escape work or battle. When the ADL complained, President Wilson had the manual recalled.

When war began between European nations in 1914, the United States tried to remain neutral, but attacks on U.S. ships eventually caused the United States to enter the war.
To successfully fight the war, the U.S. government used progressive ideas to manage the economy, build a large military, and shape public opinion. America's involvement in the war effort had a profound impact on American society for years to come.

Place and Time: United States 1914-1920
Political conflicts in Europe sparked the beginning of World War I. The United States attempted to keep its long-standing policy to remain neutral in Europe's wars until events eroded US, neutrality and finally led to the nation's involvement. World War I was the first time in US. history that the United States sent troops to fight in Europe. After the war, the United States suffered economic uncertainty and social tensions as many Americans became anti-immigrant, anticommunist, and antiunion.

nations goto war?
IT MATTERS BECAUSE
Through the late 1800s and early 1900s, imperialism, shifting national boundaries, old alliances, and nationalist sentiment: among European nations set the stage for World War I. Attack on U.S. ships and American support for the Allies eventually caused the United States to enter the war.
The Causes of World War I
guiding question What political circumstances in Europe led to World Warl?
In 1914 tensions were building among European nations, stemmin from events that dated to the 1860s. In 1864, while Americans fought the Civil War, the German kingdom of Prussia launched th first of a series of wars to unite the various German states into one nation. By 1871, Prussia had united Germany and established the German Empire, which became one of the most powerful nations i the world, transforming European politics.
Militarism and Alliances
In 1870, as part of its plan to unify Germany, Prussia forced Fran« to give up territory along the German border. As a result, France and Germany became enemies. To protect itself, Germany signed alliances with Italy and with the huge empire of Austria-Hungary which controlled much of southeastern Europe. This became known as the Triple Alliance.
The new alliance alarmed Russian leaders, who feared that Germany intended to expand eastward. In addition, Russia and Austria-EIungary were competing for influence in southeastern Europe. A common interest in opposing Germany and Austria-Hungary led Russia and France to sign the Franco-Russia Alliance in 1894. Under the alliance, the two nations promised to come to each other s aid in a war against the Triple Alliance.
Such alliances fostered militarism—the strong buildup of armed forces to intimidate and threaten other nations. Over time, German militarism led Britain to become involved in the alliance
232
system. Britain s policy was to try to prevent one nation from controlling all of Europe. By the late 1800s, Germany had clearly become Europe’s strongest nation.
In 1898 Germany began building a large modern navy. The buildup threatened the British, who rushed to build warships. By the early 1900s, Britain and Germany were engaged in an arms race. The race convinced Britain to build closer ties with France and Russia. The British refused to sign a formal alliance, so the relationship became known as an entente cordiale, or friendly understanding. Britain, France, and Russia became known as the Triple Entente.
Imperialism and Nationalism
By the late 1800s, nationalism, or a feeling of intense pride in ones homeland, had become a powerful idea in Europe. Nationalists place primary emphasis on promoting their homeland’s culture and interests. They believe in the right of self-determination—the idea that those who share a national identity should have their own country and government. In the 1800s, nationalism led to a crisis in the Balkan region of southeastern Europe.
In the 1700s and 1800s, imperialism—the ruling or controlling of other peoples or nations through annexation, military conquest, or economic domination—was how European powers built empires. For years the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire had ruled the Balkans. But as nationalism spread in the late 1800s and early 1900s, national groups such as the South Slavs—Serbs, Bosnians, Croats, and Slovenes—began to press for independence. The Serbs, who were the first to gain independence, formed a nation called Serbia between the two empires. Serbia believed that its mission was to unite the South Slavs.
Russia supported the Serbs, but Austria-Hungary worked to limit Serbia’s growth. In 1908 Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia, which had belonged to the Ottoman Empire, outraging the Serbs. The annexation demonstrated that Austria-Hungary had no intention of letting the Slavic people in its empire become independent.
An Assassination Brings War
In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, visited the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. As he and his wife rode through the city, Bosnian revolutionary Gavrilo Princip rushed their car and shot them dead. The assassination occurred with the knowledge of Serbian officials who hoped to start a war that would damage Austria-Hungary.
Austria-Hungary decided the time had come to crush Serbia in order to prevent Slavic nationalism from undermining its empire. Knowing an attack on Serbia might trigger a war with Russia, the Austrians asked their German allies for support. Austria-Hungary then issued an ultimatum to the Serbian government. The Serbs counted on Russia to back them up, and the Russians, in turn, counted on France.
On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Russia immediately mobilized its army, including troops stationed on the German border. Within days Germany declared war on Russia and France. World War I had begun.
Germany immediately launched a massive invasion of France, hoping to knock the French out of the war, so it

Those fighting for the Triple Entente were called the Allies. Italy joined them in 1915 after being promised part of Austro-Hungarian territory after the war. Germany and Austria-Hungary joined with th Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria to form the Central Powers. German) plan to defeat France before Russia could mobilize failed. When Rus

Evaluating How did the complex web of European alliances contribu to the outbreak of World War I?

HISTORIAN
Determining Cause and Effect
Propaganda is a powerful force to influence opinion.
In wartime, propaganda can be used to convince people to take sides or participate for a particular cause or reason.
As a historian, how much do you think the British propaganda swayed the United States to support the Allies in World War I, or were other reasons, such as business, more of a deciding factor?
The United States Enters the War
guiding question What events motivated the United States tojoin the war?
When World War I began, President Wilson was determined to keep the United States out of a European conflict. He immediately declared the United States to be neutral and asked all Americans “to be impartial in thought as well as in action.” Despite Wilsons hopes for neutrality, events gradually drew the United States into the war on the side of the Allies. The Neutrality Debate
Despite the president’s plea, most Americans supported one side or the other. Many German Americans supported their homeland, and many Iri Americans harbored hostility toward Britain, but in general public opinic favored the Allies. Many Americans valued the heritage, language, and political ideals they shared with Britain. Others treasured America’s links with France, a great friend to America during the Revolutionary War.
For more than two years, the United States remained neutral. During this time a great debate began over whether the country should prepare f war. Supporters of the “preparedness” movement believed that preparing was the best way to make sure the United States was not forced into the conflict. Others disagreed. In 1915, Carrie Chapman Catt and Jane Addams—leaders of the women’s suffrage movement—founded the Women’s Peace Party. This organization, along with others such as the League to Limit Armament, worked to keep America out of the war.
One select group of Americans was decidedly pro British: President Wilsons cabinet. Only Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan favored neutrality. The other cabinet members argued forcefully on behalf of Brit Many U.S. military leaders also backed Britain, believing an Allied victor was the only way to preserve the world’s balance of power.
British officials worked diligently to win American support. One method they used was propaganda, or information designed to influenc opinion. The British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable from Europe to United States so most war news would be based on British reports. The American ambassador to Britain endorsed many of these reports, and American public opinion swayed in favor ofthe Allies.
234
Companies in the United States also had strong ties to the Allies, and many American banks invested heavily in an Allied victory. By 1917, American loans to the Allies totaled over $2 billion. Although other banks, particularly in the Midwest where pro-German feelings were strongest, lent some $27 million to Germany, the country’s prosperity was intertwined with the Allies. If the Allies won, the investments would be paid back; if not, the money might never be repaid.
Moving Toward War
A series of events gradually eroded American neutrality and drew the United States into the war. Shortly after the war began, the British blockaded German ports. They forced neutral merchant ships sailing to Europe to land at British ports to be inspected for contraband, or goods prohibited from shipment to Germany and its allies. Although the U.S. government protested Britain’s decision, the German response angered Americans even more. In February 1915, the Germans announced that they would use submarines called U-boats to sink without warning any ship they found in the waters around Britain. This decision violated an international treaty signed by Germany that banned attacks on civilian ships without warning.

ANALYZING PRIMARY SOURCES
Should the United States Stay Neutral in World War I?
Many Americans were divided about whether the United States should remain neutral. Voices spoke out loudly on both sides.
--------YES----------	--------NO
« Germany is not moving against this country. She has not been guilty of any aggression against us. She has taken the lives of a few of our citizens, because they got in the way when she was prosecuting a war against another nation and fighting to preserve her existence. If the German Government should make aggressive warfare against the United States you would not need
any exhortation in the Senate of the United States to arouse the patriotism ofthe American people. You would not be holding open your enlisting stations without getting any soldiers.99
—from the Congressional Record, March 4,1917
«I have come to the conclusion that the German Government is utterly hostile to all nations with democratic institutions because those who compose it see in democracy a menace to absolutism and the defeat ofthe German ambition for world domination....
... Germany must not be permitted to win this war and to break even, though to prevent it this country is forced to take an active part. This ultimate necessity must be
constantly in our minds in all our controversies with the belligerents. American public opinion must be prepared for the time, which may come, when we will have to cast aside our neutrality and become one ofthe champions of democracy."

On May 7, 1915, a U-boat sank the British passenger ship Lusitani killing over 1,000 passengers—including 128 Americans. The attack gave credibility to British propaganda and changed American attitude about the war. Wilson sent an official protest to Germany, but in Mari 1916, a U-boat torpedoed a French passenger ship. Wilson then decided to issue one last warning demanding that the German
government abandon its methods or risk war with the United States. Germany did not want to strengthen the Allies by drawing the
United States into the war. It promised with certain conditions to stc sinking merchant ships without warning. President Wilson’s success played an important part in his reelection bid in 1916. His campaigi slogan, “He kept us out of war,” helped him win a narrow victory.

war with Germany was necessary.
Then, on February 1, 1917, Germany resumed unrestricted submarin warfare. German military leaders believed that they could starve Britain into submission if U-boats began sinking all ships on sight. They did not believe that the United States could raise an army and transport it to Europe in time if it decided to enter the war. Between February 3 and March 21, U-boats sank six American ships. Roused to action, President Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany on April 2, 1917:

Wartime Agencies
As part of the war effort, Congress created new agencies staffed by business executives, managers, and government officials to coordinate mobilization and ensure the efficient use of national resources. These agencies emphasized cooperation between big business and government.
The War Industries Board (WIB) coordinated the production of war materials. Early problems convinced President Wilson to expand the Board s powers. The WIB told manufacturers what they could produce, allocated raw materials, ordered new factory construction, and sometimes set prices.
The Food Administration, run by Herbert Hoover, was responsible for increasing food production while reducing civilian consumption. The agency encouraged families to conserve food and grow their own vegetables in victory gardens. “Eat more corn, oats and rye products—fish and poultry—fruits, vegetables and potatoes, baked, boiled and broiled foods.... Eat less wheat, meat, sugar and fats to save for the army and our allies,” urged Food Administration posters.
The Fuel Administration managed use of coal and oil. To conserve energy, it introduced the first usage of daylight saving time, shortened workweeks for civilian goods factories, and encouraged Heatless Mondays.

migrate to move from one location to another
By the end ofthe war, the United States had spent about $32 billion. To fund the war effort, Congress raised income tax rates, placed new taxes on corporate profits, imposed an extra tax on the profits of arms factories, and borrowed over $20 billion through the sale of Liberty Bonds and Victory Bonds. Americans who bought bonds were lending money to the government to be repaid with interest in a specified number of years. Mobilizing the Workforce
The war effort also required the cooperation of workers. To prevent strikes from disrupting the war effort, the government established the National War Labor Board (NWLB) in April 1918. The NWLB often pressured industry to improve wages, adopt an eight-hour workday, and allow unions the right to organize and bargain collectively. In exchange, labor leaders agreed not to disrupt war production. As a result, membership in unions increased by over one million between 1917 and 1919.
With so many men in the military, employers were willing to hire women for jobs traditionally held by men. Some 1 million women joined the workforce for the first time, and another 8 million switched to better industrial jobs. Women worked in factories, shipyards, and railroad yards and served as police officers, mail carriers, and train engineers. When the war ended, however, most women returned to their previous jobs or stopped working. Yet the changes demonstrated that women were capable of holding jobs that many had believed only men could do.
Desperate for workers, Henry Ford sent agents to the South to recruit African Americans. Other companies quickly followed suit. Promises of high wages and plentiful work convinced between 300,000 and 500,000 African Americans to move north. This massive population movement became known as the Great Migration. The racial makeup of such cities as Chicago, New York, Cleveland, and Detroit changed greatly. Eventually, so did politics in the Northern cities, where African Americans were able to vote.
The war also encouraged other groups to migrate. Between 1917 and 1920, more than 100,000 Mexicans migrated into the Southwest, providing labor for farmers and ranchers. Mexican Americans also found new
CHARTS/GRAPHS
To pay for the war, the U.S. government raised taxes and issued bonds. The government printed posters, organized parades, and asked movie stars to help promote war bonds. Here, actor Douglas Fairbanks urges Americans to buy Liberty Bonds at a rally in New York City in 1918.

Mexican Americans tended o settle in separate neighborhoods, called barrios, where hey could support one another.
Shaping Public Opinion
Progressives did not think that organizing the economy was enough to ensure the success of the war effort. They also believed the government needed to shape public opinion. Soon after Congress declared war, Wilson created the Committee on Public Information (CPI) to “sell” the war to the American people. Headed by
journalist George Creel, the CPI recruited advertising executives, artists, authors, songwriters, entertainers, public speakers, and motion picture companies to help sway public opinion in favor ofthe war.
The CPI distributed pamphlets and arranged for thousands of “four-minute speeches” to be delivered at movie theaters and other public places. Some 75,000 speakers, known as Four-Minute Men, urged audiences to support the war in various ways, from buying war bonds to reporting draft dodgers to the authorities. Nongovernmental groups also helped raise awareness and funds for the war. For example, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee raised $63 million in relief funds. The Jewish Welfare Board set up centers at home and abroad for Jewish servicemen.
The Supreme Court Limits Free Speech
In addition to using propaganda, the government passed legislation to limit opposition to the war and to fight espionage, or spying to acquire government information. The Espionage Act of 1917 made it illegal to aid the enemy, give false reports, or interfere with the war effort. The Sedition Act of 1918 made it illegal to speak against the war publicly. In practice, it allowed officials to prosecute anyone who criticized the government. These two laws led to more than 2,000 convictions.
Despite protests, the Espionage and Sedition Acts were upheld by the Supreme Court. Although the First Amendment states that Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, the Supreme Court departed from a strict interpretation of the Constitution. In Schenck v. United States (1919), Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the unanimous opinion. The Court ruled that the government could restrict speech when the speech constituted a “clear and present danger.

The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree. When a nation is at war, many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight, and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.** —from United States Supreme Court Reports, 1920.

Building the Military
guiding question How were progressive ideals used in preparing the military for war ?
Progressives did not abandon their ideas when it came to building up the military. Instead, they applied those ideas to develop a new system for recruiting a large army
Volunteers and Conscripts
When the United States entered the war in 1917, the army and the National Guard together had slightly more than 200,000 troops. Many men quickly volunteered, but many more were still needed.
Many progressives believed that forced military service was a violation of democratic and republican principles. Believing a draft was necessary, however, Congress, with Wilsons support, created a new system called selective service.
Instead of having the military run the draft from Washington, D.C., the Selective Service Act of 1917 required all men between 21 and 30 to register for the draft. A lottery randomly determined the order in which they were called before a local draft board in charge of selecting or exempting people from military service. The thousands of local boards were the heart ofthe system. The members of the draft boards were civilians from local communities. Progressives believed local people, understanding community needs, would know which men to draft and would do a far better job than a centralized government bureaucracy. Eventually, about 2.8 million Americans were drafted.
Not all American soldiers were drafted. Approximately 2 million men volunteered for military service. Some had heard stories of German atrocities and wanted to fight back. Others believed democracy was at stake. Many believed they had a duty to respond to their nation’s call.
Although the horrors of war soon became apparent to the American troops, their morale remained high, helping to ensure victory. More than 50,000 Americans died in combat, and over 200,000 were wounded. Another 60,000 soldiers died from disease, mostly from the influenza epidemic of 1918 and 1919. The flu epidemic was not limited to the battlefield. It spread around the world and made more than a quarter of all Americans sick. The disease killed an estimated 25 to 50 million people worldwide, including more than 500,000 Americans.
The U.S. Army kept many African American soldiers from combat, assigning them to work as cooks, laborers, and laundrymen. The 369th Regiment, however, was assigned to the French Army and spent 191 days in the frontline trenches. The entire regiment was awarded the French Croix de Guerre for gallantry in combat.

Of the nearly 400,000 African Americans who were drafted, about 42,000 served overseas as combat troops. African American soldiers encountered discrimination and prejudice in the army, where they served in racially segregated units, almost always under the supervision of white officers. Despite these challenges, many African American soldiers fought with distinction. For example, the African American 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions fought in bitter battles along the Western Front. Many ofthe soldiers in those divisions won praise from the French commander, Marshal Philippe Petain, and the United States commander, General John Pershing.
An estimated 12,000 Native Americans and about 20,000 Puerto Ricans served in the armed forces. Thousands of Mexican Americans also served in the war, volunteering for service more than any other minority group in the United States. Some Asian immigrants fought on the side of the United States even before they were citizens. Though they faced discrimination, many Asians served in the U.S. Army with distinction, being granted citizenship in recognition of their contributions.
Women Join the Military
World War I was the first war in which women officially served in the armed forces, although they served only in noncombat positions. As the military prepared for war in 1917, it faced a severe shortage of clerical workers because so many men were assigned to active duty. Early in 1917, the navy authorized the enlistment of women to meet its clerical needs.
Women serving in the navy wore a standard uniform and were assigned the rank of yeoman. By the end of the war, more than 11,000 women had served in the navy. Although most performed clerical duties, others served as radio operators, electricians, pharmacists, chemists, and photographers. Unlike the navy, the army refused to enlist women. Instead, it began hiring women as temporary employees to fill clerical jobs. The only women to actually serve in the army were in the Army Nurse Corps.
Women had served as nurses in both the army and the navy since the early 1900s, but as auxiliaries. They were not assigned ranks and were not technically enlisted in the army or navy. More than 20,000 nurses served in the Army Nurse Corps during the war, including more than 10,000 overseas. g READING PROGRESS CHECK

All of the warring nations in World War I used propaganda to boost support for their side. Many Americans believed the propaganda coming from Europe, particularly from the British government and press. When the United States entered the war, the American government also began using propaganda in an attempt to unite Americans behind the war effort.

“Fear, perhaps, is rather an important element to be bred in the civilian population. It is difficult to unite a people by talking only on the highest ethical plane. To fight for an ideal, perhaps, must be coupled with thoughts of self preservation. So a truthful appeal to the fear of men, the recognition ofthe terrible things that would happen if the German Government were permitted to retain its prestige, may be necessary in order that all people unite in the support ofthe needed sacrifices.”

guiding question How did new technologies increase the number of casualties compared with previous wars?
By the spring of 1917, World War I had devastated Europe. Old-fashioned strategies and new technologies resulted in terrible destruction. Many Americans believed, however, that their troops would make a difference and quickly bring the war to an end.
Trench Warfare
Early offensives demonstrated that warfare had changed. Powerful artillery guns placed far behind the front lines hurled huge explosive shells onto the battlefield. More people were killed by artillery fire than by any other weapon. As one American noted in his diary:

—quoted in The American Spirit, November 3,1918
To protect themselves from artillery, troops began digging trenches. On the Western Front—where German troops fought French, British, and Belgian forces—the troops dug a network of trenches that stretched from the English Channel to the Swiss border. Both sides used barbed wire and a new weapon, the machine gun, to guard against the enemy. Attacks usually began with a massive artillery barrage. Soldiers then raced across the rough landscape

toward enemy trenches. Troops used any weapon available to kill the enemy. The new style of fighting, which both sides eventually utilized, resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of men and a stalemate on the Western Front. Offensive and defensive moves by the Allies and the Germans failed to be particularly successful.
To protect against poison gas attacks, troops carried gas masks similar to these masks worn by American soldiers in 1917.
network an interconnected system
New Technology
Breaking through enemy lines required new technologies. The Germans first used poison gas in 1915, and the Allies soon followed. Gas caused vomiting, blindness, and suffocation. Both sides developed gas masks to counter fumes. In 1916 the British introduced the armored tank, which could crush barbed wire and cross trenches. But there were still too few of the slow, unreliable machines to revolutionize warfare.
World War I also marked the first use of aircraft in war. Early in the war, the Germans used giant rigid balloons called zeppelins to drop bombs on British warships in the North Sea. At first, airplanes were used to spy on enemy troops and ships. Then the Allies equipped them with machine guns and rockets to attack the German zeppelin fleet. Other aircraft carried small bombs to drop on enemy lines. As technology advanced, airplanes shot down other airplanes in battles known as dogfights. But early military aircraft were difficult to fly and easy to destroy. A combat pilot had an average life expectancy of about two weeks.

The Americans Arrive
guiding question Why was the arrival ofU.S. forces so important to the war effort?

Nearly two million American troops marched into the bloody stalemate in the Western Front. Although the American " doughboys” were inexperienced, they were fresh and eager to fight. As the Americans began to arrive, many in Germany concluded that the war was lost.
Winning the War at Sea
American admiral William S. Sims proposed that merchant ships and troop transports travel in groups called convoys. Small, maneuverable warships called destroyers protected convoys across the Atlantic. If a ship was sunk, other ships in the convoy could rescue survivors. Convoys greatly reduced shipping losses and ensured that American troops arrived safely in time to help the Allies on the Western Front.

Russia Leaves the War
In March 1917, riots broke out in Russia. Czar Nicholas II, the leader of the Russian Empire, abdicated his throne, and the Russian Revolution began. A temporary government took command whose leaders wanted Russia to stay in the war. However, the government was unable to deal adequately with the problems afflicting the nation, so Vladimir Lenin’s Bolshevik Party seized power and established a Communist government in November 1917.
Germany’s military fortunes improved with the Bolshevik takeover.
Lenin pulled Russia out of the war to concentrate on establishing a Communist state. He explained:
convoy a group that travels with something, such as a ship, to protect it
adequately sufficiently; completed to its minimum requirements
PRIMARYSOURCE
(([l]t is necessary with particular thoroughness, persistence and patience to... prove without overthrowing capital it is impossible to end the war by a truly democratic peace.**
—from The April Theses, 1917
Air battles first occurred during World War I. These early planes, however, were hard to fly and easy to destroy during dogfights.
Lenin agreed to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany on March 3,
1918.	Under this treaty, Russia gave up the Ukraine, its Polish and Baltic territories, and Finland. With the Eastern Front settled, Germany could concentrate its forces in the west.
Americans Enter Combat
At the time World War I began, many Americans believed they owed the French a debt for their help in the American Revolution. General John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), arrived in Paris on July 4, 1917. British and French commanders wanted to integrate American troops into their armies. Pershing refused, and eventually only one unit, the 93rd Infantry Division an African American unit—was transferred to the French.
Germany's Last Offensive On March 21,1918, the Germans launched a massive gas attack and artillery bombardment along the Western Front. Strengthened by reinforcements from the Russian front, the Germans pushed deep into Allied lines. By early June, they were less than 40 miles (64 km) from Paris. In late May, as the

Alvin York (1887-1964)
Alvin York grew up poor in the mountains of Tennessee. After being drafted, he tried to avoid military service as a conscientious objector due to his pacifist Christian beliefs. York later became convinced that he could fight for a just cause. During the Battle ofthe Argonne Forest, German machine guns on a fortified hill fired on York's platoon and killed nine men. York took command and charged the machine guns. He went on to kill several Germans, capture the machine guns, and take 132 prisoners. For his actions, he received the Medal of Honor and the French Croix de Guerre.

offensive continued, the Americans launched their first major attack, quickly capturing the village of Cantigny. On June 1, American and French troops blocked the German drive on Paris at the town of Chateau-Thierry. On July 15, the Germans launched one last massive attack in an attempt to take Paris, but American and French troops held their ground.
The Battle of the Argonne Forest With the German drive stalled, French marshal Ferdinand Foch, supreme commander of the Allied forces, ordered massive counterattacks. In mid-September American troops drove back German forces at the battle of Saint-Mihiel. On September 26, 1918, the most massive offensive for the American Expeditionary Force was launched in the region between the Meuse River and the Argonne Forest. Although the Germans inflicted heavy casualties, their positions slowly fell to the advancing American troops. By early November, the Americans had opened a hole on the eastern flank of the German lines. All across the Western Front, the Germans began to retreat.
The War Ends
Meanwhile, a revolution had engulfed Austria-Hungary. In October 1918, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia declared independence. By early November, the governments of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire had surrendered to the Allies.
In late October, sailors in Kiel, the main base of the German fleet, mutinied. Within days, groups of workers and soldiers seized power in other German towns. The German emperor stepped down, and on November 9, Germany became a republic. Two days later, the government signed an armistice—an agreement to stop fighting. On November 11,1918, the fighting stopped.

A
Flawed Peace guiding question Why did President Wilson's ideas for peace negotiations differ from those of french premier Clemenceau and British prime minister Lloyd George?
Although the fighting had stopped, World War I was not over. In January 1919, delegates from 27 countries traveled to the peace conference at the Palace of Versailles, near Paris. The treaty with Germany that resulted came to be called the Treaty of Versailles. The conference also negotiated the Treaty of Saint-Germain, ending the war with Austria-Hungary. Negotiations on the Treaty of Versailles lasted five months. The most important participants were the so-called “Big Four”: President Wilson of the United States, British prime minister David Lloyd George, French premier Georges Clemenceau, and Italian prime minister Vittorio Orlando. Russian representatives were not invited to the conference because Allied leaders refused to recognize Lenin’s government as legitimate.
The Fourteen Points
President Wilson arrived in Paris in 1919 with a peace plan known as the Fourteen Points. It was based on “the principle of justice to all peoples and nationalities.” In the first five points, Wilson proposed to eliminate the causes ofthe war through free trade, freedom ofthe seas, disarmament, an impartial adjustment of colonial claims, and open diplomacy.

The next eight points addressed the right of national self-determination, the idea that the borders of countries should be based on ethnicity and national identity. Supporters of this idea believed that when borders are not based on national identity, nations are more likely to go to war to resolve border disputes. This principle also meant that no nation should keep territory taken from another nation. This required the Central Powers to evacuate all invaded countries and Germany to restore the French territory of Alsace-Lorraine, taken in 1871.
The fourteenth point called for the creation of a League of Nations. The Leagues members would help preserve peace by pledging to respect and protect each other’s territory and political independence. Wilson was willing to give up his other goals in exchange for support for the League.
The Treaty of Versailles
Wilson’s popularity in Europe put him in a strong negotiating position. The peace conference decided to use the Fourteen Points as the basis for negotiations. But not everyone was impressed by Wilson’s ideas. Premier Clemenceau of France and British prime minister Lloyd George wanted to punish the Germans for the suffering they had inflicted on the rest of Europe. Additionally, Britain refused to give up its sizable naval advantage by agreeing to Wilson’s call for freedom of the seas.
The Treaty of Versailles, reluctantly signed by Germany on June 28,
1919,	included many terms designed to punish and weaken Germany. Germany’s armed forces were greatly reduced and its troops were not allowed west ofthe Rhine River. The treaty also specifically blamed “the aggression of Germany” for the war. This allowed the Allies to demand that Germany pay reparations—monetary compensation for all of the war damages it had caused. A commission decided that Germany owed the Allies about $33 billion. This sum far exceeded what Germany could pay all at once and was intended to keep its economy weak for a long time.

German Empire, and the Ottoman Empire were dismantled, and new nations created. In general, the majority of people in each new country were from one ethnic group. But both Poland and Czechoslovakia were given territory where the majority of the people were German, and Germany was split in two in order to give Poland access to the Baltic Sea. This arrangement helped set the stage for a new series of crises in the 1930s.
The Treaty of Versailles ignored freedom of the seas, free trade, and Wilson’s goal of a fair settlement of colonial claims. No colonial people in Asia or Africa
received independence. France and Britain took over colonial areas in Africa and the Middle East, and Japan assumed responsibility for colonies in East Asia. The treaty did, however, call for the creation of a League of Nations. League members promised to reduce armaments, to submit all disputes that endangered the peace to arbitration, and to aid any member who was threatened with aggression.

The U.S. Senate Rejects the Treaty
President Wilson was confident the American people would support the Treaty of Versailles. But he had badly underestimated opposition to the League of Nations in the Senate. All treaties signed by the United States must be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate, and in November 1918, the Democratic Party had lost control of the Senate. Even though he needed Republican support to ratify the treaty, Wilson refused to take any Republican leaders with him to the peace conference. This ensured that Wilsons views prevailed, but it also meant that Republican concerns were not addressed.
Opposition in the Senate focused on the League of Nations. One group of senators, nicknamed “the Irreconcilables,” refused to support the treaty under any circumstances. They assailed the League as the kind of “entangling alliance” that George Washington and the other Founders had warned against. They believed that joining an international organization endangered American sovereignty. As a democratic-republic, the American government was supposed to act based on what its own citizens wanted, not what people in other countries wanted.
A larger group of senators, known as the “Reservationists,” was led by the powerful chairman of the Foreign Relations committee, Henry Cabot Lodge. The reservationists were willing to support the Treaty of Versailles if amendments were made to the League of Nations. The reservationists pointed out that the Constitution requires Congress to declare war. Yet the League of Nations could require member states to aid any member who was attacked. The reservationists argued that this might force the United States into a war without Congressional approval. They agreed to ratify the treaty if it was amended to say that any military action by the United States required the approval of Congress. Wilson refused, fearing the change would undermine the League’s effectiveness.
Wilson decided to take his case directly to the American people. Starting in September 1919, he traveled some 8,000 miles and made more than 30 major speeches in three weeks. Soon afterward he suffered a stroke. Although bedridden, Wilson still refused to compromise on the treaty.
The Senate voted in November 1919 and in March 1920, but both times it refused to give its consent to the treaty. After Wilson left office in 1921, the United States negotiated separate peace treaties with each ofthe Central Powers. The League of Nations took shape without the United States.
248
The debate had pointed out the pros and cons of international treaties and international organizations. On the one hand, once the United States joined an international organization and signed an international treaty, it was bound by those agreements which would limit the nation’s ability to act independently. Of course, the United States could always withdraw from a treaty, but when a nation does that too often, its credibility is damaged and other nations will no longer trust it to keep its agreements. On the other hand, had the United States joined the League of Nations, it would have been able to use its power and influence to shape League policies and enforce League actions. It could have helped promote international cooperation and peace. In the years ahead, many people would argue that the League of Nations was ineffective because many powerful nations, such as the United States, were not members.
World War I: A Turning Point
World War I marked an important turning point in world history. The war had destroyed the German, Russian, and Austro-Hungarian empires and badly weakened Britain and France. All across the world, Wilson’s idea of national self-determination began to take hold as people in Europe’s colonies began to work for independence. The war had also triggered a communist revolution in Russia, and that development would affect global events for the rest of the twentieth century as a slow motion struggle began between supporters of democratic institutions and free enterprise and supporters of communism and revolution.

America's victory overseas led to turmoil at home. The end ofthe wartime economy led to a depression and fears of communism, as strikes, riots, and bombings took place.
An Economy in Turmoil
guidingquestion Why did many workers participate in strikes following the war ?
After the war ended, government agencies removed their controls from the economy. People raced to buy goods that had been rationed, while businesses raised prices they had been forced to keep low. The result was rapid inflation that greatly increased the cost of living—the cost of food, clothing, shelter, and other essentials. With orders for war materials evaporating, factories laid off workers. Returning soldiers found that jobs were scarce. Inflation Leads to Strikes
While workers wanted higher wages to keep up with inflation, companies resisted because inflation was also driving up their operating costs. During the war, union membership had increased greatly. Business leaders, however, were determined to break the power of the unions. By the end of 1919, more than 3,600 strikes involving more than four million workers had taken place.
The Seattle General Strike In Seattle, some 35,000 shipyard workers walked off the job demanding higher wages and shorter hours. Other unions in Seattle soon organized a general strike—-a strike that involves all workers in a community—of more than 60,000 people that paralyzed the city for five days. The strikers returned to work without making any gains, but their actions worried many Americans because the general strike was a common tactic of Communists and some radical groups in Europe.
The Boston Police Strike One of the most famous strikes of 1919 occurred in Boston, where roughly 75 percent ofthe police force walked off the job. Riots and looting forced Governor Calvin
A
250
Coolidge to call in the National Guard. When the strikers tried to return to work, the police commissioner instead fired them. Despite protests, Coolidge agreed that the men should be fired, declaring: “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, anytime.” Coolidge’s response earned him widespread public support and convinced the Republicans to make him their vice-presidential candidate in 1920.
The Steel Strike Soon after the police strike, an estimated 350,000 steelworkers went on strike for higher pay, shorter hours, and recognition of their union. U.S. Steel refused to talk to union leaders and set out to break the union. It blamed the strike on foreign radicals and called for loyal Americans to return to work. Meanwhile, the company hired African American and Mexican workers as replacements. Clashes between company guards and strikers were frequent. In Gary, Indiana, a riot left 18 strikers dead. The strike collapsed in 1920, setting back the union cause in the steel industry for more than a decade. Racial Unrest
Postwar economic turmoil also contributed to widespread racial unrest. Many African Americans had moved north during the war to take factory jobs. As people began to be laid off and returning soldiers found it hard to find work and affordable housing, many blamed African Americans for taking their jobs. Frustration and racism combined to produce violence.
In the summer of 1919, 25 race riots broke out across the nation. The riots began in July, when a mob of angry whites burned shops and homes in an African American neighborhood in Longview, Texas. A week later in Washington, D.C., gangs of African Americans and whites fought each other for four days before troops got the riots under control.
The worst violence occurred in Chicago. On a hot July day, African Americans went to a whites-only beach. Both sides began throwing stones, and an African American teenager drowned as a result. A full-scale riot then erupted. Angry African Americans attacked white neighborhoods while whites attacked African American neighborhoods. The riot lasted for almost two weeks until the government sent in the National Guard to impose order. By the time the rioting ended, 38 people had been killed—15 white and 23 African American—and more than 500 had been injured.

The race riots of 1919 disillusioned some African Americans who felt their wartime contributions had been for nothing. For others, however, the wartime struggle for democracy encouraged them to fight for their rights at home. For the first time, African Americans organized and fought back.

Determining Cause and Effect Why did the number of strikes increase after the war?
The Red Scare
go 5D8NG question Doyou agree or disagree with A. Mitchell Palmer's efforts to prevent a "radical" revolution in the United States?
Since the late 1800s, many Americans had accused immigrants of importing socialist and communist ideas and had blamed them for labor unrest and violence. Events in Russia seemed to justify fears of a Communist revolution. The strikes of 1919 fueled fears that Communists, or “reds,” might seize power, leading to a nationwide panic known as the Red Scare. Many people were particularly concerned about workers using strikes to start a revolution. The Palmer Raids
In April the postal service intercepted more than 30 parcels containing homemade bombs addressed to prominent Americans. The next month, a parade in Cleveland to protest the jailing of American Socialist Party leader Eugene Debs turned into a series of riots. Two people were killed and another 40 were injured. In June eight bombs in eight cities exploded within minutes of one another, suggesting a nationwide conspiracy.
One of these bombs damaged the home of United States attorney general A. Mitchell Palmer. Palmer took action, establishing a special division within the Justice Department, the General Intelligence Division, which eventually became the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Although evidence pointed to no single group, Palmer’s agents targeted the foreign-born. On November 7, 1919, Palmer ordered a series of raids on offices of the Union of Russian Workers in 12 cities. Less than seven weeks later, a transport ship left New York for Russia carrying 249 immigrants who had been deported, or expelled from the country.
In January 1920, Palmer ordered another series of raids on the headquarters of various radical organizations. Nearly 6,000 people were arrested. Palmer’s raids continued until the spring of 1920, and authorities detained thousands of suspects. Palmers agents often ignored the civil liberties of suspects. Officers entered homes and offices without search warrants. Some suspects were jailed indefinitely and were not allowed to talk to their attorneys. Many of the nearly 600 immigrants who were deported never had a court hearing. Palmer defended his actions:
authorities those who have control over determining and enforcing what is right or wrong

«Like a prairie-fire, the blaze of revolution was sweeping over every American institution of law and order a year ago. It was eating its way into the homes of the American workmen... leaping into the belfry ofthe school bell, crawling into the sacred corners of American homes... burning up the foundations of society.w
—from "The Case Against the 'Reds',"Forum, 1920
For a while, Palmer was regarded as a national hero. But his raids failed to turn up any hard evidence of revolutionary conspiracy. The Red Scare, however, greatly influenced people’s attitudes during the 1920s. The New York state legislature expelled five members of the Socialist Party in January 1920, and within a few months, nearly 30 states passed sedition laws making it illegal to join groups advocating revolution. Many linked radicalism with immigrants, which led to calls to limit immigration.
The Election of 1920
Economic problems, labor unrest, racial tensions, and the fresh memories of World War I created a general sense of disillusionment in the United States. During the 1920 campaign, Ohio governor James M. Cox and his running mate, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, ran on a platform of progressive ideals. President Wilson tried to convince the Democrats to make the campaign a referendum on the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations. The Republican candidate, Warren G. Harding, called for a return to “normalcy,” arguing that the country needed to return to the days before the Progressive Era reforms. Harding won the election by a landslide. Many Americans hoped to put racial, labor, and economic troubles behind them and build a more prosperous and stable society.

After the suffering of World War /, Americans were ready to enjoy life and eager to buy new goods that had not been available during the war. The new technology of the assembly line made the automobile much more affordable and spurred economic growth. The growing African American population in the North sparked new trends in literature, music, and art, and made African Americans a powerful political voice. Yet some people believed traditional society and morality were under attack, causing nativism and racism to increase in the 1920s.

Born in 1865 in Corsica, Ohio, Warren G. Harding began his career in Ohio state politics. In 1898 voters elected Harding to the Ohio General Assembly, where he fit in comfortably with the powerful Ohio Republican political machine. In 1903 he was elected lieutenant governor. He became a U.S. senator in 1914. After serving one term, Harding ran for and won the presidency in 1920.
In his campaign, Harding promised “a return to normalcy” following the war. For Harding and his administration, a “return to normalcy” meant an end to progressive experimentation, an end to high taxes on the wealthy, and an end to government intervention in the economy. In particular, it meant an end to the economic controls imposed during World War I. The Harding administration committed itself to restoring economic growth and prosperity by getting the government out of the economy. His genial manner endeared him to the nation. People applauded the easygoing atmosphere of the Harding administration replacing the reform and war fervor of President Wilson’s last years.
Teapot Dome and Other Scandals
Harding made several notable appointments to the cabinet. These included former Supreme Court justice Charles Evans Hughes as secretary of state, former Food Administrator Herbert Hoover
260
as secretary of commerce, and business tycoon Andrew Mellon as secretary ofthe treasury. Many of his other appointments, however, were disastrous. He gave cabinet posts and other high-level jobs to friends and political allies from Ohio. Harding felt comfortable among his old friends, known as the Ohio Gang. Alice Roosevelt Longworth, daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt, described a typical evening in Harding’s White House study:
PRIMARYSOURCE
((The air [would be] heavy with tobacco smoke, trays with bottles containing every imaginable brand of whiskey.. .cards and poker chips at hand—a general atmosphere of waistcoat unbuttoned, feet on desk, and spittoons alongside.»
—from Crowded Hours, 1933
Several of these men used their influential posts for their own gain. Colonel Charles R. Forbes, an Ohio acquaintance of Harding’s, sold scarce medical supplies from veterans’ hospitals and kept the money for himself.
He cost the public about $250 million.
In June 1923, while traveling from Alaska to California, Harding became ill with what was probably a heart attack. He died in San Francisco on August 2, shortly before the news of the Forbes scandal broke. Early the next morning, the vice president, Calvin Coolidge, took the oath of office and became president.
The most famous scandal, known as Teapot Dome, began in early 1922. Harding’s secretary of the interior, Albert B. Fall, secretly allowed private interests to lease lands containing U.S. Navy oil reserves at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, and Elk Hills, California. In return, Fall received bribes from these private interests totaling more than $300,000. After the Wall Street Journal broke the story, the Senate launched an investigation that took most of the 1920s to complete. In 1929 Secretary Fall became the first cabinet secretary to go to prison.
Attorney general Harry Daugherty was investigated for accepting bribes from a German agent seeking to buy a German-owned company that had been seized by the U.S. government during World War I. Daugherty

refused to open Justice Department files to a congressional committee. He also refused to testify under oath, claiming immunity, or freedom from prosecution, on the grounds that he had had confidential dealings with President Harding. Daugherty was later dismissed by President Coolidge.
Teapot Dome and the other scandals of the Harding administration increased Americans’ distrust of the federal government and political leaders. This distrust added to the growing frustration with progressive policies caused by World War I. Many progressive ideas depended on efficient honest government to be effective. If the government was corrupt, it helped make the case for reducing the role of government in the economy.
"Silent Cal"Takes Over
Calvin Coolidge was very different from Harding. A critic joked that Coolidge could be “silent in five languages.” Coolidge quickly distanced himself from the Harding administration. However, he asked the most capable cabinet members—Hughes, Mellon, and Hoover—to remain. Coolidge believed that prosperity rested on business leadership and that government should interfere with business and industry as little as possible.
In the year following Harding’s death and the revelations of the scandals, Coolidge avoided crises and adopted policies intended to keep the nation prosperous. He easily won the Republican nomination for president in 1924. The Republicans promised the American people that the policies that had brought prosperity would continue. Coolidge won the election easily.

Coolidge and Prosperity
After all, the chief business of the American people is business. They are profoundly concerned with producing, buying, selling, investing and prospering in the world....
In all experience, the accumulation of wealth means the multiplication of schools, the increase of knowledge, the dissemination of intelligence, the encouragement of science, the broadening of outlook, the expansion of liberties, the widening of culture.”

Policies of Prosperity
guidingquestion What government policies helped the economy recover from the postwar recession?
Andrew Mellon, a successful banker and industrialist, was secretary ofthe treasury under President Harding and the chief architect of economic policy. When Mellon took office, he had three major goals: to balance the budget, to reduce the governments debt, and to cut taxes. Mellon argued that if taxes were lower, businesses and some consumers would spend and invest their extra money. This would cause the economy to grow, and Americans would earn more money. The government then would collect more in taxes. This idea is known today as supply-side economics*
At Mellon’s urging, Congress dramatically reduced tax rates. By 1928, Congress had reduced the income tax rate most Americans paid to 0.5 percent, down from 4 percent. They cut the rate for the wealthiest Americans to 25 percent, down from 73 percent. The federal budget fell from $6.4 billion to less than $3 billion in seven years.
Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover also sought to promote economic growth. He tried to balance government regulation with his philosophy of cooperative individualism. This idea involved encouraging businesses to form trade associations that would voluntarily share information with the federal government. Hoover believed this system would reduce costs and promote economic efficiency.
H READING PROGRESS CHECK
Summarizing What strategies helped promote economic growth and recovery after World War I?
Trade and Arms Control
guiding question Doyou think it is possible to abolish war?
Before World War I, the United States was a debtor nation. By the end of the war, wartime allies owed the United States more than $10 billion in war debts. By the 1920s, the United States was the dominant economic power in the world. Under Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, the nation tried to use its economic power to promote peace and stability.
The Myth of Isolationism
Most Americans, tired of being entangled in the politics of Europe, favored isolationism. This is the idea that the United States will be safer and more prosperous if it stays out of world affairs. To many, it appeared that the United States had become isolationist. It had not ratified the Treaty of Versailles and had not joined the League of Nations. But in fact, the United States was too powerful and too interconnected with other countries economically to be truly isolationist. Instead of relying on armed force and the collective security ofthe League of Nations, the United States tried to promote peace by using economic policies and arms control agreements.
The Dawes Plan	1. K
Americas former allies, Britain and France, had difficulty making the payments on their immense war debts. Meanwhile, Germany was trying to make huge cash payments to these nations as punishment for starting t e war—payments that were crippling the German economy.

isolationism a national policy of avoiding involvement in world affairs
TheJazzAge 263
To address this problem, in 1924 American diplomat Charles G. Dawes negotiated an agreement with France, Britain, and Germany. American banks would make loans to Germany to help it to make reparations payments. In exchange, Britain and France would accept less in reparations and pay back more on their war debts to the United States.
U.S. secretary of state Frank Kellogg is remembered today for promoting the Kellogg-Briand Pact, a treaty to outlaw war.
CRITICAL THINKING
Predicting Consequences What might happen today if the United States and other nations followed the key idea ofthe Kellogg-Briand Pact? The Washington Conference
Despite their debts, the major powers were involved in a costly postwar naval arms race. In 1921 the United States invited representatives from eight major countries—Britain, France, Italy, China, Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal—to Washington, D.C., to discuss disarmament. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes proposed a 10-year halt on the construction of new warships. The result was the Five-Power Naval Limitation Treaty between Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States. But the conference also angered the Japanese because their navy was required to be smaller than those of the United States and Britain.
The Kellogg-Briand Pact
The Washington Conference inspired U.S. secretary of state Frank Kellogg and French foreign minister Aristide Briand to propose a treaty to outlaw war altogether. On August 27, 1928, the United States and 14 other nations signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact. All signing nations agreed to abandon war and to settle all disputes by peaceful means.
The London Naval Treaties
From January to April 1930, five nations met in London to extend the Washington Conference. The United States, Britain, France, Italy, and Japan agreed on ratios for war ships, halting the arms race through 1936. In 1934 Japan announced it would not extend the treaty past 1936, so the five nations met again in December 1935. The United States, Britain, and France again signed the treaty. Japan and Italy declined to sign the treaty.

The Rise of New Industries
guiding question How did new industries change the lives ofAmericans in the 1920s?
By the 1920s, the automobile had become part of American life.
A 1925 survey conducted in Muncie, Indiana, found that 21 out of 26 families who owned cars did not have bathtubs with running water. As one farm wife explained, “You cant ride to town in a bathtub.”
Increased automobile ownership was just one example of Americans’ rising standard of living. Real per capita earnings soared 22 percent between 1923 and 1929 even as work hours decreased. In 1923 U.S. Steel cut its daily work shift from 12 hours to 8 hours. In 1926 Henry Ford cut the workweek for his employees from six days to five, and farm machinery company International Harvester instituted an annual two-week paid vacation for employees. Mass production, or large-scale manufacturing done with machinery, made these changes possible by increasing supply and reducing costs. Workers made more and the goods they bought cost less.
Ford, the Assembly Line, and the Model T
The moving assembly line divided operations into simple tasks and cut unnecessary motion to a minimum. In 1913 automaker Henry Ford installed the first moving assembly line at a plant in Highland Park, Michigan. By the following year, workers were building an automobile every 93 minutes. By 1925, a Ford car was rolling off the line every 10 seconds.
Ford’s assembly line product, the Model T, demonstrated the economic concept of elasticity, or how sensitive product demand is to price. In 1908, the Model T’s first year, the car sold for $850. In 1914 mass production reduced the price to $490. Ford also increased his

workers’ wages in 1914 to $5 a day-doubling their pay-and reduced the workday to eight-hour shifts. He took these dramatic steps to win workers' loyalty and to undercut union organizers. By 1924, Model Ts were selling for $295, and Ford sold millions of them.

Ford’s mass-production methods opened the door for new companies to manufacture cars. By the mid-1920s, General Motors and Chrysler competed successfully with Ford. The auto industry also spurred growth in the production of steel, petroleum, rubber, plate glass, nickel, and lead.
Cars revolutionized American life. They eased the isolation of rural families and let more people live farther from work. A new kind of worker, the auto commuter, appeared. Other forms of urban transportation, such as the trolley, became less popular.

In response to rising disposable income, many other new goods came on the market. Americans bought such innovations as electric razors, facial tissues, frozen foods, and home hair color. Mouthwash, deodorants, cosmetics, and perfumes became popular products.

Birth ofthe Airline Industry
After the Wright brothers’ first successful flight in 1903, the aviation industry began developing. Leading the way was American inventor Glenn Curtiss, who invented ailerons—surfaces attached to wings that could be tilted to steer the plane. Ailerons made it possible to build rigid wings and much larger aircraft. The federal government began to support the airline industry. In 191f the postmaster general introduced the world’s first airmail service.
In 1925 Congress passed the Kelly Act, authorizing postal officials to hire private airplane operators to carry mail. The Air Commerce Act of 1926 provided federal aid to build airports. The transatlantic solo flight of former airmail pilot Charles Lindbergh in 1927 banished doubt about the potential of aircraft. By 1928, 48 airlines were serving 355 American cities.
The Radio Industry
In 1913 American engineer Edwin Armstrong invented a special circuit that made it practical to transmit sound via long-range radio. The radio industry began a few years later. In November 1920, the Westinghouse Company broadcast the news of Harding’s landslide election victory from station KDKA in Pittsburgh—one of the first public broadcasts in history. That success persuaded Westinghouse to open other stations.
In 1926 the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) set up a network of stations to broadcast daily radio programs. By 1927, almost 700 stations

Sales of radio equipment grew from $10.6 million in 1921 to $411 million in 1929, by which time more than 12 million radios were in use across the country.
In 1928 the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) assembled a coast-to-coast network of stations to rival NBC. The two networks sold advertising time and hired musicians, actors, and comedians from vaudeville, movies, and the nightclub circuit to appear on their shows. Americans experienced the first presidential election campaign to use radio in 1928, when the radio networks sold more than $1 million in advertising time to the Republican and Democratic Parties.

The Consumer Society
guiding question How did attitudes toward credit and consumerism change in the 1920s?
Higher wages and shorter workdays resulted in a decade-long buying spree that kept the economy booming. Shifting from traditional attitudes of thrift and prudence, Americans in the 1920s enthusiastically accepted their new role as consumers.
Easy Consumer Credit
One notable aspect ofthe economic boom was the growth of individual borrowing. Credit had been available before the 1920s, but most Americans had considered debt shameful. Now attitudes toward debt started changing, as people began believing in their ability to pay their debts over time. Many listened to the sales pitch “Buy now and pay in easy installments,” and began to accumulate debt. Americans bought 75 percent of their radios and 60 percent of their automobiles on the installment plan. Some started buying on credit at a rate exceeding their income.

something no one knew they needed. To attract consumers, manufacturers turned to advertising, another booming industry in the 1920s.
Advertisers linked products with qualities associated with the modern era, such as progress, convenience, leisure, success, and style. Advertisers also preyed on consumers’ fears and anxieties, such as insecurities about ones status or weight. For example, a 1923 advertisement for face cream read: “These premature lines are only the troubles of a skin allowed to be too dry.... The society woman keeps her skin smooth and fresh season in and season out.”
The Managerial Revolution
By the early 1920s, many industries had already created modern organizational structures. Companies were split into divisions with functions such as sales, marketing, and accounting. Managers were hired to run these divisions, freeing executives and owners from the day-to-day running ofthe companies. The large numbers of new managers helped expand the middle class, adding to the nation’s prosperity. These new
developments in business organization generated more business profit, which improved the nation’s standard of living.

In addition to these innovations in management, companies in the 1920s began conducting time and motion studies, applying the ideas in Frederick Tayler’s Principles of Scientific Management. They systematically broke down manufacturing work into small discrete tasks and then analyzed how best to use workers to do each task as efficiently as possible.
Henry Ford’s assembly line was an example of this approach. Time-study analysis made workers more productive, but in some ways it made work more difficult. Instead of a variety of changing tasks, workers on an assembly line had to do the same repetitive task over and over again.

Uneven Prosperity
Not all Americans shared in the economic boom. For example, thousands ol African Americans who held factory jobs during World War I were replaced by returning servicemen. Native Americans, though granted citizenship in 1924, were often isolated on reservations where there was little productive work. Also, many immigrants had difficulty finding work. Most were farmers and factory workers with pitifully low wages. Many people in the Deep South were also left out of the economic boom as the traditional agricultural economic base there eroded after the war.

The Farm Crisis
guiding question Why did farmers miss out on the prosperity of the 1920s?
American farmers did not share in the prosperity ofthe 1920s. On average they earned less than one-third of the income of other American workers. Technological advances in fertilizers, seed varieties, and farm machinery allowed them to produce more, but higher yields without an increase in demand meant that they received lower prices. Between 1920 and 1921,

Although many people benefited from the economic boom of the 1920s, several groups did not share in the general prosperity. For many African Americans, such as this family in rural Georgia, the 1920s were a time of poverty.

Comparing and Contrasting In the 1920s, how was the life of a factory worker who lived in a big city different from the life of a farmer living in a rural area?
corn and wheat prices declined considerably. Costs for improved farming technology, meanwhile, continued to increase.
Many factors contributed to this “quiet depression” in American agriculture. During the war, the government had urged farmers to produce more to meet the great need for food in Europe. Many farmers borrowed heavily to buy new land and new machinery to raise more crops. Sales were strong, prices were high, and farmers prospered. After the war, however, European farm output rose, and the debt-ridden countries of Europe had little money to spend on American farm products. In addition, Congress passed the Fordney-McCumber Act in 1922, making matters worse by raising tariffs dramatically. This dampened the American market for foreign goods and sparked a reaction in foreign markets against buying American agricultural products.
Congress tried to pass legislation to help farmers sell their surpluses, but President Coolidge vetoed the bills. He argued that with money flowing to farmers under the proposed law, they would be encouraged to produce even greater surpluses. Agriculture remained in recession throughout the 1920s.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
The 1920s are often called the Roaring Twenties because to many the decade seemed to be one long party. Many urban Americans celebrated the new "modern" culture. However, many rural Americans believed traditional society was under attack. Nativism and racism increased, women sought to break free of traditional roles, and supporters of the new morality clashed with those who supported more traditional values.
Nativism and Immigration Policies
,	Why did nativism strengthen during the 1920s, and how did the
government deal with the tensions?
The 1920s was a time of economic growth, but it was also a time of turmoil. An economic recession, an influx of immigrants, and cultural tensions combined to create an atmosphere of disillusionment and intolerance. The fear and prejudice many felt toward Germans and Communists during and after World War I expanded to include all immigrants. This triggered a general rise in racism and nativism—a belief that one’s native land needs to be protected against immigrants.
During World War I, immigration to the United States had dropped sharply. By 1921, however, it had returned to prewar levels, with the majority of immigrants coming from southern and eastern Europe. Many Americans blamed the bombings, strikes, and recession of the postwar years on immigrants. Many believed immigrants were taking jobs that would otherwise have gone to soldiers returning home from the war.
The Sacco-Vanzetti Case
The Sacco-Vanzetti case reflected the prejudices and fears ofthe era. On April 15, 1920, two men robbed and murdered two employees of a shoe factory in Massachusetts. Police subsequently arrested two Italian immigrants, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, for the crime.

The case created a furor when newspapers revealed that the two men were anarchists, or people who oppose all forms of government. They also reported that Sacco owned a gun similar to the murder weapon and that the bullets used in the murders matched those in Saccos gun. The evidence was questionable, but the fact that the accused men were anarchists and foreigners led many people to assume they were guilty, including the jury. On July 14, 1921, Sacco and Vanzetti were found guilty and sentenced to death. After six years of appeals, Sacco and Vanzetti were executed on August 23, 1927.

Return ofthe Ku Klux Kian
The group that most wanted to restrict immigration was the Ku Klux Kian, or KKK. The old KKK began in the South after the Civil War and used threats and violence to intimidate newly freed African Americans. The new Kian also targeted Catholics, Jews, immigrants, and other groups said to be “un-American.” William J. Simmons founded the new Ku Klux Kian in 1915, with a pledge to preserve America’s white, Protestant civilization. With the help of professional promoters to sell Kian memberships, more and more people joined. By 1924, membership was close to 4 million as it spread beyond the South into the North and West.
Kian membership began to decline in the late 1920s, mainly due to scandals and power struggles among its leaders. In addition, new restrictions on immigration deprived the Kian of one of its major issues. National Origins Act
American immigration policies became more restrictive in response to nativist groups like the KKK. Even some business leaders, who had favored immigration as a source of cheap labor, now saw the new immigrants as radicals. In 1921 President Harding signed the Emergency Quota Act, which restricted annual admission to the United States by ethnic group. In 1924 the National Origins Act made immigration restriction a permanent policy. The law set quotas at 2 percent of each national group represented in

Increasing Mexican Immigration
Employers still needed immigrants, a source of cheap labor, for agriculture, mining, and railroad work. Mexican immigrants could fill this need because the National Origins Act exempted natives of the Western Hemisphere from the quotas. Large numbers of Mexican immigrants had already begun moving to the United States due to the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902. The act funded irrigation projects in the Southwest and led to the creation of large farms that needed thousands of workers. By the end of the 1920s, nearly 700,000 Mexicans had migrated to the United States.
QREADING PROGRESS CHECK
Contrasting How did the National Origins Act help deal with the tensions created by nativism?
A
Clash of Cultures guiding question Why doyou think some Americans feared the "new morality"?
Groups that wanted to restrict immigration also wanted to preserve what they considered to be traditional values. They feared that a “new morality” was taking over. This trend glorified youth and personal freedom and brought big changes—particularly to the status of women.
Changes for Women
Having won the right to vote in 1920, many women sought to break free from traditional roles. Women who attended college often found support to pursue careers. Many working-class women took jobs because they needed the wages, but work was also a way to break away from parental authority and establish financial independence. Romance, pleasure, and friendship
became linked to successful marriages. Sigmund Freud’s theories also affected peoples ideas about relationships, especially his theories about human sexuality. Womens fashions changed during the 1920s: women bobbed, or shortened, their hair and wore flesh-colored silk stockings.
Some women, known as flappers, smoked cigarettes, drank prohibited liquor, and wore makeup and sleeveless dresses with short skirts.
Many professional women made major contributions in science, medicine, law, and literature. In medicine, Florence Sabin’s research led to a dramatic drop in death rates from tuberculosis. Public-health nurse Margaret Sanger believed that families could improve their standard of living by limiting the number of children they had. She founded the American Birth Control League in 1921 to promote knowledge about birth control. During the 1920s and 1930s, the use of birth control increased dramatically, particularly in the middle class.
Religious Fundamentalism
While many Americans embraced the new morality of the 1920s, others feared that the country was losing its traditional values. They viewed the consumer culture, relaxed ethics, and changing roles of women as evidence of the nation’s moral decline. Many of these people, especially in rural towns, responded by joining a religious movement known as Fundamentalism, a name derived from a series of Christian religious pamphlets titled The Fundamentals, published by millionaire Lyman Stewart.
Fundamentalists believed that the Bible was literally true and without error. They defended the Protestant faith against ideas implying that human beings derived their moral behavior from society and nature, not God. In particular, they rejected Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, which said that human beings had developed from lower forms of life over the course of millions of years. Instead, they believed in creationism—the belief that God created the world as described in the Bible.
Two popular evangelical preachers, Billy Sunday and Aimee Semple McPherson, stirred supporters by preaching in very nontraditional ways. Sunday, a former professional baseball player, drew huge crowds with his rapid-fire sermons and on-stage showmanship. McPherson conducted her revivals and faith healings in Los Angeles in a flamboyant theatrical style, using stage sets and costumes that expressed the themes of her highly emotional sermons.
In 1925 Tennessee outlawed any teaching that denied “the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible,” or taught that man descended from a lower order of animals.” The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) advertised for a teacher willing to be arrested for teaching evolution. John T. Scopes, a biology teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, volunteered. At Scopes’s trial, William Jennings Bryan, a three-time presidential candidate, was the prosecutor representing the creationists. Clarence Darrow, one of the country’s most celebrated trial lawyers, defended Scopes. Scopes was found guilty and fined $100, although the conviction was later overturned on a technicality. The trial had been broadcast over the radio, and Darrow s blistering cross-examination of Bryan hurt the Fundamentalist cause.

TheJazzAge 273
Prohibition
The movement to ban alcohol sales grew stronger in the early 1900s. When the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect in January 1920, the Volstead Act gave the U.S. Treasury Department the power to enforce Prohibition, marking a dramatic increase in federal police powers.
In the 1920s, Treasury Department agents made more than 540,000 arrests, but Americans still ignored the law. People flocked to secret bars called speakeasies to purchase alcohol. Liquor also was readily available in rural areas through bootlegging—the illegal production and distribution of alcohol. Huge profits could be made smuggling liquor from Canada and the Caribbean. Organized crime became big business, and gangsters used their money to corrupt local politicians. Al Capone, one of the most successful and well-known gangsters of the era, had many police officers, judges, and other officials on his payroll.
The battle to repeal Prohibition began almost as soon as the Eighteenth Amendment was ratified. The Twenty-first Amendment, ratified in 1933,
Prohibition led to the creation of a special federal bureau charged with stopping the sale of illegal alcohol. In this photo, a federal agent cracks open barrels of illegal rum to prevent it from being sold.

How did many artists and writers of the time describe the 1920s?
During the 1920s, American artists and writers challenged traditional ideas as they searched for meaning in the modern world. Many artists, writers, and intellectuals flocked to Manhattan’s Greenwich Village and Chicago’s South Side. The artistic and unconventional, or bohemian, lifestyle of these places allowed artists, musicians, and writers greater freedom of expression.
Modern American Art
European art movements greatly influenced the modernists of American art. Perhaps most striking was the diverse range of artistic styles, each attempting to express the individual, modern experience. American painter John Marin drew on the urban dynamics of New York City for inspiration:
fiaasia
[T]he whole city is alive; buildings, people, all are alive; and the more they move me the more I feel them to be alive.
It is this'moving of me'that I try to express, so that I may recall the spell I have been under and behold the expression ofthe different emotions that have been called into being. ”

BIOGRAPHIES
Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961)
Ernest Hemingway was one of the most important American authors during the early 1920s. His writings focus on one theme—man's search for the meaning of life during a time filled with violence. Hemingway's writing style reflects his purpose. He writes in the simple and direct style that he learned while working as a journalist. His characters are often engaged in war or on a violent adventure like hunting or bullfighting. The main character almost always tries to face his challenges with a strong personal code of courage, professionalism, and skill. His first novel, The Sun Also Rises, was published in 1926. His two famous war novels, A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls, were very popular when they were published and are still considered great American novels. In the 1950s, Hemingway won the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature for The Old Man and the Sea.
Willa Cather (1873-1947)
Journalist, poet, and novelist, Willa Cather was among the most important writers of the first half of the twentieth century. Her work was known for its unconventional approach to structure, humanity, beauty, and drama. Having spent much of her childhood on the Nebraska frontier, she often explored the pioneer life in her writing. Her first book of poetry, April Twilights, was published in 1903, and a short story collection, The Troll Garden, followed in 1905. She then spent six years working for McClure's Magazine until a fellow writer at the magazine encouraged her to return to fiction. Cather immediately went to work on a string of successful books, including 0 Pioneers! (1913), My Antonia (1918), and One o/Ot/rs (1922), for which she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.

His paintings conveyed a modern sense of disenchantment and isolation in haunting scenes. Georgia O’Keeffe’s landscapes and flowers were admired in many museums throughout her long life and are still admired today.
Much of American modern art in the 1920s focused on trying to portray the inner moods and feelings of people. As a result, much of the art was surreal or expressionist. It did not depict the outer world in a realistic way because it sought to use color and shape and lines to portray the inner world of people’s emotions, moods, and relationship to the outer world. This was a positive contribution of the art, because its themes had been generally unexplored by American artists in the past. On the other hand, surrealism and expressionism were often difficult for the general public to appreciate, and could be discouraging in their depiction of society as fragmented and discordant, and individuals as isolated.
Poets and Writers
Writers of the 1920s varied greatly in their styles and subject matter. Illinois poet and writer Carl Sandburg used common speech to glorify the Midwest. So did the novels of Pulitzer Prize winner Willa Cather, such as The Song of the Lark. Sinclair Lewis poked fun at small-town life in Main Street. Edith Wharton criticized upper-class ignorance and pretensions in her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Age of Innocence. In Greenwich Village, another Pulitzer Prize winner, Edna St. Vincent Millay, wrote about women’s inner lives.
Several poets influenced poetic style and subject matter. Some—such as Amy Lowell, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams—used clear, concise images to express moments in time. Others, such as T. S. Eliot, criticized what they saw as a loss of spirituality in modern life.

Part of what made the 1920s feel new and modern was the rise of mass culture. Movies, which were very popular in the 1920s, brought Americans together in a shared experience.
Among playwrights, Eugene O’Neill was probably the most innovative. His plays, filled with bold artistry and modern themes, portrayed realistic characters and situations, offering a modern vision of life that often touched on the tragic. Long Day’s Journey Into Night is a memorable example.
Some American writers, disillusioned by World War I and the emerging consumer society, moved to Paris, a center of artistic activity. American experimental writer Gertrude Stein dubbed them a “Lost Generation.” Her Paris apartment became a home away from home for many writers.
Among them was Ernest Hemingway, who wrote moving novels about war and its aftermath, such as A Farewell to Arms.
Another visitor was F. Scott Fitzgerald. He criticized society’s superficiality in The Great Gatsby, in which colorful characters—some modeled after his wife Zelda, who was a dancer, painter, and novelist—chased futile dreams:
PRIMARY SOURCE
They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made. **
—from The Great Gatsby, 1925
The literature of the 1920s had potentially both positive and negative impacts on American readers. On the one hand, by criticizing class pretensions, consumerism, and the pursuit of material goods, the literature of the era encouraged people to think seriously about how modern life was changing things.
On the other hand, literature also challenged traditional values and beliefs that might have played an important role in sustaining society. Many artists and writers of the 1920s attempted to portray the sense that modern life was meaningless, that moral progress was impossible, and that people were losing their relationships and connections. By saying that life has no meaning and nothing was constant, this type of literature implied there was little purpose to life and therefore no reason to try to achieve anything.

to see such stars as Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and Rudolph Valentino. In 1927 the golden age of Hollywood began with the first “talking” picture, The Jazz Singer.
Films of the 1920s reflected the issues and characteristics of the erain many ways. Some told stories of World War I and its aftermath, and were often blunt about the cost and impact of the war on people’s lives. Many told stories of complicated relationships between men and women and reflected the new morality and changing nature of relationships of the 1920s. Many films focused on Christian themes, dramatizing stories from the Bible and the values and beliefs of Protestant Christianity.
Famous songwriter Irving Berlin worked in New York Citys Tin Pan Alley, where composers wrote popular music. Berlin’s famous songs include “Puttin’ on the Ritz” and “White Christmas.” Radio broadcasts offered everything from classical music to comedy. In the popular show Amos ‘ri Andy, the troubles of two African American characters (portrayed by white actors) captured the nation’s attention.
The mass media—radio, movies, newspapers, and magazines aimed at a broad audience—did more than just entertain. They also fostered a sense of shared experience that helped unify the nation.
Sports
Sports such as baseball and boxing reached new heights of popularity in the 1920s, thanks to motion pictures and radio. Baseball star Babe Ruth became a national hero, famous for hitting hundreds of home runs. Fans also idolized boxer Jack Dempsey, who was world heavyweight champion from 1919 until 1926, when he lost the title to Gene Tunney. When Dempsey attempted to win back the title in 1927, one store sold $90,000 worth of radios in the two weeks before the event.
Newspaper coverage helped build enthusiasm for college football. One of the most famous players of the 1920s was Red Grange of the University of Illinois. He was known as the “Galloping Ghost” because of his speed and ability to evade the opposing team. The triumphs of Bobby Jones, the best golfer of the decade, and tennis players Bill Tilden and Helen Wills also thrilled sports fans. When swimmer Gertrude Ederle shattered records by swimming the English Channel in a little over 14 hours in 1927, Americans were enchanted.

I
During World War I and the 1920s, hundreds of thousands of African Americans joined the Great Migration from the rural South to
; industrial cities in the North. Populations swelled in large Northern cities. Nightclubs and music filled these cities, particularly the New

American arts. This became known as the Harlem Renaissance.
The Writers
Claude McKay was the first important writer of the Harlem Renaissance. In his 1922 poetry collection, Harlem Shadows, McKay expressed a proud defiance and bitter contempt of racism. These were two major characteristics of Harlem Renaissance writing.

blues style of music evolving from African American spirituals and noted for its melancholy sound
Langston Hughes was a prolific, original, and versatile writer. He became a leading voice ofthe African American experience in America. Zora Neale Hurston wrote some of the first major stories featuring African American women as central characters. Other notable writers ofthe Harlem Renaissance include Countee Cullen, Alain Locke, and Dorothy West.
The literature of the Harlem Renaissance helped to instill a strong sense of pride, defiance, and confidence in African Americans. It encouraged resistance to racism and challenged stereotypes, and it also reminded African Americans of their roots and the difficulties they had already overcome. It helped lay the foundations for the civil rights movement that would begin after World War II.
If there was any negative impact of Harlem Renaissance literature, it lay within its own success. In helping instill pride and confidence, it also helped create a distinct and separate African American culture apart from the wider culture of the nation. This, in turn, contributed to the rise of movements advocating African Americans separate themselves from the rest of society in order to protect themselves, and preserve their own identity.
Jazz, Blues, and the Theater
New Orleans native Louis Armstrong moved to Chicago in 1922. There he introduced an early form of jazz, a musical style influenced by Dixieland and ragtime, with syncopated rhythms and improvisational elements. In Chicago, Armstrong broke away from the New Orleans tradition of group playing by performing highly imaginative solos on the cornet and trumpet.
Composer, pianist, and bandleader Edward “Duke” Ellington also had a special sound, a blend of improvisation and orchestration using different combinations of instruments. Like many other African American entertainers, Ellington got his start at the Cotton Club, the most famous nightclub in Harlem (but one that served only white customers). Years later, Ellington reflected on the music of the era by saying, “Everything, and I repeat, everything had to swing. And that was just it, those cats really had it; they had that soul. And you know you can’t just play some of this music without soul. Soul is very important.”
Bessie Smith seemed to symbolize soul. She became known as the Empress of the Blues. Smith sang of unfulfilled love, poverty, and oppression—the classic themes of the blues, a soulful style of music that evolved from African American spirituals.
Jazz reflected the characteristics and issues of the 1920s era in many ways. With its emphasis on improvisation, it reflected the feelings of many people that the 1920s was a time of experimentation and a breaking away from old rules and values. It expressed the individualism ofthe era, and because many of the popular jazz singers were women, it also reflected the new role of women in American society. Blues and soul music also enabled African Americans to give voice to their difficult social and economic position in American society.
Jazz had an enormously positive impact on society. It built a connection between African American culture and the rest of American society, helping to reduce racism by the shared experience of the music. Not everyone, however, appreciated the music at the time. During Prohibition, jazz music became associated with the speakeasies where alcohol was consumed illegally. As a result many people believed the music contributed to immoral behavior and threatened traditional values.
American jazz music was also one of the first American cultural expressions that had a significant impact on the rest ofthe world. In part
280
because of Americas role in ending World War I, many Europeans, especially in France, became fascinated with American culture. Many American jazz musicians visited Europe after World War I, and their performances helped develop a European audience for the music. Paris, in particular, became a center for jazz in Europe, just as it became home to many American expatriate writers in the years after the war.
Theater also flourished during the Harlem Renaissance. Shuffle Along, the first musical written, produced, and performed by African Americans, made its Broadway debut in 1921. The show’s success helped launch a number of careers, including those of Florence Mills and Paul Robeson. Robeson received wide acclaim for his performance in the title role of Eugene O Neills Emperor Jones. He also gained fame four years later for his work in the musical Show Boat. Robeson often appeared at the famous Apollo Theater in Harlem.

African Americans and 1920s Politics
guiding question How did African American leaders differ in their approaches to political actions during this decade?
In 1919 approximately 1,300 African American veterans of World War I marched through Manhattan to Harlem. W.E.B. Du Bois captured their sense of pride and defiance in a speech:
PRIMARY SOURCE
MWe return. We return from fighting. We return fighting. Make way for Democracy! We saved it in France,
and by the Great Jehovah, we will save it in the United States of America, or know the reason why.
—from The Crisis, May 1919
Zora Neale Hurston was one of the major literary voices of the Harlem Renaissance. Hurston presented a unique, insightful, and often quite humorous perspective of the African American experience through her work. She was also an accomplished traveler, anthropologist, and an instructor at North Carolina College for Negroes. She had great success with her novels, such as Jonah's Gourd Vine (1934), the perennial classic, Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), and Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939). In 1942 she published her autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road, to great acclaim.
Along with the Apollo Theater, the Cotton Club was one of the famous clubs in Harlem. Many performers launched careers by appearing on its stage.

Growing Political Power in the North
World War I set the stage for African Americans to reenter American politics. The Great Migration of African Americans to the North had a significant impact as well. As their numbers grew in city neighborhoods, African Americans became an influential voting bloc. In 1928 African American voters in Chicago helped elect Oscar DePriest. He was the first African American representative in Congress from a Northern state.
The NAACP Battles Injustice
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) battled hard against segregation and discrimination against African Americans. Its efforts focused primarily on lobbying public officials and working through the court system. The NAACP’s persistent protests against the horrors of lynching led to the passage of antilynching legislation in the House of Representatives in 1922. The Senate defeated the bill, but the NAACP s ongoing protests kept the issue in the news. This probably helped reduce the number of lynchings that took place.
In 1930 the NAACP joined with labor unions to launch a highly organized national campaign against the nomination of Judge John J. Parker to the U.S. Supreme Court. The North Carolina judge allegedly was racist and antilabor. By a narrow margin, the Senate refused to confirm Parkers nomination. This proved that African Americans had become a powerful political force.
282
Black Nationalism and Marcus Garvey
While the NAACP fought for integration and improvement in the economic and political position of African Americans, other groups began to emphasize black nationalism and black pride. Some began calling for African Americans to separate from white society.
A dynamic leader from Jamaica, Marcus Garvey captured the imagination of millions of African Americans with his Negro Nationalism. Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), aimed at promoting black pride and unity. He was inspired by Booker T. Washingtons call for self-reliance. The central message of Garvey’s Harlem-based movement was that African Americans could gain economic and political power by educating themselves.
Garvey also advocated separation and independence from whites. In 1920 he told his followers they would never find justice or freedom in America. He proposed leading them to Africa.
The emerging African American middle class and intellectuals distanced themselves from Garvey and his push for racial separation. The FBI saw UNIA as a dangerous catalyst for African American uprisings. Garvey also alienated key figures in the Harlem Renaissance by calling them “weak-kneed and cringing . . . [flatterers of] the white man.” Convicted of mail fraud in 1923, he served time in prison. In 1927 President Coolidge used Garvey’s immigrant status to have him deported to Jamaica.
Despite Garvey’s failure to keep his movement alive, he instilled millions of African Americans with a sense of pride in their heritage and inspired hope for the future. These feelings reemerged strongly in the 1950s and played a vital role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

Hoover's Response to the Depression
The Story Matters...
During the prosperous 1920s, optimism drove stock prices to new highs, but risky investment practices set the stage for a crash. Sensing danger, investors sold their holdings, causing the market to lose billions of dollars and the nation's banks to collapse.
Companies went out of business, millions of Americans were unemployed, and families could not buy food. When a terrible drought struck the Great Plains, farmers were unable to grow crops, leading to even more devastation.
◄ A destitute mother and other workers'families were stranded after the pea crop they were to harvest failed. The government sent 20,000 pounds of food to help the stranded workers at the farm in California.

Place andTime: United States 1928-1933
When the stock market crashed in October 1929, the extreme optimism ofthe 1920s turned to the profound despair of the Great Depression, By the early 1930s, more Americans were demanding the government's help. Veterans grew frustrated and began to march to Capitol Hill to demand the immediate payment of a promised bonus. Wearing ragged military uniforms and singing old war songs, this "Bonus Army" traveled the highways and railroads to Washington, D.C., to protest their plight. By July 1932, more than 15,000 unemployed veterans, each asking the government for early payment of cash bonuses due to be paid in 1945, converged on the nation's capital.

The economic collapse that began in 1929 seemed unimaginable months before. In the 1928 election, both presidential candidates painted a rosy picture of the future. Republican presidential nominee Herbert Hoover declared, “We are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land.”

The Election of 1928
For the presidential election of 1928, the Democrats chose Alfred E. Smith, governor of New York. Smith was the first Roman Catholic to win a major party’s presidential nomination. He faced a tough challenger, as Herbert Hoover was secretary of commerce and former head of the Food Administration.
Smith’s religious beliefs became a campaign issue. Some Protestants claimed the Catholic Church financed Smith’s campaign and would have inappropriate influence on American politics. The attacks embarrassed Hoover, a Quaker, and he tried to quash them, but the charges damaged Smith’s candidacy.
The prosperity of the 1920s—for which the Republicans took full credit—was a bigger challenge to Smith’s candidacy. Hoover won in a landslide. On March 4, 1929, an estimated 50,000 onlookers stood in the rain to listen to Hoover’s Inaugural Address. “I have no fears for the future of our country,” proclaimed Hoover. “It is bright with hope.” The Stock Market Soars
The optimism that swept Hoover into office also drove stock prices to new highs. Sometimes the stock market has a long period of
290
rising stock prices, or a bull market. The bull market of the 1920s convinced many to invest in stocks. By 1929, approximately 10 percent of American households owned stocks.
Before the late 1920s, stock prices generally reflected their true values. In the late 1920s, however, many investors failed to consider a company’s earnings and profits. Buyers engaged in speculation, or betting the market would continue to climb, thus enabling them to sell stock and make money quickly.
Many investors bought stocks on margin, making only a small cash down payment (as low as 10 percent of the price). With $1,000, an investor could buy a sum of $10,000 worth of stock. The remaining $9,000 came as an interest-bearing loan from the stockbroker. Quick profits were possible if stock prices kept rising, but problems came when prices began to fall. To protect a loan, a broker could issue a margin call, demanding the investor repay the loan at once.

Summarizing What investment decisions destabilized the economy during the 1920s?
The Great Crash
-a,	.	How did the stock market crash trigger a chain of events that led to the Depression?
The bull market lasted only as long as investors continued putting new money into it. In September 1929, the market peaked. Prices then began an uneven downward slide. As investors decided the boom was over, they sold more stock, causing prices to decline even further.
The Stock Market Crash
On Monday, October 21, 1929, the comedian Groucho Marx was awakened by a telephone call from his broker. “You’d better get down here with some cash to cover your margin,” the broker said. The stock market had plunged. The dazed comedian had to pay back the money he had borrowed to buy stocks, which were now selling for far less than he had paid for them. Other brokers made similar margin calls. Customers put stocks up for sale at a frenzied pace, driving the market into a tailspin.
On October 24, a day that came to be called Black Thursday, the market plummeted further. Marx was wiped out. His earnings from plays and films

Identifying Central Ideas What investment practices most destabilized the stock market?
The following week, on October 29, a day that was later dubbed Black Tuesday, prices took the steepest dive yet. That day, more than 16 million shares of stock were sold, and the value of the industrial index (a measure ofthe value of leading industrial companies) dropped by 10 percent. By mid-November, the market price of stocks had dropped by more than one-third Some $30 billion was lost, a sum roughly equal to the total wages Americans earned in 1929. Although the stock market crash was not the major cause of the Depression, it undermined the economy’s ability to overcome other weaknesses.
bank run persistent and heavy demands by a bank's depositors, creditors, or customers to withdraw money
Banks Begin to Close
The market crash weakened the nation’s banks in two ways. First, by 1929, banks had lent billions to stock speculators. Second, many banks had invested depositors’ money in the stock market, hoping for high returns. When stock values collapsed, banks lost money on their investments, and speculators defaulted on their loans. Having suffered serious losses, many banks cut back drastically on loans. With less credit available, consumers and businesses were not able to borrow as much money, sending the economy into a recession.
Some banks could not absorb the losses they suffered and had to close. The government did not insure bank deposits, so if a bank failed, customer! including even those who did not invest in the stock market, lost their savings. As a growing number of banks closed in 1929 and 1930, a severe crisis of confidence in the banking system further destabilized the economy
News of bank failures worried Americans. Some depositors made runs on banks, thus causing the banks to fail. A bank run takes place when man; depositors decide to withdraw their money at the same time, usually out of fear that the bank will collapse. Most banks make a profit by lending money received from depositors and collecting interest on the loans. The bank keeps only a fraction of depositors’ money in reserve. Usually, that reserve is enough to meet the bank’s needs. If too many people withdraw their money, however, the bank will collapse. By 1932, about one in four banks in the United States had gone out of business.

The Roots of the Great Depression
-SUSDSNG question What were the underlying conditions that led to the collapse of the US. economy?
The stock market crash played a major role in putting the economy into a recession. Yet the crash would not have led to a long-lasting depression if other forces had not been at work. The roots of the Great Depression were deeply entangled in the economy of the 1920s.
The Uneven Distribution of Income
Overproduction was a factor leading to the onset of the Great Depression. More efficient machinery increased the production capacity of factories and farms. Most Americans did not earn enough to buy up the goods they helped produce. Manufacturing output per person-hour rose 32 percent, but the average worker’s wage increased only 8 percent. In 1929 the top 5 percent of all American households earned 30 percent of the nation’s income. In contrast, about two-thirds of families earned less than $2,500 a year, leaving them with little disposable income.
Farmers, in particular, did not share in the prosperity of the 1920s, as many had gone into debt to buy land or equipment during World War I, when demand for their products was high. When prices fell, they tried to produce even more to pay their debts, taxes, and living expenses. Prices dropped so low that many farmers went bankrupt and lost their farms.
During the 1920s, many Americans had purchased high-cost items, such as refrigerators and cars, on the installment plan. Purchasers could make small down payments and pay the remainder of the item’s price in monthly installments. Paying off such debts eventually forced some buyers to stop making new purchases. Because of the decrease in demand for their products, manufacturers in turn cut production and laid off employees.
The slowdown in retail sales reverberated throughout the economy. When radio sales slumped, for example, orders for copper wire, wood cabinets, and glass radio tubes slowed. Montana copper miners, Minnesota lumberjacks, and Ohio glassworkers lost jobs. Jobless workers cut purchases, further reducing sales. This put even more Americans out of work.

Hoover Rejects Government Intervention
f^You cannot extend the mastery of the government over the daily working life of a people without at the same time making it the master of the peoples souls and thoughts.... Free speech does not live many hours after free industry and free commerce die.... Every step of bureaucratizing of the business of our country poisons the very roots of liberalism—that is, political equality, free speech, free assembly, free press, and equality of opportunity. It is the road not to more liberty, but to less liberty.
—Herbert Hoover, from a speech delivered October 22,1928
DBQ
ANALYZING PRIMARY
SOURCES
Why did Hoover refuse to support government intervention in the economy? Unemployment insurance was nonexistent. Many families had little or no savings. Lost jobs often meant dire circumstances. In 1930 alone, about 26,000 businesses failed.
The Loss of Export Sales
Many jobs might have been saved if American manufacturers had sold more goods abroad. As the bull market of the 1920s sped up, however,
U.S. banks made loans to speculators rather than loans to foreign companies. Loans from U.S. banks had helped European nations make war reparations and pay down war debts. They had also secured foreign markets for U.S. exports. Without these loans from U.S. banks, foreign companies purchased fewer American products.
In 1929 Hoover wanted to encourage overseas trade by lowering tariffs. Congress, however, decided to protect American industry from foreign competition by raising tariffs. The resulting legislation, the Hawley-Smoot Tariff, raised the average tariff rate to the highest level in American history. In the end, it failed to help American businesses, because foreign countries responded by raising their own tariffs. This meant fewer American products were sold overseas. By 1932, exports had fallen to less than half the level that they had been in 1929. A decrease in exports hurt both American companies and farmers.
Mistakes by the Federal Reserve
Just as consumers were able to buy more goods on credit, access to easy money propelled the stock market. Instead of raising interest rates to curb excessive speculation, the Federal Reserve Board kept its rates low throughout the 1920s.
The Board’s failure to raise interest rates significantly helped cause the Depression in two ways. First, by keeping rates low, the Board encouraged member banks to make risky loans. Second, the low interest rates led business leaders to think that the economy was still expanding. As a result, they borrowed more money to expand production. This was a serious mistake because it led to overproduction when sales were falling. When the Depression finally hit, companies had to lay off workers to cut costs. Then the Federal Reserve made another mistake: it raised interest rates, thus tightening credit. The economy continued to spiral downward.

The Depression Worsens
:	question Howdid economic changes affect everyday life during the 1930s?
The Depression grew steadily worse during President Hoover’s administration. In 1930, across the nation, 1,352 banks suspended operations, more than twice the number of bank failures in 1929. In 1932 alone, some 30,000 companies went out of business. By 1933, roughly one-fourth of the workforce was unemployed.
Struggling to Get By
The jobless often went hungry. When possible, they stood in breadlines for free food or lined up outside soup kitchens set up by private groups. People who could not pay their rent or mortgage lost their homes. Some, paralyzed by fear and humiliation, did not move and were evicted. Court officers called bailiffs ejected them and their belongings. Throughout the country, newly homeless people put up shacks on unused or public lands. They built shantytowns, which they called Hoovervilles after the president they blamed for their plight.
In search of work or a better life, many homeless, unemployed Americans began walking, hitchhiking, or, most often, “riding the rails” across the country. These wanderers, called hoboes, would sneak past railroad police to slip into open boxcars on freight trains. Hundreds of thousands of people, mostly boys and young men, wandered from place to place in this way.
The Depression also caused many immigrants to return to their native countries. In some cases, this repatriation was voluntary as jobs

became scarce. In other cases, repatriation was forced. The federal government launched repatriation drives to send poor immigrants back to their home countries. It also stepped up efforts to deport immigrants who had violated the law. In the Southwest, federal officials rounded up Mexicans (often without regard to their citizenship status) and forcibly returned them to Mexico.
Although estimates vary, historians believe that the Mexican Repatriation resulted in somewhere between 500,000 and 2 million people of Mexican heritage, perhaps more that half of whom were American citizens, being

Hispanics were one ofthe most highly visible immigrant minorities remaining after the immigration laws ofthe 1920s had restricted other immigrants and deporting them was easier am less expensive than shipping hundreds of thousands of people back to Europe.

Farmers soon faced a new disaster. The Great Plains were very dry with high winds. Topsoil was held in place by deep rooted prairie grasses that preserved moisture in times of low rainfall. The Homestead Act had and encouraged large-scale settlement of the region and as the population grew, tractors and combines came into widespread use, much of the Great Plains were extensively deep-plowed making the topsoil susceptible to rapid erosion.
Deep-plowing was not a problem for many decades, as the Great Plains experienced higher than normal rainfall from the late 1800s to the 1920s. But when crop prices dropped in the 1920s, many farmers left their fields uncultivated even as temperatures had begun to climb and rainfall had begun to decline. In the early 1930s, a severe drought hit, and there was nothing anchoring the soil or retaining moisture. The soil turned to dust. Human and physical geographic factors had combined to create a disaster.
Winds blew the arid earth aloft, blackening the sky for hundreds of miles. Dust buried crops and livestock. Humans and animals caught outdoors sometimes died of suffocation when the dust filled their lungs. During most of the 1930s, an average of 50 dust storms a year hit the Plain*
Some Great Plains farmers managed to hold on to their land, but othei were not as lucky. If their land was mortgaged, they had to turn the property over to the banks. Then, nearly penniless, many families headed west, hoping for a better life in California. Because many migrants were from Oklahoma, they became known as “Okies.” In California, their struggles continued:

Arts and Entertainment
GUIDING QUESTION
In whatways did culture reflect the Depression experience? The hard times of the 1930s led many Americans to want to escape their worries. Movies and radio programs grew increasingly popular. During the 1930s, more than 60 million Americans went to the movies each week.
Child stars delighted viewers, and comedies provided a relief from daily worries. The Marx Brothers amused audiences in such films as Animal Crackers. Moviegoers also loved cartoons. Walt Disney produced the first feature-length animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, in 1937.
Serious films often celebrated ordinary people and the values of smalltown America. In Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Jimmy Stewart played a decent but naive senator. He refuses to compromise his principles and exposes the corruption of some of his colleagues. Although few movies portrayed the hard times of the era, dramas tended to show heroes, often regular people, standing up to corruption or powerful forces. These films resonated with Americans because they offset the feelings of helplessness the Depression had caused, and also reflected the belief of many people that they were victims of corruption among the wealthy and powerful.
In 1939 MGM produced The Wizard of Oz, a colorful musical that lifted viewers’ spirits. That same year, Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable thrilled audiences in Gone with the Wind, a Civil War epic that won nine Academy Awards. Hattie McDaniel won Best Supporting Actress, becoming the first African American to win an Academy Award.
While movies captured the imagination, radio offered information and entertainment. Tens of millions of people listened to the radio daily.
Comedians such as Jack Benny were popular, as were the adventures of superheroes such as the Green Hornet. Daytime dramas continued their story lines from day to day. Programs such as The Guiding Light presented the personal struggles of middle-class families. The sponsors were often makers of laundry soaps, so the shows were nicknamed soap operas. Radio also exposed listeners to a variety of musical styles. Americans enjoyed hit songs from movies and Broadway musicals to swing music to country.
Literature and the visual arts also flourished during the 1930s. Writers and artists tried to portray life around them, using the homeless and unemployed as their subjects in stories and pictures. Novelists developed new writing techniques. In The Sound and the Fury, William Faulkner shows what characters are thinking and feeling before they speak. Using this stream of consciousness technique/ he exposes hidden attitudes of the residents of a fictional Mississippi county.
Perhaps no writer did more than reporter and novelist John Steinbeck did to capture the characteristics and issues of the Depression. Steinbeck focused on the rural poor, particularly agricultural workers and farmers. He created a sense of realism with rich detailed descriptions, showing how people said things and what they and their surroundings looked like. He focused on how their circumstances were partly the result of the economic system, but he also stressed the importance of friendship and family in helping people survive hardship.
Steinbeck’s writings added flesh and blood to journalists reports of poverty and misfortune and evoked both sympathy for his characters and indignation at social injustice. In The Grapes of Wrath (1939), Steinbeck tells the story of a family fleeing the Dust Bowl to find a new life in California. Steinbeck had visited the camps of migrant families and sympathized with

their fears. In his novel, he describes the experiences of the Joad family who headed to California after losing their farm.
Images were also becoming more influential. Photographers roamed the nation with the new 35-millimeter cameras, seeking new subjects. In 1936 TIME magazine publisher Henry Luce introduced Life, a weekly photojournalism magazine that enjoyed instant success. The striking pictures of photojournalists Dorothea Lange and Margaret Bourke-White showed how the Great Depression affected average Americans.
Lange photographed homeless people in San Francisco and poor migrant agricultural workers in California’s Central Valley. One of her most famous photos, entitled “Migrant Mother” (1936) exemplifies the Depression era’s characteristics and issues. The photo depicts a sad weary women with seven children who had just sold her car’s tires to buy food. Lange also traveled throughout the Dust Bowl states capturing images of the devastated region. When the images were collected in a best-selling book An American Exodus (1939), the state of California responded by setting up camps to shelter migrant workers.
Like Lange, Margaret Bourke-White was a master at using photography to capture the era’s ironies and contrasts. In 1937, Life magazine carried one of hei most famous photographs. It showed a line of poor African American flood victims waiting for help in front of a billboard which declared, “World’s Highes Standard of Living” and showed a white family happily driving a car.
Painters of the 1930s included Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood, whose styles were referred to as the regionalist school. Their work emphasized traditional American values, especially those of the rural Midwest and South. Wood’s best-known painting today is American Gothic. The portrait pays tribul to no-nonsense Midwesterners while gently making fun of their severity.

Determining Cause and Effect
Why Learn This Skill?
Why do we study history? We know things have happened in the past that have shaped the world we live in today. There are many things we appreciate and other things that we think are wrong. The purpose of history, perhaps more than anything else, is to explain why things happened and what changed as a result. In short, understanding history requires you to identify cause-and-effect relationships.
Learning the Skill
Determining cause and effect involves considering why an event occurred. A cause is an action, an event, a condition, or a decision that makes something else happen. What happens is the effect.
There are three kinds of causes. Necessary causes are causes that you have to have or the event cannot happen. A sufficient cause is a cause that all by itself can cause an event. But it is not the only possible cause. Contributory causes cannot cause an event by themselves, but they can help shape the conditions under which it happens.
To determine cause and effect follow these steps:
•	Ask why an event happened. List possible reasons for the event.
•	Look at the list. Which causes are necessary? Are they all necessary? Which ones might be sufficient but not needed to explain the event. Which causes only contributed to shaping the event?
•	Look at the timing of the causes. Which ones established conditions far in the past. These are long range causes. Which ones helped trigger an event once conditions were in place? These are short-term or immediate causes.
•	To determine effects, ask "What happened because of this?" or "What were the results of this?"
•	Examine what effects happened right away and which ones only developed
slowly over time. These are short and long-range effects.
•	Be sure you have causes and events in the correct sequence.
•	Make sure there is a logical or reasonable connection between the causes and effects you have identified. Sometimes things happen close together, but that doesn't mean one caused the other. Writing history is all about explaining why your evidence proves a cause and effect relationship.

Promoting Recovery
guiding question How did President Hoover's governing philosophy influence his efforts to combat the Great Depression?
On Friday, October 25, 1929, the day after Black Thursday, President Herbert Hoover declared that “the fundamental business of the country ... is on a sound and prosperous basis.” On March 1930, he told the press that “the worst effects of the crash upon employment will have passed during the next sixty days.” Critics derided his optimism as conditions worsened. Hoover hoped to downplay the public’s fears and to avoid more bank runs and layoffs. He urged consumers and business leaders to make rationa decisions. In the end, Hoover’s efforts failed to inspire the publics confidence, and the economy continued its downward slide.
Hoover believed that American “rugged individualism” would keep the economy moving and that the government should not step in to help individuals. After World War I, many European countries implemented a form of socialism, which Hoover felt contributed to their lack of economic recovery. In 1922 Hoover h< written a book, American Individualism, explaining why the American system of individualism was the best social, political, spiritual, and economic system. Thus, it was difficult for him to propose more government control.
Despite public statements that the economy was not in trouble, Hoover was worried. He organized a series of conferences, bringing together heads of banks, railroads, and other big businesses, as well as labor leaders and government officials to strategize about solutions.

Industry leaders pledged to keep factories open and to stop slashing wages, but by 1931, they had broken those pledges. Hoover increased funding for public works, or government-financed building projects. The resulting construction jobs employed a small fraction ofthe millions of unemployed. The only way the government could create enough new jobs was through massive spending, which Hoover refused to do.
Someone had to pay for public works projects. If the government raised taxes, consumers would have less money to spend, hurting business. If the government kept taxes low and ran a budget deficit—spending more than it collected it would have to borrow money, making less available for loans. As the 1930 congressional elections approached, most Americans blamed the party in power for the ailing economy. The Republicans lost 49 seats and their majority in the House of Representatives; they held on to the Senate by a single vote. Trying to Rescue the Banks
To get the economy growing, Hoover wanted to increase the money supply to help banks make loans to corporations. They could then expand production and rehire workers. The president asked the Federal Reserve Board to put more currency into circulation, but the Board refused. To ease the money shortage, Hoover set up the National Credit Corporation (NCC) in October 1931. The NCC created a pool of money that allowed troubled banks to continue lending money in their communities. This program, however, failed to meet the nations needs.
In 1932 Hoover requested Congress to set up the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) to make loans to businesses. By early 1932, the RFC had lent about $238 million to banks, railroads, and building-and-loan associations. Overly cautious, the RFC failed to increase its lending sufficiently. The economy continued its decline.
Direct Help for Citizens
Hoover strongly opposed the federal governments participation in relief-money given directly to impoverished families. He believed that only state and local governments should dole out relief, with any other needs being met by private charity. By the spring of 1932, however, state and local governments were running out of money, and private charities lacked the resources to handle the crisis.
Support for a federal relief measure increased, and Congress passed the Emergency Relief and Construction Act in July. Reluctantly, Hoover signed it.

The new act called for $1.5 billion for public works and $300 million in emergency loans to the states for direct relief. For the first time in American history, the federal government was supplying direct relief funds. By this time, however, the new program could not reverse the damage that had been done.
H READING PROGRESS CHECK
Identifying What two major strategies did President Hoover use to promote economic recovery?
In an Angry Mood
guiding question Why did citizens try to change government policy during the Depression's early years? How did they change it?
In the months after the Wall Street crash, most Americans were resigned to bad economic news. By 1931, however, many were becoming increasingly discontent.
Hunger Marches and Protests by Farmers
In January 1931, about 500 residents of Oklahoma City looted a grocery store. The following month, hundreds of unemployed citizens smashed the windows of a Minneapolis grocery store and helped themselves to meat, produce, and canned goods. Crowds began showing up at rallies and “hunger marches” organized by the American Communist Party. On December 5, 1932, in Washington, D.C., a group of about 1,200 hunger marchers chanted, “Feed the hungry, tax the rich.” Police herded them into a cul-de-sac and denied them food and water. Some members of Congress insisted on the marchers’ right to petition their government. With that, the marchers made their way to Capitol Hill.
The hungry poor were not the only people who began to protest conditions during the Depression. During the agricultural boom that took place during World War I, many farmers had heavily mortgaged their land to pay for seed, equipment, and feed. After the war, prices sank so low that farmers began losing money. Creditors foreclosed on nearly one million farms between 1930 and 1934. They took ownership of the land and evictee families. Some farmers began destroying their crops, desperately trying to raise prices by reducing the supply. In Nebraska, farmers burned corn to heat their homes. Georgia dairy farmers blocked highways and stopped milk trucks, dumping the milk into ditches.

The Bonus Marchers
After World War I, Congress had enacted a $1,000 bonus for each veteran, to be distributed in 1945. In 1929 Texas congressman Wright Patman introduced a bill that would authorize early payment of these bonuses. In May 1932, several hundred Oregon veterans began marching to Washington, D.C., to lobby for passage ofthe legislation. As they moved eastward, other veterans joined them until they numbered about 1,000. Wearing ragged military uniforms, they trudged along the highways or rode the rails, singing old war songs. The press termed the marchers the “Bonus Army.”
Once in Washington, the veterans camped in Hoovervilles. More veterans joined them until the Bonus Army swelled to an estimated 15,000. President Hoover acknowledged the veterans’ right to petition but refused to meet with them. When the Senate voted down the bonus bill, veterans outside the Capitol began to grumble. In a statement, Hoover said, “Congress made provision for the return home of the so-called bonus marchers who have for many weeks been given every opportunity of free assembly, free speech and free petition to the Congress.” Many returned home, but some marchers stayed on. Some lived in the camps; others squatted in vacant buildings downtown.
In late July, Hoover ordered the buildings cleared. The police tried, but when an officer panicked and fired into a crowd, killing two veterans, the secretary of war asked if he could send in army
troops. General Douglas MacArthur ignored Hoover’s orders to clear the buildings but to leave the camps alone. MacArthur sent in cavalry, infantry, and tanks to clear the camps. Soon, unarmed veterans were running away, pursued by some 700 soldiers. The soldiers teargassed stragglers and burned the shacks. National press coverage of troops assaulting veterans further harmed Hoover’s reputation and hounded him throughout the 1932 campaign.
Although Hoover failed to resolve the economic crisis, he did more than any prior president to expand the federal government’s role in the economy. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was the first federal agency created to stimulate the economy during peacetime. The rout of the Bonus Army marchers and the lingering Depression, however, tarnished Hoover’s public image.

The Story Matters...
The Great Depression had changed the lives of many Americans. Millions had lost their jobs, their savings, and their homes. Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt offered hope and relief in the presidential election of 1932. In his first hundred days in office, he sent bill after bill to Congress. This legislation became known as the New Deal. It included an array of programs and laws designed to rejuvenate the American economy and prevent such an economic disaster from reoccurring.
◄ Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, shared a progressive attitude with his famous cousin, President Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican.

CHAPTER 10
Place and Time: United States 1931-1941
Franklin D. Roosevelt and his administration had a monumental task in 1933. The Great Depression had affected millions of Americans. People began to demand help from the federal government. Promising a "New Deal" for the American people, President Roosevelt took immediate steps to put people back to work, strengthen the economy, and establish a safety net for the nation. Roosevelt's critics challenged his plan because never before had the federal government intervened so directly in the economy.

Roosevelt's Rise to Power
guiding question What qualities make an effective leader?
A distant cousin of Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt grew up in Hyde Park, New York. In his youth, Franklin learned to hunt, ride horses, and sail; he also developed a lifelong commitment to conservation and a love of rural areas in the United States. Roosevelt was educated at Harvard and then at Columbia Law School. While at Harvard, he became friends with Theodore Roosevelts niece Eleanor, whom he later married.
Intensely competitive, Roosevelt liked to be in control. He also liked being around people. His charming personality, deep rich voice, and wide smile expressed confidence and optimism. In short, his personality seemed made for a life in politics.
Roosevelt began his political career in 1910 when he was elected to the New York State Senate. He earned a reputation as a progressive reformer. Three years later, he became assistant secretary of the navy in the Wilson administration. In 1920 his reputation (and famous surname) helped him win the vice-presidential nomination on the unsuccessful Democratic ticket.
After losing the election, Roosevelt temporarily withdrew from politics. The next year, he caught the dreaded paralyzing disease polio. Although there was no cure, Roosevelt refused to give in. He began a vigorous exercise program to restore muscle control. With heavy steel braces on his legs, he was able to seem to walk short distances by leaning on a cane and someone’s arm and swinging his legs forward from his hips.
310
While recovering from polio, Roosevelt depended on his wife and his aide Louis Howe to keep his name prominent in the New York Democratic Party. Eleanor Roosevelt became an effective public speaker, and her efforts kept her husband s political career alive.
By the mid-1920s, Roosevelt was again active in the Democratic Party.
In 1928 he ran for governor of New York. He campaigned hard to show that his illness had not slowed him down, and he narrowly won the election.
Two years later, he was reelected in a landslide. As governor, Roosevelt oversaw the creation of the first state relief agency to aid the unemployed.
Roosevelts popularity in New York paved the way for his presidential nomination in 1932. Americans saw in him an energy and optimism that gave them hope despite the tough economic times. After Roosevelt became president, his serenity and confidence amazed people. When one aide commented on his attitude, Roosevelt replied, “If you had spent two years in bed trying to wiggle your big toe, after that anything else would seem easy.”
In mid-June 1932, when the country was deep in the Depression, Republicans gathered in Chicago and nominated Herbert Hoover to run for a second term as president. Later that month, the Democrats also held their national convention in Chicago. When Roosevelt won the nomination, he broke with tradition by flying to Chicago to accept it in person. His speech set the tone for his campaign:
Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962)
\ Eleanor Roosevelt transformed ' the role of First Lady. She traveled,
; toured factories and coal mines,
! and met with workers, then told
her husband what people were ; thinking. She was a strong i supporter of civil rights and urged
him to stop discrimination in New
Deal programs. After President ; Roosevelt's death, she was : appointed a delegate to the ; United Nations in 1946, where
she helped draft the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

might Franklin Roosevelt's political career have been different if Eleanor
t had not been his wife?

«Let it be from now on the task of our Party to break foolish traditions....

I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people."
—speech delivered to the Democratic National Convention, July 2,1932
From that point forward, Roosevelt’s policies for ending the Depression became known as the New Deal. Roosevelt’s confidence that he could make things better contrasted sharply with Herbert Hoovers apparent failure to do anything effective. On Election Day, Roosevelt won in a landslide, winning the electoral vote in all but six states.

The Hundred Days
GUIDING QUESTION
Why are the first hundred days so important for a president? Roosevelt won the presidency in November 1932, but the situation grew worse between the election and his inauguration. Unemployment continued to rise and bank runs increased. People feared that Roosevelt would abandon the gold standard and reduce the value of the dollar to fight the Depression. Under the gold standard, one ounce of gold equaled a set number of dollars. To reduce the value of the dollar, the United States would have to stop exchanging dollars for gold. Many Americans and foreign investors with deposits in American banks decided to take their money out of the banks and convert it to gold before it lost its value.
Across the nation, people stood in long lines with paper bags and suitcases, waiting to withdraw their money from banks. By March 1933, more than 4,000 banks had collapsed, wiping out nine million savings accounts. In 38 states, governors declared bank holidays—closing the remaining banks before bank runs could put them out of business.
By the day of Roosevelts inauguration, most of the nations banks were closed. One in four workers was unemployed. Roosevelt knew he had to restore the nation’s confidence. “First of all,” he declared in his Inaugural Address, “let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.... This nation asks for action, and action now!”
SKILLS PRACTICE
As you read about the First New Deal, use a graphic organizer of your choice to take notes about the different approaches to ending the Depression. After completing the lesson, use your notes to write a summary of what you read.
The New Deal Begins
Roosevelt and his advisers came into office bursting with ideas about how to end the Depression. Roosevelt had no clear agenda, nor did he have a strong political ideology. He argued, “The country needs bold, persistent experimentation. . .. Above all, try something.”
The new president sent bill after bill to Congress. Between March 9 and June 16, 1933—which came to be called the Hundred Days—Congress passed 15 major acts to resolve the economic crisis. These programs made up what would be called the First New Deal.
A
Divided Administration Although he alone made the final decision about what policies and programs to pursue, Roosevelt depended on his advisers for new ideas. He deliberately chose advisers who disagreed with one another because he wanted to hear many different points of view.
One influential group of President Roosevelt’s advisers supported the belief that if the government agencies worked with businesses to regulate wages, prices, and production, they could lift the economy out of the Depression. A second group of advisers, who distrusted big business and felt business leaders had caused the Depression, wanted government planners to run key parts of the economy. A third group of advisers supported former president Woodrow Wilson’s “New Freedom” philosophy. They wanted Roosevelt to break up big companies and allow competition to set wages, prices, and production levels. This group of advisers also thought that the government should impose regulations to keep economic competition fair.
HREADING PROGRESS CHECK
Summarizing What were the key accomplishments during Roosevelt's first hundi days in office?
312
Banks and Debt Relief
GUIDING QUESTION
Why did Roosevelt broadcast "fireside chats"? Roosevelt knew that very few of the new programs would work as long as the nation’s banks remained closed. Before he did anything else, he had to restore peoples confidence in the banking system. Within a week of his taking office, the Emergency Banking Relief Act was passed. The new law required federal examiners to survey the nation’s banks and issue Treasury Department licenses to those that were financially sound.
On March 12, Roosevelt addressed the nation by radio. Sixty million people listened to this first of many “fireside chats.” He said, “I assure you that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress. When banks opened on March 13, deposits far outweighed withdrawals. The banking crisis was over.
With confidence in the banking system restored, Roosevelt then proceeded to use powers granted in the Emergency Banking Relief Act to take the dollar off the gold standard. In June Congress went further, passing a law that made all contracts payable only in legal tender. No one could demand gold in payment or use gold to pay for things.
Almost immediately, inflation began. This was exactly what the president wanted. The purpose of going off the gold standard was to cause inflation, what Roosevelt called “reflation” because he believed the dollar was overvalued from decades of deflation. Roosevelt wanted to cause inflation to help people in debt.
When money inflates, it loses value. Debts become easier to pay because the money owed is not worth as much anymore. At the same time, inflation causes prices to go up, earning more money for farmers and others who were suffering from low prices for their goods. The United States stayed off the gold standard for about nine months, until the president thought the dollar’s value had fallen far enough. In early 1934, Roosevelt set a new price for the gold standard, where one ounce of gold equaled 35 U.S. dollars.
fireside chats radio broadcasts made by Roosevelt to the American people to explain his initiatives
TheFDICand SEC
Many of Roosevelt s advisers wanted to go further, pushing for new regulations for banks and the stock market. Roosevelt agreed, and supported the Securities Act of 1933 and the Glass-Steagall Banking Act. The Securities Act required companies that sold stocks and bonds to provide complete and truthful information to investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was created to regulate the stock market and stop fraud. The Glass-Steagall Act separated commercial banking from investment banking. Commercial banks handle everyday transactions and could no longer risk depositors money through stock speculation. The act also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to provide government insurance for bank deposits. The creation of the FDIC increased public confidence in the banking system.
In creating the FDIC and the SEC, Congress changed the historical role of state and federal governments in financial matters. Until the New Deal, the regulation of banks had been the responsibility of state governments Today banks can have a federal charter or a state charter, and be subject to ot federal and state regulations. Similarly, up until 1933, the operation of stock markets had been generally unregulated. Under the laissez-faire ideas oft e fate 1800s, the idea that the federal government should impose ru es on a market where people met to buy and sell stocks was never seriously considere .

The FDIC still exists today. It guarantees bank deposits up to $250,000 for all member banks and is funded by insurance premiums paid by the banks, not by taxpayer money. The FDIC supervises the operations of over 4500 banks nationwide making sure they are sound, and comply with all financial regulations and consumer protection laws. You can tell if a bank is insured by the FDIC by looking for the “Member FDIC” logo on bank windows, paper documents, and websites.
The SEC also still exists, regulating the operations of the nations stock markets. It inspects stock brokers, investment advisors, and agencies that rate stocks. It investigates reports of fraud, insider trading, and works to prevent companies from misleading investors with false information. The SEC does not insure investments. Investing in companies always carries risk and investors can lose their money. The SEC’s role is not to protect investments, but to prevent fraud and make sure investors are given correct information so they can make good investment decisions.
Mortgage and Debt Relief
Terrified of losing their homes and farms, many Americans cut back on spending to make sure they could pay their mortgages. Roosevelt responded by introducing policies to help Americans with their debts. For example, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation bought the mortgages of home owners who were behind in their payments. It then restructured the loans with longer repayment terms and lower interest rates.
The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) helped farmers refinance their mortgages. These loans saved millions of farms from foreclosure. Although the FCA may have slowed economic recovery by making less money available to lend to more efficient businesses, it did help many desperate and impoverished people hold onto their land.
Both the HOLC and the FCA represented a dramatic expansion ofthe federal government’s role in the economy. Never before had the federal government been involved in helping people with their mortgages.

Farms and Industry
guiding question How did New Deal legislation try to stabilize agriculture and industry?
Many of Roosevelt’s advisers believed that both farmers and businesses were suffering because prices were too low and production too high. To help the nation’s farmers, Congress passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The act was based on a simple idea—that prices for farm goods were lo because farmers grew too much food. Under this act, the government’s Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) would pay farmers not to rai certain livestock, grow certain crops, and produce dairy products. Over the ne two years, farmers withdrew millions more acres from cultivation and receive! more than $1 billion in support payments. The program met its goal, althougl raising food prices in a depression drew harsh criticism. Also, not all farmers benefited. Thousands of tenant farmers, many of them African Americans, los their jobs and homes when landlords took their fields out of production.
The government turned its attention to manufacturing in June 1933, with the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). Once passed, this law authorize the National Recovery Administration (NRA) to suspend antitrust laws and a owed business, labor, and government to cooperate with rules, or codes of 1

competition, for each industry. Codes set prices, established minimum wages, shortened workers’ hours to create more jobs, permitted unionization, and helped businesses develop industry-wide rules of fair competition. The NRA revived a few industries, but the codes were difficult to administer. Employers disliked that the NRA allowed workers to form unions. They also argued that paying minimum wages forced them to raise prices. After the NRA was instituted, industrial production fell. The NRA was declared unconstitutional in 1935.

Relief Programs
guidingquestion How did New Deal programs differ from President Hoover's attempts to combat the Depression?
Many of President Roosevelt’s advisers emphasized tinkering with prices and providing debt relief to solve the Depression. Others maintained that the Depression’s fundamental cause was low consumption. They thought getting money into the hands of needy individuals would be the fastest remedy. Because neither Roosevelt nor his advisers wanted to give money to the unemployed, they supported work programs for the unemployed.
The decision to create federal work programs marked yet another change in the historical roles of state and federal government. Until the depression, relief programs run by government were rare, but when they have been set up, they had always been funded and managed by state and local governments. During the Hoover administration relief aid had, for the first time, been sent from the federal government to state governments to help them fund jobs

programs. But the New Deal went even further, with the creation of several federally managed job programs that bypassed the state governments entirely,
The CCC	u 1
The most highly praised New Deal work relief program was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The CCC offered unemployed young men 18-25 years old the opportunity to work under the direction of the forestry service planting trees, fighting forest fires, and building reservoirs. To prevent a repeat ofthe Dust Bowl, the workers planted a line of more than 200 million trees, known as a Shelter Belt, from north Texas to North Dakota.
The young men lived in camps near their work areas and earned $30 a month, $25 of which was sent directly to their families. The average CCC worker returned home after six to twelve months, better nourished and with greater self-respect. CCC programs also taught more than 40,000 of their recruits to read and write. By the time the CCC closed down in 1942, it had put 3 million young men to work outdoors—including 80,000 Native Americans, who helped reclaim land they had once owned. After a second Bonus Army march on Washington in 1933, Roosevelt added some 250,000 veterans to the CCC as well.
FERA and the PWA
A few weeks after authorizing the CCC, Congress established the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). Roosevelt chose Harry Hopkins, a former social worker, to run FERA. Initially, it did not create projects for the unemployed. Instead, it gave money to state and local agencies to fund their relief projects.
After meeting with Roosevelt to discuss his new job, Hopkins took the next two hours to spend $5 million on relief projects. When critics charged that some of the projects did not make sense in the long run, Hopkins replied, “People don’t eat in the long run—they eat every day.”
In June 1933, Congress authorized another relief agency, the Public Works Administration (PWA). One-third of the nation’s unemployed were in the construction industry. To put them back to work, the PWA began building highways, dams, schools, and other government facilities.
The PWA awarded contracts to construction companies. By insisting that contractors not discriminate against African Americans, the agency broke down some of the racial barriers in the construction trades.
The CWA
By the fall of 1933, neither FERA nor the PWA had reduced unemployment significantly, and Hopkins realized that unless the federal government acted quickly, a huge number of unemployed citizens would be in severe distress once winter began. After Hopkin; explained the situation, President Roosevelt authorized him to set u] the Civil Works Administration (CWA).
Hiring workers directly, the CWA employed 4 million people, including 300,000 women. The agency built or improved 1,000 airports, 500,000 miles of roads, 40,000 school buildings, and 3,500 playgrounds a parks. The program spent nearly $1 billion in just five months. Although the CWA helped many people get through the winter, President Rooseve was alarmed by how quickly the agency was spending money. He did no want Americans to get used to the federal government providing them v jobs. Warning that the Civil Works Administration would “become aha with the country, Roosevelt insisted that it be shut down the following spring. Hopkins summarized what the CWA had accomplished:

Emergency Economic Stabilization Act
Success of the First New Deal
During his first year in office, Roosevelt convinced Congress to pass an astonishing array of legislation. The First New Deal did not restore prosperity, but it reflected Roosevelt’s zeal for action and his willingness to experiment. Banks were reopened, many more people retained their homes and farms, and more people were employed. Perhaps the most important result of the First New Deal was a change in the spirit of the American people. Roosevelt’s actions had inspired hope and restored Americans’ faith in their nation.

The First New Deal When
FDR took office in 1933, the economy had been getting worse for more than three years. During the first one hundred days of his presidency, he oversaw 15 major pieces of legislation that attempted to revive the nation s economy and provide relief to the unemployed. Never before had the federal government intervened so directly in the economy. Key to stopping the economic downslide was FDR's ability to inspire confidence that the nation’s economic problems could be solved.

INAGURAL ADDRESS,
1933 “I am certain that my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our nation impels. This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly....
So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself— nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support ofthe people themselves which is essential to victory.
I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days....
This Nation asks for action, and action now.
Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem, if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment accomplishing greatly needed projects to simulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources.”
—President Franklin D. Roosevelt, first inaugural address, delivered March 4,1933,
Excerpted from The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt
“During the whole ’33 one-hundred days, Congress, people didn’t know what was going on, the public couldn’t understand these thing that were being passed so fast. They knew something was happening, something goodfc them. They began investing and working and hoping again....
The bank rescue of 1933 was probably the turning point ofthe Depression. When people were able to survive the shock of having all th banks closed, and then see the banks open up ... there began to be confidence. The public helped itself, after it got confidence. It marked the revival of hope.... A Depression is much like a run on a bank. It’s a crisis of confidence.”

ORAL HISTORY INTERVIEW
“What Roosevelt and the New Deal did wast turn around and face the realities.... A hundred years from now, when historians loc back on it, they will say a big corner was turned. People agreed that old things didn’t
work. What ran through the whole New Deal was finding a way to make things work.
Before that, Hoover would loan money to farmers to keep their mules alive, but wouldn’t loan money to keep their children alive. This was perfectly right within the framework of classical thinking. If an individual couldn’t get enough to eat, it was because he wasn’t on the ball. It was his responsibility. The New Deal said: Anybody who is unemployed isn’t necessarily unemployed because he’s shiftless....
Great quantities [of letters] came pouring in, letters from everywhere. .. They were proposals from people, solutions to all sorts of problems. Some of them crackpot, some of them quite good. Everybody had suggestions. The country was aware, as it never was before, that it was on the edge of something...
Laissez faire as such certainly did not come to an end with the New Deal. We still have a tremendous amount of freedom of decisionmaking in the individual corporate enterprise. The new element is the government’s positive responsibility for making our economy run.”

Launching the Second New Deal
guidingquestion Why did President Roosevelt decide to introduce new legislation to fight the Depression?
President Roosevelt was tremendously popular during his first two years in office, but opposition to his policies began to grow. New Deal programs had created more than 2 million new jobs. More than 10 million workers remained unemployed, however, and the nation’s total income was about half of what it had been in 1929. Criticism From Right and Left
Roosevelt faced hostility from both the political right and the left. The right wing had long believed that the New Deal regulated business too tightly. Opponents thought that it gave the federal government too much power over the states. By late 1934, the right wing increased its opposition as Roosevelt started deficit spending, abandoning a balanced budget and borrowing money to pay for his programs. Many business leaders became alarmed at the growing deficit.
Some on the left, however, believed that the New Deal had not gone far enough. They wanted even more economic intervention to shift wealth from the rich to middle-income and poor Americans. One outspoken critic was Huey Long. As governor of Louisiana, Long had championed the poor. He improved schools, colleges, and hospitals, and built roads and bridges. These benefits made him popular, and he built a powerful but corrupt political machine. In 1930 Long was elected to the U.S. Senate. In 1934 he established the Share Our Wealth Society to “pull down these huge piles of gold until there shall be a real job, not a little old sow-belly, black-eyed pea job but a real spending
320
money, beef-steak and gravy... Ford in the garage ... red, white, and blue job for every man.” Long planned to run for president in 1936.
Roosevelt also faced a challenge from Catholic priest and popular radio host Father Charles Coughlin. Once an ardent New Deal supporter, the Detroit resident had grown impatient with its moderate reforms. He called for inflating the currency and nationalizing the banking system. In 1934 he organized the National Union for Social Justice, which some Democrats feared would become a new political party.
A third challenge came from California physician Francis Townsend. He proposed that the federal government pay citizens over age 60 a pension of $200 a month. Recipients would have to retire and spend the entire check each month. Townsend believed that the plan would increase spending and free up jobs for the unemployed. His proposal attracted millions of supporters, especially older Americans, who mobilized as a political force for the first time. Together, the three men had supporters around the country. Roosevelt faced the possibility of a coalition that would prevent his reelection.
TheWPA
In 1935 Roosevelt launched a series of programs, now known as the Second New Deal, to generate greater economic recovery. Among these new programs was the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the New Deal’s largest public works program. Between 1935 and 1941, the WPA employed 8.5 million workers and spent $11 billion to construct about 650,000 miles of roadways, 125,000 public buildings, 853 airports, more than 124,000 bridges, and more than 8,000 parks. One WPA program, called Federal Number One, financed artists, musicians, theater people, and writers.
Artists created murals and sculptures for public buildings; musicians set up orchestras and smaller musical groups; playwrights, actors, and directors wrote and staged plays; and writers recorded the stories of those who had once been enslaved and others whose voices had not often been heard.

The Supreme Court's Role
In May 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, the Supreme Court struck down the authority of the National Recovery Administration. The Schechter brothers had been convicted of violating the NRAs poultry code. The Court ruled that the Constitution did not allow Congress to delegate its legislative powers to the executive branch, and therefore the NRA’s codes were unconstitutional. Roosevelt worried that the ruling suggested the Supreme Court could strike down the rest of the New Deal. Roosevelt knew he needed a
new series of programs to keep voters’ support. He called congressional leaders to a White House conference and thundered that Congress could not go home until it passed his new bills.
That summer, Congress passed Roosevelt’s programs.

ANALYZING PRIMARY SOURCES
There were many viewpoints on the New Deal. Some opponents believed it was undermining American society. Others thought it did not go far enough.
(S It is not easy for me to stand up here tonight and talk to the American people against the Democratic Administration. This is not easy... during my whole public life I put patriotism above partisanship. And when I see danger, I say danger—What are these dangers that I see? The first is the arraignment of class against class... In my time I have met some good and bad industrialists. I have met some good and bad financiers, but I have also met some good and bad laborers, and this I know, that permanent prosperity is dependent upon both capital and labor alike.
«So now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to that plan of mine.. .for the redistribution of wealth and for guaranteeing comforts and conveniences to all humanity out of this abundance in our country. I hope none will be horror-stricken when they hear me say that we musl limit the size ofthe big man's fortune in order to guarantee a minimum of fortune, life and comfort to the little man; but, if you are, think first that such is the declaration on which Roosevelt rode into the nomination and election of President. While my urgings are declared b some to be the average of a madman... if you will listen to me you wi find that it is restating the laws handed down by God to man; you will find that it was the exact provision of the contract and law ofthe Pilgrim Fathers who landed at Plymouth in 1620.99
And I also know that there can be no permanent prosperity in this country until industry is able to employ labor, and there certainly can be no permanent recovery upon any governmental theory of 'soak the rich'and'soakthe poor'99

Reforms for Workers and Senior Citizens
guiding question Howdid the Wagner Act and the Social Security Act affect Americans?
When the Supreme Court struck down the NRA, it also invalidated the section of the NIRA that gave workers the right to organize. Democrats knew that the working-class vote was key to winning reelection in 1936. They also believed that unions could help end the Depression because higl union wages would give workers more money to spend, thereby boosting t economy. Opponents disagreed, arguing that high wages forced companies to charge higher prices and hire fewer people. Despite these concerns, Congress pushed ahead with new labor legislation.
The Wagner Act
In July 1935, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act, also called the Wagner Act. This act guaranteed workers the right to unionize and bargain collectively. It also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which organized factory elections by secret ballot to determine whether workers wanted a union. The NLRB could also investigate employers’ actions and. stop unfair practices. The Wagner Act also set up a process called binding arbitration, whereby dissatisfied union members took their complaints to a neutral party who would listen to both sides and decide on the issues.
322
The Wagner Act led to a burst of labor activity. In 1935 John L. Lewis, leader ofthe United Mine Workers, helped form the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO), which set out to organize unions that included all workers, skilled and unskilled, in a particular industry. First, it focused on the automobile and steel industries, two of the largest industries in which workers were not yet unionized. Organizers used new tactics to get employers to recognize the unions. For example, during sit-down strikes, employees stopped work inside the factory and refused to leave.
This technique prevented management from sending in replacement workers. It was a common CIO tactic for several years.
In late December 1936, the United Auto Workers (UAW), a CIO union, began a sit-down strike at General Motors plant in Flint, Michigan. Family, friends, and others passed food and other provisions to them through windows. Violence broke out when police launched a tear gas assault on strikers, wounding 13, but the strike held. On February 11, 1937, General Motors recognized the UAW as its employees sole bargaining agent. The UAW became one of the most powerful unions in the United States.
U.S.
Steel, the nation’s largest steel producer and a long-standing opponent of unionizing, decided it did not want to repeat GM’s experience. In March 1937, the company recognized the CIO’s steelworkers union. Smaller steel producers did not follow suit and suffered bitter strikes. By 1941, however, the steelworkers union had won contracts throughout the industry. In the late 1930s, employees in other industries worked hard to gain union recognition from their employers. Union membership tripled from roughly 3 million in 1933 to about 9 million in 1939.
In 1938 the CIO changed its name to the Congress of Industrial Organizations and became a federation of industrial unions.
Social Security
After passing the Wagner Act, Congress began work on one of the United States’s most important pieces of legislation. This was the Social Security Act, which provided some financial security for older Americans, unemployed workers, and others. Roosevelt and his advisers viewed the bill primarily as an insurance measure. Workers earned the right to receive benefits because they paid special taxes to the federal government, just as they paid premiums in buying a life insurance policy. The legislation also provided modest welfare payments to others in need, including people with disabilities and poor mothers with dependent children.
Some critics did not like the fact that the money came from payroll taxes imposed on workers and employers, but to Roosevelt these taxes were crucial.

PRIMARY SOURCE
CRITICAL THINKING
Predicting Consequences How might Social Security have changed Americans' sense of personal economic security? We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and their unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no... politician can ever scrap my social security program.”
—quoted in "Memorandum on Conference with FDR Concerning Social Security Taxation,’19)
What Roosevelt did not anticipate was that Congress would later horror from the Social Security fund to pay for other programs without raising payroll taxes.
The core of Social Security was the monthly retirement benefit, which people collected when they stopped working at age 65. Unemployment insurance supplied a temporary income to workers who had lost their jobs.
Social Security continues to be a part of American life today. When Americans find themselves unemployed, they can draw on their unemployment insurance from Social Security for many weeks while they look for a new job. In addition, of course, Americans who have contributed t the Social Security system are eligible for a pension benefit when they retire.
In 2013, the government paid out over 1.3 trillion dollars in Social Security payments, approximately 37% of all federal government spending that year.
Social Security dramatically changed the role of the federal governmen It was the first example of what came to be called “entitlement” programs. An entitlement program is not simply a form of welfare or relief. It is a payment from the government that Americans are entitled to receive, in pa because they have paid into the system regularly with deductions from thei paychecks, and in part because the law imposes a requirement on the government to make the payments.
Social Security was controversial at the time it was passed, and remains a source of political debate today, in part because even though Americans are entitled to their Social Security payments, the federal government has borrow) against the Social Security fund in the past, and is now forced to borrow more money to pay its Social Security obligations. With the federal government deeply in debt and continuing to use deficit spending in almost every budget, concerns have arisen as to whether Social Security can remain solvent and the U.S. government will be able to meet its obligations. Social Security establishe the principle that the federal government should be responsible for those who through no fault of their own, were unable to work.

Roosevelt's Second Term
guiding question Why do you think Roosevelt easily won reelection?
In 1936 millions of voters owed their jobs, mortgages, and bank accounts to the New Deal. Many African Americans, who had reliably voted Republican since Reconstruction, switched their allegiance to the Democratic Party. Women and African Americans had made modest gains, thanks to the support of Eleanor Roosevelt, who toured the country and recounted her experiences to her husband. She persuaded him to address some of their problems in his New Deal programs. A Democratic Party coalition emerged, including not just the white South but also African Americans, farmers, workers, immigrants, women, progressives, and intellectuals.
The Election of 1936
The Republicans nominated Kansas governor Alfred Landon as their presidential challenger. He wanted to “free the spirit of American enterprise,” but could not convince most voters change was needed. Roosevelt won more than 60 percent of the popular vote.
The Court-Packing Plan
Although the New Deal was popular, the Supreme Court saw things differently. In January 1936, it declared the Agricultural Adjustment Act unconstitutional. Cases pending on Social Security and the Wagner Act meant that the Court might strike down other New Deal programs.
Roosevelt was furious. After his reelection, he tried to change the Court’s political balance. He sent Congress a bill that would increase the number of justices and allow the president to appoint an additional

CRITICAL THINKING
Comparing and Contrasting What mood does the photograph convey? justice if a sitting justice who had served 10 years did not retire within six months of reaching age 70. The bill, if passed, would have allowed Roosevelt to appoint up to six new justices.
The court-packing plan, as it was called, was a major political mistake. Many Southern Democrats feared new justices would overturn segregation. African American leaders worried future justices might oppose civil rights. Many Americans thought the plan gave the president too much power. The Court appeared to back down, narrowly upholding the constitutionality of both the Wagner Act and the Social Security Act. Soon after, a conservative justices resignation allowed Roosevelt to appoint a justice who supported the New Deal
Although the bill was quietly killed and Roosevelt achieved his goal of changing the Court’s view of the New Deal, the court-packing plan hurt his reputation. Moreover, it caused conservative Democrats to work with Republicans to block any further New Deal proposals.
The Recession of 1937
Roosevelt’s problems continued. In early 1937, the economy seemed to be on the verge of recovery. Industrial output was almost back to pre-Depression levels, and many people believed the worst was over. Concerned about rising debt, Roosevelt ordered the WPA and the PWA to be cut significantly. Unfortunately, he cut spending just as the first Social Security payroll taxes took $2 billion out of the economy. By the end of 1937, about 2 million peop were out of work.
A debate over the value of government spending arose within the administration. The leaders of the WPA and the PWA cited a new economic theory called Keynesianism (KAYN • zee • uh • nih • zuhm), which held that government should spend heavily in a recession to jump-start the economy.
At first, Roosevelt was reluctant to begin deficit spending again. Some critics believed the recession proved the public was becoming too dependent on government spending. But in early 1938, with no recovery i sight, Roosevelt asked Congress for $3.75 billion for the PWA, the WPA, and other programs.

The New Deal Ends
guiding question What impact has New Deal legislation had on federal and state governments?
In his second Inaugural Address, Roosevelt had pointed out that despite progrf in climbing out of the Depression, many Americans were still poor:
PRIMARYSOURCE
** I see one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-dad, ill-nourished.... The test of our progress is not whe we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those1 have too little.**
from The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt: The Constitution Prevail:
The Last New Deal Reforms
One ofthe presidents goals for his second term was to provide better housin for the nations poor. Eleanor Roosevelt, who had toured poverty-stricken Appalachia and the rural South, strongly urged the president to do somethin Roosevelt responded with the passage of the National Housing Act, which established the United States Housing Authority. This organization received
500 million to subsidize loans to builders willing to construct low-cost hous
Roosevelt also sought to help the nation’s tenant farmers. About 150,000 white and 195,000 Afncan American tenant farmers were expelled from farms when landlords took their land out of production under the AAA To stop this trend, Congress created the Farm Security Administration to give loans to tenants so they could purchase farms.
The last major piece of New Deal reform was the Fair Labor Standards Act, which abolished child labor, limited the workweek to 44 hours for most workers, and set the first federal minimum wage at 25 cents an hour. The recession of 1937 enabled Republicans to win seats in Congress in the midterm elections of 1938. Together with conservative Southern Democrats, they began blocking further New Deal legislation. By 1939, the New Deal era had come to an end.

The New Deal's Legacy
The onset of the Great Depression in 1929 was a major turning point in American history. The economic crisis of the Depression led to the New Deal, which fundamentally changed the relationship between the American people and the federal government. As a result of the Depression, the power of the federal government to intervene in the economy significantly increased.
At the same time, the historical role of the state governments and their relationship to the federal government began to shift as well. Increasingly the federal government took on a regulatory role that had previously been left to state governments. In addition, state governments began to look to the federal government as a source of additional funds to help them afford state programs and provide aid in difficult economic circumstances.
The New Deal did not end the Depression, but it did give many Americans a stronger sense of security and stability. As a whole, the New Deal tended to balance competing economic interests. Supreme Court decisions in 1937 and 1942 further increased federal power over the economy and allowed it to mediate between competing groups.
In taking on this mediating role, the New Deal established what some have called the broker state, in which the government works out conflicts among different interests. This broker role has continued under the administrations of both parties ever since. The New Deal also brought about a new public attitude toward government. Roosevelts programs had succeeded in creating a safety net—safeguards and relief programs that protected people against economic disaster. Throughout the hard times of the Depression, most Americans maintained a surprising degree of confidence in the American system.

LESSON 1
The Origins of World War II

’orld War II have been respond to injustice while
IT MATTERS BECAUSE
In the years following World War I, aggressive and expansionist governments took power in Europe andAsi Meanwhile, most Americans did not want to get involved another foreign war.
The Rise of Dictators
guiding question What economic and political conditions following World War I encouraged dictatorships?
The Treaty of Versailles, along with the economic depression that followed, contributed to the rise of antidemocratic governments in both Europe and Asia. These antidemocratic states would eventually break the peace agreement that ended World War I.
Mussolini and Fascism in Italy
One of Europe’s first dictatorships arose in Italy. In 1919 Benito Mussolini founded Italy’s Fascist movement. Fascism was an aggressive nationalistic movement that considered the nation mor important than the individual. Fascists believed that order in society and national greatness came through a dictator who led a strong government and built an empire.
Fascism was also strongly anticommunist. After the Russian Revolution, many Europeans feared that Communists, allied with labor unions, were trying to bring down their governments. Mussolini exploited these fears by portraying fascism as a bulwark against communism, protecting private property and the middle class. He pledged to return Italy to the glories of the Roman Empire.
Backed by the Blackshirts, a Fascist militia, Mussolini threatened to march on Rome in 1922, claiming he was defending Italy against a communist revolution. Liberal members of the Italian parliament insisted that the king declare martial law. When he refused, the cabinet resigned. Conservative advisers then persuaded the king to appoint Mussolini as the premier. Once in office, Mussolini—who took the title of II Duce, or “The Leader”—embarked on an ambitious program of bringing order to Italy.
Stalin Takes Over the Soviet Union
After the Russian Revolution, the Communist Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, created the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922. The Communists instituted one-party rule, suppressed individual liberties, and punished opponents.
After Lenin died in 1924, Joseph Stalin came to power. By 1926, Stalin was the new Soviet dictator. He began a massive effort to industrialize his country using Five-Year Plans. Steel production increased, but industrial wages declined by 43 percent from 1928 to 1940. Family farms were combined and turned into collectives, or government-owned farms. Peasants who resisted by killing livestock or hoarding crops faced show trials or death from starvation. As many as 10 million peasants died in famines during 1932 and 1933. Stalin also sought to expand Soviet influence beyond its borders, proclaiming, “[W]orld dictatorship can be established only when the victory of socialism has been achieved in certain countries or groups of countries ... [growing into] a World Union of Soviet Socialist Republics uniting the whole of mankind....”
Stalin tolerated no opposition, targeting political enemies along with artists and intellectuals. He used concentration camps, which held nearly 2 million people by 1935. Prisoners were used as slave labor. Between 15 and 20 million people died under Stalin’s rule, which lasted until his death in 1953.
Hitler and Nazi Germany

exploit to take unfair advantage of
collective a farm, especially in Communist countries, formed from many small holdings collected into a single unit for joint operation under governmental supervision
Adolf Hitler was a fervent nationalist who hated both the victorious Allies and the German government that had accepted their peace terms ending World War I. He became the leader of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, or Nazi Party. The Nazis were one of many political parties that arose out of postwar Germany’s political and economic chaos. The party called for Germany to expand its territory and to reject the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. It also was anti-Semitic. In November 1923, the Nazis tried to seize power by marching on city hall in Munich, Germany. The plan failed, the Nazi Party was banned for a time, and Hitler was arrested.
While in prison, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf (“My Struggle”), in which he claimed that Germans, particularly blond, blue-eyed Germans, belonged to a “master race” called Aryans. He argued that the Slavic peoples of Eastern Europe belonged to an inferior race, which Germans should enslave. Hitlers racism was strongest, however, toward Jews. Hitler blamed the Jews for many of the world’s problems, especially for Germany s defeat in World War I.
After his release, Hitler changed his tactics. He focused on getting Nazis elected to the Reichstag, the lower house of the German parliament. When the Depression struck Germany, many desperate Germans began to vote for radical parties, including the Nazis and Communists. By 1932, the Nazis were the largest party in the Reichstag. The
following year, the German president appointed Hitler as chancellor.
After taking office, Hitler called for new elections. Storm troopers, as the Nazi paramilitary units were called, began intimidating voters. After the election, the Reichstag, dominated by the Nazis and other right-wing parties, voted to give Hitler dictatorial powers. In 1934 Hitler became president, which gave him control ofthe army. He then gave himself the new title of Der Fuhrer, or “The Leader.

CRITICALTHINKING
Predicting Consequences What might be a result of Tojo's aggressive leadership? command to be in control of, to have full power
Militarists Control Japan
In Japan, as in Germany, difficult economic times helped undermine the political system. Japanese industries had to import nearly all ofthe resources they needed to produce goods. When the Depression struck, other countries raised their tariffs, making things worse. Many Japanese military officers blamed the country’s problems on corrupt politicians. They believed that Japan was destined to dominate East Asia and that straying from traditional beliefs corrupted the country.
The military leaders argued that seizing territory was the only way Japan could get the resources it needed. In September 1931, the Japanese army invaded Manchuria, a resource-rich region of northern China. In October, hoping to avoid conflict with the United States, Emperor Hirohito’s prime minister asked Minister of War Hideki Tojo to withdraw some troop; from China. Tojo refused, threatening to bring down the government. The military was in command of the country.

Examining How did postwar conditions contribute to the rise of dictatorships in Europe
World War II Begins
guiding question How did European nations try to prevent war?
In 1935 Hitler began to defy the Treaty of Versailles that had ended World War I. He announced that Germany would build a new air force and begin a military draft that would greatly expand its army—actions in direct violation of the treaty. Rather than enforce the treaty by going to war, European leaders tried to negotiate with Hitler.
Europe’s leaders had several reasons for believing—or wanting to believe—that a deal could be reached with Hitler to avoid war. First, they wanted to avoid a repeat of World War I. Second, some thought most of Hitler’s demands were reasonable, including his demand that all German-speaking regions be united. Third, many people assumed that the Nazis would want peace once they gained more territory.
The Austrian Anschluss
In late 1937, Hitler again called for the unification of all German-speaking people, including those in Austria and Czechoslovakia. He believed that Germany could expand its territory only by force.
In February 1938, Hitler threatened to invade German-speaking Austr unless Austrian Nazis were given important government posts. Austria’s chancellor gave in to this demand, but then tried to put the matter of unification with Germany to a democratic vote. Fearing the outcome, Hit! sent troops into Austria in March and announced the Anschluss, or unification, of Austria and Germany.
The Munich Crisis
Hitler next announced German claims to the Sudetenland, an area of Czechoslovakia with a large German-speaking population. The Czechs strong resisted Germany’s demands. France threatened to fight if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union also promised aid. Prime Minister Nev Chamberlain pledged Britain’s support to France, its ally.
Representatives of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany met in Munich, Germany, to decide Czechoslovakia’s fate. At the Munich Conference, on September 29, 1938, Britain and France agreed to Hitler’s demands, a policy that came to be known as appeasement. In other words, they made concessions and believed that if they gave Hitler what he wanted, they could avoid war. Czechoslovakia had to give up the Sudetenland or fight Germany on its own. When Chamberlain returned home, he stated, “My good friends, for the second time in our history, a British Prime Minister has returned from Germany bringing peace with honor. I believe it is ‘peace for our time.’ Go home and get a nice quiet sleep.”
Appeasement, however, failed to preserve the fragile peace. In March 1939, Germany sent troops into Czechoslovakia and divided the country. Slovakia became independent in name, but it was actually under German control. The Czech lands became a German protectorate.
Hitler Demands Danzig
A month after the Munich Conference, Hitler demanded that the city of Danzig be returned to German control. Danzig was more than 90 percent German, and it had been part of Poland since World War I. Hitler also requested a highway and railroad across the Polish Corridor.
Hitler’s new demands convinced Britain and France that war was inevitable. On March 31, 1939, Britain announced that if Poland went to war to defend its territory, Britain and France would come to its aid. This declaration encouraged Poland to refuse Hitler’s demands. In May 1939,
Hitler ordered the German army to prepare to invade Poland. He also ordered his foreign minister to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union. If Germany was going to fight Britain and France, Hitler did not want to have to fight the Soviets too.
The Nazi-Soviet Pact
When German officials proposed a non-aggression treaty to the Soviets, Stalin agreed. He believed the best way to protect the Soviet Union was to turn the capitalist nations against each other. If the treaty worked, Germany would go to war against Britain and France.
The non-aggression pact, signed by Germany and the Soviet Union on August 23, 1939, shocked the world. Communism and Nazism were supposed to be opposed to each other. Leaders in Britain and France understood, however, that Hitler had made the deal to free himself for war against their countries and Poland. They did not know that the treaty called for the division of Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union.
The Invasion of Poland and the Fall of France
On September 1,1939, Germany invaded Poland. Two days later, Britain and France declared war on Germany. World War II had begun. The Germans used a new type of warfare called blitzkrieg, or “lightning war. Blitzkrieg used massed tanks, combined with waves of aircraft and paratroopers, to break through and encircle enemy positions. By October 5,1939, the Germans had defeated the Polish military.
Meanwhile, Western Europe remained quiet. British and French troops in | France waited for a German attack. On May 10,1940, Hitler launched a new I blitzkrieg. While German troops parachuted into the Netherlands, tanks rolled | into Belgium and Luxembourg. British and French forces raced north into I	Belgium.

Britain's Neville Chamberlain (third from left), Mussolini (center), and Hitler (third from right) agreed to prevent war at the Munich Conference in 1938. To appease Hitler, representatives at the conference agreed that Czechoslovakia would give up the Sudetenland to Germany. Less than a year later, Germany had occupied all of Czechoslovakia, invaded Poland, and was at war with Britain and France.
CRITICAL THINKING
Drawing Conclusions Why do you think that the policy of appeasement failed?
The Miracle at Dunkirk
German troops drove Allied forces toward the English Channel. The port of Dunkirk became the Allies’ only way out. As German forces moved in on Dunkirk, Hitler ordered them to stop. Historians think that Hitler was nervous about risking his tank forces. Whatever his reasons, Hitler’s orders provided a three-day delay that allowed Allied forces to evacuate. When the evacuation ended on June 4, an estimated 338,000 British and French troops had been saved during the “Miracle at Dunkirk.”
Less than three weeks later, on June 22, 1940, Franc surrendered. To govern the rest of France, Germany set up a puppet government at the town of Vichy and mad<
Marshal Philippe Petain the leader but gave him no power. French general Charles de Gaulle led the Free French resistance forces from the French colony of Algiers. He worked with Allied leaders and refused to recognize the defeat of France.
Britain Remains Defiant
Hitler expected Britain to negotiate peace after France surrendered. Hew< mistaken. On June 4, 1940, British prime minister Winston Churchill delivered a defiant speech, vowing that Britain would never surrender:
PRIMARY SOURCE

-Winston Churchill, from his speech to Parliament, June 4,
That same month, Hitler ordered the German air force, the Luftwaffe, to begin attacking British ships in the English Channel. Then, in August and September, the Luftwaffe battled the British Royal Air Force in what became known as the Battle of Britain. After London was bombed accidentally, Britai retaliated by bombing Berlin. The Luftwaffe then began targeting its attacks c London and other cities. Britain’s use of radar gave it the advantage. After ma losses on both sides, Hitler canceled the planned invasion of Britain. Churchi praised the sacrifices of the pilots who saved Britain, saying, “Never in the fie of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.”

guiding questions Why did many Americans support isolationism? Why did President Roosevelt support internationalism?
The rise of dictatorships and militarism in Europe discouraged many Americans. The sacrifices they had made during World War I seemed pointless. In addition, during the Depression, most European nations announced they would no longer repay their war debts to the United States. In response, many Americans once again began supporting isolationism and trying to avoid involvement in international conflicts.
The Nye Committee
Meanwhile, accusations emerged that arms manufacturers had tricked the United States into entering World War I. In 1934 Senator Gerald P. Nye held hearings to investigate these allegations. The Nye Committee report documented the huge profits that arms factories had made during the war and created the impression that these businesses influenced the decision to go to war. Even more Americans turned toward isolationism.

Roosevelt's Internationalism
Despite the government’s stand on neutrality, President Roosevelt supported internationalism, the idea that trade between nations creates prosperity and helps prevent war. He warned that the neutrality acts might drag us into war instead of keeping us out,” but he did not veto th bills. When Japan invaded China in July 1937 without declaring war, Roosevelt claimed the Neutrality Act of 1937 did not apply. He authorize! the sale of weapons to China, warning that the nation should not let an “epidemic of lawlessness” infect the world:

B READING PROGRESS CHECK
Explaining What steps did the supporters of United States isolationism take to ensure that the country remained neutral in an international conflict?
Neutrality Tested
guiding question Howdid President Roosevelt assist Britain while maintaining U.S. neutrality?
Roosevelt wanted to help Britain and France in their struggle and asked Congress to revise the neutrality laws to allow the sale of weapons to warring nations. Congress passed the Neutrality Act of 1939 permitting the sale of weapons, but only on a “cash-and-carry” basis.
In the spring of 1940, the United States faced the first test of its neutrality. Britain asked Roosevelt for old American destroyers to replenish its fleet, and the president used a loophole in the cash-only requirement for purchases. He sent 50 ships to Britain in exchange for Americas use of British bases in the Atlantic. Because the deal did not involve an actual sale, the Neutrality Act did not apply.
Widespread acceptance of the Destroyers-for-Bases deal indicated a change in public opinion. By July 1940, most Americans favored offering limited aid to the Allies, but debate continued over the scope of that aid.
The Fight for Freedom Committee wanted the repeal of neutrality laws and stronger actions against Germany. On the other side, the America First Committee opposed any intervention to help the Allies.
After winning reelection in 1940, Roosevelt expanded the nation’s role in the war. Speaking to Congress, he listed the Four Freedoms for which both the United States and Britain stood: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.
The Lend-Lease Act
By December 1940, Great Britain had run out of funds to fight the war. Roosevelt proposed the Lend-Lease Act, which allowed the United States to lend or lease arms to any country considered “vital to the defense of the United States.” Britain could receive weapons, then return them or pay rent for them after the war. Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act by a wide margin. Lend-lease aid eventually went to the Soviet Union as well, when in June 1941, Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. Roosevelt followed Britain’s lead in supporting any state fighting the Nazis.

The Atlantic Charter
In August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill met and developed the Atlantic Charter, which committei both nations to a postwar world oi democracy, nonaggression, free trade, economic advancement, am freedom of the seas. Churchill late said that FDR “made it dear that 1 would look for an ‘incident’ which would justify him in opening hostilities” with Germany.
In early September, a German submarine, or U-boat, fired on an American destroyer that had been radioing the U-boat s position to the British. Roosevelt promptly responded by ordering American ships to follow a “shoot-on-sight” policy toward German submarines. The Germans escalated hostilities the following month, targeting two American destroyers. One of them, the Reuben James, sank after being torpedoed, killing over 100 sailors. As the end of 1941 drew near, Germany and the United States continued a tense standoff.

Japan Attacks Pearl Harbor
guidingquestion Howdid the United States try to slow Japan's advances in the Pacific?
Despite the growing tensions in Europe, it was the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that finally brought the United States into World War II. Ironically Roosevelts efforts to help Britain fight Germany resulted in Japan’s decision to attack the United States.
America Embargoes Japan
As German submarines sank British ships in the Atlantic, the British begai moving warships from Southeast Asia, leaving India and other colonial possessions vulnerable to Japanese attack. To hinder Japanese aggression, Roosevelt began applying economic pressure. Japan depended on the Unit States for many key materials, including scrap iron, steel, and especially oi In July 1940, Congress gave the president the power to restrict the sale of strategic materials—items important for fighting a war. Roosevelt then blocked the sale of airplane fuel and scrap iron to Japan. Furious, the Japanese signed an alliance with Germany and Italy, becoming a member ( the Axis.
In 1941 Roosevelt began sending lend-lease aid to China, hoping to enable the Chinese to tie down the Japanese and prevent them from attacking elsewhere. The strategy failed. By July 1941, Japan had sent military forces into southern Indochina, directly threatening the British Empire. In response, Roosevelt froze all Japanese assets in the United States, reduced the oil shipments to Japan, and sent General Douglas MacArthur to the Philippines to build up American defenses there.
342
With its war against China in jeopardy because of a lack of resources, the Japanese military planned to attack the resource-rich British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia. They also decided to seize the Philippines and to attack the American fleet at Pearl Harbor. Negotiations with the Americans continued, but neither side would back down. In late November 1941, six Japanese aircraft carriers, two battleships, and several other warships set out for Hawaii.
Surprise Attack
The Japanese government appeared to be continuing negotiations with the United States in good faith. American intelligence, however, had decoded Japanese messages that made it clear that Japan was preparing to go to war against the United States. On November 27, American commanders at the Pearl Harbor naval base received a war warning from Washington D.C., but it did not mention Hawaii as a possible target. Because of its great distance from Japan, officials doubted that Japan would attack Hawaii.
The U.S. military’s inability to interpret the intelligence correctly left Pearl Harbor an open target. Japan’s surprise attack on December 7, 1941, was devastating. Eight battleships, three cruisers, three destroyers, and four other vessels were sunk or damaged. The attack destroyed over 180 aircraft and killed 2,403 Americans. Another 1,178 were injured.
That night, a gray-faced Roosevelt met with his cabinet, telling them the country faced the most serious crisis since the Civil War. The next day, he asked Congress to declare war: The Senate voted 82 to 0 and the House 388 to 1 to declare war on Japan.
Because American officials did not expect it, the attack on Pearl Harbor was particularly devastating.
CRITICAL THINKING
Determining Cause and Effect What was the immediate result of the attack on Pearl Harbor? Germany Declares War
Hitler had hoped that Japan would attack the United States so that the majority of U.S. forces would be sent to the Pacific front. He expected the United States to enter the European war as incidents between German submarines and the United States mounted in the Atlantic.

During the Holocaust, the Nazis killed nearly 6 million European Jews. The Nazis also killed millions of people from other groups they considered inferior. The Hebrew term for the Holocaust is Shoah, meaning “catastrophe,” but it is often used specifically to refer to the Nazi campaign to exterminate the Jews during World War II.
The Nuremberg Laws
Although the Nazis persecuted anyone who dared oppose them, as well as the disabled, Gypsies (now known as Roma), homosexuals, and Slavic peoples, they reserved their strongest hatred for the Jews. This loathing went far beyond the European anti-Semitism that was common at the time. In the Middle Ages, Jews had been subjected to discrimination and sometimes to mob violence and expulsions. But in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Western and Central Europe, both the frequency and intensity of anti-Jewish government policies diminished.
After the Nazis took power, however, they quickly moved to deprive German Jews of many established rights. In September 1935, the Nuremberg Laws took citizenship away from Jewish Germans and banned marriage between Jews and other Germans. Two months later, another decree barred Jews from holding public office or voting. Another law compelled Jews
344
with German-sounding names to adopt “Jewish” names. Soon the passports of Jews were marked with a red J to identify them as Jewish.
By the summer of 1936, at least half of Germany’s Jews were jobless, having lost the right to work as civil servants, journalists, farmers, and actors. In 1938 the Nazis also banned Jews from practicing law and medicine and from operating businesses. With no source of income, life for Jews became very difficult.
Despite worsening conditions, many Jews chose to remain in Germany during the early years of Nazi rule. Well integrated into German society before this time, they were reluctant to leave and give up the lives they had built there. Many also thought that conditions would surely improve after a time. In fact, conditions soon became worse.
Kristallnacht
On November 7, 1938, a young Jewish refugee named Herschel Grynszpan shot and killed a German diplomat in Paris. Grynszpan’s parents and more than 14,000 other Polish Jews had been deported from Germany to Poland, and the distraught young man was seeking revenge for this act and for the persecution of the Jews in general.
Using this as a pretext, Hitler ordered his minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, to stage attacks against the Jews that would seem like a spontaneous popular reaction to news of the murder. On the night of November 9, this plan played out in a spree of destruction. In Vienna, a Jewish child named Frederic Morton watched in terror that night as Nazi storm troopers broke into his family’s apartment:
On Kristallnacht, November 9,1938, Nazi storm troopers destroyed Jewish property, such as this burned-out synagogue, and terrorized Jewish families across the Third Reich.

The anti-Jewish violence that erupted throughout Germany and Austria that night came to be called Kristallnacht, or “night of broken glass,” because broken glass littered the streets afterward. By the following morning, more than 90 Jews were dead, hundreds were badly injured, and thousands more were terrorized. The Nazis had forbidden police to interfere while roving bands of thugs destroyed 7,500 Jewish businesses and hundreds of synagogues.
The lawlessness of Kristallnacht continued to persist. Following the initial night of violence, the Gestapo, the government’s secret police, arrested about 30,000 Jewish men. The state also confiscated insurance payments owed to Jewish owners of ruined businesses.

Jewish Refugees Try to Flee
Kristallnacht and its aftermath marked a significant escalation of Nazi persecutioi against the Jews. Many Jews, including Frederic Morton’s family, decided that was time to leave and fled to the United States. Between 1933, when Hitler took power, and the start of World War II in 1939, some 250,000 Jews escaped Nazi-controlled Germany. These emigrants included prominent scientists, such as Albert Einstein, and business owners lik Otto Frank, who resettled his family in Amsterdam in 1933. Ottos daughter Anr kept a diary of her family’s life in hiding after the Nazis overran the Netherland; The “secret annex,” as she called their hiding place, has become a museum.
Limits on Jewish Immigration By 1938, one U.S. consulate in Germai had a backlog of more than 100,000 visa applications from Jews trying to leave for the United States. Following the Nazi Anschluss, some 3,000 Austrian Jews applied for U.S. visas each day. Most never received visas 1 the United States or to the other countries where they applied. As a result, millions of Jews remained trapped in Nazi-dominated Europe.
Several factors limited Jewish immigration to the United States. Na2 orders prohibited Jews from taking more than about four dollars outoi Germany. U.S. immigration law, however, forbade granting a visa to anyone “likely to become a public charge.” Customs officials tended to assume that this description applied to Jews, because Germany had fore them to leave behind any wealth. High unemployment rates in the 1930; also made immigration unpopular. Few Americans wanted to raise immigration quotas, even to accommodate European refugees. Others d not want to admit Jews because they held anti-Semitic attitudes. The existing immigration policy allowed only 150,000 immigrants annually, with a fixed quota from each country. The law permitted no exceptions] refugees or victims of persecution.
International Response At an international conference on refugees in 1938, several European countries, the United States, and Latin America stated their regret that they could not take in more of Germany’s Jews without raising their immigration quotas. Meanwhile, Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels announced, “[I]f there is any country that believes i has not enough Jews, I shall gladly turn over to it all our Jews.” Hitler also declared himself ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries ... even on luxury ships.”
As war loomed in 1939, many ships departed from Germany cramm< with Jews desperate to escape. Some of their visas, however, had been forged or sold illegally, and Mexico, Paraguay, Argentina, and Costa Rica denied access to Jews with such documents. So, too, did the United State;
The St Louis Affair On May 27, 1939, the SS St. Louis entered the harb< in Havana, Cuba, with 930 Jewish refugees on board. Most of these passengers hoped to go to the United States eventually, but they had certi icates improperly issued by Cuba’s director of immigration giving
em permission to land in Cuba. When the ships arrived in Havana, the

Cuban government refused to let the refugees come ashore. For several days, the ship’s captain steered his ship in circles off the coast of Florida, awaiting official permission to dock at a U.S. port. Denied permission, the ship turned back toward Europe, disembarking in France, Holland, Belgium, and Great Britain. Within two years, the first three of these countries fell under Nazi domination. Many of the refugees brought to these countries perished in the Nazis’ “final solution.”

Explaining What factors made it difficult for Jewish people to leave Europe?
The Final Solution
. n d i n g q u e s t i o n How did the Nazis try to exterminate Europe's Jewish population?
On January 20, 1942, Nazi leaders met at the Wannsee Conference to coordinate the “final solution of the Jewish question.” Previous “solutions” had included rounding up Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, and others from conquered areas, shooting them, and piling them into mass graves. Another method forced Jews and other “undesirables” into trucks and then piped in exhaust fumes to kill them. These methods, however, had proven too slow and inefficient for the Nazis.
At Wannsee, the Nazis made plans to round up Jews from the vast areas of Nazi-controlled Europe. Jews were taken to detention centers known as concentration camps. There, healthy individuals would work as slave laborers until they dropped dead of exhaustion, disease, or malnutrition. Most others, including the elderly, young children, and the
i infirm (among them laborers who could no longer work) would be sent to extermination camps, attached to many of the concentration camps, to be
? executed in massive gas chambers.

PLACES AND REGIONS
Which three nations had the highest number of Jewish losses? As one of the largest concentration camps, Buchenwald had more tha 200,000 prisoners working 12-hour shifts as slave laborers in nearby factories. Although Buchenwald had no gas chambers, hundreds of prisoners died there every month from exhaustion and horrible living conditions. As a U.S. Army chaplain wrote in his diary in 1945:
PRIMARYSOURCE
“ One thousand Weimar citizens toured the Buchenwald camp in groups of 100. They saw blackens skeletons and skulls in the ovens ofthe crematorium. In the yard outside, they saw a heap of white human ashes and bones... .Those who were dead were stripped of their clothing and lay naked, m< stacked like cordwood waiting to be burned in the crematory. At one time, 5,000 had been stacked ( the vacant lot next to the crematory.
—from the diary of Captain Luther D. Fletcher, qu World War II: From the Battle Front to the Hon
Leon Bass, a young American soldier, saw Buchenwald at the end of the war. A room built to hold 50 people had housed more than 150, with bunk beds built almost to the ceiling. Bass recalled:
PRIMARYSOURCE
I looked at a bottom bunk and there I saw one man. He was too weak to get up; he could just b3i turn his head. He was skin and bones. He looked like a skeleton; and his eyes were deep set. He didr utter a sound; he just looked at me with those eyes, and they still haunt me today.
—quoted in Facing History ond 0
Extermination Camps
In late 1941, the Nazis built extermination facilities at the Chelmno and Auschwitz camps in Poland. After the Wannsee Conference, extermination facilities were built at four other camps in Poland. At these camps, including the infamous Treblinka, Jews were the Nazis’ main victims. Auschwitz alone housed about 100,000 people in 300 prison barracks. Its gas chambers, built to kill 2,000 people at a time, could gas 12,000 people in a day. Of the estimated 1,600,000 people who died at Auschwitz, about 1,300,000 were Jews. Most of the others were Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, or Gypsies.
Upon arrival at Auschwitz, healthy prisoners were selected for
slave labor. Elderly or disabled people, the sick, and mothers and children went immediately to the gas chambers, after which their bodies were burned in giant crematoriums.
In only a few years, Jewish culture, which had existed in Europe for more than 1,000 years, had been virtually obliterated by the Nazis in the lands they conquered. Despite exhaustive debate, there is still great controversy about why and how an event so horrifying as the Holocaust could have occurred. No consensus has been reached, but most historians point to a number of factors: the German people’s sense of injury after World War I; severe economic problems; Hitler’s control over the German nation; the lack of a strong tradition of representative government in Germany; German fear of Hitler’s secret police; and a long history of anti-Jewish prejudice and discrimination in Europe.

The Holocaust As the Allies
liberated areas from German control in the spring of 1945, they discovered horrifying scenes in Nazi concentration camps. The Nazi regime had systematically murdered six million Jews and killed another six million Poles, Slavs, Gypsies, homosexuals, communists, and mentally disabled persons. Photographs of the newly liberated camps shocked the American public, although the Roosevelt administration and the State Department had evidence of the death camps as early as 1942.

NAZI DECREE,
1941 I.	(1) Jews over six years of age are prohibited from appearing in public without wearing a Jewish star.
(2) The Jewish star is a yellow piece of cloth with a black border, in the form of a six-pointed star the size of a palm ofthe hand. The inscription reads ‘JEW’ in black letters. It shall be worn visibly, sewn on the left chest side of the garment.
II.
Jews are forbidden: EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT
“[There] were two barracks: the men stood on one side, the women on the other. They were addressed in a very polite and friendly way: ‘You have been on a journey. You are dirty. You will take a bath. Get undressed quickly.’ Towel and soap were handed out, an then suddenly the brutes woke up and showe their true faces: this horde of people, these men and women were driven outside with hai blows and forced both summer and winters tc go the few hundred metres to the ‘Shower Room.’ Above the entry door was the word ‘Shower’. One could even see shower heads on the ceiling which were cemented in but never had water flowing through them.
These poor innocents were crammed together, pressed against each other. Then panic broke out, for at last they realized the fate in store for them. But blows with rifle but and revolver shots soon restored order and finally they all entered the death chamber. Tt doors were shut and, ten minutes later, the temperature was high enough to facilitate th condensation ofthe hydrogen cyanide forth condemned were gassed with hydrogen cyanide. This was the so-called ‘Zyklon B’.. which was used by the German barbarians.. One could hear fearful screams, but a few moments later there was complete silence.”

PROSECUTION STATEMENT
The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating, that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it cannot survive their being repeated. That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one ofthe most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to Reason.
This Tribunal, while it is novel and experimental, is not the product of abstract speculations nor is it created to vindicate legalistic theories. This inquest represents the practical effort of four ofthe most mighty of nations, with the support of 17 more, to utilize

We will show them to be living symbols of racial hatreds, of terrorism and violence, and ofthe arrogance and cruelty of power.... Civilization can afford no compromise with the social forces which would gain renewed strength if we deal ambiguously or indecisively with the men in whom those forces now precariously survive.

It is unmistakably apparent to all of us that, unless the advance of Hitlerism is forcibly checked now, the Western Hemisphere will be within range ofthe Nazi weapons of destruction... .To the people ofthe Americas, a triumphant Hitler would say, as he said after the seizure of Austria, and as he said after Munich, and as he said afterthe seizure of Czechoslovakia:"! am now completely satisfied. This is the last territorial readjustment I will seek." And he would of course add: "All we want is peace, friendship, and profitable trade relations with you in the New World."... Nobody can foretell tonight just when the acts of the dictators will ripen into attack on this hemisphere and us. But we know enough by now to realize that it would be suicide to wait until they are in our front yard. 59

Building the Military
guidingquestion What roles did minorities and women play in the armed forces during World War II?
Within days of Germany’s attack on Poland in 1939, President Roosevelt expanded the army to 227,000 soldiers. Before the spring of 1940, many Americans had opposed a peacetime draft Opinions changed after France surrendered to Germany in June 1940. In September of that year, Congress approved the Selectiv Training and Service Act—a plan for the first peacetime draft in American history—by a wide margin.
The man responsible for taking the flood of recruits and buildii large modern army capable of engaging the armed forces of Germai and Japan was General George C. Marshall, chief of staff of the U.S. Army and Roosevelt’s chief military advisor. Marshall would guide largest expansion of the army in American history from fewer than 190,000 men at the time the war began in Europe in 1939 to over 8 million men by the war’s end.
You're in the Army Now
More than 60,000 men enlisted in the month after the attack on Pe< Harbor. At first, the flood of recruits overwhelmed the army’s train facilities and equipment supplies. In 1940 the Department of Agricul had transferred over 350,000 acres to the War Department. New ba such as the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida, were built, an existing ones such as Eglin Air Force base were expanded. Many reci lived in tents rather than barracks, carried sticks representing guns practiced maneuvers with trucks labeled “TANK.”
358
New recruits were given physical exams and injections against smallpox and typhoid. Then they were issued uniforms, boots, and available equipment, and sent to basic training for eight weeks. Trainees drilled and exercised constantly and learned how to work as a team. Basic training helped break down barriers between soldiers. Recruits came from all over the country, and training together created tight relationships among the troops.
A
Segregated Military Although basic training promoted unity, most recruits did not encounter Americans from every part of society. At the start ofthe war, the U.S. military was segregated. African Americans were organized into their own units, but white officers generally commanded them. Military leaders typically assigned them to construction and supply units.
Pushing for "Double V" Not all African Americans wanted to support the war. As one African American college student noted: “The Army jim-crows us.... Employers and labor unions shut us out. Lynchings continue. We are disenfranchised .. . [and] spat upon. What more could Hitler do to us than that?” Nevertheless, most agreed that they should support their country. One leading African American newspaper, the Pittsburgh Courier, launched the “Double V” campaign to urge readers to support the war to win a double victory over Hitler’s racism abroad and racism at home.
African Americans in Combat Under pressure from African American leaders, President Roosevelt ordered the armed services to recruit African Americans and to put them into combat. He also promoted Colonel Benjamin 0. Davis, Sr., the highest-ranking African American officer, to the rank of brigadier general.
In early 1941, the air force created its first African American unit, the 99th Pursuit Squadron. Trained in Tuskegee, Alabama, the pilots became known as the Tuskegee Airmen. Commanded by Lt. Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., the squadron helped win the Battle of Anzio in Italy. Three other Tuskegee squadrons protected American bombers as they flew to their targets. Known as the 332nd Fighter Group, these squadrons flew 200 such missions without losing a single member to enemy aircraft. Also, the African American 761st Tank Battalion was commended for service during the Battle of the Bulge.
Other Minorities in the Military Although Japanese Americans were not allowed to serve at first, as the war progressed second-generation Japanese Americans served in the 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Almost half had been in internment camps in

the Southwest. Together these units became the most decorated in the history of the United States military. Approximately 500,000 Hispanic Americans served in the armed forces despite racial hostility against them. By the end ofthe war, 17 Hispanic Americans had received the Medal of Honor.
About one-third of all able-bodied Native American men aged 18-50 served in the military during the war. More than 400 Navajo marines served as “code talkers,” relaying critical information and orders over fielc radios as spoken messages coded in their own language.
Of the half million Jewish Americans who served in the military, approximately 52,000 were decorated for bravery. Because so many European Jews died as a result of the Holocaust, American Jews took on increased leadership in the worldwide Jewish community.
Although the military did not end all segregation during the war, it di integrate military bases in 1943 and steadily expanded the role of African Americans within the armed forces. These successes paved the way for President Truman’s decision to fully integrate the military in 1948. Women Join the Armed Forces
Women also joined the armed forces. The army enlisted them for the firs time but barred them from combat. Many army jobs were administrative and clerical. Filling these jobs with women freed more men for combat.
Congress first allowed women in the military in May 1942 by creatin: the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC). It appointed War Departm official Oveta Culp Hobby as WAAC’s first director. Many women were unhappy that WAAC was not part of the regular army, however. About a year later, the army replaced the WAAC with the Women’s Army Corps (WAC), and Hobby became a colonel.
The coast guard, navy, and marines followed suit and set up women’s units. Another 68,000 women served as nurses in the army and navy. Ab 300 women serving as Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) made me than 12,000 flights to deliver planes to the war effort.

American Economy in Wartime
GUIDING QUESTION
Howdidthe U.S. government mobilize the economy for war? Fighting a global war troubled President Roosevelt, but not British prime minister Winston Churchill, who knew that victory depended on industry. He compared the American economy to a gigantic boiler: “Once the fire is lighted under it there is no limit to the power it can generate.”
Converting the Economy
War production increased rapidly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, helped by existing government plans to build thousands of warplanes and a “Two-Ocean navy. Roosevelt believed that government and business had to work together to prepare for war. He created the National Defense Advisory Committee and asked business leaders to serve on the committee. The president and his advisers believed that giving industry incentives to produce goods quickly was the best way to rapidly mobilize the economy.
Normally, the government asked companies to bid on contracts to produce military equipment, a slow process. Instead, the government signed cost-plus contracts, agreeing to pay a company the cost to make a product plus a guaranteed percentage as profit. Under the cost-plus system, the more—and faster—a company produced, the more money it made. Although not cheap, the system got war materials produced quickly and in quantity. Cost-plus convinced many companies to convert to war production, and Congress authorized the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) to make loans to companies wanting to convert.
American Industry Gets the Job Done
By the fall of 1941, much had already been done to prepare the economy for war, but it was still only partially mobilized. The attack on Pearl Harbor changed everything. By the summer of 1942, almost all major industries and some 200,000 companies had converted to war production. Together they made the nation’s wartime “miracle” possible.

Kaiser’s shipyards built many kinds of ships, but they were best knov for basic cargo ships called Liberty ships. When the war began, it took 244 days to build the first Liberty ship. After Kaiser shipyards applied th mass-production techniques, average production time dropped to 41 dai Kaiser’s shipyards built 30 percent of all American ships constructed dui the war.
As war production grew, controversies between business leaders, government agencies, and the military increased.

Life on the Home Front
guiding question How did World War II change life for women and minorities in the United States?
The war dramatically changed American society. Unlike much of Euro] and Asia, which experienced devastation, America benefited somewha from the war. Mobilizing the economy finally ended the Great Depress creating almost 19 million new jobs and nearly doubling the average family s income. As an Ohio worker noted, “[O]ne of the important thi that came out of World War II was the arrival of the working class at a status level in this society. . . . The war integrated into the mainstream whole chunk of society that had been living on the edge.”
The improvement in the economy did not come without cost. Families had to move to where the defense factories were located. Housing conditions were terrible. The pressures and prejudices of the era led to strikes, race riots, and rising juvenile delinquency. Goods were rationed and taxes were higher. Workers earned more money, but also worked longer hours.
When the war began, American defense factories wanted to hire white men. With so many men in the military, however, there simply were not enough white men to fill all ofthe jobs. Under pressure to produce, employers began to recruit women and minorities.
Women in Defense Plants
During the Great Depression, many people believed married women should not work outside the home, especially if they took jobs that could go to men trying to support their families. Most working women were young, single, and employed in traditional female jobs such as domestic work or teaching. The wartime labor shortage, however, forced factories to recruit married women for industrial jobs traditionally reserved for men.
Although the government hired nearly 4 million women, primarily for clerical jobs, the women working in the factories captured the publics imagination. The great symbol of the campaign to hire women was “Rosie the Riveter,” a character from a popular song by the Four Vagabonds. The lyrics told of Rosie, who worked in a factory while her boyfriend served in the marines. Images of Rosie appeared on posters, in newspapers, and in
nWTi ANALYZING SUPREME COURT CASES
KOREMATSU v. UNITED STATES, 1944
Background to the Case
During World War 11, President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066 and other legislation gave the military the power to exclude people of Japanese descent from areas that were deemed important to U.S. national defense and security. In 1942 Toyosaburo Korematsu refused to leave San Leandro, California, which had been designated as a "military area" based on Executive Order 9066. Korematsu was found guilty in federal district court of violating Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34. Korematsu petitioned the Supreme Court to review the federal court's decision.
How the Court Ruled
In their decision, the majority of the Supreme Court, with three dissenting, found that, although exclusion orders based on race are constitutionally suspect, the government is justified in time of "emergency and peril"to suspend citizens'civil rights. A request fora rehearing ofthe case in 1945 was denied.

Distinguishing Fact from Opinion
When In Defense of Internment: The Case for “Racial Profiling” in World War II and the War on Terror was published in 2004, many historians were outraged. Author Michelle Malkin supported the decision to put Japanese Americans in internment camps. The Historians’ Committee for Fairness said it was “contradicted by several decades of scholarly research.” Malkin wrote that Roosevelt had evidence that some spying was taking place on the West Coast, and that Roosevelt was protecting national security.

By the end of the war, the number of working women had increased from 12.9 million to 18.8 million. Although most women were laid off or their jobs voluntarily after the war, their success permanently changed American attitudes about women in the workplace.
African Americans Demand War Work
Factories hired women, but they resisted hiring African Americans. Frustrated by the situation, A. Philip Randolph, the head of the Brotherh of Sleeping Car Porters—a major union for African American railroad workers—decided to act. He informed President Roosevelt that he was organizing a march on Washington “in the interest of securing jobs... in I national defense and . . . integration into the . . . military and naval force
On June 25, 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which sta “there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defei industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origi To enforce the order, he created the Fair Employment Practices Commission, the first federal civil rights agency since Reconstruction.
Mexican Farmworkers
The wartime economy also benefited Mexicans. In 1942 the federal government arranged for Mexican farmworkers to help harvest crops in Southwest as part of the Bracero Program, which continued until 1964. More than 200,000 Mexicans came to work during the war. Many also helped build and maintain railroads. Migrant workers thus became important to the Southwest’s economic system.

Many African Americans left the South for jobs in war factories in the North and West. However, African Americans often faced suspicion an intolerance. Racial violence erupted in Detroit on Sunday, June 20, 194. Fighting between white and African American teens triggered a citywk riot that left 25 African Americans and 9 whites dead.

Japanese, German, and Italian American Relocation
When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, many Americans turned their anger against Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans. On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 allowing the War Department to declare any part of the United States a military zone and to remove people from that zone as needed. He must have felt justified four days later when a Japanese submarine surfaced north of Santa Barbara, California, and shelled an oil refinery. Most of the West Coast was declared a military zone, and people of Japanese ancestry were evacuated to 10 internment camps farther inland.
In 1988 President Ronald Reagan apologized to Japanese Americans on behalf of the U.S. government and signed legislation granting $20,000 to each surviving Japanese American who had been interned.
Thousands of people of German and Italian descent also had their freedom restricted. All unnaturalized residents of German and Italian descent aged 14 years or over were deemed enemy aliens and subject to regulations including travel restrictions and the seizure of personal property. More than 5,000 were arrested and sent to live in military internment camps.

Admiral Chester Nimitz, the commander of the United States Navy in the Pacific, began planning operations against the Japanese navy. Although the Japanese had badly damaged the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, they had missed the American aircraft carriers, which were at sea on a mission. The United States had several carriers in the Pacific, and Nimitz was determined to use them. In the days just after Pearl Harbor, however, Nimitz could do little to stop Japan’s advance into Southeast Asia.
The Fall of the Philippines
A few hours after bombing Pearl Harbor, the Japanese attacked American airfields in the Philippines. Two days later, they landed troops. The American and Filipino forces defending the Philippines were badly outnumbered. Their commander, General Douglas MacArthur, retreated to the Bataan Peninsula. Using the peninsula’s rugged terrain, the troops held out for more than three months.
By March, in desperation, the troops ate cavalry horses and mules. The lack of food and supplies, along with diseases such as malaria, scurvy, and dysentery, took their toll. The women of the Army Nurse Corps worked on Bataan in primitive conditions. Patients slept in the open air. One nurse, Rose Meier, reported, “If we needed more room, we got our axes and chopped some bamboo trees down.”

General Douglas MacArthur (1880-1964)
General Douglas MacArthur graduated from West Point in 1903. One of his first military assignments was in the Philippines, site of his later World War II defeat and subsequent victory. In 1904 he was appointed aide-de-camp to his father, General Arthur MacArthur, in Japan. Following his World War II success in the Pacific, he was appointed Supreme Commander, Allied Powers (SCAP), in Japan. There he decreased Japan's military and helped reestablish its economy.

Nearly 78,000 prisoners of war were forced to march-sicl exhausted, and starving—65 miles (105 km) to a Japanese prison camp. Almost 10,000 troops died on this march, which was later to be called t!

Although the troops in the Bataan Peninsula surrendered, a small f held out on the island of Corregidor in Manila Bay. Finally, in May 194 Corregidor surrendered. The Philippines had fallen to the Japanese. The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo
Even before the Philippines fell, President Roosevelt was searching for; way to raise the morale of the American people. He wanted to bomb Tc but American planes could reach Tokyo only if an aircraft carrier brouj them close enough. However, Japanese ships in the North Pacific preve carriers from getting near Japan.
In early 1942, a military planner suggested replacing the carrier’s u; short-range bombers with long-range B-25 bombers that could attack f farther away. The only problem was that, although B-25s could take off from a carrier, the bombers could not land on its short deck. After attac Japan, they would have to land in China.
President Roosevelt put Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle in command of the mission to bomb Tokyo. At the end of March, a crane loaded sixteen B-25s onto the aircraft carrier Hornet. The next day, the Hornet headed west across the Pacific. On April 18, American bombs f on Japan for the first time.
Japan Changes Strategy
While Americans rejoiced in the air force’s success, Japanese leaders w< aghast at the raid. Those bombs could have killed Emperor Hirohito, w was revered as a god. The Doolittle Raid convinced Japanese leaders to change their strategy.
Before the raid, the Japanese navy had disagreed about the next ste The officers in charge of the navy’s planning wanted to cut American supply lines to Australia by capturing the south coast of New Guinea. 1 commander of the fleet, Admiral Yamamoto, wanted to attack Midway Is and—the last American base in the North Pacific west of Hawaii.

After Doolittles raid, the Japanese war planners dropped their opposition to Yamamoto’s idea. The American fleet had to be destroyed to protect Tokyo from bombing. The attack on New Guinea would still go ahead, but only three aircraft carriers were assigned to the mission. All of the other carriers were ordered to assault Midway.
The Battle of the Coral Sea
The Japanese believed that they could safely proceed with two attacks at once because they thought their operations were secret. What the Japanese did not know was that an American team of code breakers based in Hawaii had already broken the Japanese navy’s secret code for conducting operations.
In March 1942, decoded Japanese messages alerted the United States to the Japanese attack on New Guinea. In response, Admiral Nimitz sent two carriers, the Yorktown and the Lexington, to intercept the Japanese in the Coral Sea.
There, in early May, carriers from both sides launched all-out airstrikes against each other. Although the Japanese sank the Lexington and badly damaged the Yorktown, the American attacks prevented the Japanese from landing on New Guinea’s south coast and kept the supply lines to Australia open.
The Navajo Code Talkers
When American marines stormed an enemy beach, they used radios to communicate. Using radios, however, meant that the Japanese could intercept and translate the messages. In the midst of the battle, there was no time to use a code-machine. Acting upon the suggestion of Philip Johnston, an engineer who had lived on a Navajo reservation as a child, the marines recruited Navajos to serve as “code talkers.”
The Navajo language had no written alphabet and was known only to the Navajo and a few missionaries and anthropologists. The Navajo recruits developed code words, using their own language, that stood for military terms. For example, the Navajo word jay-sho, or buzzard, was code for bomber; lo-tso, or “whale,” meant battleship; and ni-ma-si, or potatoes, stood for grenades.
Code talkers proved invaluable in combat. They could relay a message in minutes that would have taken a code-machine operator hours to encipher and transmit. During the Battle of Iwo Jima, code talkers transmitted more than 800 messages during the first 48 hours as the marines struggled to

Driving Back Japan
guiding questions What was the military strategy behind "island-hopping"? Was it successful?
The American plan to defeat Japan called for a two-pronged attack. The Pacific Fleet, commanded by Admiral Nimitz, would advance through the central Pacific by “hopping” from one island to the next, closer and closer to Japan. Meanwhile, General MacArthur’s troops would advance through the Solomon Islands, capture the north coast of New Guinea, and then launch an invasion to retake the Philippines.
Island-Hopping in the Pacific
By the fall of 1943, the navy was ready to launch its island-hopping campaign, but the geography of the central Pacific posed a problem. Many of the islands were coral reef atolls. The water over the coral reef was not always deep enough to allow landing craft to get to the shore. If the landing craft ran aground on the

The vehicle was a boat with tank tracks, nicknamed the “Alligator.” This amphibious tractor, or amphtrac, had been invented in the late 1930s to rescue people in Florida swamps. It had never been used in combat, and the navy decided to buy only 2 of them in 1941. If more had been available at Tarawa, American casualties probably would have been much lower.
More than 1,000 marines died on Tarawa. Photos of bodies lying crumpled next to burning landing craft shocked Americans back home. Ma people began to wonder how many lives would be lost in defeating Japan.
The next assault—Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands—went mu more smoothly. This time all of the troops went ashore in amphtracs. Although the Japanese resisted fiercely, the marines captured Kwajalein and nearby Eniwetok with far fewer casualties.
After the Marshall Islands, the navy targeted the Mariana Islands. Ameri< military planners wanted to use the Marianas as a base for a new heavy bomb the B-29 Superfortress. The B-29 could fly farther than any other plane in the world. From airfields in the Marianas, B-29s could bomb Japan. Admiral Nin decided to invade three of the Mariana Islands: Saipan, Tinian, and Guam. Despite strong Japanese resistance, American troops captured all three by August 1944. A few months later, B-29s began bombing Japan.
MacArthur Returns
As the forces under Admiral Nimitz hopped across the central Pacific, General Douglas MacArthur’s troops began their own campaign in the southwest Pacific. The campaign began by invading Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, east of New Guinea, in August 1942. It continued until early 1944, when MacArthur’s troops finally captured enough islands to surround the main Japanese base in the region. In response, the Japanesi withdrew their ships and aircraft from the base, although they left 100,0 troops behind to hold the island.
Worried that the navy’s advance across the central Pacific was leavin him behind, MacArthur ordered his forces to leap nearly 600 miles (9661 to capture the Japanese base at Hollandia on the north coast of New Guinea. Shortly after securing New Guinea, MacArthur’s troops seized t island of Morotai—the last stop before the Philippines.
To take back the Philippines, the United States assembled an enormous invasion force. In October 1944, over 700 ships carrying more than 160,000

A few hours after the invasion began, MacArthur headed to the beach. Upon reaching the shore, he strode to a radio and spoke into the microphone: “People ofthe Philippines, I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God, our forces stand again on Philippine soil.”
To stop the American invasion, the Japanese sent four aircraft carriers toward the Philippines from the north and secretly dispatched another fleet from the west. Believing the Japanese carriers were leading the main attack, most of the American carriers protecting the invasion left Leyte Gulf and headed north to stop them. Seizing their chance, the Japanese warships to the west raced through the Philippine Islands into Leyte Gulf and ambushed the remaining American ships.
The Battle of Leyte Gulf was the largest naval battle in history. It was also the first time that the Japanese used kamikaze attacks. Kamikaze means “divine wind” in Japanese. It refers to the great storm that destroyed the Mongol fleet during its invasion of Japan in the thirteenth century. Kamikaze pilots would deliberately crash their planes into American ships, killing themselves but also inflicting severe damage. Luckily for the Americans, just as their situation was becoming desperate, the Japanese commander, believing more American ships were on the way, ordered a retreat.
Although the Japanese fleet had retreated, the campaign to recapture the Philippines from the Japanese was long and grueling. More than 80,000 Japanese were killed; fewer than 1,000
surrendered. MacArthur’s troops did not capture Manila until March 1945. The battle left the city in ruins and more than 100,000 Filipino civilians dead. The remaining Japanese retreated into the rugged terrain north of Manila; they were still fighting in August 1945 when word came that Japan had surrendered.

Since 1940, U.S. military strategists had discussed with Presiden Roosevelt the pressures of a two-front war. He wanted to get U.S troops into battle in Europe, but Prime Minister Churchill did n believe the United States and Britain were ready to invade Eurof Instead, the prime minister wanted to attack the periphery, or edges, of the German empire. Roosevelt eventually agreed, andi July 1942, he ordered the invasion of Morocco and Algeria—tw( French territories indirectly under German control.
The Battle for North Africa
Roosevelt decided to invade for two reasons. The invasion woul give the army some experience without requiring a lot of troops It would also help the British troops fight the Germans in Egypt Most of Britain’s empire, including India, Hong Kong, Singapon Malaya, and Australia, sent supplies to Britain through Egypt’s Suez Canal.
German general Erwin Rommel, whose success earned him nickname “Desert Fox,” commanded the “Afrika Korps.” After a 12-day battle at the Egyptian coastal city of El Alamein, the Brit secured the Suez Canal and forced Rommel to retreat in Novem
1942.	Despite this defeat, German forces remained a serious thr in North Africa.
Later that month, American troops commanded by General Dwight D. Eisenhower invaded North Africa. When the Americ advanced into the mountains of western Tunisia, they fought th German army for the first time. At the Battle of Kasserine Pass,
the Americans were outmaneuvered and outfought. They suffered roughly 7,000 casualties and lost nearly 200 tanks. Eisenhower fired the general who led the attack and put General George Patton in command. The American and British forces finally pushed the Germans back. On May 13, 1943, the last German troops in North Africa surrendered.
The Battle of the Atlantic
After Germany declared war on the United States, German submarines entered American coastal waters. American cargo ships were easy targets, especially at night when the glow from the cities in the night sky silhouetted the vessels. To protect the ships, citizens on the East Coast dimmed their lights every evening and put up special “blackout curtains.”
If they had to drive at night, they did so with their headlights off.
By August 1942, German submarines had sunk about 360 American ships along the East Coast, including many oil tankers. The loss of so many ships convinced the U.S. Navy to set up a convoy system in which cargo ships traveled in groups escorted by warships. The convoy system improved the situation dramatically, making it much more difficult for a submarine to torpedo a cargo ship and escape without being attacked.
The spring of 1942 marked the high point of the German submarine campaign. In May and June alone, more than 1.2 million tons of shipping were sunk. Yet in those same two months, American and British shipyards built more than 1.1 million tons of new shipping. At the same time, American airplanes and warships began to use new technology, including radar, sonar, and depth charges, to locate and attack submarines. As the new technology began to take its toll on German submarines, the Battle of the Atlantic turned in favor of the Allies.

The Battle of Stalingrad
Adolf Hitler was convinced that defeating the Soviet Union depended on destroying the Soviet economy. In May 1942, he ordered his army to capture strategic oil fields, factories, and farmlands in southern Russia and Ukraine. The city of Stalingrad, which controlled the Volga River and was a major railroad junction, was the key to the attack. If the German army captured Stalingrad, they would cut off the Soviets from the resources they needed to stay in the war.

On November 23, Soviet reinforcements arrived and surrounded Stalingrad, trapping almost 250,000 German troops. When the battle ended in February 1943, some 91,000 Germai had surrendered. Only 5,000 of them survived the Soviet prison camps. Each side lost nearly half a million soldiers. The Battle of Stalingrad put the Germans on the defensive.

H REAPING PROGRESS CHECK
Explaining What was Roosevelt's purpose in invading North Africa?
Striking Germany and Italy
guiding question IV/iof were the goals of strategic bombing in Germany and the invasion of Sicily!
The Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942 had shown that a large-scale invasion from the sea was possible. The success of the landinj convinced Roosevelt to meet again with Churchill to plan the next stage the war. In January 1943, Roosevelt headed to Casablanca, Morocco, tor the prime minister.
At the Casablanca Conference, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to step up the bombing of Germany. The goal of this new campaign was “the progressive destruction of the German military, industrial, and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people.” The Allies also agreed to attack the Axis on the island of Sicily. Churchill called Italy the “soft underbelly” of Europe. He was convinced that the Italians would quit the war if the Allies invaded their homeland Strategic Bombing
The Allies had been bombing Germany even before the Casablanca Conference. Britain’s Royal Air Force had dropped an average of 2,300 (2,093 t) of explosives on Germany every month for more than three y< The United States Eighth Army Air Force had dropped an additional 1, tons (1,365 t) of bombs during the last six months of 1942. These numl were small, however, compared to the massive new campaign. Between January 1943 and May 1945, the Royal Air Force and the United States Eighth Army Air Force dropped approximately 53,000 tons (48,2301) of explosives on Germany every month.
The bombing campaign did not destroy Germany’s economy or undermine German morale, but it did cause a severe oil shortage and wrecked the railroad system. It also destroyed so many aircraft factork that Germany s air force could not replace its losses. By the time the Al landed in France, they had control of the air, ensuring that their troop: would not be bombed.
Striking the Soft Underbelly
As the bombing campaign against Germany intensified, plans to invad Sicily also moved ahead. General Dwight D. Eisenhower commanded invasion, with General Patton and British general Bernard Montgome)

heading the ground forces. The invasion began before dawn on July 10,
1943.	Despite bad weather, the Allied troops made it ashore with few casualties. A new amphibious truck delivered supplies and artillery to the soldiers on the beach.
Eight days after the troops came ashore, American tanks smashed through enemy lines and captured the western half of the island. Patton’s troops then headed east, while the British attacked from the south. By August 17, the Germans had evacuated the island.
The attack on Sicily created a crisis within the Italian government. The king of Italy, Victor Emmanuel, and a group of Italian generals decided that it was time to depose Mussolini. On July 25, 1943, the king invited the dictator to his palace. “My dear Duce,” the king began, “it’s no longer any good. Italy has gone to bits. Army morale is at rock bottom. The soldiers don’t want to fight anymore. . . . You can certainly be under no illusion as to Italy’s feelings with regard to yourself. At this moment, you are the most hated man in Italy.” The king then arrested Mussolini, and the new Italian government began negotiating a surrender to the Allies.
Following Italy’s surrender, however, German troops seized control of northern Italy, including Rome, and returned Mussolini to power.
The Germans then took up positions near the heavily fortified town of Cassino. The terrain near Cassino was steep, barren, and rocky. Rather than

On April 5,1945, First Lieutenant Vernon Baker and his platoon advanced toward Castle Aghinolfi, a German stronghold in the mountains nearViareggio, Italy. Baker and about 25 others moved ahead ofthe group, and Baker successfully destroyed an observation post, a dugout, and three machine gun positions.
In 1996 his actions earned him a Medal of Honor"for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty in action on 5 and 6 April 1945."This made Baker one of seven African American World War II veterans to receive belated recognition for their service.

Drawing Conclusions Why were Baker's actions so important to the assault on Castle Aghinolfi? attack such difficult terrain, the Allies landed at Anzio, behind German lines. Instead of retreating, however, as the Allies had hoped, the Germans surrounded the Allied troops near Anzio.
It took the Allies five months to break through the German lines at Cassino and Anzio. Finally, in late May 1944, the Germans retreated.
Less than two weeks later, the Allies captured Rome. Fighting in Italy continued, however, for another year. The Italian campaign was one ofthe bloodiest in the war, with more than 300,000 Allied casualties.
The Tehran Conference
Roosevelt wanted to meet with Stalin before the Allies invaded France.
In late 1943, Stalin agreed, proposing that Roosevelt and Churchill meet him in Tehran, Iran.
The leaders reached several agreements. Stalin promised to launch a full-scale offensive against the Germans when the Allies invaded France in 1944. Roosevelt and Stalin then agreed to divide Germany after the war so that it would never again threaten world peace. Stalin promised that once Germany was defeated, the Soviet Union would help the United States against Japan. He also accepted Roosevelt’s proposal of an international peacekeeping organization after the war. Part of the agreement proclaimed:

Evaluating What did Roosevelt and other leaders hope to accomplish by attackim Germany and Italy?
The D-Day Invasion
guiding question What if D-Day had failed and Germany had defeated the Allies in Europe?
After the conference in Tehran, Roosevelt headed to Cairo, Egypt, where 1 and Churchill continued planning an invasion of France to force German) again fight the war on two fronts. One major decision still had to be made The president had to choose the commander for Operation Overlord—the code name for the invasion. Roosevelt selected General Eisenhower. Planning Operation Overlord
Hitler had fortified the French coast along the English Channel, but he d not know when or where the Allies would land. The Germans believed tl landing would be in Pas-de-Calais—the area of France closest to Britain. The Allies encouraged this belief by placing dummy equipment along the coast across from Calais. The real target was farther south, a 60-mile stre of five beaches along the Normandy coast.
The selection of a site for the largest amphibious landing in history wa one ofthe biggest decisions of World War II. Allied planners considered coastlines from Denmark to Portugal in search of a sheltered location with firm flat beaches within range of friendly fighter planes in England. There

378
and to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of American, Canadian, and British troops set to stream ashore following the invasion. An airfield and a seaport that the Allies could use were also needed. Most important was a reasonable expectation of achieving the element of surprise.
Planners also discussed who should lead France after the invasion. General Eisenhower had informed Charles de Gaulle that the French Resistance forces would assist in the liberation of Paris, but President Roosevelt was not sure he trusted de Gaulle and refused to recognize him as the official French leader.
By the spring of 1944, more than 1.5 million American soldiers, 12,000 airplanes, and 5 million tons (4.6 million t) of equipment had been sent to England. Only setting the invasion date and giving the command to go remained. The invasion had to begin at night to hide the ships crossing the English Channel. The ships had to arrive at low tide so that they could see the beach obstacles. The low tide had to come at dawn so that gunners bombarding the coast could see their targets. Paratroopers, who would be dropped behind enemy lines, needed a moonlit night to see where to land. Perhaps most important of all was good weather. A storm would ground the airplanes, and high waves would swamp landing craft.
Given all these requirements, there were only a few days each month to begin the invasion. The first opportunity was from June 5 to 7, 1944. Eisenhower’s planning staff referred to the day any operation began by the letter D. The invasion date, therefore, came to be known as D-Day. Heavy cloud cover, strong winds, and high waves made June 5 impossible.
The weather was forecast to improve briefly a day later. The Channel would still be rough, but the landing ships and aircraft

The Longest Day
Nearly 7,000 ships carrying more than 100,000 soldiers headed for Normandy’s coast. At the same time, 23,000 paratroopers were dropped inland, east and west of the beaches. Allied fighter-bombers raced up and down the coast, hitting bridges, bunkers, and radar sites. At dawn, Allied warships began a tremendous barrage. Thousands of shells rained down o the beaches, code-named “Utah,” “Omaha,” “Gold,” “Sword,” and “Juno.”
The American landing at Utah Beach went well. The German defenses were weak, and in less than three hours, the troops had captured the bead and moved inland, suffering fewer than 200 casualties. On the eastern flank, the British and Canadian landings also went well. By the end of the day, British and Canadian forces were several miles inland.
Omaha Beach, however, was a different story. Surrounded at both ends by cliffs that rose wall-like from the sea, Omaha Beach was only foui miles long. The entire beach overlooked a 150-foot high bluff, and there were only five ravines leading from the beach to the top of the bluff. The Germans had made full use of the geographic advantage the high bluff gave them. They dug trenches and built concrete bunkers for machine guns at the top of the cliffs and positioned them to guard the ravines leading to the beach. Under intense German fire, the American assault almost disintegrated.
General Omar Bradley, commander of the American forces landing at Omaha and Utah, began making plans to evacuate. Slowly, however, the American troops began to knock out the German defenses. More landing craft arrived, ramming their way through the obstacles to get to the bead Nearly 2,500 Americans were either killed or wounded on Omaha, but by early afternoon, Bradley received this message: “Troops formerly pinned down on beaches . . . [are] advancing up heights behind beaches.” By the end of the day, nearly 35,000 American troops had landed at Omaha, and another 23,000 had landed at Utah. More than 75,000 British and Canadi; troops were on shore as well. The invasion had succeeded.

The Third Reich Collapses
guiding question Why W675 the Battle of the Bulge so important to the Allied forces?
Although D-Day had been a success, it was only the beginning. Surrounding many fields in Normandy were hedgerows—dirt walls, several feet thick, covered in shrubbery—built to fence in cattle and crops. They also enabled the Germans to fiercely defend their positions. The battle of the hedgerows ended on July 25, 1944, when 2,500 U.S. bombers blew a hole in the German lines, enabling U.S. tanks to race through the gap.
As the Allies broke out of Normandy, the French Resistance— French civilians who had secretly organized to resist the German occupation—staged a rebellion in Paris. When the Allies liberated Paris on August 25, the streets were filled with French citizens celebrating their victory.
The Battle of the Bulge
As the Allies advanced toward the German border, Hitler decided to stage one last desperate offensive. His goal was to cut off Allied supplies coming through the port of Antwerp, Belgium. The attack began just before dawn on December 16, 1944. Six inches (15 cm) of snow covered the ground, and the weather was bitterly cold. Moving rapidly, the Germans caught the American defenders by surprise. As the German troops raced west, their lines bulged outward, and the attack became known as the Battle of the Bulge.
Eisenhower ordered General Patton to the rescue. Three days later, faster than anyone expected in the midst of a snowstorm, Patton’s troops slammed into the German lines. As the weather cleared, Allied aircraft began hitting German fuel depots.

On Christmas Eve, out of fuel and weakened by heavy losses, the German troops driving toward Antwerp were forced to halt. Two days later, Pattons troops broke through to the German line. Fighting continued for three weeks, but the United States had won the Battle of the Bulge. On January 8 the Germans began to withdraw, having suffered more than 100,000 casualties. They had very few resources left to prevent the Allies from entering Germany.

Truman was forced to make some of the most difficult decisions ofthe war
during his first six months in office.
The Battle of Iwo Jima
On November 24, 1944, bombs fell on Tokyo. Above the city flew 80 B-29 Superfortress bombers that had traveled more than 1,500 miles (2,414 km) from new American bases in the Mariana Islands. Many of their bombs missed the targets. By the time the B-29s reached Japan, they did not have enough fuel left to fix their navigational errors or to adjust for high winds. The pilots needed an island closer to Japan so the B-29s could refuel. American military planners chose Iwo Jima.
Iwo Jima was perfectly located, roughly halfway between the Marianas and Japan, but its geography was formidable. It had a dormant volcano at its southern tip and rugged terrain with rocky cliffs, jagged ravines, and dozens ol caves. Volcanic ash covered the ground. Even worse, the Japanese had built a vast network of concrete bunkers connected by miles of tunnels.
On February 19, 1945, some 60,000 marines landed on Iwo Jima. As the troops leaped from the amphtracs, they sank up to their ankles in the soft ash and were pounded by Japanese artillery. The marines crawled inland, attacking the Japanese bunkers with flamethrowers and explosives. More than 6,800 marines were killed capturing the island. Admiral Nimitz later wrote that, on Iwo Jima, “uncommon valor was a common virtue.”

Firebombing Japan
While American engineers prepared airfields on Iwo Jima, General Curtis LeMay, commander of the B-29s based in the Marianas, changed strategy. To help the B-29s hit their targets, he ordered them to drop bombs filled with napalm—a type of
jellied gasoline. The bombs would not only explode but would also start fires. Even if the B-29s missed their targets, the fires they started would spread to the intended targets.
The use of firebombs was very controversial because the fires would also kill civilians; however, LeMay could think of no other way to destroy Japans war production quickly. Loaded with firebombs,
B-29s attacked Tokyo on March 9,
1945. As strong winds fanned the flames, the firestorm grew so intense that it sucked the oxygen out of the air, asphyxiating thousands. As one survivor later recalled:
napalm a type of jellied gasoline
U.S.
Marines raise the American flag after the capture of Iwo Jima. More than 6,800 marines were killed before the island was captured. CRITICALTHINKING
Determining Cause and Effect How might the Battle of Iwo Jima have been a factor in President Truman's decision to drop the atomic bomb?
PRIMARY SOURCE
« The fires were incredible... with flames leaping hundreds of feet into the air.... With every passini moment the air became more foul... the noise was a continuing crashing roar.... Fire-winds filled wi burning particles rushed up and down the streets. I watched people... running for their lives.... The flames raced after them like living things, striking them down.... Wherever I turned my eyes, I sawpe ... seeking air to breathe.^
—quoted in American Heritage New History of World
The firebombing of Tokyo killed more than 80,000 people and destro more than 250,000 buildings. By the end of June 1945, Japan’s six key industrial cities had been firebombed. By the end of the war, the B-29s h: firebombed 67 Japanese cities.
The Invasion of Okinawa
Despite the massive damage that firebombing caused, there were few signs ii the spring of 1945 that Japan was ready to quit. Many American officials believed the Japanese would not surrender until Japan had been invaded. To prepare for the invasion, the United States needed a base near Japan to stock supplies and build up troops. Iwo Jima was small and still too far away. Milit planners chose Okinawa—only 350 miles (563 km) from mainland Japan.
American troops landed on Okinawa on April 1, 1945. Instead of defending the beaches, the Japanese troops took up positions in the island’s rugged mountains. To dig the Japanese out of their caves and bunkers, the American troops had to fight their way up steep slopes agai constant machine gun and artillery fire. More than 12,000 American soldiers, sailors, and marines died during the fighting, but by June 22,1' Okinawa had finally been captured.
The Terms for Surrender
Shortly after the United States captured Okinawa, the Japanese empero Hirohito, urged his government to find a way to end the war. The biggt problem was the American demand for unconditional surrender. Many Japanese leaders were willing to surrender, but on one condition: Hirol had to stay in power.
American officials knew that the fate of Hirohito was the most impo issue for the Japanese. Most Americans, however, blamed the emperor ft war and wanted him removed from power. President Truman was reluct to go against public opinion. Furthermore, he knew the United States w: almost ready to test a new weapon that might force Japan to surrender without any conditions. The new weapon was the atomic bomb.
The Manhattan Project
In 1939 Leo Szilard, a Jewish physicist who had fled Nazi persecution, learned that German scientists had split the uranium atom. Szilard ha< been the first scientist to suggest that splitting the atom might release enormous energy. Worried that the Nazis were working on an atomic bomb, Szilard convinced the world’s best-known physicist, Albert Ein: to sign a letter Szilard had drafted and send it to President Roosevelt, letter, Einstein warned that by using uranium, “extremely powerful be of a new type may ... be constructed.”
Roosevelt responded by setting up a scientific committee to study issue. In 1941 the committee met with British scientists who were alrc working on an atomic bomb. The Americans then convinced Rooseve begin a program to build an atomic bomb.
384
The secret American program to build an atomic bomb was code-named the Manhattan Project and was headed by General Leslie R. Groves. The first breakthrough came in 1942, when Szilard and Enrico Fermi, another physicist, built the world’s first nuclear reactor at the University of Chicago. Groves then organized a team of engineers and scientists to build an atomic bomb at a secret laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
Physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer led the team. On July 16, 1945, they detonated the world’s first atomic bomb in New Mexico.
Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Even before the bomb was tested, American officials began debating how to use it. Admiral William Leahy, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, opposed using the bomb because it would kill civilians. He believed an economic blockade and conventional bombing would convince Japan to surrender. Secretary of War Henry Stimson wanted to warn the Japanese about the bomb and tell them their emperor could stay in power if they surrendered. Secretary of State James Byrnes, however, wanted to drop the bomb on Japan without any warning.
President Truman later wrote that he “regarded the bomb as a military weapon and never had any doubts that it should be used.” His advisers had warned him to expect massive casualties if the United States invaded Japan. Truman believed it was his duty as president to use every weapon available to save American lives.

People continue to debate whether President Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan was the best way to end World War II.
M
The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.... If Japan does not surrender, bombs will have to be dropped on her war industries and, unfortunately, thousands of civilian lives will be lost.... Having found the bomb we have used it. We have used it against those who attacked us without warning at Pearl Harbor, against those who have starved and beaten and executed American prisoners of war, against those who have abandoned all pretense of obeying international laws of warfare.
We have used it in order to shorten the agony of war, in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young Americans.”
S.
Truman, radio report to the American people, August 9,1945 Harry S. Truman President of the United States
«It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because ofthe effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons....
William Leahy Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
The lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening. My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians ofthe Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.”

America and World War II 385
The United States dropped an atomic bomb that destroyed the Japanese city of Hiroshima.
CRITICAL THINKING
Analyzing Primary Sources What details in the picture illustrate the effect of the atomic bomb? The Allies threatened Japan with “prompt and utter destruction” if t nation did not surrender, but the Japanese did not reply. Truman then ordered the military to drop the bomb. On August 6, 1945, a B-29 bomb named Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb, code-named “Little Boy,” 01 Hiroshima, an important industrial city.
The bomb destroyed about 63 percent of the city. Between 80,000 ar 120,000 people died instantly, and thousands more died later from burn and radiation sickness. Three days later, on August 9, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. Later that day, the United States dropped anothe atomic bomb, code-named “Fat Man,” on the city of Nagasaki, killing between 35,000 and 74,000 people. Faced with such massive destructioi and the shock of the Soviets joining the war, Hirohito ordered his government to surrender. On August 15, 1945—V-J Day—Japan surrendered. The long war was over.
Putting the Enemy on Trial
In August 1945, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union created the International Military Tribunal (IMT) to punish German an Japanese leaders for war crimes. The tribunal held trials in Nuremberg, Germany, where Hitler had staged Nazi Party rallies.
Twenty-two German leaders were prosecuted at the Nuremberg Tri< Three were acquitted, 7 were given prison sentences, and 12 were sentei to death. Trials of lower-ranking leaders continued until April 1949, lea to 24 more executions and 107 prison sentences.
Similar trials were held in Tokyo. The IMT for the Far East charged 25 Japanese leaders with war crimes. The Allies did not indict Hirohito fearing that any attempt to put the emperor on trial would lead to an uprising. Eighteen Japanese defendants were sentenced to prison. The i were sentenced to death by hanging.
386
The trials punished many of the people responsible for World War II and the Holocaust, but they were also part of the American plan for building a better world. As Robert Jackson, chief counsel for the United States at Nuremberg, said in his opening statement to the court: “The wrongs we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant and so devastating, that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored because it cannot survive their being repeated.”
World War II: A Turning Point
The years 1939-1945 were a major turning point in world history. By the end of World War II, large areas of the world’s great powers—Britain, France, Germany, Japan and the Soviet Union—lay devastated. Germany and Japan were occupied by foreign armies. Some 25 million people had been killed. Japans empire was gone and the European empires would never fully recover. Over the next three decades, nearly all of the subject peoples of the British, French, and Dutch empires would gain their independence. New countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East were born. The Middle Eastern conflict between the new nation of Israel and the Arab nations was itself a direct result of World War II.
The war also opened a new era in American history. The American economy was undamaged, and by the mid-1940s it was producing over 35 percent of the entire world’s gross domestic product. A vast American military force was deployed in Europe and Asia, and it also controlled the world’s first nuclear weapons. The United States had emerged as the world’s strongest economic and military power. It was in a position of such strength and dominance that a new term—superpower—was later coined to describe its relationship to the rest of the world.
Only one other country had the potential to rival the United States at the end of the war. The Soviet Union, although devastated from Germany’s invasion, had built its own enormous army and industrial capacity. Soviet troops were in control of Eastern Europe, and communist ideas posed the only real ideological challenge to American ideas of democracy, free enterprise, and limited government. Although World War II had put an end to Nazism, the struggle had left Europe divided, and the resulting tensions between former allies would soon lead to a new international conflict known as the Cold War.

Using Secondary
Sources
Why Learn This Skill?
Secondary sources are everywhere. Every history book is a secondary source, including this textbook. Any book, article, document, website, or other presentation of information that discusses or describes information that originates somewhere else is a secondary source. Primary sources are where scholars get information: primary sources include data, facts, documents, letters, quotes, interviews, original photos, art, speeches, transcripts and other materials that people create as part of their activities. Secondary sources are efforts by people to comment on primary sources and try to understand what they mean and what they are telling us about people's activities. Learning to use secondary sources will help you figure out whether those sources are presenting a complete and accurate picture of a topic or event and whether you can rely on the information they present.
Learning the Skill
When writing a secondary source, historians typically combine many primary sources and other secondary sources together to create the historical narrative. The goal of a secondary source is to analyze and interpret primary sources, then synthesize, or combine, them so that generalizations and evaluations about history are possible. Secondary sources are what stitch all the evidence together into a presentation of events that we call history.
The reason you analyze a secondary source is to figure out what an author's main ideas and argument is, and to determine whether you agree with it or not, and why.
Follow these steps:
1.	First, ask yourself what you are trying to accomplish with the secondary source.
Are you trying to acquire information? Or are you trying to analyze or answer historical questions?
2.	Who is the author? What are his or her credentials? Do they have training or a background that makes you think you trust their work?
3.	Who published the secondary source? Does that indicate any possible bias am special motive for the work that might make you suspicious of its conclusions:
4.	Look at the secondary source. Whenw it written? Examine its title and table o contents. What clues does it provide as the topic of the work and the approach author is taking.
5.	Does the secondary source have footm or endnotes where it cites the primary sources it uses to prove its ideas? Does have a bibliography listing all of the sources of evidence used to prepare the work?
6.	What kind of sources are being used? the secondary source using mostly otl secondary sources, or is it using many primary sources? This is important if want to use the secondary source to acquire information. You have to be si its information is reliable.
7.	If it is using primary sources, what kii are being used? Are they reliable? Dot the author generally rely on one partii kind of primary source to support his her conclusions? Are there any weaknesses or biases in the types of primary sources being used? Might tf author be led to the wrong conclusion relying on one type of source too muc
8.	Figure out the author's argument. Th: important if you are using the seconc source to analyze or answer historica questions. Look at the work's introdu and conclusion. What are the major questions or issues the author is tryii explain? Is the author trying to be objective, clearly separating facts froi opinions? Or is the author making a strong emotional argument with a v< clear opinion and all the facts seem t support that opinion?
388
8*
9. Think about the author's conclusions. Do they make sense to you? What kind of evidence could be used to disprove them? Did the author examine sources that challenge his ideas and explain how they fit into the work?
Practicing this Skill
Practice this skill with this text you are using. This text is a secondary source. Let's analyze your textbook.
1.	Can the textbook be used to acquire information? Can the textbook be used to analyze and answer historical questions? Explain.
2.	Who are the authors of this program? What are their credentials? What else have they written? Do you think they can be trusted to be professional?
3.	Who published your textbook? What is their purpose? Is there likely to be a bias in what they publish?
4.	Does the textbook use primary sources? What kinds?
5.	Does your textbook have one single argument or focus on only one major issue? Why or why not?
6.	Pick one chapter in your textbook and analyze it as a secondary source. Try to identify its main argument and how it analyzes and explains the historical questions of the time period the chapter covers.
Applying the Skill
! There has been much controversy over the years about the American decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan. Different historians have viewed the decision differently, and have come to different
i conclusions. Here are several secondary sources about the decision:
Gar Alperovitz, The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb (1995)
Herbert Feis, Japan Subdued (1961)
Gregg Herken, The Winning Weapon (1981)
Robert James, Maddox Weapons For Victory (1995)
Martin Sherwin, A World Destroyed (1975)
Look up two of these secondary sources and apply the skills you have learned for analyzing secondary sources. Then answer these historical questions:
1.	Acquiring Information What are the major opinions of historians concerning Truman’s decision?
2.	Analyzing Historical Questions Write a brief report on the kinds of evidence being used by historians analyzing the decision to drop the bomb. How might the sources used affect their interpretation?
3.	Answering Historical Questions
Based on what you have learned, why do you think President Truman dropped the atomic bomb on Japan? Do you agree with the decision?

Social Studies Skills
Read the two secondary sources below, and then answer the questions that follow.
Historian Gar Alperovitz argues that Truman had alternatives to the atomic bomb but chose to use the weapon to pressure Stalin, and force Japan's surrender before the Soviets could join the war.
Quite simply, it is not true that the atomic bomb was used because it was the only way to save the'hundreds of thousands' or 'millions' of lives as was subsequently claimed. The readily available options were to modify the surrender terms and/or await the shock of the Russian attack... even if one were to accept the most inflated estimates of lives saved by the atomic bomb, the fact remains that it was an act of violent destruction aimed at large concentrations of noncombatants.99
—from The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb
Historian Herbert Feis argues that Truman dropped the bomb to avoid an invasion of Japan.
Their thoughts about its employment were governed by one reason which was deemed imperative: that by using the bomb, the agony of war might be ended more quickly. The primary and sustaining aim from the start of the great exertion to make the bomb was military, and the impelling reason for the decision to use it was military—to end the war victoriously as soon as possible. ”

The Story Matters...
The destruction caused by the atomic bomb raised the stakes of military conflict. American concerns about the lack of freedom in countries controlled by the Soviet Union created a growing tension between the two nations. The United States and the Soviet Union would continue in a state of political conflict, military tension, and economic competition for almost 45 years. Conflict broke out in 1950 when Communist North Korea invaded South Korea, expanding the Cold War.

Place andTime: United States 1945-1960
Relations between the Soviet Union and the other Allies soured as the Soviets established Communist governments in Eastern Europe. President Truman authorized billions of dollars of American aid to devastated European nations as well as to the Allies former enemies, Germany and Japan. Americans grew fearful of the possibility of Communists infiltrating the U.S. government, while others feared an attack with nuclear weapons. By the early 1950s, Americans were looking for someone or something that would make them feel secure.

President Roosevelt believed that high tariffs—like the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1931—had helped cause the Great Depression, and his advisors were convinced that the best way to generate prosperity and economic growth after the war was to increase tl amount of trade between countries and to create institutions thi would keep the trade system stable.
In July 1944, Roosevelt organized a conference for the worlc nations except those that belonged to the Axis. The conference held at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire and established many international economic institutions that are still part of the wor economic system today.
The first organization set up at Bretton Woods was the World Bank. Its purpose was to help rebuild Europe after the war, and he! nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America develop their economic The World Bank still performs this role today, loaning money to h

nations with their economic development. The second institution set up was the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Its purpose was to help countries with trade deficits. A trade deficit is when a country imports more than it exports. Countries with trade deficits have more of their money flowing out to buy foreign goods than they have flowing in from other countries who are buying their goods. The IMF was to use its funds to prevent trade wars and to prevent each country’s money from changing too much in value. The IMF continues to perform this function today.
In addition to these two institutions, the nations set up a new currency system. The U.S. dollar became the world’s reserve currency. All nations set an exchange rate between their currency and the dollar. The dollar in turn was put on a gold standard. One ounce of gold would equal 35 U.S. dollars, and the United States pledged to always keep enough gold in reserve so that anyone with dollars could convert them into gold on demand.
One ofthe positives of the Bretton Woods system was that it would prevent nations from using inflation to escape their debts. Everyone remembered that Germany had used inflation to make its currency almost worthless after World War I as a way to avoid paying its reparations debts. The Bretton Woods system would keep the world’s currencies stable and help keep the world at peace. The weakness of the system was that a gold standard limited the use of monetary policy to fight inflation or get out of a recession. By setting exchange rates, it also meant trade between nations could become unbalanced if the exchange rate did not accurately reflect the market value of goods being traded across borders.

Creating the United Nations
Roosevelt not only wanted to create a new global economic system, he also wanted a new political system to help prevent another world war. He believed one cause of World War II had been the American decision to stay out of the League of Nations after World War I. He wanted the United States and its allies to create a new international organization that would take an active role in preserving the peace.
In 1944, at the Dumbarton Oaks estate in Washington, D.C., delegates from 39 countries met to discuss the new organization, which was to be called the United Nations (UN). The delegates at the conference agreed that the UN would have a General Assembly, in which every member nation in the world would have one vote. The UN would also have a Security Council with 11 members. Five countries would be permanent members of the Security Council: Britain, France, China, the Soviet Union, and the United States. These five permanent members would each have veto power.
The advantage ofthe United Nations was that it put all ofthe great powers that had helped to defeat the Axis in the Security Council. This would force them to consult with each other and work together whenever the United Nations took action. The weakness ofthe United Nations was that the veto allowed any one member ofthe Security Council to stop the UN from taking action.
On April 25, 1945, representatives from 50 countries came to San Francisco to officially organize the United Nations and design its charter. The General Assembly was given the power to vote on resolutions and to choose the nonpermanent members of the Security Council. The Security Council was responsible for international peace and security. It could ask its members to use military force to uphold a UN resolution.

Left to right: Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin. Leaders of the "Big Three" Allied nations met at the Yalta Conference to determine how to organize postwar Europe.
CRITICAL THINKING
Predicting Consequences How might allowing Stalin to influence the political landscape of Eastern Europe affect that region's later foreign policy? The Yalta Conference
In February 1945, with the war in Europe nearly over, Roosevelt, Church and Stalin met at Yalta—a Soviet resort on the Black Sea—to plan the postwar world. Several agreements reached at Yalta later played an important role in causing the Cold War.
A key issue discussed at Yalta was Poland. Shortly after the German; had invaded Poland in 1939, the Polish government fled to Britain. In E however, Soviet troops drove back the Germans and entered Poland. As they liberated Poland from German control, the Soviets encouraged Po Communists to set up a new government. As a result, two governments claimed the right to govern Poland: one Communist and one non-Communis President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill both argued that the Poles should be free to choose their own government.
Stalin, however, quickly pointed out that every time invaders had enter Russia from the west, they had come through Poland. Eventually, the three leaders compromised. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to recognize the Poli government set up by the Soviets. Stalin agreed it would include members < prewar Polish government, and free elections would be held as soon as pos The Declaration of Liberated Europe
After reaching a compromise on Poland, the three leaders agreed to issue the Declaration of Liberated Europe. The declaration echoed the Atlantic Charte asserting the right of all people to choose the form of government under wi they will live. The Allies promised that the people of Europe would be allow
create democratic institutions of their own
choice” and to create temporary governmen that represented “all democratic elements.” pledged “the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments resp( to the will of the people.”
Dividing Germany
The conference then focused on Germany. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agreed to di Germany into four zones. Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France
each control one zone. The same four countries would also divide the German capita city of Berlin into four zones, even though it was in the Soviet zone.
Although pleased with the decision to divide Germany, Stalin also demanded that Germany pay heavy reparations for the war damages it had caused. An agreement was reached that Germany could pay war reparations with trade goods and products, half of which would go to the Soviet Union. The Allies would remove industrial machinery, railroad cars, and other equipment from Germany as reparations. Later arguments about reparations greatly increased tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Rising Tensions
The Yalta decisions shaped the expectations of the United States. Two weeks after Yalta, the Soviets pressured the king of Romania into appointing a Communist government. The United States accused the Soviets of violating the Declaration of Liberated Europe. Soon afterward, the Soviets refused to allow more than three non-Communist Poles to serve in the 18-member Polish government. There was also no indication that they intended to hold free elections in Poland as promised. On April 1, President Roosevelt informed the Soviets that their actions in Poland were not acceptable.
Yalta marked a turning point in Soviet-American relations. President Roosevelt had hoped that an Allied victory and the creation of the United Nations would lead to a more peaceful world. Instead, as the war came to an end, the United States and the Soviet Union became increasingly hostile toward each other. The Cold War, an era of confrontation and competition between the nations, lasted from about 1946 to about 1990.
Soviet Concerns
As the war ended, Soviet leaders became concerned about security. They wanted to keep Germany weak and make sure that the countries between Germany and the Soviet Union were under Soviet control. Soviet leaders also believed that communism was a superior economic system that would eventually replace capitalism. They believed that the Soviet Union should encourage communism in other nations. They accepted Lenin’s theory that capitalist countries would eventually try to destroy communism. This made them suspicious of capitalist nations.
American Economic Issues
While Soviet leaders focused on securing their borders, American leaders focused on economic problems. They believed that the Great Depression became so severe because nations reduced trade. They also believed that when nations stop trading, they are forced into war to get resources. By 1945, Roosevelt and his advisers were convinced that economic growth through world trade was the key to peace. They also thought that the free enterprise system, with private property rights and limited government intervention in the economy, was the best route to prosperity.
UN
Responses to the War In response to the atrocities of World War II, the United Nations held a General Assembly in December 1946. They passed a resolution that made genocide punishable internationally. The text of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide became the first UN human rights treaty. Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired a UN Commission on Human Rights in 1948. The international commission drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which promoted the inherent dignity of every human being and was a commitment to end discrimination.

Truman Takes Control
guiding question Why did the Potsdam Conference further increase tensions between the United St and the Soviet Union?
Eleven days after confronting the Soviets on Poland, President Roosevelt died Harry S. Truman became president. Truman was strongly anti-Communist. H believed World War II had begun because Britain had tried to appease Hitler, did not intend to make that mistake with Stalin. “We must stand up to the Russians,” he told Secretary of State Edward Stettinius the day he took office.
Ten days later, Truman did exactly that at a meeting with Soviet foreign minister Molotov. Truman immediately brought up Poland and demanded th Stalin hold free elections as he had promised at Yalta. Molotov took the unexpectedly strong message back to Stalin. The meeting marked an importa shift in Soviet-American relations and set the stage for further confrontations The Potsdam Conference
In July 1945, with the war against Japan still raging, Truman finally met Stalin at Potsdam, near Berlin. Both men had come to Potsdam to work a deal on Germany. Truman was now convinced that industry was criti to Germany s survival. Unless its economy was allowed to revive, the i of Europe would never recover, and the German people might turn to communism out of desperation.
Stalin and his advisers were convinced they needed reparations froi Germany. The war had devastated the Soviet economy. Soviet troops hs begun stripping their zone in Germany of its machinery and equipmcn use back home, but Stalin wanted Germany to pay much more.
400
• • Atjhe c°nference, Truman took a firm stand against heavy reparations. He insisted that Germany s industry had to be allowed to recover. Truman suggested the Soviets take reparations from their zone, while the Allies allowed in ustry to revive in the other zones. Stalin opposed this idea since the Soviet zone was mostly agricultural. To get the Soviets to accept the agreement,
Truman offered Stalin a small amount of industrial equipment from the other zones, but required the Soviets to pay for part of it with food shipments. He also offered to accept the new German-Polish border the Soviets had established.
Stalin did not like the proposal. At Potsdam, Truman learned of the successful U.S. atomic bomb tests. He hinted to Stalin that the United States had a new, powerful weapon. Stalin suspected Truman of trying to bully him. He thought the Americans wanted to limit reparations to keep the Soviets weak. Despite his suspicions, Stalin had to accept the terms. American and British troops controlled Germany’s industrial heartland, and there was no way for the Soviets to get reparations without cooperating.
The Potsdam Conference marked yet another increase in tensions.
The Iron Curtain Descends
Although Truman had won the argument over reparations, he had less success on other issues at Potsdam. The Soviets refused to make stronger commitments to uphold the Declaration of Liberated Europe.
The presence of the Soviet army in Eastern Europe ensured that pro-Soviet Communist governments would eventually be established in the nations of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia.
The Communist countries of Eastern Europe came to be called satellite nations because they were controlled by the Soviets, as satellites are tied by gravity to the planets they orbit. Although not under direct Soviet control, these nations had to remain Communist and friendly to the Soviet Union. They also had to follow policies that the Soviets approved.
After watching the Communist takeover in Eastern Europe, the former British prime minister Winston Churchill coined a phrase to describe what had happened. On March 5, 1946, in a speech delivered in Fulton, Missouri, Churchill referred to an “iron curtain” falling across Eastern Europe. The press picked up the term, and for the next 43 years, it described the Communist nations of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. With the Iron Curtain separating Eastern Europe from the West, the World War II era had come to an end. The Cold War was about to begin.

Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence, but to a very high and, in some cases, increasing measure of control from Moscow.

officials continued to believe cooperation with the Soviets was possible. In late 1945 the foreign ministers of the former Allies mf first in London, then in Moscow, to discuss the future of Europe and Asia. Although both British and American officials pushed fo free elections in Eastern Europe, the Soviets refused to budge. The Long Telegram
Increasingly exasperated by the Soviets’ refusal to cooperate, officials at the U.S. State Department asked the American Embass in Moscow to explain Soviet behavior. On February 22, 1946, diplomat George Kennan responded with what became known as the Long Telegram—a message, thousands of words long, explaining his views of the Soviets. According to Kennan, the Soviets’ view of the world came from a traditional “Russian sens of insecurity” and fear of the West, intensified by the communi ideas of Lenin and Stalin. Because Communists believed they we in a historical struggle against capitalism, Kennan argued, it was impossible to reach any permanent settlement with them.
Kennan proposed what became basic American policy throughout the Cold War: “a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containmei of Russian expansive tendencies.” In Kennan’s opinion, the Soviet system had major economic and political weaknesses. If the Unitec States could keep the Soviets from expanding their power, it would only be a matter of time before their system would fall apart, beating communism without going to war.

Crisis in Iran
While Trumans administration discussed Kennan’s ideas, a series of crises erupte uring the spring and summer of 1946. These crises seemed to prove that Kennan was right about the Soviets. The first crisis began in Iran.
During World War II, the United States had troops in southern Iran while Soviet troops held northern Iran to secure a supply line from the Persian Gulf. After the war, instead of withdrawing as promised, the Soviet troops remained in northern Iran. Stalin then began demanding access to Iran’s oil supplies. To increase the pressure, Soviet troops helped local Communists in northern Iran establish a separate government.
American officials saw these actions as a Soviet push into the Middle East. The secretary of state sent Stalin a strong message demanding that Soviet forces withdraw. At the same time, the battleship USS Missouri sailed into the eastern Mediterranean. The pressure seemed to work. Soviet forces withdrew, having been promised a joint Soviet-Iranian oil company, although the Iranian parliament later rejected the plan.
The Truman Doctrine
Frustrated in Iran, Stalin turned northwest to Turkey. There, the straits of the Dardanelles were a vital route from Soviet ports on the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. For centuries Russia had wanted to control this strategic route.
In August 1946, Stalin demanded joint control of the Dardanelles with Turkey.
Presidential adviser Dean Acheson saw this move as part of a Soviet plan to control the Middle East. He advised Truman to make a show of force. The president ordered the new aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt to join the Missouri in protecting Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean.
Meanwhile, Britain tried to help Greece. In August 1946, Greek Communists launched a guerrilla war against the Greek government.
British troops helped fight the guerrillas, but in February 1947, Britain informed the United States that it could no longer afford to help Greece due to Britain’s weakened postwar economy.
Shortly after, Truman went before Congress to ask for $400 million to fight Communist aggression in Greece and Turkey. His speech outlined a policy that became known as the Truman Doctrine. Its goal was to aid those who worked to resist being controlled by others. In the long run, it pledged the United States to fight the spread of communism worldwide.

The peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had totalitarian regimes forced upon them against their will. The Government of the United States has made frequent protests against coercion and intimidation, in violation of the Yalta agreement in Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one.... I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.

Recovery Program, or Marshall Plan, which would give European nations American aid to rebuild their economies. Truman saw both the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine as essential for containment. Marshall offered help to all nations planning a recovery program.
Although the Marshall Plan was offered to the Soviet Union and its satellite nations, the Soviets rejected it and developed their own economic program. This action further separated Europe into competing regions. Th Marshall Plan pumped billions of dollars in supplies, machinery, and food into Western Europe. The regions recovery weakened the appeal of communism and opened new markets for trade.
In his 1949 Inaugural Address, Truman proposed assistance for underdeveloped countries outside the war zone. The Point Four Program aimed to provide them with “scientific advances and industrial progress” for their improvement and growth. The Department of State administered the program until its merger with other foreign aid programs in 1953.

The Berlin Airlift
Truman and his advisers believed Western Europe’s prosperity depended on Germany’s recovery. The Soviets, however, still wanted Germany to pay reparations. This dispute brought the nations to the brink of war. By early 1948, American officials had concluded that the Soviets were trying to undermine Germany’s economy. In response, the United States, Britain, an France merged their German zones and allowed the Germans to have theii own government, creating the Federal Republic of Germany, which becam known as West Germany. They also agreed to merge their zones in Berlin and make West Berlin part of West Germany. The Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. West Germany was most! independent but not allowed to have a military.
The creation of West Germany convinced the Soviets they would neve] get the reparations they wanted. In June 1948, Soviet troops blockaded We Berlin hoping to force the United States to reconsider its decision or abandon West Berlin. Truman sent bombers capable of carrying atomic weapons to bases in Britain. Hoping to avoid war with the Soviets, he ordered the air force to fly supplies into Berlin rather than troops.
The Berlin Airlift began in June 1948 and continued through the sprir of 1949, bringing in more than two million tons of supplies to the city. Sta. finally lifted the blockade on May 12, 1949. The airlift symbolized Americ determination to contain communism and not give in to Soviet demands.
404
The Creation of NATO
The Berlin blockade convinced many Americans that the Soviets were bent on conquest. The public began to support a military alliance with Western Europe. By April 1949, an agreement had been made to form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)—a mutual defense alliance.
NATO initially included 12 countries: the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Portugal, the Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg, and Iceland. NATO members agreed to come to the aid of any member who was attacked. For the first time, the United States had committed itself to maintaining peace in Europe. Six years later, NATO allowed West Germany to rearm and join its organization. This decision alarmed Soviet leaders. They responded by organizing a military alliance in Eastern Europe known as the Warsaw Pact.

Developments in Asia and the Korean War
guiding question Why was the Korean War a major turning point in the Cold War?
The Cold War eventually spread beyond Europe. Conflicts also emerged in Asia, where events in China and Korea brought about a new attitude toward Japan and sent American troops back into battle in Asia less than five years after World War II had ended.

NATO was formed as an alliance to defend against an outside attack.
In response, the Soviet Union created its own alliance known as the Warsaw Pact.
The Chinese Revolution
In China, Communist forces led by Mao Zedong had been struggling against the Nationalist government led by Chiang Kai-shek since the late 1920s. During World War II, the two sides suspended their war to resist Japanese occupation. With the end of World War II, however, civil war broke out again. Although Mao and the Communist forces made great gains, neither side could win nor agree to a compromise.

CRITICALTHINKING
Analyzing What geographical feature forms the border between China and North Korea? To prevent a Communist revolution in Asia, the United States sent the Nationalist government $2 billion in aid beginning in the mid-1940s. The Nationalists, however, squandered this advantage through poor military planning and corruption. By 1949 the Communists had captured the Chinese capital of Beijing, while support for the Nationalists declined.
In August 1949, the U.S. State Department discontinued aid to the Chinese Nationalists. The defeated Nationalists then fled to the small island of Formosa (now called Taiwan). The victorious Communists established the Peoples Republic of China in October 1949.
China’s fall to communism shocked Americans. To make matters worse, in September 1949 the Soviet Union announced that it had successfully tested its first atomic weapon. Then, early in 1950, the People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union signed a treaty of friendship and alliance. Many Western leaders feared that China and the Soviet Union would support communis revolutions in other nations.
The United States kept formal diplomatic relations with only
the Nationalist Chinese in Taiwan. It used its veto power in the UN Securi Council to keep representatives of the new Communist People’s Republic of China out of the UN, allowing the Nationalists to retain their seat.
New Policies in Japan
The Chinese revolution brought about a significant change in American policy toward Japan. At the end of World War II, General Douglas MacArthur had taken charge of occupied Japan. His mission was to introduce democracy and keep Japan from threatening war again. Once the United States lost China as its chief ally in Asia, it adopted policies to encourage the rapid recovery of Japan’s industrial economy. Just as the United States viewed West Germany as the key to defending all of Europe against communism, it saw Japan as the key to defending Asia.
The Korean War
At the end of World War II, American and Soviet forces entered Korea to disarm the Japanese troops stationed there. The Allies divided Korea at tl 38th parallel of latitude. Soviet troops controlled the north, while Americ troops controlled the south.
As the Cold War began, talks to reunify Korea broke down. A Communist Korean government was organized in the north, while an American-backed government controlled the south. Both governments claimed authority over Korea, and border clashes were common. The Soviets provided military aid to the North Koreans, who quickly built an army. On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops invaded the south, driving back the poorly equipped South Korean forces.
Truman saw the Communist invasion of South Korea as a test of the containment policy and ordered American naval and air power into actit He then called on the United Nations to act. Because the Soviet Union w boycotting the Security Council over its China policy, Truman succeeds With the pledge of UN troops, he ordered General MacArthur to send American troops from Japan to Korea.
The American and South Korean troops were driven back into a sms pocket of territory near the port of Pusan. Inside the “Pusan perimeter, troops stubbornly resisted the North Koreans, buying time for MacArth to organize reinforcements.

CRITICAL THINKING
Identifying Central Ideas What was the objective of the United States during the Korean War? On September 15, 1950, MacArthur ordered a daring invasion behind enemy lines at the port of Inchon. The Inchon landing took the North Koreans by surprise. Within weeks they were in full retreat back across the 38th parallel. Truman then gave the order to pursue the North Koreans beyond the 38th parallel.
MacArthur pushed the North Koreans north to the Yalu River, the border with China.
China Enters the War The Communist Peoples Republic of China saw the advancing UN troops as a threat and warned them to halt their advance. When warnings were ignored, Chinese forces crossed the Yalu River in November. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops flooded across the border, driving the UN forces back across the 38th parallel.
As his troops fell back, an angry MacArthur demanded approval to
expand the war against China. He asked for a blockade of Chinese ports, the use of Chiang Kai-sheks Nationalist forces, and the bombing of Chinese cities with atomic weapons.
Truman Fires MacArthur President Truman refused MacArthur’s demands because he did not want to expand the war into China or to use the atomic bomb. MacArthur persisted, publicly criticizing the president and arguing that it was a mistake to keep the war limited. “There is no substitute for victory,” MacArthur insisted, by which he meant that if the United States was going to go to war, it should use all of its power to win.
A limited war was a form of appeasement, he argued, and appeasement “begets new and bloodier war.”
Determined to maintain control of policy and show that he commanded the military, an exasperated Truman fired MacArthur for insubordination in April 1951. Later, in private conversation, Truman explained: “I was sorry to have to reach a parting of the way with the big man in Asia, but he asked for it and I had to give it to him.”
MacArthur, who remained popular despite being fired, returned home to parades and a hero’s welcome. Many Americans criticized the president. Congress and military leaders, however, supported his decision and his Korean strategy. American policy in Asia remained committed to limited war—a war fought to achieve a limited objective, such as containing communism. Truman later explained his position:
limited war a war fought with limited commitment of resources to achieve a limited objective, such as containing communism

Eisenhower quietly hinted to the Chinese that the United States might w a nuclear attack in Korea. The threat seemed to work. In July 1953, negotiate signed an armistice. The battle line between the two sides in Korea, which w very near the prewar boundary, became the border between North Korea an South Korea. A “demilitarized zone” (DMZ) separated them. American troo are still based in Korea, helping to defend South Korea’s border. There has never been a peace treaty to end the war. More than 33,600 American soldie died in action, and over 20,600 died in accidents or from disease.
Changes in Policy The Korean War marked a turning point in the Cold War. Until 1950, the United States had preferred to use political pressure ar economic aid to contain communism. After the Korean War began, the United States embarked on a major military buildup. The war also helped expand the Cold War to Asia. Before 1950, American efforts to contain communism focused on Europe. With the Korean War, the nation became more militarily involved in Asia. By 1954, the United States had signed defense agreements with Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The United State also formed the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in 1954. Aid also began flowing to French forces fighting Communists in Vietnam.

Using A Decision-
Making Process
Why Learn This Skill?
Life is full of choices. It seems that almost all the time we are being asked to make decisions. While some decisions, such as what color of socks to wear, are not that important, others, such as whether or not to go to university, or what job to take can affect the rest of your life. History is also full of choices. Much of the work of historians is looking at the decisions people have made and trying to figure out why they made them and whether they had other choices. Learning a good decision-making process will help you make better choices for yourself, and help you understand historical choices made by others.
Learning the Skill
Follow these five steps to help you through the process of making good decisions.
1.	Identify the problem. What are you being asked to choose?
2.	Gather information about the problem, and clearly identify your options and the various alternatives that are possible.
3.	Try to predict the consequences for each option. Identify both positive and negative things that might happen for each option. Consider both short-term and long-term consequences. Sometimes short-term hardships can lead to long-term benefits that make the difficulties getting there worthwhile.
4.	Evaluate the consequences. This is the hardest step. How important are each of the positive and negative consequences, sometimes referred to as the costs and benefits, when weighed against each other?
5.	Make your decision. Know that once you make a decision and act on it, it causes new things to happen, possibly things you did not predict. Be prepared to stick to your decision if it is leading to something you want, even if it is hard to follow through. But if the decision leads to negative consequences you did not expect,
be prepared to start a new decisionmaking process.
Practicing the Skill
Decisions throughout history have affected the outcome of events and created the world we live in today. Each of the following events took place as a result of a decision made by a person or a group of people during the Cold War. Identify the alternatives and describe their consequences.
1.	The United States begins the Berlin airlift after Stalin cuts off surface transportation bringing supplies from the West.
2.	The Marshall Plan for rebuilding war-torn Western Europe is approved.
3.	President Truman relieves General Douglas MacArthur of his command for insubordination.
Applying the Skill
Making Decisions Do research at the library or online at a news website and identify a current issue facing the United States.
Identify the issue, then review the facts and what you already know about the issue. Identify various alternatives and determine the consequences for each. Use this information to evaluate both positive and negative consequences. Make a sound decision about which alternative would be best for you, and write a paragraph defending your decision.

New Red Scare guiding question How did the post-World War II Red Scare compare and contrast with tht
one that followed World War I?
During the 1950s, rumors and accusations spawned fears that Communists were trying to take over the world. The Red Scare beg; in September 1945, when a clerk named Igor Gouzenko walked out of the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa, Canada, and defected. Gouzenko carried documents showing a Soviet effort to infiltrate government agencies in Canada and the United States, with the specific goal of obtaining information about the atomic bomb. The case stunned Americans. It implied that spies had infiltrated the American government. Soon the search for spies escalated into a general fear of Communist subversion, or effort to weaken a society and overthrow its government.
TheTruman Loyalty Review Program
In early 1947, President Truman established a loyalty review progr to screen all federal employees. Trumans action seemed to confirm suspicions that Communists had infiltrated the government and so added to fears that communism was sweeping the nation. Between 1947 and 1951, more than six million federal employees were screen for loyalty—a term difficult to define. A person might become a suspect for reading certain books, belonging to various groups, traveling overseas, or seeing certain foreign films. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) scrutinized some 14,000 people. Aboi 2,000 quit their jobs, many under pressure. Another 212 were fire< for questionable loyalty,” despite a lack of actual evidence.

HUAC and Anti-Communist Investigations
FBI director J. Edgar Hoover remained unsatisfied. In 1947 he went before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Formed in 1938 to investigate subversive activities in the United States, HUAC had been a minor committee before Hoover s involvement. He urged HUAC to hold public hearings on Communist subversion to expose not just Communists but also “Communist sympathizers” and “fellow travelers.” Under Hoover s leadership, the FBI sent agents to infiltrate groups suspected of subversion and wiretapped thousands of telephones.
Hollywood on Trial One of HUAC s first hearings in 1947 focused on the film industry as a cultural force that Communists might manipulate to spread their ideas and influence. Future American president Ronald Reagan was head of the Screen Actors Guild at the time and, when called before HUAC, he testified that there were Communists in Hollywood. During the hearings, ten screenwriters, known as the “Hollywood Ten,” used their Fifth Amendment right to protect themselves from self-incrimination and refused to testify. The incident led producers to blacklist, or agree not to hire, anyone who was believed to be a Communist or who refused to cooperate with the committee.
The blacklist created an atmosphere of distrust and fear.
Alger Hiss In 1948 Whittaker Chambers, a magazine editor and former Communist Party member, told HUAC that several government officials were also former Communists or spies. One official Chambers named was Alger Hiss, a diplomat who had served in Roosevelt’s administration, attended the Yalta Conference, and helped organize the United Nations.
Hiss sued Chambers for libel, but Chambers testified that, in 1937 and 1938, Hiss had given him secret State Department documents. Hiss denied being either a spy or a member of the Communist Party, and he also denied ever having known Chambers.
The committee was ready to drop the investigation until California representative Richard Nixon convinced his colleagues to continue the hearings to determine who had lied. Chambers produced copies of secret documents, along with microfilm that he had hidden in a hollow pumpkin. These “pumpkin papers,” Chambers claimed, proved Hiss was lying.
A jury agreed and convicted Hiss of perjury, or lying under oath.
The Rosen bergs Another spy case centered on accusations that American Communists had sold secrets about the atomic bomb to the Soviets to help them produce a bomb in 1949. In 1950 the hunt for spies led the FBI to arrest Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a New York couple who were members of the Communist Party. The government charged them with spying for the Soviets.
The Rosenbergs denied the charges but were condemned to death for espionage. Many people believed that they were simply victims caught in the wave of anti-Communist frenzy. Appeals and pleas for clemency failed, however, and the Rosenbergs were executed in June 1953.
Project Venona In 1946 American and British cryptographers, working for a project code-named “Venona,” cracked the Soviet Unions spy code, enabling them to read approximately 3,000 messages between Moscow and the United States collected during the Cold War. These messages confirmed extensive Soviet spying and ongoing efforts to steal nuclear secrets. The government did not reveal Project Venonas existence until 1995. The Venona documents provided strong evidence that the Rosenbergs were indeed guilty.

Joseph McCarthy (1908-1957)
When Wisconsin politician Joseph McCarthy first ran for Senate in 1946, he claimed his opponent was "communistically inclined." His later accusations of Communist subversion made him a national figure. Between 1950 and 1954, McCarthy made headlines for his investigations of government departments and figures, despite his inability to build a solid case against anyone. His often wild accusations became the hallmark ofMcCarthyism.
The Red Scare Spreads
Many state and local governments, universities, businesses, unions, churches, and private groups also began efforts to find Communists. The University of California required its faculty to take loyalty oaths and fired 157 who refused. Many Catholic groups became anti-Communist and urged members to identify Communists within the Church. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 required union leaders to take oaths saying that they were not Communists. Many union leaders did not object. Instead, they launched efforts to purge their own organizations, eventually expelling 11 unions that refused to remove Communist leaders.

guidingquestion Why did many Americans believe Senator McCarthy's accusations?
In 1949 the Red Scare intensified as the Soviet Union successfully tested an atomic bomb, and China fell to communism. To many Americans, these events seemed to prove that the United States was losing the Cold War.
In February 1950, little-known senator Joseph R. McCarthy gave a speech to a Republican women’s group in West Virginia. Halfway through his speech, McCarthy made a surprising statement when he claimed:

The Associated Press sent the statement nationwide. Reporters at an airport asked McCarthy to see his list. McCarthy replied that he would be happy to show it to them, but unfortunately, it was in his bag on the plane. In fact, the list never appeared. McCarthy, however, continued making charges.
McCarthy proclaimed that Communists were a danger at home and abroad. He distributed a booklet accusing Democratic Party leaders of corruption and of protecting Communists. McCarthy often targeted Secretary of State Dean Acheson, calling him incompetent and a tool of Stalin. He also accused George C. Marshall, former army chief of staff and secretary of state, of disloyalty. The prevailing anxiety about communism made many Americans willing to accept McCarthy’s claims.
The McCarran Act
In 1950, with McCarthy and others arousing fears of Communist spies, Congress passed the Internal Security Act, also called the McCarran Act. The act made it illegal to attempt to establish a totalitarian government ir the United States, and required all Communist-related organizations to publish their records and register with the United States attorney general. Communists could not have passports and, in cases of a national emergency, could be arrested and detained. Unwilling to punish people fi their opinions, Truman vetoed the bill, but Congress easily overrode his veto in 1950. Later Supreme Court cases limited the act’s scope.
412
McCarthy's Rise and Fall
In 1953 McCarthy became chairman of the Senate subcommittee on investigations, which forced government officials to testify about alleged Communist influences. Investigations became witch-hunts—searches for disloyalty based on weak evidence and irrational fears. McCarthy’s tactic of damaging reputations with vague, unfounded charges became known as McCarthyism.
McCarthy s sensational accusations put him in the headlines, and the press quoted him often and widely. He badgered witnesses and then refused to accept their answers. His tactics left a cloud of suspicion that he and others interpreted as guilt. People were afraid to challenge him.
In 1954 McCarthy began to look for Soviet spies in the United States Army During weeks of televised hearings, millions of Americans watched McCarthy question and bully officers, harassing them about trivial details and accusing them of misconduct. His popular support began to fade.
Finally, to strike back at the army’s lawyer, Joseph Welch, McCarthy brought up the past of a young lawyer in Welch’s firm who had been a member of a Communist-front organization while in law school. Welch, who was fully aware of the young man’s past, exploded at McCarthy for possibly ruining the young man’s career: “Until this moment, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness. . . . You have done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?”
Spectators cheered. Welch had said what many Americans had been thinking. Later that year, the Senate passed a vote of censure, or formal disapproval, against McCarthy. Although he remained in the Senate, McCarthy had lost all influence. He died in 1957.

Watkins v. United States, 1957
In 1954 labor organizer John Watkins testified before HUAC. He agreed to discuss his connections with the Communist Party and to identify people who were still members, but refused to talk about those who were no longer members. Watkins received a misdemeanor conviction for refusing to answer questions “pertinent to the question under inquiry’’ In 1957 he appealed his case to the Supreme Court. In a 6-to-l decision, the Supreme Court held that the activities of HUAC during its investigations were beyond the scope of the stated aims of the committee, as well as the authority of congressional powers.

Determining Cause and Effect
The United States experienced two major Red Scares during the twentieth century: one during the 1920s, and one during the 1950s. Both of these scares occurred shortly after a major nation—first Russia, and later China— adopted a Communist form of government. As a historian, find the effect these scares had on American society and determine if they can be related.
Soviet attack. Schools created bomb shelters and held bomb drills to teach students to “duck-and-cover” to protect themselves from a nuclear bomb blast
Although “duck-and-cover” might have made people feel safer, it would not have protected them from nuclear radiation. Experts have note that for every person killed outright by a nuclear blast, four more would die later from fallout, the radiation left over after a blast. To protect themselves, some families built backyard fallout shelters.
Popular Culture in the Cold War
As worries about nuclear war and Communist infiltration filled the public imagination, Cold War themes soon appeared in films, plays, television, tl titles of dance tunes, and popular fiction. Matt Cvetic, an FBI undercover informant who secretly infiltrated the Communist Party, captivated readei with reports in the Saturday Evening Post in 1950. His story was later mad into the movie I Was a Communist for the FBI (1951). Another film, WalkE, on Beacon (1952), features the FBI’s activities in a spy case. In 1953 Arthui Miller’s thinly veiled criticism of the Communist witch-hunts, The Crucib, appeared on Broadway. The play remains popular today as a cautionary tale about how hysteria can lead to false accusations.
In 1953 a weekly television series, I Led Three Lives, about an undercover FBI counterspy who was also a Communist Party official, debuted. Popular tunes such as “Atomic Boogie” and “Atom Bomb Baby” played on the radio. The next year, author Philip Wylie published Tomorrow!, a novel describing the horrific effects of nuclear war on an unprepared American city. Wylie wrote his novel to educate the public about the horrors of atomic war.
One of the most famous and enduring works of this period is John Hersey’s nonfiction book Hiroshima. Originally published as the August h edition of The New Yorker magazine, the book provides six firsthand accou of the United States dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. Not only did it make some Americans question the use of the bomb, but Hiroshima also underscored the real, personal horrors of a nuclear attack.
At the same time, the country was enjoying postwar prosperity and optimism. That spirit, combined with McCarthyism, fears of Communist infiltration, and the threat of atomic attack, made the early 1950s a time c contrasts. As the 1952 election approached, Americans were looking for someone or something that would make them feel more secure.

guiding question How were the policies of massive retaliation and brinkmanship different from previous military policies?
By the end of 1952, many Americans were ready for a change in leadership. The Cold War had much to do with that attitude. Many people believed that Truman’s foreign policy was not working. The Soviet Union had tested an atomic bomb and consolidated its hold on Eastern Europe. China had fallen to communism, and American troops were fighting in Korea.
Tired of the criticism and uncertain he could win, Truman decided not to run again. The Democrats nominated Adlai Stevenson, governor of Illinois. The Republicans chose Dwight D. Eisenhower, the general who had organized the D-Day invasion. Stevenson had little chance against a national hero who had helped win World War II. Americans wanted someone they could trust to lead the nation in the Cold War. Eisenhower won in a landslide. "More Bang for the Buck"
The Cold War shaped Eisenhower’s thinking from the moment he took office. He was convinced that the key to victory was not simply military might but also a strong economy. The United States had to show the world that the free enterprise system could produce a better society than communism. At the same time, economic prosperity would prevent Communists from gaining support in the United States and protect society from subversion.
As a professional soldier, Eisenhower knew the costs associated with large-scale conventional war. Preparing for that kind of warfare, he believed, was too expensive. “We cannot defend the

nation in a way which will exhaust our economy” the president declare Instead of maintaining a large and expensive army, the nation “must be prepared to use atomic weapons in all forms.” Nuclear weapons, he said gave “more bang for the buck”
The Korean War had convinced Eisenhower that the United States could not contain communism by fighting a series of small wars. Such were unpopular and too expensive. Instead, wars had to be prevented] the first place. The best way to do that seemed to be to threaten to use nuclear weapons. This policy came to be called massive retaliation.
Eisenhower s emphasis on nuclear weapons required new technoloj deliver them. The president wanted to make sure that the United States could wage nuclear war even if the Soviets destroyed American bases ii Europe or Asia. This required technology that would allow the U.S. to: the USSR without needing bases overseas. At the same time, American forces had to be very difficult to destroy in one attack. If massive retali was to be an effective strategy, American nuclear weapons had to be deployed in a way that an enemy could not eliminate them all at once i surprise attack. For this reason, the United States began to build what1 later be referred to as the nuclear triad, a three part system made up ol range bombers, land-based missiles, and missile-carrying submarines.
In 1955 the U.S. air force unveiled the first part of the triad, the hu B-52 bomber which could fly across continents to drop nuclear bombs B-52 is still in use today. But because bombers could be shot down, Eisenhower also approved the development of intercontinental ballisti missiles (ICBMs) that could reach anywhere in the world in less than 30 minutes. The Atlas missile was the first American ICBM. It was als< to launch the first seven U.S. astronauts in the early 1960s. A modified version of the Atlas is still used today to launch satellites.
For the third part of the triad, Eisenhower also began a program t< submarines capable of launching nuclear missiles from underwater. Tl Polaris submarine was the first submarine ever built to launch long-ra missiles. The first Polaris submarine was deployed in 1960 and carriec 16 nuclear missiles.
The new policy enabled Eisenhower to cut military spending fror around $50 billion to about $34 billion by reducing the size of the an w ich was expensive to maintain. He then increased the U.S. nuclear arsenal from about 1,000 bombs in 1953 to about 18,000 bombs in 15
416
One result of the decision to focus on massive retaliation was the emergence of a new arms race. The United States and the Soviet Union began to compete in the development of missiles and bombers, and steadily expanded the size and power of their nuclear arsenal.
Brinkmanship
President Eisenhower s willingness to threaten nuclear war to maintain peace worried some people. Critics called this brinkmanship—the willingness to go to the brink of war to force the other side to back down— and argued that it was too dangerous. During several crises, however, President Eisenhower felt compelled to threaten nuclear war.
The Taiwan Crisis Shortly after the Korean War ended, a new crisis erupted in Asia. Although Communists had taken power in mainland China, Chinese Nationalists still controlled Taiwan and several small islands along Chinas coast. In the fall of 1954, China threatened to seize two of the islands. Eisenhower saw Taiwan as part of the “anti-Communist barrier” in Asia that needed to be protected at all costs.
When China began shelling the islands and announced that Taiwan would be liberated, Eisenhower asked Congress to authorize the use of force to defend Taiwan. He then warned that an attack on Taiwan would be resisted by U.S. naval forces and hinted that they would use nuclear weapons to stop an invasion. Soon afterward, China backed down.
The Suez Crisis The following year, a serious crisis erupted in the Middle East. Eisenhower wanted to prevent Arab nations from aligning with the Soviet Union. To build support among Arabs, Secretary of State Dulles offered to help Egypt finance the construction of a dam on the Nile River.
The deal ran into trouble in Congress, however, because Egypt had bought weapons from Communist Czechoslovakia. Dulles was forced to withdraw the offer. A week later,
Egyptian troops seized control of the Suez Canal from the Anglo-French company that had controlled it. The Egyptians intended to use the canal’s profits to pay for the dam.
In October 1956, British and French troops invaded Egypt.
Eisenhower was furious with Britain and France. The situation became even more dangerous when the Soviet Union threatened rocket attacks on Britain and France and offered to send troops to help Egypt. Eisenhower immediately put U.S. nuclear forces on alert, noting, “if those fellows start something, we may have to hit ’em— and, if necessary, with everything in the bucket.”
Pressured by the United States, the British and French called off the invasion. The Soviet Union had won a major diplomatic victory by supporting Egypt. Soon other Arab nations began accepting Soviet aid.

The ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the necessary art.... If you try to run away from it, if you are scared to go to the brink, you are lost.

Covert Operations
guiding question Why did President Eisenhower want to use covert operations tocombat the spread of communism?
President Eisenhower relied on brinkmanship on several occasions, but hi knew it could not work in all situations. It could prevent war, but it could not prevent Communists from staging revolutions within countries. To d( this, Eisenhower decided to use covert, or hidden, operations conducted the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
Many of the CIA’s operations took place in developing nations— nations with primarily agricultural economies. Many of these countries blamed European imperialism and American capitalism for their problen Their leaders looked to the Soviet Union as a model of how to industriali: their countries. They often threatened to nationalize, or put under government control, foreign businesses operating in their countries.
One way to stop developing nations from moving into the Communis camp was to provide them with financial aid, as Eisenhower had tried to in Egypt. In some cases, however, in which the threat of communism seemed stronger, the CIA ran covert operations to overthrow anti-Ameri leaders and replace them with pro-American leaders.
Iran and Guatemala
Two examples of covert operations that achieved American objectives toi place in Iran and Guatemala. By 1953 Iranian prime minister Mohamme Mossadegh had nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. He seemei ready to make an oil deal with the Soviet Union. The pro-American shah Iran tried to force Mossadegh out of office but failed and fled into exile. CIA quickly sent agents to organize street riots and arrange a coup that ousted Mossadegh and returned the shah to power.
The following year, the CIA intervened in Guatemala. In 1950, with Communist support, Jacobo Arbenz Guzman was elected president of Guatemala. After Arbenz Guzman assumed office in 1951, his land-refoi program took over large estates and plantations, including those of the American-owned United Fruit Company. In May 1954, Communist Czechoslovakia delivered arms to Guatemala. The CIA responded by arming the Guatemalan opposition and training them at secret camps ir Nicaragua and Honduras.

Covert operations did not always work as Eisenhower hoped. Stalin die in 1953, and a power struggle began in the Soviet Union. By 1956, Niki Khrushchev had emerged as the Soviet leader. That year Khrushchev delivered a secret speech to Soviet officials. He attacked Stalin’s policies and insisted that there were many ways to build a communist society. Although the speech was secret, the CIA obtained a copy of it and distributed copies of it throughout Eastern Europe and the world.
Many Eastern Europeans had long been frustrated with Communii rule. Hearing Khrushchev s speech further discredited communism. In 1956, riots erupted in Eastern Europe. By late October, a full-scale upr

SOVIET FIRES EARTH SATELLITE INTO SPACE; IT IS CIRCLING THE GLOBE AT
M. P. H.; SPHERE TRACKED IN 4 CROSSINGS OVER U.S.
Sputnik was the world's first artificial satellite. It made news around the world and launched the space race. SputnikII, launched only a month after Sputnik, carried the first living creature into orbit—an "astro" dog named Laika.

had begun in Hungary. Although Khrushchev was willing to tolerate
greater freedom in Eastern Europe, he had never meant to imply that the	imply to express indirectly
Soviets would tolerate an end to communism in the region. Soon after the uprising began, Soviet tanks rolled into the capital of Hungary and crushed the rebellion.
Sputnik Launches the Space Race
As the United States began to develop ICBMs, Americans were stunned to
discover that the Soviet Union already had them. On October 4, 1957, the
Soviets demonstrated this technology by launching Sputnik, the first
artificial satellite to orbit Earth. Less than four months later, the United
States launched its first satellite, Explorer 1. Determined not to be beaten by
the Soviets, Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, or NASA, in late 1958 to begin developing a civilian space
program for the United States.
The Cold War Begins 419
President Eisenhower addressed ► concerns about communist activity in the Middle East by asking Congress to authorize military force to assist nations resisting a communist threat. This policy became known as the Eisenhower Doctrine.
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev rose to power in the mid-1950s, following the death of longtime dictator Joseph Stalin.
CRITICAL TREKING
Drawing Conclusions Howdid covert operations around the world contribute to tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union?


Sputnik marked a turning point in history and the beginning of a new era—the use of satellites in space. Both nations in the Cold War began launching satellites to assist in communications and to spy on other nations. Today, satellites are a vital part of modern communications and travel. They transmit television, radio, and cell phone signals, and the satellites of the Global Positioning System (GPS) help drivers and pilots navigate.
The Eisenhower Doctrine
The United States was not the only nation using covert means to support its foreign policy. President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt had
emerged from the Suez crisis as a hero to the Arab people, and by 1957 h had begun working with Jordan and Syria to spread pan-Arabism—the ic that all Arab people should be united into one nation.
Eisenhower and Dulles worried about Nasser’s links to the Soviets an feared he was laying the groundwork to take control of the Middle East. 1 late 1957, Eisenhower asked Congress to authorize the use of military for whenever the president thought it necessary to assist Middle East nation; resisting Communist aggression. The policy came to be called the Eisenhower Doctrine. It essentially extended the Truman Doctrine and t policy of containment to the Middle East.
In July 1958, Eisenhower’s concerns appeared to be confirmed when left-wing rebels, believed to be backed by Nasser and the Soviets, seiz< power in Iraq. Fearing his government was next, the president of Lebanon sought help. Eisenhower ordered 5,000 marines to Beiri the Lebanese capital. Once the situation stabilized, the U.S. forci withdrew.
A
Spy Plane Is Shot Down After the Hungarian uprising, Khrushchev reasserted Sovie power and the superiority of communism. Although he b supported “peaceful coexistence” with capitalism, he bej accusing the “capitalist countries” of starting a “feveris race.” In 1957, after the launch of Sputnik, Khrushcb boasted, “We will bury capitalism. . . . Your grande! *	will live under communism.”
Late the following year, Khrushchev demanded t withdrawal of Allied troops from West Berlin. Seen of State Dulles rejected Khrushchev’s demands. If the Soviets threatened Berlin, Dulles announced, NATC would respond, “if need be by military force.” Brinkmanship worked again, and Khrushchev backe down. Eisenhower invited Khrushchev to visit the United States in late 1959. The visit’s success led the 1 leaders to agree to hold a summit in Paris.
420
Shortly before the summit was to begin in I960, the Soviet Union shot down an American U-2 spy plane. At first Eisenhower claimed that the aircraft was a weather plane that had strayed off course. Then Khrushchev dramatically produced the pilot, Francis Gary Powers. Eisenhower refused to apologize, saying the flights had protected American security. In response, Khrushchev broke up the summit.
In this climate of heightened tension, Eisenhower prepared to leave office. In January 1961, he delivered a farewell address to the nation in which he pointed out that a new relationship had developed between the military establishment and the defense industry. He warned Americans to be on guard against the influence of this military-industrial complex in a democracy.
Although he had avoided war and contained communism, Eisenhower was frustrated. He had sent military advisers to South Vietnam to train a South Vietnamese army and also saw Fidel Castro establish a communist regime in Cuba. Eisenhower stated, “I confess that I lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment. As one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war ... I wish I could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight.”

Understanding How Historians Interpret the Past
Why Learn This Skill?
As you have read about the history of the United States, you probably have realized that
j	historians do not always agree about why things
happened or agree about how events affected things that happened later. When you study history, it is easy to become confused unless you have some idea of how historians interpret the past and the different approaches they use.
Learning the Skill
I
The study of how historians approach history is called historiography. It is in some ways the history of historians and their different approaches to interpreting the past.
One of the important things to understand is that how people view history changes over time. This happens for several reasons. Sometimes an event has to happen before people realize a past event was important and needs to be studied. Historical interpretations also change over time because new information becomes available. For example, a country may open its archives. Another reason interpretations change over time is because historians look at different kinds of evidence.
There are three big questions for historians. The first is causation: Historians want to explain why something happened or why people made certain choices. The second issue is outcome: Historians want to explain what happened because of an event or choices people made. The third issue is meaning: Historians want to explain why a historical event matters.
There are several approaches historians take to answer these questions. The first is sometimes called intentionalism, or volitionalism. It has also been nicknamed "The Great Man" approach to history. It focuses on leaders, especially political leaders. It looks at who made key choices, and tries to figure out why they made those choices.
A second approach to history is structuralis A structural approach looks at the way things are organized, the rules and structures of the political system, the economy, and society. For example, instead of focusing on a president am his goals, ambitions, and choices, a structural^ might look at how the Constitution structures the president's role and forces him to make certain choices and limits his ability to make other choices.
A third approach to history is intellectualisi Intellectual historians assume that ideas are tl most important cause of things. They look at ideas, ideology, culture, and people's perceptions, so as to understand what happen
As you might expect, these three approacl can lead to very different histories of the same event. And within these approaches, historian narrow their emphasis even further. Some structuralists, for example, emphasize the role the economy alone, or the role of social classej Others focus just on the political system. Amc intellectual historians, some focus on ideology while others stress the role of culture.
Practicing the Skill
Read the following paragraphs, and then answer the questions that follow about interpreting the causes of the Cold War.
Over the years there have been many differeni arguments put forward for why the Cold War beg Historians have suggested Roosevelt made mistah Yalta, and did not stand up to Stalin soon enough, Some think Truman was too aggressive and unwil to compromise. Some argue that Stalin was authoritarian and paranoid and determined to cor everything he could. Others have suggested Stalir was a committed communist and determined to dt everything he could to spread communism into Europe. Some have suggested the Cold War was partly Churchill's responsibility. They suggest Br maneuvered the United States into taking over Britain's role of balancing power in Europe so as J protect the British Empire.
422
Historians have also argued that American capitalism and its desire for overseas markets led to the clash with the Soviets. Others think the fundamental clash was between a democratic republic based on individual rights versus a totalitarian communist system. Another group of historians point out that the Russians knew their history of being invaded from the West and just wanted a buffer zone on their border to protect themselves. Others think the American military was determined to avoid another Pearl Harbor and pushed for alliances and overseas bases to make sure America remained safe.
1.	In which theories above are historians practicing a volitional or intentionalist approach to the Cold War?
2.	What would a structuralist emphasize in trying to understand the causes of the Cold War?
3.	What theories about the cold war would intellectual historians favor?
Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin at the Yalta Conference in 1945
Applying the Skill
Conducting a Historical Inquiry Now that you understand the basic approaches historians take to history, conduct your own historical inquiry into some aspect of the Cold War. Identify a question about the Cold War you would like to answer. Write it down.
Gather sources that talk about the history related to your question. Collect a variety of sources: gather works by historians, as well as collections of primary sources that include speeches and government documents for the Cold War. If possible
I use a local library or online resources to examine old magazines and newspapers from the time you are studying. After gathering your sources, analyze them, making notes as to what they tell you. Write down a hypothesis, or possible explanation, for your original question.
I
Ask yourself if you are taking an f intentional, structural or intellectual approach to the question. Does thinking about the question that way suggest other sources to examine? Test your hypothesis against your sources. Do any of them contradict your idea? Do you need other sources to confirm your idea? Once you are confident you have a good answer to your question, prepare an article for a historical journal identifying your question, outlining your sources and findings, and presenting your conclusions.

Return to a Peacetime Economy
guidingquestion What happened when the nation returned to a peacetime economy, a how did government try to ease the transition?
After the war, many Americans feared the return to a peacetime economy. They worried about unemployment and a recession because military production had stopped and millions of former soldiers needed work. Despite such worries, the economy contin to grow after the war. Increased consumer spending helped ward a recession. After so many years of economic depression and wartime shortages, Americans rushed out to buy consumer gooc
The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, popularly callee the GI Bill, also boosted the economy. The act provided funds tc help veterans establish businesses, buy homes, and attend colleg< The postwar economy did have problems in the early years afte the war. A greater demand for goods led to higher prices. The resulting inflation soon triggered labor unrest. As the cost of liv rose, workers in the automobile, steel, electrical, and mining industries went on strike for better pay.
Truman was afraid that the miners’ strikes would drastically reduce the nation’s energy supply. He ordered the government t< take control of the mines. He also pressured mine owners to gra the union most of its demands. Truman even stopped a strike tl shut down the nation’s railroads by threatening to draft the stril workers into the army.

the 1946 congressional elections, and won control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1930.
The new conservative Congress quickly set out to limit the power of organized labor. In 1947 legislators passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which outlawed the closed shop, or the practice of forcing business owners to hire only union members. This law also allowed states to pass right-to-work laws, which outlawed union shops (shops requiring new workers to join the union). It prohibited featherbedding, or limiting work output in order to create more jobs. It also banned using union money to support political campaigns. Truman, however, vetoed the bill, arguing that it was a mistake:
PRIMARYSOURCE
M [It would] reverse the basic direction of our national labor policy, inject the Government into private economic affairs on an unprecedented scale, and conflict with important principles of our democratic society. Its provisions would cause more strikes, not fewer. **
—from a message to the U.S. House of Representatives, June 20,1947
Despite President Truman’s concerns, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 over his veto. Supporters of the act claimed that the law held irresponsible unions in check. Labor leaders, however, called the act a “slave labor” law, insisting that it erased many of the gains that unions had made since 1933.

The Democratic Party’s loss of control in Congress in the 1946 elections did not dampen President Truman’s plans. After taking office, Truman had proposed domestic measures to continue the work of Franklin Roosevelts New Deal. He worked to push this agenda through Congress.
Truman's Legislative Agenda
Truman’s proposals included expanding Social Security benefits and raising the minimum wage. He also proposed public housing and slum clearance, a program to ensure full employment through federal spending and investment, a system of national health insurance, and long-range environmental and public works planning.
In February 1948, Truman also boldly asked Congress to pass a broad civil rights bill.
The bill would protect African Americans right to vote. It would also abolish poll taxes and make lynching a federal crime. He issued an executive order barring discrimination in federal employment and ending segregation in the armed forces. Most of Trumans legislative efforts failed as a coalition of Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats defeated many of his proposals.

The Fair Deal
— Analyzing-----
Primary Sources
Truman’s Fair Deal
Truman’s 1949 State of the Union address repeated his previous domestic agenda. Every segment of our population and every individual,” he declared, has a right to expect from our Government a fair deal.” Whether intentional or not, the president had coined a name—the Fair Deal—to set his program apart from the New Deal.
The 81st Congress did not completely support Truman’s Fair Deal. Legislators did raise the legal minimum wage to 75<t an hour. They increased Social Security benefits by over 75 percent and extended them to 10 million additional people. Congress also passed the National Housing Act of 1949, which provided for the construction of low-income housing and for long-term rent subsidies. Congress refused, however, to pass national health insurance or to provide aid for farmers or schools. Led by conservative Republicans and Dixiecrats, legislators also opposed Truman’s civil rights legislation.

The Eisenhower Years
guidingquestion How did Eisenhower's presidency signal a more conservative direction for the government?
In 1950 the United States went to war in Korea. The war consumed the nation’s attention and resources, ending Truman’s Fair Deal. By 1952, with the war at a bloody stalemate and his approval rating dropping quickly, Truman decided not to run again.
With no Democratic incumbent to face, Republicans pinned their hopes on a popular World War II hero: Dwight Eisenhower, former commander of the Allied Forces in Europe. The Democrats nominated Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson.
The Republicans adopted the slogan “It’s time for a change!” The warm and friendly Eisenhower, known as “Ike,” promised to end the war in Korea. “I like Ike” became the Republican rallying cry. Eisenhower won the election in a landslide. The Republicans also gained an eight-seat majority in the House, while the Senate became evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.
Eisenhower and "Dynamic Conservatism"
President Eisenhower had two favorite phrases. Middle of the road described his political beliefs, and "dynamic conservatism meant balancing economic conservatism with activism that would benefit the country. Under the guidance of a cabinet filled with business leaders, Eisenhower ended government price and rent controls. Many conservatives viewed these as unnecessary federal regulations of the economy. Eisenhowers administration believed business growth was vital to the nation. His secretary of defense, the former president of General Motors, declared that “what is good for our country is good for General Motors, and vice versa.
As we look around the country, many of our shortcomings stand out.... Our minimum wages are far too low.... Our farmers still face an uncertain future. And too many of them lack the benefits of our modern civilization. Some of our natural resources are still being wasted. We are acutely short of electric power.... Five million families are still living in slums and firetraps.... Proper medical care is so expensive that it is out of the reach of the great majority of our citizens. Our schools ... are utterly inadequate. Our democratic ideals are often thwarted by prejudice and intolerance.... [E]very individual has a right to expect from our Government a fair deal.^^

CRITICALTHINKING
Analyzing Information How did the construction of the interstate highway system demonstrate Eisenhower's dynamic conservatism?
To cut federal spending, Eisenhower vetoed a school construction bill and agreed to slash aid to public housing. H also targeted aid to businesses, or what he called “creeping socialism.” Shortly after taking office, he abolished the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which loaned money to banks, railroads, and other large institutions in financial trouble. Another agency, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), also came under Eisenhower’s scrutiny. During his presidency, federal spending for the TVA fell fro $185 million to $12 million. Eisenhower also supported soim modest tax cuts.
In some areas, Eisenhower took an activist role. He especial
pushed for two large government projects. As more Americans ov cars, the need for better roads increased. In 1956 Congress passed tl Federal Highway Act, the largest public works program in American history. The act provided for a $25 billion, 10-year project to build more than 40,000 miles (64,400 km) of interstate highways. Congress also authorized the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway. This project included building a series of locks along the St. Lawrence River that wor allow ships to travel from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. The thi previous administrations had failed to accomplish this feat because of differences with Canada over the waterway.
Extending Social Security
Despite cutting federal spending and attempting to limit the governmen role in the economy, President Eisenhower agreed to extend the Social Security system to an additional 10 million people. He also extended unemployment payments to 4 million more citizens. Eisenhower even agreed to raise the minimum wage and to continue to provide some government aid to farmers.
By the time Eisenhower ran for a second term in 1956, the nation h; successfully shifted back to a peacetime economy. The battles between liberals and conservatives over whether to continue New Deal policies would continue. In the meantime, most Americans focused their energy enjoying what had become a decade of tremendous prosperity.

The Affluent Society
wdoes prosperity change the way people live?
It Matters Because
For many Americans, the 1950s was a time of affluence, with many new technological breakthroughs. In addition, new forms of entertainment created a generational divide between young people and adults.
American Abundance
guiding question How did the lives ofAmericans change after World War II?
The 1950s was a decade of incredible prosperity. Between 1940 and 1955, the average income ofU.S. families roughly tripled. People in all income brackets were experiencing a rapid rise in income. In 1958 economist John Kenneth Galbraith published The Affluent Society, in which he claimed that the nations postwar prosperity was a new phenomenon. Galbraith suggested that whereas past societies had an “economy of scarcity” with limited economic productivity, the United States had now created an “economy of abundance.” New business techniques and technology enabled the production of abundant goods and services. They dramatically raised the U.S. standard of living.
With more disposable income than ever, Americans began spending on new consumer goods. Advertising helped fuel the spending spree. It became the United States’s fastest-growing industry. Manufacturers employed new, carefully planned marketing techniques to create consumer demand for their products.
The Growth of Suburbia
Advertisers targeted consumers with money to spend, many of whom lived in new mass-produced suburbs that grew up around cities in the 1950s. Levittown, New York, was one of the earliest of the mass-produced suburbs. It was the brainchild of Bill Levitt, who mass-produced hundreds of simple, similar-looking homes 10 miles east of New York City. Between 1947 and 1951, families rushed to buy the inexpensive homes. Similar suburbs multiplied throughout the nation. The suburban population doubled, while the population of cities rose only 10 percent.

Reasons for suburban growth varied. Some people wished to escape 1 crime and congestion of the city. Others believed suburbs offered a bette life and were more affordable. The GI Bill and the government’s decision give income tax deductions for mortgage and property tax payments ma home ownership more attractive than ever. Between 1940 and 1960, the percentage of Americans who owned their homes rose from about 41 percent to about 61 percent.
The Baby Boom
The U.S. birthrate exploded after World War II. From 1945 to 1961, mor than 65 million children were born in the United States. At the height of this baby boom, a child was born every seven seconds. Many factors contributed to the baby boom. First, young couples who had put off gett married during World War II and the Korean War could finally begin th families. Also, the government encouraged the growth of families by offering generous GI benefits for home purchases. Finally, popular culti celebrated pregnancy, parenthood, and large families.
The Changing Workplace
As the economy grew, ongoing mechanization of farms and factories mean! more Americans began working in offices in what came to be called white-collar jobs. These employees typically wore a white dress shirt and a tie to work instead of the blue denim work shirts of factory workers and laborers 1956 white-collar workers outnumbered blue-collar workers for the first t The shift to white-collar jobs was partly the result of both new technology and management innovations introduced into the workplac the 1950s, the first business computers came on the market. Payroll, bil inventory, record-keeping, and scientific and engineering calculations < all be done by computers. As companies began to use computers, mana were able to consolidate clerical tasks across departments. This meant f clerical workers were needed and these tasks could be done faster and i
reliably. People could focus on management tasks.
Many white-collar employees worked for large corporations. To be n competitive, some corporations expanded overseas. They became multinational corporations, locating near raw materials and benefiting a cheap labor pool. Also during this time, another management innovati the franchise became popular. In a franchise, a person owns and runs < more stores of a larger chain. Believing that consumers valued dependabi and familiarity, the owners of chain operations required their franchises

more efficient and consistent and helped to reduce costs
Many other corporate leaders also expected conformity rather than freethinking Socio ogist David Riesman and others criticized this trend.
In his 1950 book The Lonely Crowd, Riesman argued that conformity was changing people. He claimed that people used to judge themselves on the basis of their own values and the esteem of their families. But now, he said, The American is said to be shallower, freer with his money, friendlier, more uncertain of himself and his values, more demanding of approval.
[This attitude of] other-direction is becoming the typical character of the new’ middle class.” In his 1956 book The Organization Man, William H. Whyte, Jr., attacked the similarity many businesses cultivated in their employees to keep any individual from dominating.

Scientific Advances
guiding question How did technological advances change sodety?
As the United States experienced social changes during the postwar era, it also witnessed important scientific advances. During the 1950s, scientists broke new ground in electronics, aviation, and medicine.
Advances in Electronics and Aviation
The electronics industry advanced rapidly after World War II. In 1947 three U.S. physicists developed the transistor, a tiny electric generator that made it possible to create small portable radios.
The computer age also dawned in the postwar era. In 1946 scientists developed one of the nation’s earliest computers, ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), to make military calculations. Several years later, a newer model, UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer), processed business data and started the computer revolution.
Aviation progressed rapidly as well. Aircraft designers used more plastics and light metals, swept-back wings, and new jet engine technology to build planes that could fly farther on the same amount of fuel. These advances made airline travel affordable for more people.

Medical Breakthroughs
Prior to the 1950s, there were few effective treatments for cancer and heart attacks. Medical breakthroughs in the 1950s changed that. The development of radiation treatments and chemotherapy helped many cancer patients survive. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), developed in 1950, helped many people survive heart attacks. Doctors also learned to replace worn-out heart valves with artificial valves, and implanted the first
pacemakers in 1952.
Tuberculosis and polio had frightened Americans for decades. Tuberculosis patients were isolated in sanatoriums to prevent the spread of this highly contagious lung disease.
During the 1950s, a blood test for the disease and new antibiotics helped end fears. In 1956 tuberculosis fell from the

The Rise of Television
Early television programs included comedies, variety shows, and action programs. In 1953 Lucille Ball and her husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in of the medium’s most popular shows ever, a comedy called I Love Lucy. One episode attracted an audience of 44 million viewers—more than fo the presidential inauguration the following day.
Many early comedy shows, such as those starring Bob Hope and Jac Benny, were adapted from radio programs. Variety shows, such as Ed Sullivan’s Toast of the Town, provided a mix of comedy, music, dance, a acrobatics. Quiz shows also drew large audiences after the 1955 debut < The $64,000 Question. Westerns such as The Lone Ranger and Gunsmokt quickly in popularity. Viewers also enjoyed police shows such as Dragn Television news and sports broadcasts grew in popularity as well. Hollywood Adapts
As television’s popularity grew, movies lost viewers. Attendance plunge from 82 million in 1946 to 36 million by 1950. By 1960, one-fifth ofth nation’s movie theaters had closed. Hollywood used contests, door priz and advertising to attract audiences, but failed. Hollywood tried 3-D movies that required the audience to wear special glasses. Viewers quickly tired of the glasses and the films’ often-silly plots.
However, Cinemascope—a process that showed movies on large, panoramic screens—finally gave Hollywood something television coi not match. Full-color spectacles like The Robe and Around the World 80 Days cost a great deal to make, but drew huge audiences and profi

New Music and Poetry
GUIDING questions Why did young people in the 1950s develop their own popular culture? Why were the results different from those in previous generations?
Teens in every generation seek to separate themselves from their parents. In that respect, the 1950s were just like earlier decades, but the results were different for two reasons. First, teens had disposable income that could be spent on entertainment designed specifically for them. Second, the new mass media meant that teens around the country could hear the same music or see the same television shows. The new youth culture became an independent
market for the entertainment and advertising industries.
Rock'n'Roll
In 1951, at a record store in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, radio disc jockey Alan Freed noticed white teenagers buying African American rhythm-and-blues records and dancing to the music in the store. Freed convinced his manager to put the music on the air, and listeners went crazy for it. Soon, white artists began making music that stemmed from these African American sounds, creating a new form of music, rock'n'roll.
With a loud and heavy beat that made it ideal for dancing, and lyrics about themes that appealed to young people, rock ’n roll became wildly popular.
Teens bought recordings from artists such as Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and Bill Haley and the Comets. In
1956 teenagers found their first rock ’n roll hero in music and movie star Elvis Presley. At first, popular television host Ed Sullivan refused to invite Presley to appear on his variety show. He insisted that rock n’ roll music was not fit for a family-oriented show. After another show featuring Presley upset Sullivans high ratings, however, he relented.
Presley owed his popularity as much to his moves as to his music, swinging his hips and dancing during his performances in ways that shocked many people. Many adults condemned rock n roll as loud, mindless, and dangerous. The city council of San Antonio, Texas, banned rock ’n’ roll from the jukeboxes at public swimming poo s.
The rock n roll hits that teens bought in record numbers united them in a world their parents did not share. Thus, in the 1950s, this new music helped to create what became known as the generat.on gap, or the cultural separation between children and their parents.
During the 1950sz teens around the nation eagerly bought rock'n'roll records. The music was popular at dances called hops and even on television programs like American Bandstand.

The Beat Movement
A group of mostly white writers and artists who called themselves beats, or beatniks, highlighted a values gap in 1950s America. Beat poets, write and artists criticized American culture for its sterility, conformity, and emptiness. In 1956, 29-year-old poet Allen Ginsberg published a longp< titled “Howl” blasting American life. It began, “I saw the best minds of r generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked ... burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machin of night.” Beat author Jack Kerouac’s book On the Road (1957), about hi freewheeling adventures with a car thief and con artist, shocked some readers. Although the beat movement remained small, it laid the foundations for the widespread youth cultural rebellion of the 1960s.
LESSON 2 REVIEW
African American Entertainers
African American entertainers struggled to find acceptance. With a fe\ notable exceptions, television tended to shut out African Americans. Ii 1956 NBC gave popular African American singer Nat King Cole a 15-minute musical variety show. However, NBC was unable to find a national sponsor for a show hosted by an African American, so it canc the show two years later.
African American rock ’n’ roll singers faced fewer obstacles. Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Ray Charles all recorded hit songs. The same era also saw the rise of several female African American
groups, including the Shirelles and the Ronettes. The music of th< early rock ’n’ roll artists profoundly influenced popular music ai the world. Little Richard and Chuck Berry, for example, inspire the Beatles, whose music swept Britain a the world in the 1960s.
Despite the advances in music and th economic boom of the 1950s, not all Americans were part of the new society, many minorities and rural poor, the Am< Dream remained well out of reach.

Poverty Amid Prosperity
img question Are the people and regions most affected by poverty today the same as in the 1950s?
The 1950s saw a large expansion of the middle class. At least one in five Americans, or about 30 million people, however, lived below the poverty line. This imaginary marker is a figure the government sets to reflect the minimum income required to support a family. Many Americans mistakenly thought that the country’s prosperity had provided for everyone.
The poor included single mothers and the elderly; minorities such as Puerto Ricans and Mexican immigrants; rural Americans— both African American and white; and inner-city residents, who remained stuck in crowded slums. Many Native Americans endured poverty whether they stayed on reservations or migrated to cities. The Decline of the Inner City
Poverty was most apparent in the nation’s urban centers. As middle-class families moved to the suburbs, they left behind the poor and less educated. Many city centers deteriorated because they no longer received taxes from their former middle-class residents. Cities could no longer provide adequate public transportation, housing, and other services.
When government tried to help inner-city residents, it often made matters worse. Urban renewal programs tried to eliminate poverty by tearing down slums and building new high-rises for poor residents. Yet these crowded projects often created an

atmosphere of violence. The government also unwittingly created a condition supporting poverty with a rule that evicted residents of publ housing as soon as they began earning a higher income.
poverty line a level of personal or family income below which one is classified as poor by the federal government
African Americans
Although more than 3 million African Americans had migrated from t South to Northern cities, long-standing patterns of racial discriminatic kept many of them poor. In 1958 African Americans’ salaries, on avera were only 51 percent of what whites earned.
In 1959 the play A Raisin in the Sun, written by African American authi Lorraine Hansberry, opened on Broadway. The play told the story of a working-class African American family struggling against poverty and racism. Hansberry wrote: “The ghettos are killing us; not only our dreams but our very bodies.”

Eight family members lived in this three-room house lined with newspaper in Appalachia in the 1950s.
CRITICALTHINKING
Drawing Conclusions Besides inadequate housing, what other effects did poverty have on people? By the middle of the 1900s, Native Americans—who made up less than one percent of the population—were the poorest ethnic group in the nation. Afti World War II, the United States government launched a program to bring Native Americans into mainstream society. Under the plan, which became known as the termination policy, the federal government withdrew all official recognition of the Native American groups as legal entities and ma them subject to the same laws as white citizens. Another program encouraged Native Americans to relocate from their reservations to cities.
For many Native Americans, relocation was a disaster. For example the mid-1950s, the Welfare Council of Minneapolis said of Native Arne living conditions: “One Indian family of five or six, living in two rooir will take in relatives and friends who come from the reservations seeki jobs until perhaps fifteen people will be crowded into space.” During the 1950s, Native Americans in Minneapolis could expect to live only 37 years, comps to 68 years for other Minneapolis residents. Benjamin Reifel, a Sioux, described the despair the termination policy produced: “The Indians believed that when the clouds of war passed from the skies overhead, their ris tide of expectations, though temporarily stalled, woul< again reappear. Instead they were threatened by termination. . . . Soaring expectations began to plunge Appalachia

Some 1.5 million people left Appalachia to seek a better life in the cities. Appalachia had fewer doctors than the rest of the country, and rates of nutritional deficiency and infant mortality were high. Schooling was considered even worse than in inner-city slums.

Juvenile Delinquency
guidingquestion Wh at factors were blamed for the rise in juvenile delinquency?
During the 1950s, many middle-class white Americans found it easy to ignore poverty and racism. Some social problems, however, became impossible to ignore. Juvenile delinquency—antisocial or criminal behavior of young people—became one of those problems when the United States saw a 45 percent rise in juvenile crime rates between 1948 and 1953.
Americans disagreed on what had triggered the rise. Experts blamed television, movies, comic books, racism, busy parents, a rising divorce rate, lack of religion, and anxiety over the military draft. Some cultural critics claimed that young people were rebelling against the conformity of their parents. Others blamed a lack of discipline. Bishop Fulton J. Sheen complained that parents had raised bored children who sought new thrills, such as “alcohol, marijuana, even murder.” Still others pointed at social causes, blaming teen violence on poverty. Most teens stayed clear of gangs, drugs, and crime. Still, the public stereotyped young people as juvenile delinquents, especially those who had long hair or used street slang.
Concerned about their children, many parents focused on the schools as a possible solution. When baby boomers began entering the school system in the 1950s, enrollments increased by 13 million, and school districts struggled to pay for new buildings and hire more teachers. In 1957 the Soviet Unions launch of Sputnik I and Sputnik II, the world’s first space satellites, caused more panic about education. Many felt that the nation had fallen behind its Cold War enemy. They blamed what they saw as a lack of technical education. Efforts to improve math and science education began. Yet fears about the nation’s young people lingered at the end of the decade.

Juvenile Delinquency
Teens are more involved in crime, drugs, and gangs today than they were in the 1950s. There are four times as many juvenile court cases as there were in 1960. In the late 1990s, about 2 million juveniles (ages 10-17) were arrested, mostly for drug-related crimes. Many of these crimes were committed by juveniles in gangs. The number of juvenile cases has dropped in the past decade, but gang crimes are on the rise.

When U.S. intelligence discovered Soviet nuclear missile silos in Cuba, just 90 miles from the United States, the bright New Frontier that President Kennedy had promised Americans seemed very far away. During the 13-day standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, there was increasing fear that nuclear strikes would occur. The crisis was resolved when President Kennedy helped negotiate both nations away from the brink of nuclear war.

The threat of nuclear war and the assassination of Kennedy could not derail the drive for change. President Lyndon B. Johnson presided over landmark legislation meant to create a Great Society of wealth and equality for all.

On September 26, 1960, at 9:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, an estimated 75 million people sat indoors and focused on their television sets. They were watching the first televised president^ debate. The debate marked a new era of television politics.
During the 1960 presidential race, both parties made substai use of television. The Democrats spent more than $6 million on television and radio spots, while the Republicans spent more th< $7.5 million. Television news commentator Eric Sevareid complained that the candidates had become “packaged products He declared that the “Processed Politician has finally arrived.”
The candidates differed in many ways. John F. Kennedy, the Democratic nominee and a senator, was a Catholic from a wealt Massachusetts family. Richard M. Nixon, the Republican nomin and current vice president, was a Quaker from California. He b grown up in a family that struggled financially. Kennedy seemec outgoing and relaxed. Nixon struck many as formal and stiff.
Although the candidates presented different styles, they differed little on key issues. Both promised to boost the econom and both portrayed themselves as “Cold Warriors,” determined stop the forces of communism. Kennedy expressed concern abo suspected "missile gap/ claiming the United States lagged beh the Soviets in weaponry. Nixon warned that the Democrats’ fisc policies would boost inflation and that only he had the foreign policy experience needed for the nation.
Kennedy s Catholic faith became an issue, just as AI Smiths Catholicism had in 1928. The United States had never had a Cathol president, and many Protestants had concerns about Kennedy.
450
Kennedy decided to confront this issue openly in a speech: “I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute-where no Catholic prelate would tell the President (should he be a Catholic) how to act and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote.”
The series of four televised debates influenced the elections close outcome. Kennedy won the popular vote by 118,574 out of more than 68 million votes cast, and the Electoral College by 303 votes to 219. Despite his narrow victory, Kennedy captured the imagination of the American public as few presidents had before him. During the campaign, many had been taken with Kennedy’s youth and optimism. His Inaugural Address reinforced this impression. In the speech, Kennedy declared that “the torch has been

Upon entering office, President Kennedy set out to implement a legislative agenda that became known as the New Frontier. He hoped to increase aid to education, provide health insurance to the elderly, and create a Department of Urban Affairs. He would soon find that passing such legislation was no easy task on Capitol Hill. Although the Democrats had majorities in both houses of Congress, Kennedy was unable to push through many of his programs. His narrow victory had not helped many Democrats get elected. Those who did win, therefore, felt that they owed him nothing. In addition, Southern Democrats—a large part of the Democrats in Congress-saw Kennedy’s program as too expensive and, together with Republicans, were able to defeat many of Kennedy’s proposals.

Determining Cause and Effect
When the Kennedy administration created the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women in 1961, its stated goal was to examine employment policies for women. The reasons for the formation of the commission, however, were not as clear. At the time, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was considered politically dangerous and opposed by some labor leaders. The ERA was stuck in Congress because some thought it was too extreme a step in women’s rights. Some believe Kennedy created the commission to address the status of women, appeal to women voters, and avoid the politically-sensitive issue of the ERA. Others believe it was created to pay a political debt to Womens Bureau leader Esther Peterson, a supporter of Kennedy.
Successes and Setbacks
President Kennedy achieved some victories, particularly in improving t economy. Although the economy had soared through much of the 1950 had slowed by the end of the decade. To increase economic growth and create jobs, Kennedy advocated deficit spending and investing more fur in defense and space exploration. Such spending did indeed create jobs stimulate economic growth.
Kennedy also asked businesses to hold down prices and labor leade: to hold down pay increases. The labor unions in the steel industry agr< to reduce their demands for higher wages, but several steel companies raised prices sharply. Kennedy responded by threatening to have the Department of Defense buy cheaper foreign steel. He asked the Justice Department to investigate whether the steel industry was fixing prices. The steel companies backed down and cut their prices, but the victory caused strained relations with the business community.
In addition, the president pushed for tax cuts. When opponents argu that a tax cut would help only the wealthy, Kennedy asserted that lower t; meant businesses would have more money to expand. This, in turn, woul create new jobs and benefit everybody. However, Congress refused to pa: tax cut because of fears that it would cause inflation. Congress also block his plans for health insurance for senior citizens and federal aid to educa Congress did agree to Kennedy’s request to raise the minimum wage, his proposal for the Area Redevelopment Act, and the Housing Act. These a helped create jobs and build low-income housing in poor areas. Expanding Women's Rights
In 1961 Kennedy created the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. The commission called for federal action against gender discrimination and affirmed the right of women to equally paid employment. The commission proposed the Equal Pay Act, which Kenn signed in 1963. Kennedy never appointed a woman to his cabinet. A nun of women, however, worked in other prominent positions in the administration, including Esther Peterson, assistant secretary of labor an director of the Womens Bureau of the Department of Labor.

1 ;:’,,NGQUI '•>	: How'mPortantaresome of the Warren Court rulings for today's society?
In 1953 Earl Warren, governor of California, became chief justice of the United States. Under Warren’s leadership, the Supreme Court issued several rulings that dramatically reshaped American politics and society.
"One Person, One Vote"
Some of the Courts more notable decisions concerned reapportionment. By 1960, more Americans resided in urban than in rural areas, but many states electoral districts did not reflect this shift. In Tennessee, for example, a rural county with only 2,340 voters had one state representative, while an urban county with 133 times more voters had only seven. Thus, rural voters had far more political influence than urban ones. Some Tennessee voters took the matter to court, and their case, Baker v. Carr (1962), went to the Supreme Court. The Court ruled that federal courts had jurisdiction to hear lawsuits seeking to force states to redraw electoral districts. In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the Court ruled that states must reapportion electoral districts along the principle of “one person, one vote,” so that all citizens’ votes would have equal weight, rather than giving arbitrary power to rural voters. The decision shifted political power from rural and often conservative areas to urban areas, where more liberal voters lived. It also boosted the political power of African Americans and Hispanics, who typically lived in cities.

BAKER v. CARR, 1962 REYNOLDS v. SIMS, 1964
Background of the Cases
Although many more Americans were living in urban areas, most states had not redrawn their political districts to reflect this shift. This gave rural voters more political influence than urban voters. In Beker v. Carr, the Supreme Court ruled on whether federal courts had jurisdiction in lawsuits seeking to force states to redraw their electoral districts. In Reynolds v. Sims, the Court decided whether uneven electoral districts violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
How the Court Ruled
In Beker v. Cerr, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts can hear lawsuits seeking to force state authorities to redraw electoral districts. In Reynolds v. Sims, the Court ruled that the inequality of representation in the Alabama legislature did violate the equal protection clause. These rulings forced states to reapportion their political districts according to the principle of "one person, one vote."
The 1962 Supreme Court Seated, left to right: Associate Justices Tom Clark and Hugo Black, Chief Justice Earl Warren, Associate Justices William 0. Douglas and John Harlan; standing, left to right: Associate Justices Byron White, William Brennan, Potter Stewart, and Arthur Goldberg. Justices Byron White and Arthur Goldberg were appointed by Kennedy.

BAKER v. CARR, 1962 REYNOLDS v. SIMS, 1964
Background ofthe Cases
Although many more Americans were living in urban areas, most states had not redrawn their political districts to reflect this shift. This gave rural voters more political influence than urban voters. In Baker v. Carr, the Supreme Court ruled on whether federal courts had jurisdiction in lawsuits seeking to force states to redraw their electoral districts. In Reynolds v. Sims, the Court decided whether uneven electoral districts violated the equal protection clause ofthe Fourteenth Amendment.
How the Court Ruled
In Baker v. Carr, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts can hear lawsuits seeking to force state authorities to redraw electoral districts. In Reynolds v. Sims, the Court ruled that the inequality of representation in the Alabama legislature did violate the equal protection clause. These rulings forced states to reapportion their political districts according to the principle of"one person, one vote."

In the Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona, attorneys argued that Ernesto Miranda (right) had no idea of his legal rights and should have been told that he had the right to a lawyer.
CRITICAL THINKING
Drawing Conclusions What can you conclude about what police told suspects before the establishment of Miranda rights? Extending Due Process
The Supreme Court began to use the Fourteenth Amendment to extend the Bill of Rights to the states. Originally, the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government. Many states had their own bills of rights, but some federal rights did not exist at the state level. The Fourteenth Amendment states that “no state shall... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” Due process means that the law may not treat individuals unfairly, arbitrarily, or unreasonably. The Court ruled in several cases that due process
meant applying the federal Bill of Rights to the states. In 1961 the Supreme Court ruled in Mapp v. Ohio that state courts could not consider evidence obtained in violation of the U.S. Constitution. In Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), the Court ruled that a defendant in a state court had the right to a lawyer, regardless of his or her ability to pay. In Escobedo v. Illinois (1964), the Court ruled that suspects must be allowed access to a lawyer and informed of their right to remain silent before being questioned. Miranda v. Arizona (1966) went further, requiring authorities to inform suspects of their right to remain silent; that anything they say can and will be used against them in court; and that they have a right to a lawyer. These warnings are known as Miranda rights.
due process a judicial requirement that laws may not treat individuals unfairly, arbitrarily, or unreasonably, and that courts must follow proper procedures and rules when trying cases
Prayer and Privacy
The Supreme Court also reaffirmed the separation of church and state. The Court applied the First Amendment to the states in Engel v. Vitale (1962), ruling that states could not compose official prayers and require those prayers to be recited in public schools. In Abington School District v. Schempp (1963), it ruled against state-mandated Bible readings in public schools. The Court ruled in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) that prohibiting the sale and use of birth control devices violated citizens’ constitutional right to privacy. As with most rulings of the Warren Court, some people supported these decisions and others did not. What most people did agree upon, however, was the Court’s pivotal role in shaping national policy. These decisions continue to shape the way Americans act and behave today

It Matters Because
During the Kennedy administration, ongoing tensions with the Soviet Union led to crises over Cuba and West Berlin. To contain communism and stay ahead in technology, President Kennedy created aid programs for developing nations and expanded the space program.
Containing Communism
guiding question How were President Kennedy's programs to combat communism different from the programs of previous administrations?
When John F. Kennedy entered the White House in 1961, the Cold War with the Soviet Union dominated all other concerns. He used a range of programs to try to stop the spread of communism. These included a conventional weaponry program to give the nations military more flexibility. The programs also included economic aid to Latin America and the creation of the Peace Corps to help developing nations.
A
More Flexible Response Kennedy took office at a time of growing global instability. Resentment at wealthy Western nations was on the rise in the developing world, often encouraged by the Soviet Union. Kennedy felt that Eisenhower had relied too heavily on nuclear weapons.
To allow for a "flexible response" to resist Communist movements, the president pushed for a buildup of troops and conventional weapons. He also expanded the Special Forces, an elite army unit used in limited conflicts.
Despite his commitment to flexible response, Kennedy had warned against a “missile gap” during his campaign. Although no gap actually existed, the United States began a massive build-up of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) armed with nuclear warheads. At the time Kennedy took office, less than 20 ICBMS were deployed by the United States, and only 50 new Minuteman missiles were planned. The Soviet Union had less than 10 ICBNls

ready to fire at the United States. Nonetheless, Kennedy decided to build 1000 Minutemen ICBMS. The decision continued the arms race for the remainder of the 1960s and into the 1970s. Tensions increased as the Sovi began their own mass production of missiles, and began to look for other ways to ensure they could match the firepower of the United States.
Aid to Other Countries
Kennedy wanted to renew diplomatic focus on Latin America, where governments were often in the hands of the wealthy few and many people lived in extreme poverty. In some countries, these conditions spurred the growth of left-wing movements aimed at overthrowing their government In his Inaugural Address, President Kennedy said, “To our sister republic south of our border, we offer a special pledge—to convert our good word into good deeds—in a new alliance for progress. . . .”
When the United States became involved in Latin America, it was usually to help existing governments stay in power and to prevent Communist movements from flourishing. Poor Latin Americans resente( this intrusion, just as they resented American corporations, whose presei was seen as a kind of imperialism.
The Alliance for Progress To improve relations between the United Stat and Latin America, Kennedy proposed the Alliance for Progress, a series of cooperative aid projects with Latin American governments. The Alliance was designed to create a “free and prosperous Latin America” that wou! be more stable and less likely to support Communist-inspired revolutions.
Over a 10-year period, the United States pledged $20 billion to help Latin American countries establish better schools, housing, health care, < fairer land distribution. The results were mixed. In some countries, the Alliance did promote real reform. In others, local rulers used the money keep themselves in power.
The Peace Corps Another program aimed at helping developing nations fight poverty was the Peace Corps. This program sent Americans to provide humanitarian services in developing nations. After rigorous training,

volunteers spent two years in countries that requested assistance. Among other projects. Peace Corps volunteers built roads, taught English, laid out sewage systems, and trained medical technicians.
The Cold War in Space
In 1961 Yury Gagarin (YUR.ee guh.GAHR.uhn), a Soviet astronaut, became the first person to orbit Earth. Again, as in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik, the first satellite, the Soviets had beaten the United States in the space race. Kennedy worried that Soviet successes in space might convince the world that communism was better than capitalism. Less than six weeks after the Soviet flight, the president went before Congress and declared:
I believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before
this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon.” Kennedy’s speech set in motion a massive effort to develop the necessary technology. In 1962 John Glenn became the first American to orbit Earth. Six years later, the United States sent three men into orbit in a capsule called Apollo. The capsule was launched using the Saturn V, the most powerful rocket ever built. The Saturn V gave both Apollo and its lunar module—which astronauts would use to land on the moon—enough velocity to reach the moon.
On July 16, 1969, a Saturn V lifted off in Florida, carrying three American astronauts: Neil Armstrong, Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, and Michael Collins. On July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin boarded the lunar module, named Eagle, and headed down to the moon. Minutes later, Armstrong radioed NASA’s flight center in Texas: “Houston . . . the Eagle has landed.” Armstrong became the first human being to walk on the moon. As he set foot on the lunar surface, he announced: “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” The United States had demonstrated its technological superiority over the Soviet Union.
In 1962 John Glenn was the first American to orbit Earth.

In addition, the moon landing represented a potential turning point in human history. For the first time, human beings had walked on the surface of another world. Although no one has gone any further from home in the nearly 50 years that have passed since the first moon landing, the success of the mission demonstrated that human beings might one day set out to colonize other worlds.
The space program also set in motion an enormous wave of technological innovation that continues to shape the world today. The requirement for clear communications with the astronauts led to improved transmission technology, making possible the use of satellites to transmit

Navigational concerns led to improvements in computer technology, particularly involving the use of integrated circuits build computers that could fit in the space available.
Other inventions resulting from the space program that have improve our way of life include water filters, new types of insulation, flame resista: fabrics, the CAT scanner, memory foam for beds and chairs, and new typ of rubber, now used in running shoes and hiking boots. Innovations in robotics for the space program went on to benefit manufacturers around world and helped drive down the price of goods.
In general, the moon landing boosted the confidence of Americans ai enhanced the nation’s stature abroad. If the United States could put men < the moon, what could it not do? Three years later, in the wake of the succ of the Apollo missions, President Nixon approved the development of a r reusable spacecraft that would later be known as the Space Shuttle.

Crises of the Cold War
guiding questions What was the most important foreign policy event of the Kennedy administrate Why was it the most important event?
President Kennedy’s efforts to combat Communist influence in other countries led to some of the most intense crises of the Cold War. At time these crises left Americans and people in many other nations wondering whether the world would survive.
The Bay of Pigs

Fulgencio Batista in 1959. At once, Castro established ties with the Soviet Union, instituted drastic land reforms, and seized foreign-owned businesses, many of which were American. Cuba’s alliance with the Soviets worried many Americans. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev was also expressing his hope to strengthen Cuba’s military.
Fearing that the Soviets would use Cuba as a base from which to spread revolution, President Eisenhower had authorized the CIA to secretly train and arm a group of Cuban exiles, known as Lu Brigada, to invade the island. His goal was to set off a popular uprising against Castro. When Kennedy became president, his advisers approved the plan. Kennedy agreed to the operation with some changes. On April 17, 1961, about 1,400 armed Cuban exiles landed at the Bay of Pigs on the south coast of Cuba. The invasion was a disaster. Lu Brigada s boats ran aground on coral reefs. Then Kennedy canceled their air support to keep the United States’s involvement a secret. The expected popular uprising never happened. Within two days, Castro’s forces killed or captured almost all the members of Lu Brigada.
The Bay of Pigs was a dark moment for the Kennedy administration. The incident exposed an American plot to overthrow a neighbor’s government. The disastrous outcome made the United States look weak and disorganized.
The Berlin Wall Goes Up
In June 1961, Kennedy faced another foreign policy challenge when he met with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna, Austria. To stop Germans from leaving Communist East Germany for West Berlin, Khrushchev demanded that the Western powers recognize East Germany and withdraw from Berlin. Berlin was a city lying completely within East Germany. Kennedy refused and reaffirmed the West’s commitment to West Berlin.
Khrushchev retaliated by building a wall through Berlin, blocking movement between the Soviet sector and the rest of the city. Guards along the wall shot at people who tried to cross from East Berlin to West Berlin. The Berlin Wall stood as a symbol of Cold War divisions.
The Cuban Missile Crisis
During the summer of 1962, American intelligence learned that Soviet technicians and equipment had arrived in Cuba and that military construction was in progress. On October 22, Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union had placed long-range nuclear missiles in Cuba. This location made them a clear threat to the United States.
Kennedy ordered a naval quarantine to stop the delivery of more missiles, and demanded the existing missile sites be dismantled. He warned that if attacked, the United States would respond fully against the Soviet Union. Still, work on the missile sites continued. Nuclear warfare seemed more possible than ever.
Then, after a flurry of secret negotiations, the Soviet Union offered to remove the missiles if the United States promised not to invade Cuba.
The United States also agreed to remove its missiles from Turkey near the Soviet border.
In reality, neither Kennedy nor Khrushchev wanted nuclear war. Only lunatics or suicides, who themselves want to perish and to destroy the whole world before they die, could do this, wrote Khrushchev. We . . . want to live and do not at all want to destroy your country.” On October 28, the leaders reached an agreement. The world could breathe again.

In the wake of the assassination, the United States and much of the world went into mourning. Kennedy was president for little more than 1,000 days. Yet he made a profound impression on most Americans. Kennedy’s successor, Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson, set out to promote many of the programs that Kennedy left unfinished.

Using a Problem Solving Process Why Learn This Skill?
Life is full of choices. Imagine that you have just done poorly on a chemistry exam. You wonder why you cannot do better since you always go to class, take notes, and study for exams. In order to improve your grades, you need to identify the specific problem and then take actions to solve it.
Learning the Skill
There are six key steps you should follow that will help you through the problem-solving process.
1.	Identify the problem. Be specific.
Problems can be too big to be solved, but when broken into smaller problems, each in turn may be solvable. Focus on exactly one specific thing that is a problem and should be fixed.
2.	Gather information. This is critical. Many problems are the result of poor communication or a lack of facts. Be sure you have collected all the facts you need, that the facts are accurate and that you have a clear understanding of what everyone involved has said or done before.
3.	List and consider possible solutions. As much as possible keep emotion out of your thinking. People often are inclined to support a solution that makes them feel better or is in their interest, forgetting all of the other people who will be affected by the solution that is put in place.
4.	Consider the advantages and
disadvantages of each solution. Look at both short-term and long-term outcomes. A quick fix that does not take enough facts into account will just break down and cause new problems in the future.
5.	Now that you have listed and considered the possible options, choose the best solution to your problem and put it into effect.
32A
6.	Evaluate the effectiveness of the solution. Did it work? Is the problem solved? Has solving the problem created new problems? If so, return to the problem solving process.
Practicing the Skill
Go to the lesson, "The New Frontier" and reread the section, "Kennedy Takes Office". Use that information and the steps listed on this page to answer the following questions.
1.	What problem did Kennedy encounter in the summer of 1962 when American intelligence studied photos of Cuba?
2.	What options were available to the president to deal with the situation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of each solution?
3.	Explain the solution Kennedy implemented to solve his problem.
4.	Evaluate the effectiveness of Kennedy's solution. Was it successful? How do you determine this?
Applying the Skill
Problem Solving Do research at the library or online at a news website and identify a significant problem facing your local community. Gather information and be sure you have accurate data and a clear understanding ofthe situation. Write a comment that you could send to a newspaper or post online that describes the problem, lists the options, and their advantages and disadvantages. Propose a solution, and give your evaluation ofthe chosen solution.

guiding question How did President Johnson's experience in Congress help him get legislation passed?
Just hours after President Kennedy had been pronounced dead, Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office in the cabin of Air Force One. Days later, Johnson appeared before Congress and urged the nation to build on Kennedy’s legacy. Although the nation was booming, not all Americans shared in its prosperity. In his 1962 bo The Other America, Michael Harrington claimed that almost 50 million poor Americans lived largely hidden in slums, Appalacb the Deep South, and Native American reservations. Soon after taki office, Johnson decided to launch an antipoverty crusade. Johnson's Leadership Style
Lyndon Baines Johnson was born and raised in the “hill country” c central Texas, near the banks of the Pedernales River. Johnson remained a Texan in his heart, and his style posed a striking contrz with Kennedy’s. He was a man of impressive stature who spoke directly, convincingly, and even roughly at times. He earned a reputation as a man who got things done. He did favors, twisted ar bargained, flattered, and threatened in order to find consensus/ 01 general agreement. His ability to build coalitions had made him or the most effective and powerful leaders in Senate history.
Why was Johnson concerned about the poor? He had known hard times growing up, and had seen extreme poverty firsthand i brief career as a teacher in a low-income area. He also believed tl wealthy, powerful government should try to improve the lives of citizens. Finally, there was Johnson’s ambition. He wanted histor portray him as a great president.
462
AWar on Poverty	consensus general agreement
Before his death, Kennedy had plans for an antipoverty program and a civil rights
bill. Continuing these efforts seemed logical. Johnson knew that any program
linked to the slain president would be popular. In his State of the Union address in
1964, he said. Unfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts of hope—
some because of their poverty, and some because of their color, and all too many
because of both. Our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity. This
administration ... declares unconditional war on poverty in America.”
By the summer of 1964, Johnson had convinced Congress to pass the
Economic Opportunity Act, which attacked inadequate public services,
illiteracy, and unemployment. The act established 10 new programs within
a new agency, the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO). Many ofthe new
programs were directed at young, inner-city Americans.
The Neighborhood Youth Corps provided work-study programs to help
the underprivileged earn a high school diploma or college degree. The Job
Corps helped unemployed people ages 16-21 acquire job skills. One of the
more dramatic programs introduced was VISTA (Volunteers in Service to
America), which was essentially a domestic Peace Corps. VISTA put young
people with skills and community-minded ideals to work in poor
neighborhoods and rural areas to help people overcome poverty. Additional
programs included Upward Bound, which offered tutoring to high school
students, and a Work Experience Program, which provided day care and other
support for those in poor households to enable them to work.
The Election of 1964
Johnson quickly won public approval, but just as quickly had to run for the office he first gained through tragedy. The Republican candidate in the 1964 election was Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, known for his strong conservatism. “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue,” Goldwater declared when accepting the nomination. Few Americans were ready to embrace Goldwater’s message, which seemed too aggressive for a nation nervous about nuclear war. On Election Day, Johnson won in a landslide, gaining more than 61 percent of the popular vote and winning all but six states in the Electoral College.

After his election, Johnson began working with Congress to create the “Great Society” he had promised during his campaign. His goals reflectec the times. The civil rights movement had brought racial inequalities to tl forefront, and the strong economy encouraged people to believe that pov could be reduced. Johnson noted the Great Society’s goals during a speec in May 1964, aiming not to confine government efforts but to form a soc “where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community.”

subsidy money granted by the government to achieve a specific goal that is beneficial to society
Johnson’s ambitious vision encompassed more than 60 programs initiated between 1965 and 1968, including Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare had strong support because it was offered to all senior citizens: about half of whom lacked health insurance. Medicare’s twin program, Medicaid, financed health care for welfare recipients living below the poverty line. These programs reflected New Deal ideals by entitling categories of Americans to benefits.
Great Society programs also strongly supported education. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 granted millions of dollars to public and private schools. Education efforts also extended to preschoolers through Project Head Start, for disadvantaged children wh had never looked at a picture book or scribbled with a crayon.”
Johnson also urged Congress to act on several pieces of legislation addressing urban issues. One created a new cabinet agency, the Departm of Housing and Urban Development, in 1965. Its first secretary, Robert Weaver, was the first African American to serve in the cabinet. A broad-based program informally called “Model Cities” authorized federal subsi to many cities to improve transportation, health care, housing, and polic

One notable Great Society measure changed the composition ofthe American population: the Immigration Act of 1965. This act ended the system established in the 1920s that gave preference to northern European immigrants. The new law opened wider the door ofthe United States to immigrants from all parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa.
The Great Society's Legacy
Great Society programs touched nearly every aspect of American life and improved many lives. In the years since Johnson left office, however, debate has continued over whether the Great Society was truly a success. In many ways, the impact of the Great Society was limited. Some programs did not work as well as hoped. In many cases, the programs grew so quickly they became unmanageable and difficult to evaluate.
Cities, states, and groups eligible for aid began to expect immediate and life-changing benefits. Other Americans opposed the massive growth of federal programs. When Johnson attempted to fund both his grand domestic agenda and the increasingly costly war in Vietnam, the Great Society eventually suffered. Some Great Society initiatives have survived, however, including Medicare and Medicaid, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Project Head Start. Overall, the programs provided some important benefits to poor communities and gave political and administrative experience to minority groups.
The Great Society’s attempt to create more economic opportunity did have some unintended consequences. The cost of Medicare began to expand rapidly, in part because of the rising costs of medical care and new medical technology, and in part because of the tendency of Congress to add more and more items to what Medicare covers. In addition, as baby boomers aged, the number of people signing up for Medicare became a greater proportion of the population. Because Medicare is an entitlement program, the government is obligated to make payments, and this has contributed to deficit spending and the rise in the national debt.
Critics of the Great Society have also argued that far from ending poverty, the various programs of the War on Poverty and Great Society actually fostered a culture of dependency and a new permanent “underclass.” According to this argument, people in the underclass were trapped, unable to improve their economic circumstances, because they had become too reliant on government programs.

The civil rights movement gained momentum rapidly after World War II. Supreme Court rulings, massive protests by civil rights groups, and new federal legislation all combined to make racial segregation illegal in the United States.

CHAPTER 16
Place andTime: United States 1954-1968
Rosa Parks made a decision in December 1955 that ignited a movement to end segregation and achieve civil liberties for all Americans. A young pastor by the name of Martin Luther King, Jr., spearheaded efforts to reach these goals. By the mid-1960s, civil rights activists had gained two important pieces of legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

It Matters Because
After World War II, African Americans and other civil rights supporters challenged segregation in the United States. Their efforts were strongly opposed by Southern segregationists. Eventually, the federal government begar to take a firmer stand for civil rights.
The Origins of the Movement
guidingquestion What techniques did the civil rights movement useto challenge segregatioi
On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks left her job as a seamstress in Montgomery, Alabama, and boarded a bus to go home. In 1955, buses in Montgomery reserved seats in the front for whites and seats in the rear for African Americans. Seats in the middle were available to African Americans only if there were few whites on the bus. Parks took a seat just behind the white section, and soon all ol the seats on the bus were filled. When the driver noticed a white man standing, he told Parks and three other African Americans in her row to get up so the white man could sit down. When Parks did not move, the driver called the police.
News of Parks’s arrest reached the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which asked Parks whether her case could be used to challenge segregation. Parks replied, “If you think it will mean something to Montgomery and do some good, I’ll be happy to go along with it.”
Parks’s decision would spark a new era in the civil rights movement. The struggle would not be easy. In 1896 the Supreme Court had declared segregation to be constitutional in Plessy v. Ferguson, which established the "separate but equal" doctrine. Laws that segregated African Americans were permitted as long as equal facilities were provided. The facilities provided for Africa Americans, however, were usually of poorer quality than those provided for whites. Areas without laws requiring segregation often had de facto segregation—segregation by custom and tradition.

Court Challenges Begin
Aw'^pp ^movement had been building for a long time. Since 1909, 6	a supported court cases aimed at overturning segregation.
Over the years, the NAACP had achieved some victories. In 1935, for example,
the Supreme Court ruled in Norris v. Alabama that exclusion of African Americans from juries violated their rights to equal protection under the law.
New Political Power
African Americans also enjoyed increased political power. Northern politicians increasingly sought their votes and listened to their concerns. During the 1930s, many African Americans benefited from New Deal programs and began supporting the Democratic Party. This gave the party new strength in the North. The northern wing of the party was now able to counter Southern Democrats, who often supported segregation.
The Push for Desegregation
During World War II, African American leaders began to use their political power to help end discrimination in wartime factories. They also increased opportunities for African Americans in the military.
In 1942 James Farmer and George Houser founded the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in Chicago. CORE began using sit-ins, a form of protest first popularized by union workers in the 1930s, to desegregate restaurants that refused to serve African Americans. Using the sit-in strategy,

iiiiiiii ANALYZING SUPREME COURT CASES
BROWN v. BOARD OF
EDUCATION (1954)
Background of the Case
One of the most important Supreme Court cases in American history began in 1952, when the Supreme Court agreed to hear the NAACP's case Brown v. Board ofEducation of Topeka, Kansas, and three other cases. They all dealt with the question of whether the principle "separate but equal," established in Plessy v. Ferguson, was constitutional with regard to public schools.
How the Court Ruled
In a unanimous decision in 1954, the Court ruled in favor of Linda Brown and the other plaintiffs. In doing so, it overruled Plessy v. Ferguson. It rejected the idea that equivalent but separate schools for African American and white students were constitutional. The Court held that racial segregation in public schools violated the Fourteenth Amendments equal protection clause. Chief Justice Earl Warren summed up the Courts decision, declaring:"[I]n the field of public education, the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."The Court's rejection of "separate but equal" was a major victory for the civil rights movement. It led to the overturning of laws requiring segregation in other public places.
The children involved in the Brown v. Board of Education case are shown in this 1953 photograph. They are, from front to back, Vicki Henderson, Donald Henderson, Linda Brown (of the case title), James Emanuel, Nancy Todd, and Katherine Carper. Together, their cases led to the Supreme Court decision that public schools could not be segregated on the basis of race.

Brown v. Board of Education
After World War II, the NAACP continued to challenge segregation in th courts. From 1939 to 1961, the NAACP’s chief counsel and director of its Legal Defense and Educational Fund was African American attorney Thurgood Marshall. After the war, Marshall focused his efforts on ending segregation in public schools.
In 1954 the Supreme Court decided to combine several cases and isst general ruling on segregation in schools. One of the cases involved a youi African American girl named Linda Brown, who was denied admission t< her neighborhood school in Topeka, Kansas, because of her race. She was told to attend an all-black school across town. With the help of the NAA( her parents sued the Topeka school board. On May 17, 1954, the Supremi Court ruled unanimously in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kans that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., used his position as a minister to preach his message of nonviolent resistance.
CRITICALTHINKING
Drawing Conclusions Why do you think Dr. King was effective in getting his message across?
Southern Resistance
The Brown decision marked a dramatic reversal of the precedent establisl in the Plessy v. Ferguson case in 1896. Brown v. Board of Education applies only to public schools, but the ruling threatened the entire system of segregation. Although it convinced many African Americans that the tirr had come to challenge segregation, it also angered many white Southerm Some became even more determined to defend segregation, regardless of what the Supreme Court ruled.
Although some school districts in the Upper South integrated their schools, anger and opposition was a far more common reaction. Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia called on Southerners to adopt “massive resistance” against the ruling. Across the South, hundreds of thousands c white Americans joined citizens’ councils to pressure their local governments and school boards into defying the Supreme Court. Many states adopted pupil assignment laws, which established elaborate requirements other than race that schools could use to prevent African Americans from attending white schools.
The Supreme Court inadvertently encouraged white resistance when followed up its decision in Brown v. Board of Education a year later. The Court ordered school districts to proceed “with all deliberate speed” to e school segregation. The wording was vague enough that many districts were able to keep their schools segregated for many more years.
Massive resistance also appeared in Congress. In 1956 a group of 101 Southern members of Congress signed the “Southern Manifesto.” It denounced the Supreme Court’s ruling as “a clear abuse of judicial power” and pledged to use “all lawful means” to *	reverse the decision. Not until 1969 did the
Supreme Court order all school systems to desegregate “at once” and operate integrated schools “now and hereafter.”

The Civil Rights Movement Begins
guiding question Why was the Montgomery bus boycott successful?
In the midst of the uproar over the Brown v. Board of Education case, Rosa Parks made her decision to challenge segregation of public transportation. Jo Ann Robinson, head of a local group called the Womens Political Council, called on African Americans to boycott Montgomerys buses on the day Rosa Parks appeared in court. The boycott marked the start of a new era of the civil rights movement among African Americans.
The Montgomery Bus Boycott
The Montgomery bus boycott had a successful outcome.
Several African American leaders formed the Montgomery
Improvement Association to run the boycott and to negotiate with city leaders. They elected a 26-year-old pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., to lead them.
Dr. King encouraged the people to continue their protest, but cautioned that the protest had to be peaceful:
PRIMARY SOURCE
African Americans walk to work during the third month of the Montgomery bus boycott.
CRITICAL THINKING
Determining Cause and Effect Consider the number of people you see walking in this photograph. Why do you think the bus boycott was effective?
« Now let us say that we are not advocating violence.... The only weapon that we have in our hands this evening is the weapon of protest.... If we were incarcerated behind the iron curtains of a communistic nation—we couldn't do this. If we were trapped in the dungeon of a totalitarian regime—we couldn't do this. But the great glory of American democracy is the right to protest for right. W
—quoted in Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1989
King had earned a Ph.D. in theology from Boston University. He believed that the only moral way to end segregation and racism was through nonviolent passive resistance. African Americans, he urged, must say to racists, “[W]e will soon wear you down by our capacity to suffer. And in winning our freedom we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process.”
King’s powerful words stirred African Americans in Montgomery to continue their boycott for over a year. In November 1956, the Supreme Court declared Alabama’s laws requiring segregation on buses unconstitutional.
After the Court’s ruling, the Montgomery boycott was ended. Many other cities in the South, however, successfully resisted integrating their public transportation systems for years.
African American Churches
Martin Luther King, Jr., was not the only local minister in the bus boycott. Many of the other leaders were African American ministers. African American churches served as forums for protests and planning meetings and mobilized volunteers.
The Montgomery bus boycott had demonstrated that nonviolent protest could be successful. Dr. King, Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth of Birmingham, Alabama, and other African American ministers and civil rights activists established the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957. The SCLC set out to eliminate segregation and to encourage African Americans to register to vote. Dr. King served as the SCLC’s first president. The organization challenged segregation at voting booths and in public transportation, housing, and accommodations.

The Civil Rights Movement 475
Eisenhower Responds
GUIDING QUESTION
How did President Eisenhower respond to the civil rights movement? President Eisenhower sympathized with the civil rights movement, yet he feared the possible effect of a court ruling overturning segregation. Following the precedent set by President Truman, he ordered navy shipyards and veterans’ hospitals to desegregate. At the same time, Eisenhower disagreed with using protests and court rulings. He believed segregation and racism would end gradually, as values changed. With the nation in the midst of the Cold War, he worried that challenging white Southerners might divide the nation. Publicly, he refused to endorse the Brown v. Board of Education decision, remarking, “I don’t believe you car change the hearts of men with laws or decisions.” Regardless, Eisenhowei knew he had to uphold the authority of the federal government. As a result, he became the first president since Reconstruction to send troops into the South to protect the rights of African Americans.
Arkansas governor Orval Faubus is shown holding up a paper arguing that the federal government was abusing its power by forcibly integrating Central High.
CRITICAL THINKING
Identifying Central Ideas Why did President Eisenhower send troops to Little Rock?
Crisis in Little Rock
In September 1957, the school board in Little Rock, Arkansas, was under federal court order requiring that nine African American students be admitted to Central High. The governor of Arkansas, Orval Faubus, was determined to win reelection. He began to campaign as a defender of wh:
supremacy. He ordered troops from the Arkansas National Guard to prevent the nine students from entering the school, the National Guard troops surrounded the school, an angry white mob gathered to intimidate students.
Faubus had used the armed forces of a state to oppose the federal government—the first such challenge to the Constitution since the Civil War. Eisenhower knew that he could not allow Faubus to defy the federal government. After a conference between Eisenhower and Faubus proved fruitless, the district court ordered the governor to remove the troops. Instead of ending the crisis, however, Faubus simply left the school to tl mob. After the African American students entered the building, angry whites beat at least two African American reporters and broke many windows.

New Civil Rights Legislation
In the same year that the Little Rock crisis began, Congress passed the first civil rights law since Reconstruction. The Civil Rights Act of 1957 intended to protect the right of African Americans to vote. Eisenhower believed firmly in the right to vote, and he viewed it as his responsibilit to protect voting rights. He also knew that if he sent a civil rights bill tc Congress, conservative Southern Democrats would try to block the

legislation. In 1956 he did send the bill to Congress, hoping not only to split the Democratic Party but also to convince more African Americans to vote Republican.
Several Southern senators did try to stop the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Senate majority leader Democrat Lyndon Johnson, however, put together a compromise that enabled the act to pass. Although its final form was much weaker than originally intended, the act still brought the power of the federal government into the civil rights debate. It created a Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice and gave it the authority to seek court injunctions against anyone interfering with the right to vote.

VOCABULARY
The Civil Rights
Movement Although major figures of the civil rights movement such as Martin Luther King, Jr., are widely remembered today, the movement drew its strength from the dedication of grassroots supporters. In rural and urban areas across the South, ordinary individuals advanced the movement through their participation in marches, boycotts, and voter registration drives. Those who dared to make a stand against discrimination risked being fired from their job, evicted from their home, and becoming the target of physical violence.

And I said, ‘Yes sir.’ He said, ‘I mean that... If you don’t go down and withdraw ... well—you might have to go because we are not ready for that.’...

“All during the years, while the NAACP conducted a boycott of the downtown stores in Jackson, I had been one of [John] Salter’s most faithful canvassers and church speakers.
During the last week of school, he told me that sit-in demonstrations were about to start in Jackson and that he wanted me to be the spokesman for a team that would sit-in at Woolworth’s lunch counter.
... Seconds before 11:15 we were occupying three seats at the previously segregated Woolworth’s lunch counter. In the beginning the waitresses seemed to ignore us, as if they really didn’t know what was going on. Our waitress walked past us a couple of times before she noticed we had started to write our own orders down and realized we wanted service. She asked us what we wanted. We began to read to her from our order slips. She told us that we would be served at the back counter, which was for Negroes.
‘We would like to be served here,’ I said.
The waitress started to repeat what she had said, then stopped in the middle ofthe sentence. She turned the lights out behind the counter, and she and the other waitresses almost ran to the back ofthe store, deserting all their white customers. I

At noon, students from a nearby white high school started pouring in to Woolworth’s.
When they first saw us they were sort of surprised.... [T]he white students started chanting all kinds of anti-Negro slogans. We were called a little bit of everything....
A man rushed forward, threw Memphis from his seat, and slapped my face. Then another man who worked in the store threw me against adjoining counter.... The mob started smearing us with ketchup, mustard, sugar, pies, and everything on the counter.... About ninety policemen were standing outside the store; they had been watching the whole thing through the windows, but had not come in to stop the mob or do anything....

The Sit-in Movement
guiding question	were the goals of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Commit
In the fall of 1959, four young African Americans—Joseph McN( Ezell Blair, Jr., David Richmond, and Franklin McCain—enrolled at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, an African American college in Greensboro. The four freshmen often talked about the civil rights movement. In January 1960, McNeil suggested a sit-in. “All of us were afraid,” Richmond later recalled. “But w< went and did it.”
On February 1, 1960, the four friends entered the nearby Woolworth’s department store. They purchased school supplies and then sat at the whites-only lunch counter and ordered coffee When they were refused service, Blair asked, “I beg your pardon, but you just served us at [the checkout] counter. Why can’t we be served at the counter here?” The students stayed at the counter unt it closed. They then stated that they would sit there daily until th< got the same service as white customers. They left the store excite McNeil recalled, “I just felt I had powers within me, a superhuma strength that would come forward.” McCain noted, “I probably fe better that day than I’ve ever felt in my life.”
News of the daring sit-in spread quickly. The following day,

Within two months, sit-ins had spread to 54 cities in ni states. They were staged at segregated stores, restaurants, hotels, an movie theaters. By 1961, sit-ins had been held in more than 100 cit.

The sit-in movement brought large numbers of idealistic and energized college students into the civil rights struggle. Many were discouraged by the slow pace of desegregation. Sit-ins offered them a way to dictate the pace of change.
At first, the leaders of the NAACP and the SCLC were nervous about the sit-in campaign. Those conducting sit-ins were heckled, punched, kicked, beaten with clubs, and burned with cigarettes, hot coffee, and acid. Most did not fight back.
Urged on by former NAACP official and SCLC executive director Ella Baker, students established the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960. African American college students from all across the South made up the majority of SNCC’s members. Many whites also joined.
SNCC became an important civil rights group.
Volunteer Robert Moses urged the SNCC to start helping rural Southern African Americans, who often faced violence if they tried to register to vote. Many SNCC volunteers, including Moses, bravely headed south as part of a voter education project. During a period of registration efforts in 1964 known as Freedom Summer, the Ku Klux Kian brutally murdered three SNCC workers with the complicity of local officials.
SNCC organizer and sharecropper Fannie Lou Hamer was evicted from her farm after registering to vote. Police arrested her in Mississippi as she was returning from a voter registration workshop in 1963. They beat her while she was in jail. She still went on to help organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and challenged the legality of the state’s segregated Democratic Party at the 1964 national convention.

guidingquestion Howdid the Kennedy administration's Justice Department help the civil rights movement?
Despite rulings outlawing segregation in interstate bus service, bus travel remained segregated in much of the South. Alabama was one state in which many bus terminals were still segregated. Alabama’s governor, John Patterson, was known to be in favor of segregation. As attorney general of the state, he had banned the NAACP from being active in Alabama, and he had fought the bus boycotts.
In early May 1961, teams of African American and white volunteers who became known as Freedom Riders boarded several southbound interstate buses. Buses were met by angry white mobs in Anniston, Birmingham, and Montgomery, Alabama. The mobs slit bus tires and threw rocks at the windows. In Anniston, someone threw a firebomb into one bus. Fortunately, no one was killed.
In Birmingham, riders emerged from a bus to face a gang of young men armed with baseball bats, chains, and lead pipes. The gang beat the riders

FBI evidence later showed that Connor had told the local Kian to beat the rid< until “it looked like a bulldog got a hold of them.” The violence made national news, shocking many Americans and drawing the federal governments attention to the plight of African Americans in the South.
Kennedy and Civil Rights
While campaigning for the presidency in 1960, John F. Kennedy had promised to support civil rights. Civil rights leaders such as NAACP executive director Roy Wilkins urged Kennedy to support civil rights legislation after taking office. However, Kennedy knew he needed the support of Southern senators to get other programs through Congress and any new civil rights legislation would anger them.
Kennedy did, however, bring approximately 40 African Americans into high-level government positions. He appointed Thurgood Marshall to a federal judgeship on the Second Circuit Appeals Court in New York. Kennedy also created the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity (CEEO). He allowed the Justice Department, run by his brother Robert, t< actively support the civil rights movement. The department tried to help African Americans register to vote by filing lawsuits across the South.
After the attacks on the Freedom Riders in Montgomery, both Kennedys publicly urged them to have a “cooling off” period. CORE leader James Farmer rejected the idea and announced that the riders would heac into Mississippi. To stop the violence, President Kennedy made a deal with Mississippi senator James Eastland. No violence occurred when buses arrived in Jackson, but Kennedy did not protest the riders’ arrests.
The cost of bailing the Freedom Riders out of jail used up most of CORE’S funds. When Thurgood Marshall learned of the situation, he offered Farmer the use of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund’s huge bail-boi account to keep the rides going. When President Kennedy found that th Freedom Riders were still active, he ordered the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to tighten its regulations against segregated bus terminals. Robert Kennedy ordered the Justice Department to take lega action against Southern cities that maintained segregated bus terminals By late 1962, segregation in interstate bus travel had virtually ended.
Violence in Birmingh;
Martin Luther King, Jr., decided in the spring of 1 to launch demonstrations Birmingham, Alabama. H knew they would provoke violent response, but he believed it was the only w to get the president to actively support civil rights. Eight days after tl protests began, King was arrested. While in jail, he began writing the “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” It was an eloquent defense < nonviolent protest. In his letter, King argued that “there are two types of la
just and unjust . . . [and] one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. . . . Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality.”
After King was released, the protests began to grow again. Public Safety Commissioner Connor responded with force. He ordered police to use clubs, police dogs, and high-pressure fire hoses on the demonstrators.
One powerful demonstration was called the Childrens March. On May 2, heroic young people marched in groups from churches to downtown businesses. Many were attacked by police, and many were arrested. On September 15, 1963, the Ku Klux Kian bombed Birmingham’s Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, killing four young girls. News reports of these attacks on children led to greater support for the civil rights movement.

Events in Alabama grew more and more tragic. At his inauguration as Alabama’s governor, George Wallace had stated, “I draw a line in the dust . . . and I say, Segregation now! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!” On June 11, 1963, federal marshals had to order Wallace to move from where he stood in front of the University of Alabama’s admissions office to block two African Americans from enrolling. The next day, a white segregationist murdered civil rights activist Medgar Evers in Mississippi. Evers had been the NAACP’s first field secretary, and had focused his efforts on voter registration and boycotts. His death made him a martyr of the civil rights movement. Amid these events, President Kennedy announced a civil rights bill.
The March on Washington
Civil rights leaders kept the pressure on legislators and the president by planning a large-scale march on Washington. On August 28, 1963, more than 250,000 demonstrators, African American and white, gathered near the Lincoln Memorial. They heard speeches and sang songs. Dr. King then delivered a powerful speech calling for freedom and equality for all Americans.

The Bill Becomes Law
Kennedy tried and failed to win passage of civil rights legislation. After h assassination in November 1963, Lyndon Johnson—former leader of the Senate Democrats—became president. He had helped pass the Civil Right Acts of 1957 and 1960, but had done so by weakening their provisions an by compromising with other Southern senators.
Nevertheless, Johnson worked to get Kennedy’s civil rights legislatic through Congress. The bill passed the House of Representatives in February 1964. Then it stalled in the Senate for several weeks. Its opponents used a filibuster, a tactic in which senators speak continuously to preven vote. In June the Senate voted for cloture—to end debate and take a vote with a vote of 71 for and 29 against. The Senate then easily passed the bil On July 2, 1964, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the most comprehensive civil rights law Congress had ever enacted. The law made segregation illegal in most places of public accommodation, and it gave citizens of all races and nationalities eqw access to public facilities. The law gave the U.S. attorney general more power to bring lawsuits to force school desegregation and required private employers i end discrimination in the workplace. It also established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as a permanent federal agency.
The law also went further than simply banning discrimination based race. It also banned discrimination based on religion, gender, and nation origin. For religious minorities, for immigrants, and for women, the act represented a dramatic step forward in expanding their political rights ai economic opportunities as well.
The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 immediately raised constitutional issues. The act banned racial discrimination in facilities ar businesses that served the general public. It specifically banned any type hotel, restaurant, theater, or entertainment venue from discrimination. Y was unclear whether the federal government had jurisdiction under the Constitution to regulate these businesses.
Article 1, section 8, gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, but prior to 1964, hotels, restaurants, and theaters had been regulated by state governments, and few would have argued that they were engaged in interstate commerce. As a result, challenges to the law’s constitutionality began immediately. The owner of the Heart of Atlanta M<

The Struggle for Voting Rights
guidingquestion Why was the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a turning point in the civil rights movement?
Despite the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, voting rights remained an issue. The Twenty-fourth Amendment, ratified in 1964, helped somewhat. It eliminated poll taxes in
federal (but not state) elections. Convinced that a new law was needed to protect African American voting rights, Dr. King decided to hold another dramatic protest.
The Selma March
In December 1964, Dr. King received the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway, for his work in the civil rights movement. A few weeks later, he announced, “We are not asking, we are demanding the ballot.”
In January 1965, the SCLC and Dr. King selected Selma, Alabama, as the focal point for their campaign for voting rights. Although African Americans made up a majority of Selma’s population, they made up only 3 percent of registered voters. To prevent African Americans from registering to vote, Sheriff Jim Clark had deputized and armed dozens of white citizens. His posse terrorized African Americans. On one occasion, they even used clubs and cattle prods on them. King’s demonstrations in Selma led to the arrest of more than 3,000 African Americans, including schoolchildren, by Sheriff Clark.
To keep pressure on the president and Congress to act, Dr. King joined with SNCC activists and organized a “march for freedom” from Selma to the state capitol in Montgomery, a distance of about 50 miles (80 km). On Sunday, March 7, 1965, the march began. The SCLC’s Hosea Williams and SNCC s John

Lewis led some 600 protesters toward Montgomery.
As the protesters approached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, which led out
of Selma, Sheriff Clark ordered them to disperse. Many protesters were beaten in full view of television cameras. This brutal attack, known later as “Bloody Sunday,” left 70 marchers hospitalized and another 70 injured.
The nation was stunned as it viewed the shocking footage of law enforcement officers beating peaceful demonstrators. Watching the events

The Civil Rights Movement 485
The Voting Rights Act of 1965
On August 3, 1965, the House of Representatives passed the voting rights bill by a wide margin. The following day, the Senate also passed the bill. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 authorized the U.S. attorney general to sen federal examiners to register qualified voters, bypassing local officials whi often refused to register African Americans. The law also suspended discriminatory devices, such as literacy tests, in counties where less than half of all adults had been registered to vote.
The results were dramatic. By the end of the year, almost 250,000 African Americans had registered as new voters. The number of African American elected officials in the South also increased. In 1960, for examf no African American from the South held a seat in the U.S. Congress.
By 2011, there were 44 African American members of Congress.
The passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 marked a turning point the civil rights movement. The movement had now achieved two major legislative goals. Segregation had been outlawed, and new federal laws were in place to prevent discrimination and protect voting rights. After 1965, the movement began to shift its focus. It turned its attention to the problems of African Americans trapped in poverty and living in ghettos many of the nation’s major cities.
The Voting Rights Act of 1965, like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, immediately raised constitutional questions. Historically, each state had been allowed to set the rules regarding eligibility to vote. Article 1 sectio of the Constitution only specifies that each state has to use the same rule for choosing members of Congress as it uses for choosing members of it! state legislature. Article 2 section 1 specifies that each state gets to choos how to select the electors who vote for the president. By banning literacy tests, Congress was imposing a rule on voting, and it was unclear whethi this violated the rights of the states to set voting rules. In 1966, in Katzenbach v. Morgan, the Supreme Court ruled that the 14th Amendm< gave Congress the authority to ban literacy tests and impose voting rule; the state governments.

it Matters Because
By the mid-1960s, much progress had been made in the area of civil rights. However, leaders of the movement began to understand that merely winning political rights for African Americans would not completely solve their economic problems. African American leaders would continue to try to end economic inequality.
Urban Problems
guiding question Why did riots break out in dozens of U.S. cities in the late 1960s?
Despite the passage of civil rights laws in the 1950s and 1960s, racism was still common in American society. Changing the law could not change peoples attitudes, nor did it end urban poverty.
In 1965 approximately 70 percent of African Americans lived in large cities. Even if African Americans had been allowed to move into white neighborhoods, many were stuck in low-paying jobs with little chance of advancement. In 1960 only 15 percent of African Americans held professional, managerial, or clerical jobs, compared to 44 percent of whites. The average income of African American families was only 55 percent of that of the average income for white families. Almost half of African Americans lived in poverty, with an unemployment rate typically twice that of whites.
Poor neighborhoods in the nations major cities were overcrowded and dirty, leading to higher rates of illness and infant mortality. Juvenile delinquency rates rose, as did the rate of young people dropping out of school. Complicating matters even more was a rise in the number of single-parent households.
The Watts Riot
Just five days after President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, a riot erupted in Watts, an African American neighborhood in Los Angeles. Allegations of police brutality served as the catalyst for this uprising. It lasted for six days and required more than 14,000 members of the National Guard and 1,500 law officers to restore

order. Riots broke out in dozens of other American cities between 1964 anc 1968. In Detroit, burning, looting, and conflicts with police and the National Guard resulted in 43 deaths and more than 1,000 wounded in 1967. Property loss was estimated at almost $200 million.
The Kerner Commission
In the same year, President Johnson appointed the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders—headed by Governor Otto Kerner of Illinois—to study the causes of the urban riots and to make recommendations. The Kerner Commission, as it became known, blamed racism for most inner-city problems. “Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal,” it concluded. The commission recommended the creation of inner-city jobs and the construction of new public housing, but with the spending for the Vietnar War, Johnson never endorsed the recommendations of the commission. The Shift to Economic Rights
In the mid-1960s, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., decided to focus on the economic problems that African Americans faced. To call attention to deplorable housing conditions, Dr. King and his wife Coretta moved into a slum apartment in an African American neighborhood in Chicago. He and the SCLC hoped to improve the economic status of African Americans in poor neighborhoods.
The Chicago Movement, however, made little headway. When Dr. King led a march through the all-white suburb of Marquette Park to demonstrat the need for open housing, he was met by angry white mobs more hostile than those in Birmingham and Selma. Mayor Richard J. Daley met with Dr. King and discussed a new program to clean up the slums. Associations o realtors and bankers also agreed to promote open housing. In theory, mortgages and rental property would be available to everyone, regardless race. In practice, little changed.

Stokely Carmichael (1941-1998)
Stokely Carmichael was the founder of the 1960s Black Power movement. As a "Freedom Rider," he traveled to the South to ride on buses in protest of interstate transportation segregation laws. In 1964 Carmichael traveled to Alabama, where he organized an independent political party called the Lowndes County Freedom Organization. The organization's symbol was a black panther. In 1966 he first spoke of a new "Black Power" movement, which both promoted African American pride and advocated the necessity of self-defense in violent situations. Eventually, Carmichael relocated to Guinea, West Africa, where he changed his name to Kwame Ture. He died of cancer in Guinea in 1998.
Malcolm X (1925-1965)
Malcolm X was one of the most controversial black activists of the mid-twentieth century. He converted to the Nation of Islam while imprisoned in the 1940s. Paroled in 1952, he became an anti-white Muslim activist, calling himself "Malcolm X." Distancing himself from the Nation of Islam, he created his own group called the Organization of Afro-American Unity. During a pilgrimage, he began to rethink his social policies. He decided that white people were not inherently evil and that African Americans could enact change through traditional means. Malcolm X's new viewpoints drew harsh criticism from the Nation of Islam. On February 21,1965, three African American gunmen assassinated him.
Black Power
guidingquestion Why did many young African Americans join the black power movement?
Dr. King’s lack of progress in Chicago seemed to show that nonviolent protests could do little to solve economic problems. After 1965, many African Americans, especially urban young people, began to turn away from King. Some leaders called for more aggressive forms of protest. Some organizations, including CORE and SNCC, believed that African Americans alone should lead their struggle. Many young African Americans called for black power, a term that had many meanings. A few, including Robert F. Williams and H. Rap Brown, interpreted black power to mean that physical self-defense was acceptable.
To most, including Stokely Carmichael, the leader of SNCC in 1966, the term meant that African Americans should control the social, political, and economic direction of their struggle:
black power the mobilization of the political and economic power of African Americans, especially to compel respect for their rights and to improve their condition
PRIMARY SOURCE
MThis is the significance of black power as a slogan. For once, black people are going to use the words they want to use—not just the words whites want to hear.... The need for psychological equality is the reason why SNCC today believes that blacks must organize in the black community. Only black people can... create in the community an aroused and continuing black consciousness.
—from "What We Want," the New York Review of Books, September 1966
Black power stressed pride in the African American cultural group. It emphasized racial distinctiveness rather than adapting to the dominant culture. African Americans showed pride in their racial heritage by adopting new “Afro” hairstyles and African-style clothing. Many also took
The Civil Rights Movement 489
enforcement the act of
urging or carrying out by force
African names. Dr. King and some other leaders criticized black power as philosophy of hopelessness and despair.
Malcolm X
By the early 1960s, a young man named Malcolm X had become a symb of the black power movement. Born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, experienced a difficult childhood and adolescence. In 1946 he was senttc prison for burglary. Prison transformed Malcolm. He educated himself ai played an active role in the prison debate society.
Eventually, he joined the Nation of Islam, commonly known as the Black Muslims. Despite the name, the Nation of Islam is very different fn mainstream Islam. The Nation of Islam preached black nationalism. Afte joining the Nation of Islam, Malcolm Little changed his name to Malcoln The X symbolized the family name of his enslaved African ancestors. He declared that his true name had been stolen from him by slavery, and he would no longer use the name white society had given him. Malcolm X’s criticisms of white society and the mainstream civil rights movement gained national attention for the Nation of Islam.
By 1964, Malcolm X had broken with the Black Muslims. Discouraged scandals involving the Nation of Islam’s leader, he went to the Muslim holy city of Makkah (Mecca) in Saudi Arabia. After seeing Muslims from mar races worshipping together, he no longer promoted separatism. After Male X broke with the Nation of Islam, he continued to criticize the organizati Because of this, organization members shot and killed him in February 1965.
Malcolm X’s speeches and ideas influenced a new generation of militant African American leaders who preached black power, black nationalism, and economic self-sufficiency. In 1966 in Oakland, Califorr Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale organized the Black Panthers. Black Panther leaders called for an end to racial oppression and for control of major institutions in the African American community, such as schools, enforcement, housing, and hospitals.

Dr. King Is Assassinated
guidingquestion How did Martin Luther King, Jr.'s death affect the civil rights movement?
In March 1968, Dr. King went to Memphis, Tennessee, to support a strike c African American sanitation workers. At the time, the SCLC had been planning a national “Poor People’s Campaign” to promote economic advancement for impoverished Americans. The purpose of this campaig was to lobby the federal government to commit billions of dollars to end poverty and unemployment in the United States. People of all races and nationalities were to converge on Washington, D.C., where they would camp out until both Congress and President Johnson agreed to pass the requested legislation to fund the proposal.
On April 4,1968, as he stood on his hotel balcony in Memphis, Dr. Kin was assassinated by a sniper. In a speech the previous night, he had told gathering at a local church, “I’ve been to the mountaintop.... I’ve looke over. And I ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with you, but want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.”

J
Dr. Kings death touched off both national mourning and riots in more than 100 cities, including Washington, D.C. The Reverend Ralph Abernathy, who had served as a trusted assistant to Dr. King for many years, led the Poor People’s Campaign in Kings absence. However, the demonstration did not achieve any of the major objectives that either King or the SCLC had hoped it would.
In the wake of Dr. King’s death, Congress did pass the Civil Rights Act of 1968. This law, sometimes known as the Fair Housing Act of 1968, outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin when selling, renting, or financing housing. In many communities across the nation, racism had led to an informal segregation. People would simply refuse to sell their homes or rent property to people based on their race. Sometime banks would not approve loans because of racist attitudes or assumptions that affected the thinking of the loan officers. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 put an end to these practices.
The law also benefited immigrants and religious minorities. Historically, in many places in the United States,
Jewish Americans had encountered rules preventing them from buying or renting property in certain neighborhoods.
The Civil Rights Act of 1968 expanded their economic opportunities as well.
The assassination of Dr. King in 1968 marked a turning point in the civil rights movement. After his death, the movement began to fragment. With formal laws in place banning segregation and discrimination, and guaranteeing voting rights, the movement lost some of its unity of purpose and the vision he had given it. The shift to economic rights
was already underway at the time of his death, and it was clear that the struggle to end poverty and provide more economic opportunity would be very difficult and would have to involve very different approaches than the movement had used in the past.

Sequencing and Reading a Time Line
Why Learn This Skill?
Many people complain that history is just a bunch of dates they have to memorize. In fact, the relationship between events is what really matters to historians. They want to explain what caused something to happen, or how something affected something else over time.
History is a series of causes and effects that happen over time in a sequence. Unlike science, where you can repeat an experiment, in history, everything happens once in a particular order. If you want to know what caused something, you have to know the sequence of events.
Learning the Skill
Sequencing is simply putting things in the correct order. What came first? What came next? Did an event happen before or after another event? Putting historical events in the correct
2C, 29B
sequence will often reveal a possible relationship between them. Historians then look at the historical evidence to see if they can prove that there is a cause-and-effect relationship in the sequence.
Sequencing involves two types of chronology—absolute chronology and relative chronology. Absolute chronology is when something happened. Generally we use a specific date and time to establish absolute chronology. Relative chronology tells when something happened compared to something else. If you give the year President Obama was first elected, you are using absolute chronology. If you are asked whether President Reagan came before or after President Clinton, you use relative chronology to answer.
A very common way to present a sequence of related historical events and teach their relative and absolute chronology is to use a time line. A time line is a kind of chart that can be
Key Events of the Civil Rights Movement, 1954-1965
492
presented on a horizontal or vertical line. It lists events that occurred between specific dates in order. The number of years between these dates is called the time span. For example, a time line that begins in 1400 and ends in 1500 has a time span of 100 years. Time lines are usually divided into smaller segments, or time intervals.
Intervals can be vast, each interval being an entire historical era, or they can be small, a year, a month, a day—whatever is needed to sequence the events.
A time line is a visual aid; it helps you remember the correct order of events and people, and also the dates associated with them. It often includes captions with each event giving a quick summary of what happened.
Practicing this Skill
Look at the time line on key events of the Civil Rights movement, and then answer the questions that follow:
1.	What is the time span of this time line?
2.	What intervals is the time line using?
3.	When did Martin Luther King deliver his I Have a Dream Speech? What major legislation was passed the year after the speech?
4.	Use the time line to put these people and events in the correct relative chronology: Freedom Summer, James Farmer, Greensboro Sit-ins, Rosa Parks
5.	What major event happened just before Congress passed the Voting Rights Act? What relationship is there between the two events?
6.	What possible cause and effect sequence does the time line show between court decisions, protests, and legislation?
Applying the Skill
Sequencing Using Absolute and Relative Chronology Now that you understand sequencing, time lines, and absolute and relative chronology, read through Lesson 3, New Civil Rights Issues. Then go to the lesson, New Approaches to Civil Rights in the chapter, Politics and Economics, 1968-1980. Create a time line sequencing the events of the Civil Rights Movement from 1968-1980. Be sure to include dates and brief one-sentence captions identifying key events and individuals.

We believe that all men are entitled to the blessings of liberty. Yet millions are being deprived of those blessings—not because of their own failures, but because of the color of their skin. The reasons are deeply imbedded in history and tradition and the nature of man. We can understand—without rancor or
hatred—how this all happened. But it cannot continue. Our Constitution, the foundation of our Republic, forbids it. The principles of our freedom forbid it. Morality forbids it. And the law I will sign tonight forbids it. ”

« The objective of the United States government in Vietnam was made clear by the Truman Doctrine of 1947. The Truman Doctrine came after World War II had been concluded, the fighting had stopped, and international arrangements were in disarray. It became very clear that the Soviet Union was going to grab as much real estate as possible in the aftermath of that great war. Thus, the Truman Doctrine said in essence:'We will not allow a little country to be pushed around and be taken over by the communists. Somebody has to come to their rescue and we will do that.'99

In 1940 Japan invaded Vietnam, becoming one of a series of foreign nations to rule the Asian country. The Chinese had controlled the region for hundreds of years. Then, from the late 1800s until World War II, the French ruled Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia—a region then known as French Indochina.
The Growth of Vietnamese Nationalism
By the early 1900s, nationalism had become a powerful force in Vietnam. Several political parties pushed for independence or for reform of French colonial rule. Among the leaders of the nationalist movement was Nguyen That Thanh—better known by his assumed name, Ho Chi Minh. After years in Europe, China, and the Soviet Union, he returned to Southeast Asia. There, he helped found the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930 and worked for independence.
Ho Chi Minh’s activities forced him to flee Indochina and spew several years in exile in the Soviet Union and China. In 1941 he returned to Vietnam. By then, Japan had seized control of the country. Ho Chi Minh organized a nationalist group called the Vietminh, which united Communists and non-Communists in the effort to expel the Japanese. Soon afterward, the United States began sending aid to the Vietminh.
America Aids the French
When Japan surrendered to the Allies in 1945, it gave up control of Indochina. Ho Chi Minh quickly declared Vietnam’s independence. France had no intention of losing its former colony, however. French troops returned to Vietnam in 1946 and drove the Vietminh into hiding
500
The Vietminh fought back against the French-dominated regime and slowly gained control of large areas of the country. As the fighting escalated, France appealed to the United States for help. The request put American officials in a difficult position. The United States opposed colonialism. It had pressured the Dutch to give up their empire in Indonesia and supported the British decision to give India independence in 1947. American officials, however, did not want Vietnam to be Communist.
China’s fall to communism and the outbreak of the Korean War helped convince President Truman to aid France. President Eisenhower continued Truman’s policy and defended his decision with what became known as the domino theory—the idea that if Vietnam fell to communism, the rest of Southeast Asia would follow, like a line of dominoes falling over.
domino theory the belief that if one nation in Asia fell to the Communists, neighboring countries would follow
Defeat at Dien Bien Phu
Despite aid from the United States, the French continued to struggle against the Vietminh, who used hit-and-run and ambush tactics. These are the tactics of guerrillas, irregular troops who blend into the civilian population and are difficult for regular armies to fight. Rising casualties and a lack of victories made the war unpopular with the French public.
The turning point came in the mountain town of Dien Bien Phu. By seizing the town, the French planned to cut the Vietminh’s supply lines and force them into open battle. Soon afterward, a huge Vietminh force surrounded Dien Bien Phu and began bombarding the town. On May 7,1954, the French forces fell to the Vietminh. The defeat convinced the French to make peace and withdraw from Indochina.

Analyzing Why did the United States protect South Vietnam?
American Involvement Deepens
GUIDING QUESTION
How did American involvement in Vietnam change during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations? After Ngo Dinh Diem refused to hold national elections, Ho Chi Minh and the Communists began an armed struggle to reunify the nation. They organized a new guerrilla army of South Vietnamese Communists, which became known as the Vietcong. Eisenhower sent hundreds of military advisers to train South Vietnam’s army, but the Vietcong continued to grow more powerful because many Vietnamese opposed Diem’s government. By 1961, the Vietcong had established control over much of the countryside. Kennedy Takes Over
When President Kennedy took office in 1961, he continued to support South Vietnam, believing the country was vital in the battle against communism. From 1961 to late 1963, the number of U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam jumped from about 2,000 to around 15,000. Yet they failed to shore up the floundering Diem regime. For example, the South Vietnamese created special fortified villages known as strategic hamlets. They then moved villagers to these hamlets, despite the peasants’ resentment at being uprooted from their villages. The program proved to be extremely unpopular.
The Overthrow of Diem
American officials blamed Diem. He made himself even more unpopular by discriminating against Buddhism, one of the country’s most widely practiced religions. In the spring of 1963, he banned the traditional religious flags for the Buddhas birthday. When Buddhists protested in the streets, Diem’s police killec nine people. In response, a Buddhist monk poured gasoline over his robes and set himself on fire, the first of several to do so. Images of their self-destruction horrified Americans as they watched the footage on television news reports.
In August 1963, U.S. ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge arrived in Vietnam. He learned that several Vietnamese generals were plotting to overthrow the unpopular Diem. When Lodge expressed U.S. sympathy for their cause, the generals launched a military coup, seizing power on November 1, 1963. They executed Diem soon after. Despite his unpopularity, Diem had been a respecte< nationalist. After his death, South Vietnam’s government weakened.
Johnson and Vietnam
Just three weeks after Diem’s death, Kennedy was assassinated. The presidency—and the growing problem of Vietnam—now belonged to
ent Lyndon B. Johnson. Although he approached Vietnam cautiously
502
at first, Johnson wanted to keep the country from falling to the Communists. Additionally, some had blamed Democrats when China became Communist in 1949. Should the Democrats lose Vietnam, Johnson feared, it might “shatter my Presidency, kill my administration, and damage our democracy.”
On August 2, 1964, Johnson announced that North Vietnamese torpedo boats had fired on two U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin. Two days later, he reported another attack. Insisting that these were unprovoked, he ordered American aircraft to attack North Vietnamese ships and naval facilities.
Johnson then asked Congress for the authority to defend American forces and allies in Southeast Asia. Congress readily agreed, and on August 7,1964, it passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. This authorized the president to “take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.” Soon after, the Vietcong began to attack bases where American advisers were stationed in South Vietnam. After one particularly damaging attack, Johnson sent American aircraft to bomb North Vietnam.
ANALYZING PRIMARY SOURCES
Should America Fight in Vietnam?
As the war in Vietnam dragged on, Americans became increasingly divided about the nation's role in the conflict.
In January 1966, George W. Ball delivered an address to indicate "how we got [into Vietnam] and why we must stay."George F. Kennan, a former ambassador to the Soviet Union, argued that American involvement in Vietnam was "something we would not choose deliberately if the choice were ours to make all over again today."
---------YES----------------
u [T]he conflict in Viet-Nam is a product of the great shifts and changes triggered by the Second World War.... [T]he Soviet Union under Stalin exploited the confusion to push out the perimeter of its power and influence in an effort to extend the outer limits of Communist domination by force or the threat of force....
The bloody encounters in [Vietnam]... are
thus in a real sense battles and skirmishes in a continuing war to prevent one Communist power after another from violating internationally recognized boundary lines fixing the outer limits of Communist dominion....
In the long run our hopes for the people of South Viet-Nam reflect our hopes for people everywhere. What we seek is a world living in peace and freedom.”
—from a speech delivered January 30,1966
George W. Ball Undersecretary of State
--------- NO --------------
« Vietnam is not a region of major military-industrial importance....
[E]ven a situation in which South Vietnam was controlled exclusively by the Vietcong... would not present, in my opinion, dangers great enough to justify our direct military intervention.
And to attempt to crush North Vietnamese
strength to a point where Hanoi could no longer give any support for Vietcong political activity in the South would... have the effect of bringing in Chinese forces at some point....
Our motives are widely misinterpreted; and the spectacle of Americans inflicting grievous injury on the lives of a poor and helpless people... produces reactions among millions of people throughout the world profoundly detrimental to the image we would like them to hold of this country.”

BIOGRAPHIES
Helicopters allowed U.S. troops to get in and out of jungles and mountainous areas in Vietnam.
CRITICAL THINKING
Determining Cause and Effect How did the Vietnamese landscape make troop movements difficult?
Roy P. Benavidez (1935-1998)
Roy P. Benavidez received the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award for heroism, for action in the Vietnam War. In May 1968, Benavidez went to the aid of Special Forces team members who were wounded and surrounded, unable to get to a helicopter. Benavidez ran 80 yards through enemy fire. Wounded three times in getting to the men, he stayed with them some eight hours, preparing an evacuation. During that time, he was wounded two more times. While carrying men to the rescue helicopter, he was attacked from behind, but managed to kill his attacker in hand-to-hand combat. Only after loading all the dead and wounded, did Benavidez board the helicopter. His actions saved the lives of at least eight other men.
Both the American public and Johnson’s advisers generally supported these actions. Some officials disagreed, however. Undersecretary of State George Ball initially supported involvement in Vietnam, but later turned against it. He warned that if the United States go. too involved, it would be difficult to get out. “Once on the tiger’s back, he warned, we cannot be
sure of picking the place to dismount.
Other advisers, such as National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, believed that success in Vietnam was important to protect American interests and maintain stability in Southeast Asia. In a memo to the president, he argued:
PRIMARY SOURCE
« The stakes in Vietnam are extremely high. The American investment is very large, and American responsibility is a fact of life which is palpable in the atmosphere of Asia, and even elsewhere.The international prestige of the U.S. and a substantial part of our influence are directly at risk in Vietnam.^
—quoted in The Best and the Brightest,191
In March 1965, Johnson again expanded American involvement by ordering a sustained bombing campaign against North Vietnam. That same month, he sent the first U.S. combat troops into Vietnam.

Bloody Stalemate guiding question What military tactics were used by the Vietcong, and how did American troops respond?
By the end of 1965, more than 180,000 U.S. combat troops were fighting in Vietnam. In 1966 that number doubled. The U.S. military entered Vietnam with great confidence. “America seemed omnipotent then ” wrote one ofth first marines to arrive, Philip Caputo, in his prologue to A Rumor of War. “[W] saw ourselves as the champions of a cause that was destined to triumph.’”
Lacking the firepower of the American forces, the Vietcong used ambushes, booby traps, and other guerrilla tactics. These techniques could be greatly destructive. Ronald J. Glasser, an American army doctor, described the devastating effects of one booby trap:
PRIMARY SOURCE
** Three quarters of the way through the tangle, a trooper brushed against a two-inch vine, and a grenade slung at chest high went off, shattering the right side of his head and body.... Nearby troopers t< hold of the unconscious soldier and, half carrying, half dragging hin pulled him the rest of the way through the tangle. M
—quoted in Vietnam, 4 History,
The Vietcong also frustrated American troops by blending in with the general population and then quickly vanishing. “It was a sheer physical impossibil to keep the enemy from slipping away whenever he wished, explained one American general.
Search and Destroy"
To counter these tactics, American troops tried tc ind enemy troops, bomb their positions, destroy t eir supply lines, and force them out into the of
for combat. American planes dropped napalm, a jellied gasoline that explodes on contact. They also used Agent Orange, a chemical that strips leaves from trees and shrubs, turning farmland and forest into wasteland.
American military leaders underestimated the Vietcong’s strength. They also misjudged the enemy’s stamina and the support they had among the South Vietnamese. American generals believed that bombing and killing large numbers of Vietcong would destroy their morale and lead them to surrender.
The guerrillas, however, had no intention of surrendering, and they were willing to accept huge losses to achieve their goals.
The Ho Chi Minh Trail
In the Vietcong’s war effort, North Vietnamese support was a major factor. Although the Vietcong included many South Vietnamese, North Vietnam provided arms, advisers, and leadership. As Vietcong casualties mounted, North Vietnam began sending North Vietnamese Army units to fight. North Vietnam sent arms and supplies south by way of a network of jungle paths known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The trail wound through Cambodia and Laos, bypassing the border between North Vietnam and South Vietnam.
North Vietnam itself received weapons and other support from the Soviet Union and China. Johnson feared directly attacking North Vietnam would bring China into the war, as had happened in Korea. Yet Johnson’s limits made winning the war very difficult. Instead of conquering territory, American troops had to fight a war of attrition—defeating enemy forces by wearing them down. This strategy led troops to conduct grisly body counts after battles to determine how many enemy soldiers had been killed. The American military began measuring “progress” in the war by the number of enemy dead.
Bombing from American planes killed many thousands of Vietnamese. American soldiers were also dying in increasing numbers. The notion of a quick and decisive victory grew increasingly remote. As a result, many citizens back home began to question the nation’s involvement in the war.
Chemicals such as napalm and Agent Orange devastated the landscape of Vietnam.

continued on the next page
When the first U.S. combat troops arrived in Vietnam in the spring of 1965, about 66 percent of Americans approved of U.S. policy in Vietnam. As the war dragged on, however, public support began to wane. Media accounts seemed to contradict government reports. For example, the American commander in South Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, reported that the “enemy’s hopes are bankrupt” and “the end begins to come into view.” Yet millions of people saw images of American casualties on television in their living rooms each day as Vietnam became the first “television war.” For many people, a credibility gap had developed—they had a hard time believing what the Johnson administration said about the war.
Congress, which in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution had granted Johnson a great deal of power to conduct the war, began to seek greater involvement. Beginning in February 1966, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held “educational” hearings on Vietnam. They called in policy makers and critics to discuss the administration’s military strategy.
Teach-ins Begin
In March 1965, a group of faculty members and students at the University of Michigan joined together in a teach-in. They discussed the issues surrounding the war and reaffirmed their reasons for opposing it. In May 1965, 122 colleges held a “National Teach-In” by radio for more than 100,000 antiwar demonstrators.
People opposed the war for different reasons. Some saw the conflict as a civil war in which the United States should not
506
interfere. Others saw South Vietnam as a corrupt dictatorship and believed defending it was immoral.
Anger at the Draft
Thousands of demonstrators held protests against the war. Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) organized a march on Washington, D.C., that drew more than 20,000 people. A rally at the Lincoln Memorial drew tens of thousands of protesters as well.
Many protesters focused on what they saw as an unfair draft system.
Until 1969, college students could often defer military service until after graduation. Young people from working-class families unable to afford college were more likely to be drafted. Draftees were most likely to be assigned to combat units, and they commonly made up more than half of casualties. Most who served in Vietnam, however, enlisted voluntarily.
Nevertheless, a disproportionate number of working-class and minority youths went to war. Between 1961 and 1966, African Americans constituted about 10 percent of military personnel. Because African Americans were more likely to be assigned to combat units, however, they accounted for almost 20 percent of combat-related deaths. This skewed death rate angered African American leaders. In April 1967, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., publicly condemned the conflict: “I speak for the poor of America who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in Vietnam.... The great initiative in this war is ours. The initiative to stop it must be ours.” In response, military officials tried to reduce African American casualties. By wars end,
African Americans made up about 12 percent of Americas dead.
As the war escalated, an increased draft call put many college students at risk of being drafted. An estimated 500,000 draftees refused to go. Some burned their draft cards, did not show up for induction, or fled the country. From 1965 to 1968, officials prosecuted over 3,000 Americans who refused to serve. In 1969 a lottery system was instituted, so only those with low numbers were subject to the draft. Many draftees argued that if they were old enough to fight, they were old enough to vote. In 1971 the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, giving all citizens age 18 and older the right to vote in all state and federal elections.

Tinker v. Des Moines
In 1965 students in Des Moines, Iowa, expressed their opposition to the Vietnam War by wearing black armbands to school. The school district then banned the wearing of black armbands and subsequently expelled three students who violated the policy. The students challenged their expulsion as a violation of their First Amendment right to free speech. In 1969 the Supreme Court ruled 7 to 2 in favor of the students, holding that the wearing of black armbands was a form of “symbolic expression” covered by the First Amendment. As long as their symbolic protest was not disruptive, they had a right to express their opinion.

On January 30, 1968, during Tet, the Vietnamese New Year, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese launched a massive surprise attack. In what was called the Tet Offensive, guerrilla fighters attacked most American airbases in Soutl Vietnam and most of the South’s major cities. Vietcong even blasted their way into the American embassy in Saigon.
After about a month of fighting, U.S. and South Vietnamese soldiers repelled the enemy troops, inflicting heavy losses on them. But less tangibh damage had been done. The American people were shocked that an enemy supposedly on the verge of defeat could launch such a large-scale attack. The media openly criticized the war. “The American people should be getting ready to accept, if they haven’t already, the prospect that the whole Vietnan effort may be doomed,” declared the Wall Street Journal. Television newscast' Walter Cronkite said that it seemed “more certain than ever that the blood experience in Vietnam is to end in a stalemate.”

Johnson Leaves the Race
Both Johnson and the war had become increasingly unpopuk With the presidential election of 1968 on the horizon, some Democratic politicians made surprising moves. In November 1967, Eugene McCarthy—a little-known liberal senator from Minnesota declared that he would challenge Johnson for th< Democratic presidential nomination. At first, his candidacy was mostly dismissed, but he attracted support from those who opposed the war. In March 1968, McCarthy made a str< showing in the New Hampshire primary, winning more than 40 percent of the vote. Realizing that Johnson was vulnerable, Senator Robert Kennedy, who also opposed the war, quickly entered the race for the Democratic nomination.
With both the country and his own party deeply divided, Jo nson appeared on television on March 31, 1968. He announc ave concluded that I should not permit the presidency to ’ +nme inv°lve(d in the partisan divisions that are developii in this political year. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I wil
no accept, t e nomination of my party for another term as your President.

Season of Violence More shocking events followed Johnsons announcement. On April 4, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated in Memphis by James Earl Ray. On June 5, Robert Kennedy, who appeared likely to win the Democratic nomination, was gunned down by Sirhan Sirhan, an Arab nationalist.
The violence that seemed to plague the country in 1968 culminated with a chaotic and well-publicized clash between antiwar protesters and police at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Thousands of young activists surrounded the convention center to protest the war. Despite these protests, the delegates selected Vice

Meanwhile, in a park not far from the convention hall, protesters and police began fighting. Demonstrators taunted police with the chant “The whole world is watching!” as the officers tried to force them to disperse. Violence between protesters and police aired on national television.
o
Nixon Wins the Presidency
At a much more sedate convention, Republicans selected former vice president and 1960 presidential hopeful Richard Nixon as their candidate. A third candidate, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, decided to run in 1968 as an independent. An outspoken segregationist, Wallace sought to attract Americans who felt threatened by the civil rights movement and urban social unrest.
Public opinion polls gave Nixon a wide lead over Humphrey and Wallace. Nixons campaign promise to unify the nation and restore law and order appealed to Americans who feared their country was spinning out of control. He claimed to represent a silent majority of Americans who sought to maintain law and order but had been overshadowed in recent years by social and political turmoil. He promised that he had a “secret plan” to bring “peace with honor” in Vietnam.
Humphrey’s campaign faced significant challenges, but by October 1968, his increasingly antiwar stance and strong campaigning helped turn his numbers around. A week before the election, President Johnson announced that the bombing of North Vietnam had halted and that a cease-fire would follow. These boosts came too late for Humphrey, however. Nixon defeated him by more than 100 electoral votes, although he only won the popular vote by a slim margin of 43 percent to 42 percent.

Nixon Moves to End the War
guiding question Whatpolides did Nixon employ to end the war?
As a step toward ending the war, Nixon appointed Henry Kissingei as special assistant for national security affairs. Kissinger embarkei upon a policy called linkage, or improving relations with the Sovi< Union and China, to try to persuade them to reduce their aid to North Vietnam. In August 1969, Kissinger also entered into secret negotiations with North Vietnam’s representative, he Due Tho.
Meanwhile, Nixon began Vietnamization. Th is process involv the gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops while the South Vietnamese assumed more of the fighting. He announced the withdrawal of 25,000 soldiers on June 8, 1969. At the same time, however, Nixon increased air strikes against North Vietnam and began secretly bombing Vietcong sanctuaries in neighboring Cambodia.
Turmoil at Home Continues
In late 1969, Americans learned that in the spring of 1968 an American platoon under the command of Lieutenant William Calley had massacred unarmed South Vietnamese civilians in the hamlet of My Lai. Most of the victims were old men, women, and children. Calley eventually went to prison for his role in the killings. Jan Barry, a founder of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, viewed My Lai <. a symbol of the dilemma his generation faced in the conflict:
PRIMARY SOURCE
“To kill on military orders and be a criminal, or to refuse to kill and be a criminal is the me agony of Americas Vietnam war generation. It is what has forced upward of sixty thousand young Americans, draft resisters and deserters, to Canada, and created one hundred thousa military deserters a year... .**
quoted in Who Spoke Up?: American Protest Against the War in Vietnam, 1963-T97S,
510
The U.S. invasion of Cambodia led to mass protests and to the tragic killing of four students by National Guard troops at Kent State University in May 1970.
In April 1970, Nixon announced that American troops had invaded Cambodia to destroy Vietcong bases there. Many believed this invasion expanded the war, which set off many protests. On May 4,
Ohio National Guard soldiers armed with tear gas and rifles fired on demonstrators at Kent State University, killing four students. Days later, police killed two student demonstrators at Jackson State College in Mississippi.
An angry Congress began to work to end the president’s control of the war. In December 1970, it repealed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which had given the president nearly complete power in directing the conflict.
The following year, a former employee of the Department of Defense, Daniel Ellsberg, leaked what became known as the Pentagon Papers to
the New York Times. The documents contained details about decisions to expand the war, and confirmed what many Americans had long believed: the government had not been honest with them.
The United States Pulls Out
Americans were increasingly ready for the war to end as the presidential election of 1972 approached. Nixon faced Democratic challenger George McGovern, an outspoken critic of the war. Less than a month before the election, however, Kissinger emerged from his secret talks with Le Due Tho to announce that “peace is at hand.” Nixon soundly defeated McGovern.
Soon, Kissinger’s peace negotiations broke down over disagreements about the presence of North Vietnamese troops in the South. In December 1972, to force North Vietnam to resume negotiations, the Nixon administration began the most destructive air raids of the war. In what became known as the “Christmas bombings,” American B-52s dropped thousands of tons of bombs on North Vietnamese targets for 11 straight days. Then negotiations resumed. On January 27, 1973, the warring sides signed an agreement “ending the war and restoring the peace in Vietnam.” The United States promised to withdraw its troops, and both sides agreed to exchange prisoners of war. After almost eight years of war, the nation ended its direct involvement in Vietnam.
The Domino Effect
Peace did not last. In January 1975, Cambodia fell under the control of the Communist group the Khmer Rouge. In March 1975, the North Vietnamese army invaded South Vietnam. Nixon had resigned in August 1974 following Watergate, a scandal that broke as the war was winding down. When the new president, Gerald Ford, asked for funds to aid the South Vietnamese, Congress refused. On April 30, the North Vietnamese captured Saigon,
South Vietnam’s capital. They then renamed the city Ho Chi Minh City.
Laos, another country in the region, was also greatly affected by the Vietnam War. Though Laos was run by a neutral coalition government during most of the war, the constant effects of bombings on the parts of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos destabilized that neutrality. Communists took over in Laos after the fall of Saigon. Thus, the domino effect played out as predicted.

The Legacy of Vietnam
GUIDING QUESTION

“The lessons of the past in Vietnam,” President Ford declared in 1975, “have already been learned-learned by Presidents, learned by Congress, learned by the American people—and we should have our focus on the future.” Vietnam had a profound effect on America.
The War's Human Toll
America paid a heavy price for its involvement in Vietnam, far more than the estimated $173 billion in direct costs. Approximately 58,000 young Americans died, and some 300,000 were injured. An estimated 1 million North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese soldiers died, as did millions more civilians. Back home, some soldiers had trouble readjusting. Army Specialist Doug Johnson recalled:
PRIMARYSOURCE
« It took a while for me to recognize that I did suffer some psychological problems in trying to deal witl my experience in Vietnam.... One evening... I went to see a movie on post. I don't recall... what it was about, but I remember there was a sad part, and that I started crying uncontrollably. It hadn't dawned on me before this episode that I had... succeeded in burying my emotions.**
—quoted in Touched by the Dragon, 195
Because many people considered the war a defeat and wanted to put it behind them, the veterans’ sacrifices often went unrecognized. They received relatively few welcome-home parades and celebrations.
liiiiiii ANALYZING SUPREME COURT CASES
NEW YORK TIMES
v. UNITED STATES,
1971 Background to the Case
In 1971 Daniel Ellsberg leaked classified documents, known as the Pentagon Papers, to the New York Times and the Washington Post. When the newspapers attempted to publish these documents, the Nixon administration argued that publication would threaten national security. The case centered on the First Amendment guarantee of a free press.
How the Court Ruled
Daniel Ellsberg leaked the classified documents known as the Pentagon Papers. The New York Times went to court to battle for its right to print the Pentagon Papers.
In a 6-to-3 per curiam opinion—per curiam meaning that the decision was issued by the whole Court and not specific justices—the Court found that the Nixon administration had failed to prove that publication of the Pentagon Papers would imperil the nation in any way. The New York Times and the Washington Post could publish the Pentagon Papers.

The war remained unresolved for the American families whose relatives and friends were classified as prisoners of war (POWs) or missing in action (MIA). Despite many official investigations, these families were not convinced that the government had told the truth about POW/MIA policies.
Vietnam remained on the nations mind nearly a decade later. In 1982 the nation dedicated the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., a large black granite wall inscribed with the names of those killed and missing in action in the war.
The War's Impact on the Nation
The war also left a mark on national politics. In 1973 Congress passed the War Powers Act as a way to reestablish some limits on executive power. The act required the president to inform Congress of any commitment of troops abroad within 48 hours, and to withdraw them in 60 to 90 days, unless Congress explicitly approved the troop commitment. No president has recognized this limitation, however, and the courts have tended to avoid the issue.
Nonetheless, every president since the law’s passage has asked Congress to authorize the use of military force before committing ground troops to combat. In general, the war shook the nation’s confidence and made some begin to question American foreign policies.
On the domestic front, the Vietnam War increased Americans’ cynicism about their government. Together with Watergate, Vietnam made many Americans feel that the nation’s leaders had misled them.

I read a lot of pacifist literature to determine whether or not I was a conscientious objector. I finally concluded that I wasn't.... The one clear decision I made in 1968 about me and the war was that if I was going to get out of it, I was going to get out in a legal way. I was not going to defraud the system in order to beat the system. I wasn't going to leave the country, because the odds of coming back looked real slim.... With all my terror of going into the Army... there was something seductive about it, too. I was seduced by World War II and John Wayne movies.... I had been, as we all were, victimized by a romantic, truly uninformed view of war.99

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
B
The 1960s was one of the most tumultuous decades in American history. The decade also gave birth to a youth movement that challenged the American political syster and conventional middle-class values.
The Rise of the Youth Movement
guidingquestion How were the protest techniques used by student protesters similar to c different from those ofthe civil rights movement?
The roots of the 1960s youth movement stretched back to the 1951 In the decade after World War II, the country had enjoyed a time peace and prosperity. Prosperity did not extend to all, however. Some, especially the artists and writers ofthe beat movement, openly criticized American society. They believed American society had come to value conformity over independence and financial gain ovei spiritual and social advancement. At the same time, the civil right movement raised serious questions about racism in American society The nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union made many of the nation’s youth fear for the future. For many young people, the events of the 1950s had called into questi the wisdom of their parents and their political leaders.
The youth movement originated with the baby boomers, the huge generation born after World War II. By 1970, 58.2 percent o the American population was under 35 years old. The economic boom of the 1950s meant more families could afford to send theii children to college. College life gave young people a sense of freedon and independence. It was on college campuses across the nation that youth protest movements began and reached their peak.
Students for a Democratic Society
Young people were concerned about the injustices they saw in the nations political and social system. In their view, a small, wealthy elite controlled politics, and wealth was unfairly divided. These young people formed what came to be known as the New Left.
520
A prominent organization within the New Left was Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). It defined its views in a 1962 declaration known as the Port Huron Statement. Written largely by Tom Hayden, editor of the University of Michigan s student newspaper, the declaration called for an end to apathy and urged citizens to stop accepting a country run by big corporations and big government.
PRIMARY SOURCE
«... [H]uman degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry... the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract'others'... might die at any time....
Our work is guided by the sense that we may be the last generation in the experiment with living. »
—from the Port Huron Statement, 1962
SDS chapters focused on protesting the Vietnam War and other issues, including poverty, campus regulations, nuclear power, and racism.
The Free Speech Movement
Another movement that captured the nation’s attention in the 1960s was the free speech movement, led by Mario Savio and others at the University of California at Berkeley. The movement began in the fall of 1964, when the university decided to restrict students’ rights to distribute literature and to recruit volunteers for political causes on campus.
Like many college students, those at Berkeley were dissatisfied with practices at their university. Huge classes were divided into sections and taught by graduate students. Many professors claimed they were too busy with research to meet with students. Faceless administrators made rules that were not always easy to obey and imposed punishments for violations. Feeling isolated in this impersonal environment, many Berkeley students rallied to support the free speech movement.
The struggle between Berkeley’s students and administrators peaked on December 2, 1964, with a sit-in and powerful speech by Savio. Early the next morning, 600 police officers entered the campus and arrested more than 700 protesters. The arrests set off an even larger protest movement. Within days, a campus-wide strike had stopped classes. Many members of the faculty voiced

their support for the free speech movement. In the face of this growing opposition, the administration gave in to the students demands.
Soon afterward, the Supreme Court upheld students rights to freedom of speech and assembly on campuses. In a unanimous vote, the Court upheld the section ofthe Civil Rights Act assuring these rights in places offering public accommodations, which, by definition, included college campuses. The Berkeley revolt became a model for other student protests in the 1960s. The tactics used by the Berkeley protesters were soon being used in college demonstrations across the country.

The Counterculture
guiding question Howdid the counterculture movement affect the nation?
While many young Americans in the 1960s sought to reform the system, othei rejected it entirely. They tried to create a new lifestyle based on flamboyant dress, rock music, drug use, and communal living. They created what became known as the counterculture, and the people were commonly called "hippie Hippie Culture
Originally, hippies rejected rationality, order, and traditional middle-class values. They wanted to build a utopia—a society that was freer, closer to nature, and full of love, tolerance, and cooperation. Many hippies wanted to drop out of society by leaving home. They wanted to live together in communes—group living arrangements in which members shared everything and worked together. Much of this was a reaction to the 1950s stereotype ofthe white-collar “man in the gray flannel suit” who led a constricted and colorless life. Singer-songwriter Bob Dylan expressed the counterculture beliefs through his lyrics:
PRIMARY SOURCE
** Come mothers and fathers throughout the land/and don't criticize what you can't understand/Yoi sons and your daughters are beyond your command/ Your old road is rapidly agin'/Please get out of 1 new one if you can't lend your hand/for the times they are a-changin' ”
—from "The Times They Are A-Changin',

The Impact of the Counterculture
After a few years, the counterculture movement began to decline. The fashion and music of the counterculture, however, continued to affect American culture. More individualized dressing, including strands of beads, ragged blue jeans, and long hair for men, became generally accepted. Counterculture musicians made use of folk music and the rhythms of rock n’ roll. They wrote heartfelt lyrics that expressed the hopes and fears of their generation. Folk singers included Bob Dylan, who became an important voice of the movement, as did singers Joan Baez and Pete Seeger. Rock musicians included Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and The Who. The music and innovations of these artists continue to influence musicians today.

African Americans and college students were not the only groups seeking to change American society in the 1960s. By the middle of th decade, a new movement had emerged: the feminist, or women’s liberation, movement. Feminism is the belief that men and women should be equal politically, economically, and socially. The onset of World War II provided women with greater opportunity. After the war, however, many women returned to traditional roles. The new postwar emphasis on establishing families discouraged women from seeking employment.
Despite the popular emphasis on homemaking, the number of women who held jobs outside the home actually increased during the 1950s. Many women went to work to help their families maintain comfortable lifestyles. By 1960, about one-third of all married womei were part of the paid workforce. Yet many people continued to believe that women could better serve society by remaining in the home to influence the next generation of men.
Origins of the Movement
By the early 1960s, many women were increasingly resentful of a world where newspaper ads separated jobs by gender, banks denied women credit, and female employees often were paid less for the same work. Nearly half of American women worked by the mid-1960s but three-fourths of these women worked in lower-paying clerical, sales, or factory jobs, or as cleaning women and hospital attendants.

One stimulus that invigorated the womens movement was the Presidents Commission on the Status of Women. Its report highlighted the problems women faced in the workplace and helped create a network of feminist activists who lobbied for women’s legislation. In 1963 they won passage of the Equal Pay Act, which in most cases outlawed paying men more than women for the same job.
Many women who had stayed home were also discontent. Betty Friedan tried to describe the reasons for this in her 1963 book The Feminine Mystique. Friedan had interviewed women who had graduated with her from Smith College in 1942. She reported that while most had everything they could want in life, they felt unfulfilled. As the book became a best seller, women began reaching out to one another. They poured out their anger and sadness in what came to be known as consciousness-raising sessions. While they talked about their unhappiness, they were also building the base for a nationwide mass movement.
Congress gave the womens movement another boost by including them in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Title VII of the act outlawed job discrimination not only on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin, but also on the basis of gender. This provided a strong legal basis for the changes the women’s movement later demanded.
But simply having the law on the books was not enough. Even the agency charged with administering the Civil Rights Act—the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)—ruled in 1965 that gender-segregated help-wanted ads were legal.

The Time is NOW
By June 1966, Betty Friedan had returned to an idea that she and other women had been considering—the need for an organization to promote feminist goals. Friedan and others then set out to form the National Organization for Women (NOW). In October 1966 a group of about 30 women and men held the founding conference of NOW.

HISTORIAN |
Comparing and Contrasting
The emergence of social movements in the 1960s and 1970s has deep roots in American history. Social movements, historians contend, often share common goals—quality of life issues, political and democratic processes, economic and
environmental issues. The significance of the two decades is the concentration of all such issues in a small time span: gender equality at home and at work; political issues and processes; labor and civil rights causes; and environmental and health concerns.
The Equal Rights Amendment
The womens movement seemed to be off to a strong start when Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) in March 1972. The amendmei specified: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” To become part of the Constitution, the amendment had to be ratified by 38 states. Many state did so—35 by 1979—but then significant opposition to the amendment began to build.
Opponents argued that it would take away some womens rights. These included the right to alimony in divorce cases and the right to have singlegender colleges. They feared it would eliminate womens exemption from tl draft and do away with laws that provided special protection for women in the workforce.
One outspoken opponent was Phyllis Schlafly, organizer of the Stop ERA campaign. By the end of 1979, five states had voted to rescind their approval. Many people had become worried that the amendment would give federal courts too much power to interfere with state laws. Unable to achieve ratification by three-fourths of the states by the deadline set by Congress, the ERA finally failed in 1982.
Equality in Education
One major achievement of the movement came in the area of education. Kathy Striebels experience illustrated the discrimination female students often faced in the early 1970s. In 1971 Striebel, a junior high school student in St. Paul, Minnesota, wanted to compete for her school’s swim team, but the school did not allow girls to join. Kathy’s mother, Charlotte, was a member o the local NOW chapter. Through it, she learned that St. Paul had recently banned gender discrimination in education. She filed a grievance with the city s human rights department, and officials required the school to allow Kathy to swim.
onuxiiy alter joining me team, Kathy beat out one of the boys and ea a spot at a meet. As she stood on the block waiting to swim, the opposinj coach declared that she was ineligible because the meet was outside St. Pa and thus beyond the jurisdiction of its laws.

nearly all aspects of school operations, from admissions to athletics.
Title IX increased opportunities for women, but it also had some surprising and unintended consequences. Within just a few years, the number of women attending college surged, and by 1978 the majority of people attending college were women. By 2014, women made up approximately 58% of all college students.
Title IX also created new opportunities for women in college athletics, but it also increased expenses for colleges. If a college needed to add a womens sport, it would sometimes cancel a men’s sport in order to pay for it. In addition, prior to Title IX, the majority of coaches for women’s sports were women. But after Title IX, as women’s sports increased in funding and prestige, men were attracted to the field as well. Today, less than half of the coaches of women’s sports in college are women.
Right to Privacy and Roe v. Wade
The feminist movement worked to secure the right to make private
decisions, including reproductive decisions. A constitutional right to marital privacy was introduced in 1965 when the Supreme Court outlawed state bans on contraceptives for married couples in Griswold v. Connecticut.
The right to privacy was expanded beyond married couples when activists began challenging laws against abortion. Until 1973, the right to regulate abortion was reserved to the states. The original plan of the Constitution reserved most police power to the states. Police power refers to the state’s authority to enact laws impinging on personal or property rights in the interest of safety, health, welfare, and morality. Early in the country’s history, some abortions were permitted in the early stages of pregnancy. By the mid-1800s, however, states had passed laws prohibiting abortion, except to save the life of the mother. In the late 1960s, some states began adopting more liberal abortion laws. For example, several states allowed abortion if carrying a pregnancy to term might endanger the woman’s mental health or if she was a victim of rape or incest.
The big change came with the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. The decision stated that state governments could not regulate abortion during the first three months of pregnancy, a time that was ruled to be within a woman’s constitutional right to privacy. During the second three months of pregnancy, states could regulate abortions on the basis of the health of the mother. States could ban abortion in the final three months except in cases of a medical emergency. Those in favor of abortion rights cheered Roe v. Wade as a victory, but the issue was far from settled politically. The decision gave rise to the right-to-life movement, whose members consider abortion morally wrong and work toward its total ban.
After the Roe v. Wade ruling, the two sides began an impassioned battle that continues today. In the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court modified Roe v. Wade. The Court decided that states could place some restrictions on abortions. For example, doctors could be required to explain the risks and have patients give informed consent. Underage girls might now be required to inform their parents before getting an abortion, although the Court did strike down laws requiring women to notify their husbands before having an abortion. It also abandoned the rule that states could ban abortion only in the final trimester. Technology had enabled a fetus to be viable outside the womb much earlier in a pregnancy. States could now restrict abortion based on the viability ofthe fetus.
Tennis great Billie Jean King was a trailblazer in the effort to gain equality for women in sports. In 1972 Title IX banned educational discrimination against women in fields ranging from admissions to extracurricular activities.

The women’s movement profoundly changed society. Since the 1970s many women have pursued college degrees and careers outside ofthe home. Many employers now offer options to help women make work life more compatible with family life, including flexible hours, on-site child care, and job sharing.
Even with those changes, a significant income gap between men and women still exists. A major reason for the gap is that many working women still hold lower-paying jobs such as bank tellers, administrative assistants, cashiers, schoolteachers, and nurses. Women have made the most dramatic gains in professional jobs since the 1970s. By 2000, women made up more than 40 percent of the nations graduates receiving medical

Americans of Mexican heritage have lived in what is now the United States since before the founding of the republic. In the twentieth century, Mexican immigration to the United States rose greatly, partly due to the turmoil of the Mexican Revolution that began in 1910. During the 1920s, half a million Mexicans immigrated to the United States through official channels. An unknown number entered the country through other means.
While some persons of Mexican heritage moved to northern states, most remained concentrated in the areas that were once the northern provinces of Mexico. In 1930, 90 percent of ethnic Mexicans in the United States lived in areas of the West and Southwest. As a result of heavy Mexican immigration, the ethnic Mexican population in Texas grew from 71,062 in 1900 to 683,681 in 1930. Southern California, likewise, had a large Spanish-speaking population.
Mexicans Face Discrimination
Across the Southwest, most Mexican Americans lived in barrios. Barrios were the product of a combination of the regions history and discrimination against Latinos. Los Angeles was founded as a Spanish town in 1781. A century later when English-speaking settlers arrived, they built around the older Spanish-speaking district. From 1900 to 1930, Mexican immigration increased the ethnic Mexican population of the city from as many as 5,000 to around 150,000. By then, the Spanish-speaking population was

segregated in the eastern part of the city. Most lived in dilapidated housing and suffered high rates of infant mortality and disease.
In California and across the Southwest, employment discrimination meant that most ethnic Mexicans could find work only in low-paying jobs. Many worked as agricultural laborers. During the Great Depression, many Mexican Americans faced increased hostility and discrimination as unemployment rates soared. About one-third ofthe nations Mexican population returned to Mexico. Some left voluntarily, believing it would be easier to get by in Mexico. Others left as part of the repatriation—a series of deportations launched by federal officials. This included not only immigrants but often their American-born children as well.
During World War II, labor shortages in the Southwest led to the creation of the Bracero Program. Under this arrangement, Mexican workers entered into short-term labor contracts, mostly as low-wage farmworkers. Meanwhile, illegal immigration also increased. In 1954 Eisenhower’s administration launched a program intended to deport undocumented Latino immigrants. Police swept through barrios seeking undocumented immigrants. As a result, more than 3.7 million Mexicans were deported over the next three years.
The raids were criticized in the United States and in Mexico for intimidating people for simply “looking Mexican.” In addition, the program often failed to distinguish between individuals legally in the country—including U.S. citizens— and those who had entered illegally.
Other Latinos Arrive
Although Mexicans remained the largest group of Spanish-speaking newcomers in the 1950s, large numbers of Puerto Ricans arrived as well. American citizens since 1917, Puerto Ricans may move freely within American territory. After World War II, economic troubles prompted more than a million Puerto Ricans to move to the U.S. mainland. The majority settled in New York City, where they faced racial discrimination and high poverty levels.
The nation became home to more than 350,000 Cuban immigrants in the decade after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. Many were professionals and business owners who settled in the Miami, Florida, area. They were typically welcomed as refugees fleeing Communist oppression. By 1970, more than 9 million Latinos lived in the United States.

Latinos Organize
guidingquestion How was the Latino approach to gaining civil rights similar to and different from the African American civil rights movement?
Regardless of their citizenship status, people of Mexican heritage were often treated as outsiders by the English-speaking majority. Latinos formed organizations to work for equal rights and fair treatment.
In 1929 a number of Mexican American organizations came together to create the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). The organization’s purpose was to fight
discrimination against persons of Latin American ancestry. Membership was limited to those of Latin American heritage who were U.S. citizens. LULAC encouraged assimilation into American society and adopted English as its official language.
In Mendez v. Westminster (1947), a group of Mexican parents won a lawsuit that challenged school segregation in California. Two years after the Mendez case, LULAC filed a similar lawsuit that aimed to end the practice of segregating Spanish-speaking children into “Mexican schools” in the state of Texas. During the 1950s, the organization was also a vocal critic of the abuses of deportation authorities. In 1954 the Supreme Court’s ruling in Hernandez v. Texas extended more rights to Latino citizens. The case ended the exclusion of Mexican Americans from juries in Texas.
Another Latino organization, the American GI Forum, was founded by Dr. Hector P. Garcia. The purpose of the GI Forum was to protect the rights of Mexican American veterans. After World War II, Latino veterans were excluded from veterans’ organizations. They were also denied medical services by the Veterans Administration.
The GI Forum’s first effort to combat racial injustice involved a Mexican American soldier killed during World War II. A funeral home refused to hold his funeral because he was Mexican American. The GI Forum drew national attention to the incident, and the soldier s remains were buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Under Dr. Garcia’s leadership, the organization broadened its scope and began to challenge discrimination against all Latinos. It helped pay the poll taxes of poor Hispanics so that they could vote, fought against segregated schools, helped fund the attorneys arguing Hernandez v. Texas, and worked to register Latino voters. In 1968, Garcia was appointed to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Today the GI Forum has nearly 160,000 members across the United States.

civil rights?
As the 1960s began, Latino Americans continued to face prejudice and limited access to adequate education, employment, and housing. Encouraged by the African American civil rights movement, Latinos launched a series of campaigns to improve their economic situation anden discrimination.
In the early 1960s, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta organized two groups that fought for farmworkers. In 1965 the groups went on strike in California to demand union recognition, increased wages, and better benefits. When employers resisted, Chavez organized a national boycott of table grapes. Between 14 and 17 million citizens stopped buying grapes, and industry profits tumbled. In 1966 Chavez and Huerta merged their tw< organizations into the United Farm Workers (UFW). Chavez held a hunger strike in 1968 to support the effort. A UFW spokesman described the impact the hunger strike had on Chavez and the farmworkers: “After twenty-five days, Cesar was carried to a nearby park where the fast ended during a mass with thousands of farmworkers. He had lost thirty-five pounds, but there was no more talk about violence among the farmworkers.” The new union kept the boycott going until 1970, when the grape growers finally agreed to raise wages and improve working conditions.
Latino youths also became involved in civil rights. In 1967 college students in San Antonio, Texas, led by Jose Angel Gutierrez, founded the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO). MAYO organized walkouts and demonstrations to protest discrimination. One Texas walkou led to the creation of bilingual education at a local high school.
MAYO’s success and the spread of protests across the West and Southwest convinced Gutierrez to found a new political party in 1969. It was called La Raza Unida, or “the United People.” La Raza Unida mobilize Mexican American voters with calls for job-training programs and greater access to financial institutions. By the early 1970s, it had elected Latinos tc local offices in several cities with large Latino populations. A larger civil rights movement among Mexican Americans, many of whom began callinj themselves Chicanos, emerged. The movement fought against discrimination and celebrated ethnic pride.
In the late 1960s, many Latino leaders promoted bilingualism—the practice of teaching immigrant students in their own language while they also learned English. Congress supported this movement by passing the Bilingual Education Act in 1968, which directed school districts to set up classes for immigrants in their own language while they were learning English. This became politically controversial. Beginning in the 1980s, an English-only movement began. By the 2000s, more than half of the nation state legislatures had passed laws or amendments makin g English the official language of their state.
The Chicano Mural Movement
Efforts by Hispanic Americans to defend their civil rights and promote economic opportunity within their community were encouraged by a renewed sense of their ethnic and cultural identity. In the 1960s, a new arl movement egan in the urban southwest, particularly in the Mexican-
merican arrios of Texas and southern California. Artists, often working
532
with teams of volunteers from local communities, began creating large brightly colored murals on the walls of city buildings, schools, churches, highway overpasses, and apartment buildings.
The style ofthe murals was inspired by the works of artists Diego Garcia and Jose Orozco. The murals depicted Mexican American culture, which is why the movement came to be known as the Chicano Mural Movement. The style of the murals resembled the styles of art in ancient Mexico, but it reflected the characteristics and issues of the 1960s and 1970s.
The murals reminded Latinos of their cultural heritage and religion, portrayed economic and social problems, especially those facing farm workers and domestic workers, and challenged the racism of the era. Murals also included portraits of Cesar Chavez, famous Latino heroes from American, Mexican, and Texan history, pictures of missions, and religious scenes.
An important positive impact of the Chicano Mural Movement was that it helped remind Hispanics of their identity, their contributions to the United States, and encouraged them to support the struggle for their rights. As with all cultural movements that emphasize an ethnic identity, however, a potential negative effect of the movement was that it might also have

Dolores Huerta (1930-)
In 1955 Dolores Huerta helped found the Stockton chapter ofthe Community Service Organization (CSO). The group fought for Mexican American civil rights. Huerta led voter registration drives and worked for improved public services for farmworkers and other community residents.
In 1962 Huerta joined with Cesar Chavez to form the National Farm Workers Association (NWFA).

When the NWFA became the United Farmworkers (UFW), Huerta continued her activism on behalf of farmworkers by lobbying in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., against the farm owners' use of toxic pesticides that harmed workers, organizing strikes of field workers, and campaigning for candidates favorable to the farmworkers'causes.

Place and Time: United States 1970-1979

When President Nixon took office, he decided to take a new approach to American relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The United States had been at odds with these Communist countries for decades. Nixon's new approach was one of detente, or easing of tensions, with the two nations. The Cold War was still on, but Nixon believed that only by redefining American foreign policy and forming partnerships with his "opponents" could anything be gained.

It Matters Because
After he won the 1968 election, President Richard Nixon sought to restore law and order at home. His greatest accomplishments, however, were in foreign policy, where he worked to ease Cold War tensions with China and the Soviet Union.
Appealing to Middle America
guiding question What were Nixon's keys to victory in the 1968 presidential election?
Many Americans longed for an end to the turmoil that seemed to be plaguing the nation. In 1968 these frustrated citizens turned to Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon. He aimed his campaign messages at this group, whom he referred to as “Middle America” and the “silent majority.” Nixon promised “peace with honor” in Vietnam and law and order at home. He also promised a more streamlined government and a return to more traditional values.
In the election, Nixon faced President Johnson’s vice president, Democrat Hubert Humphrey. He also went up against a strong third-party candidate, George Wallace, an experienced Southern politician and avowed supporter of segregation. Wallace captured 13.5 percent of the popular vote. Yet Nixon managed to win with 43.4 percent of the popular vote to Humphrey’s 42.7, and 301 electoral votes to Humphrey’s 191.
The Southern Strategy
Nixon partially owed his victory to a surprisingly strong showing in the South. The South had long been a Democratic stronghold, but Nixon worked hard to get its support. He had met with powerful South Carolina senator Strom Thurmond and won his support by promising several things. Nixon agreed to appoint only conservatives to the federal courts and to name a Southerner to the Supreme Court. He also promised to oppose court-ordered busing and to choose a vice-presidential candidate that the South could support. (Nixon chose Spiro Agnew, governor of the state of Maryland.)
Nixons efforts paid off on Election Day. Large numbers of white Southerners left the Democratic Party. Humphrey’s only Southern victory was in Lyndon Johnsons home state of Texas. Wallace claimed most ofthe states in the Deep South, but Nixon captured Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and North Carolina. Thurmond’s support delivered his state of South Carolina for the Republicans as well.
After his victory, Nixon set out to attract more Southerners to the Republican Party. This effort became known as the Southern strategy.
He took steps to slow desegregation and worked to overturn civil rights policies. He also reversed a program that had cut off funds for racially segregated schools.
A
Law-and-Order President Nixon had promised to uphold law and order, and his administration went after antiwar protesters. Attorney General John Mitchell warned that he stood ready to prosecute anyone who crossed state lines to start riots.
His deputy, Richard Kleindienst, declared, “We’re going to enforce the law against draft evaders, against radical students, against deserters, against civil disorders, against organized crime, and against street crime.”
President Nixon also attacked the recent Supreme Court rulings that expanded the rights of accused criminals. Nixon openly criticized the Court and its chief justice, Earl Warren. The president promised to fill vacancies on the Court with judges who would support the rights of law enforcement over the rights of suspected criminals.
Warren retired soon after Nixon took office. The president replaced him with respected conservative judge Warren Burger. He placed three other conservative justices on the Court, including one from the South. The Burger Court did not reverse Warren Court rulings on suspects’ rights, but it refused to expand those rights. For example, in Stone v. Powell (1976), it limited defendants’ rights to appeal state convictions to the federal judiciary. The Burger Court also reaffirmed capital punishment.

Removal of U.S. Troops From Iraq
Just as Vietnamization called for the South Vietnamese military to take over duties from American troops, the gradual close of American involvement in Iraq has seen American troops give increased responsibility to Iraqi security forces. Although American combat troops officially left Iraq in August 2010, some 50,000 soldiers remained in the country. Their primary duty was to help the Iraqi army as it assumed full control over the nations security.
SKILLS PRACTICE

Draw a picture if it helps you remember the vocabulary. Think of the words and pictures the next time you hear or see one ofthe new vocabulary words.
The New Federalism
Nixon had also promised to reduce the size of the federal government. He planned to end several federal programs and give more control to state and local governments. Nixon called this the “New Federalism.” He argued that such an approach would make government more effective. I reject the patronizing idea that government in Washington, D.C., is inevitably more wise, more honest and more efficient than government at the local or State level,” Nixon declared. “The idea that a bureaucratic elite in Washington knows what’s best for people ... is really a contention that people cannot govern themselves.”
Under Nixon’s New Federalism plan, Congress passed a series of revenue-sharing bills granting federal funds to state and local agencies. As states came to depend on federal funds, the federal government could impose conditions on states. Unless states met those conditions, funds would be cut off.
As part of the New Federalism, Nixon wanted to end many of Johnson’s Great Society programs. He vetoed funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He eliminated the Office of Economic Opportunity, and tried unsuccessfully to shut down the Job Corps.
When Congress appropriated money for programs he opposed, Nixon impounded, or refused to release, the funds. By 1973, it was estimated that he had impounded as much as $18 billion. The Supreme Court eventually declared the practice of impoundment unconstitutional.
The Family Assistance Plan
One federal program Nixon wanted to reform was the nation’s welfare system—Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The program had many critics. In 1969 Nixon proposed replacing the AFDC with the Family Assistance Plan. The plan called for providing needy families a yearly grant of $1,600, which could be supplemented by outside earnings. Many liberals applauded the plan as a significant step toward expanding federal responsibility for the poor.
Although the program won approval in the House in 1970, it soon came under harsh attack. Welfare recipients complained that the federal grant was too low. Conservatives disapproved of guaranteed income. Such opposition led to the program’s defeat in the Senate.
gREADING PROGRESS CHECK
Explaining What were Nixon's first priorities when coming into office?
Nixon's Foreign Policy
guiding question What do you think was Nixon's greatest foreign policy achievement?
Despite Nixon’s domestic initiatives, a State Department official later recalled that Nixon had a “monumental disinterest in domestic policies.” Nixon once expressed his hope that a “competent cabinet” of advisers could run the country, allowing him to focus on foreign affairs.
Nixon and Kissinger
In a move that would greatly influence his foreign policy, Nixon chose as his national security advisor Henry Kissinger, a former Harvard professor. Kissinger had served under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson as a foreign policy consultant. Although Secretary of State William Rogers outranked him, Kissinger soon took the lead in helping shape Nixon’s foreign policy.
542
The Nixon Doctrine Nixon and Kissinger shared many views. Both believed abandoning the war in Vietnam would damage the nation’s position in the world. Thus, they worked toward a gradual withdrawal while also training the South Vietnamese to defend themselves.
This policy of Vietnamization, as it was called, was extended globally in what came to be known as the Nixon Doctrine. In July 1969, only six months after taking office, Nixon announced that the United States would honor all ofthe alliances it had signed. The nation would continue to provide military aid and training to allies. Yet, it would no longer “conceive all the plans, design all the programs, execute all the decisions and undertake all the defense of the free nations of the world.” America’s allies would have to take responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in their own areas of the world.
The New Policy of Detente The Soviet Union was not pleased when Nixon became president. He was known to be strongly anti-Communist. Yet Nixon and Kissinger believed the United States needed to adjust to the growing role of China, Japan, and Western Europe. This emerging “multipolar” world demanded a different approach to American foreign policy.
Both Nixon and Kissinger wanted to continue to contain communism, but they believed that negotiation with Communists was a better way for the United States to achieve its international goals. They developed a new approach called detente, or relaxation of tensions, between the United States and its two major Communist rivals, the Soviet Union and China. Nixon said that the nation had to build a better relationship with its main rivals for world peace:

detente a policy that attempts to relax or ease tensions between x nations
PRIMARYSOURCE
K
We must understand that detente is not a love fest. It is an understanding between nations that have opposite purposes, but which share common interests, including the avoidance of a nuclear war. Such an understanding can work—that is, restrain aggression and deter war—only as long as the potential aggressor is made to recognize that neither aggression nor war will be profitable. ** —quoted in The Limits of Power, 1992
The successes of detente were diminished due to upheavals in smaller nations. In Chile, President Salvador Allende was killed during a coup supported by the American CIA. Similarly, the Angolan Civil War, which began in 1975, featured secret aid from the United States. The conflicts in Chile and Angola were examples of proxy wars—conflicts during the Cold War that did not directly involve the United States and the Soviet Union but pursued Cold War aims of the two superpowers.
Nixon Visits China
Detente began with an effort to improve American-Chinese relations. Since 1949, when Communists took power in China, the United States had refused to recognize the Communists as the legitimate rulers. Instead, the U.S.
3 government recognized the exiled : regime on the island of Taiwan as ’ the Chinese government. Having 5 long supported this policy, Nixon E now set out to reverse it.

CRITICALTHINKING
Identifying Central Ideas What was the primary goal ofthe policy of detente? Henry Kissinger (1923-)
After a series of highly secret negotiations between Kissinger and Chinese leaders, Nixon announced that he would visit China in February 1972. During the historic trip, the leaders of both nations agreed to establish “more normal” relations between their countries. In a statement Nixon told his Chinese hosts during a banquet toast:

United States-Soviet Tensions Ease
Nixon’s strategy toward the Soviet Union worked. Shortly after the public learned of American negotiations with China, the Soviets proposed an American-Soviet summit, or high-level diplomatic meeting, to be held in May 1972. On May 22, President Nixon flew to Moscow for a weeklong summit. Nixon was the first American president since World War II to visit the Soviet Union.
During the historic Moscow summit, the two superpowers signed the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, or SALT I, a plan the two nations had been working on for years. The treaty temporarily froze the number of strategic nuclear weapons. Nixon and Soviet premeir Leonid Brezhnev also agreed to increase trade and the exchange of scientific information. Detente had helped ease tensions between the two countries. One Soviet official admitted that by the end of Nixon’s presidency, “the United States and the Soviet Union had their best relationship of the whole Cold War period.”
Another highlight of detente was a series of meetings that created the Helsinki Accords. In 1975 the United States, Canada, and most of the countries of Eastern and Western Europe committed to three sets of recommendations focusing on security, economic, and human rights issues. In one section, the signing states agreed to “respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.”
President Nixon indeed had made his mark on the world stage. However, a scandal was about to engulf his presidency and plunge the nation into one of its greatest constitutional crises.

The Watergate Scandal

It matters Because
Despite a successful first term, Richard Nixon and his supporters worried about reelection. The tactics they resorted to led to the Watergate scandal, one ofthe nation's great constitutional crises.
The Roots of Watergate
guiding question Why did Nixon's advisers order a break-in at the Democratic Party's headquarters?
The Watergate scandal led to the only time in the nations history when the president of the United States was forced to resign from office. It began on the morning of June 17, 1972, when a young Washington Post reporter named Bob Woodward was assigned to cover a seemingly insignificant but bizarre incident. Early that morning, five men had broken into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in the city’s Watergate apartment office complex. Woodward attended the arraignment. He was asked to go to see if there was a story worth reporting.
As Woodward sat near the back of the courtroom listening to the bail proceedings for the five defendants, the judge asked each man his occupation. One of the men, James McCord, answered that he was retired from government service. “Where in government?” asked the judge. “CIA,” McCord whispered. Woodward sprang to attention. Why was a former CIA agent involved in what seemed to be just a burglary? Over the next two years, Woodward and another reporter, Carl Bernstein, investigated this question. They uncovered a scandal that helped trigger a constitutional crisis and eventually forced Nixon to resign.
Mounting a Reelection Fight
The Watergate scandal directly involved the Nixon administration’s efforts to cover up its involvement in the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. It also included other illegal actions. Many scholars believe the roots of the scandal, however, lay in Nixon’s character and the atmosphere of the White House.

CRITICALTHINKING
Identifying Central Ideas What made the Watergate scandal so damaging to the Nixon administration?
Richard Nixon had fought hard to become president, battling back from numerous political defeats. Along the way, he had grown defensive, secretive, and often resentful of his critics. He became president amid race riots, war protests, and other turmoil. He became so consumed with his opponents that he made an “enemies list” of people whom he considered a threat to his presidency.
As the 1972 presidential election approached, Nixons reelection prospects seemed promising, but not certain. He had just finished triumphant trips to China and the Soviet Union. Former governor George Wallace had dropped out ofthe race after an assassins bullet paralyzed him. And many considered Democratic challenger Senator George McGovern too liberal. But the Vietnam War still raged, and staffers remembered the close 1968 election. Determined to win, they began spying on opposition rallies and spreading rumors about opponents.
Trying to help the president, Nixons advisers ordered five men to break into the Democratic Party’s headquarters at the Watergate complex and steal sensitive campaign information. They were also to place wiretaps on the office telephones. While the burglars worked, a security guard spotted a piece of tape holding a door lock. The guard removed the tape, but when he passed the door later, he saw that it had been replaced. He quickly called police, who arrived shortly and arrested the men.
The Cover-Up Begins
After the break-in, the media discovered that one burglar, James McCord, was not only an ex-CIA officer but also a member of the Committee for the Re-election of the President (CRP). Reports surfaced that the burglars had been paid from a secret CRP fund controlled by the White House.
Nixon may not have ordered the break-in, but he did order a cover-up. White House officials destroyed incriminating documents and gave investigators false testimony. With Nixon’s consent, administration officials asked the CIA to stop the FBI from investigating the source of money paid to the burglars. The CIA told the FBI that the investigation threatened national security. FBI deputy director W. Mark Felt then secretly leaked information about Watergate to the Washington Post.
Meanwhile, Nixon’s press secretary dismissed the incident, and the president told the American public, “The White House has had no involvement whatever in this particular incident.” It worked. Most Americans believed Nixon. Despite efforts by the media to keep the story alive, few people paid much attention during the 1972 presidential campaign. Nixon won reelection by one of the largest margins in history.

Sirica, McCord agreed to cooperate with the grand jury investigation and to testify before the newly created Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities. The chairman of the committee was Democratic senator Sam J. Ervin from North Carolina.
A
Summer of Shocking Testimony McCord’s testimony opened a floodgate of confessions. Presidential counsel John Dean who had testified in June 1973, confessed that former attorney general John Mitchell had ordered the Watergate break-in and that Nixon had taken part in the cover-up.
The Nixon administration strongly denied the charges. Dean had no evidence, and the Senate committee spent weeks trying to determine who was telling the truth. The answer appeared on July 16. White House aide Alexander Butterfield testified that Nixon had ordered a taping system installed in the White House to record all conversations to help him write his memoirs after leaving office. The tapes would tell the committee what Nixon knew and when he knew it—if the president released them.
The Case of the Tapes
At first, Nixon refused to hand over the tapes, pleading executive privilege, the principle that White House conversations should remain confidential to protect national security. Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox took Nixon to court in October 1973 to make him give up the tapes. Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Cox, but Richardson refused and resigned. Nixon then ordered Richardson’s deputy to fire Cox, but he, too, resigned. Nixon’s solicitor general, Robert Bork, finally fired Cox, but the incident badly damaged Nixon’s reputation.
The fall of 1973 proved disastrous for other reasons as well. Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in disgrace after investigators found that he had taken

UNITED STATES
v. NIXON, 1974 Background to the Case In 1974 Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski issued a subpoena to gain access to audio tape recordings President Nixon had made of conversations. Jaworski believed that the tapes would prove the active involvement of the president in the Watergate cover-up. Nixon filed a motion to prevent the subpoena, claiming executive privilege. The case went to district court, but that court withheld judgment pending the decision of the Supreme Court.
The Senate committee overseeing the Watergate investigation, chaired by Senator Sam Ervin (fourth from left at the table), wanted access to Nixon's White House tape recordings.
How the Court Ruled
In a unanimous 8-to-0 decision (Justice Rehnquist did not take part), the Supreme Court found that executive privilege did not protect Nixon's tape recordings. The ruling stated that while the president has a right to protect military secrets and other sensitive material and has a right to some confidentiality, the needs of a criminal trial must take precedence. In the Court s opinion Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote, "We conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice....

Nixon Resigns
Nixon tried to quell outrage by appointing a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, who also proved determined to obtain the tapes. In July the Supreme Court ruled that Nixon had to surrender them. He complied. Days later, the House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach Nixon, or officially charge him with misconduct. Charges included obstructing justice, misusing federal agencies to violate the rights of citizens, and defying the authority of Congress. Then new evidence emerged: a tape revealed that Nixon had ordered the CIA to stop the FBI probe into the Watergate burglary on June 23, 1972. Impeachment and conviction were inevitable. On August 9, 1974, Nixon resigned in disgrace.
Vice President Gerald Ford took office as president of the United States after Nixon’s resignation. He urged Americans to put the scandal behind them, saying, “Our long national nightmare is over.” On September 8, 1974, Ford announced a full pardon for Nixon. Ford’s pardon of Nixon drew public criticism and diminished his popularity.
The Impact of Watergate
The constitutional crisis led to new laws intended to limit the power of the executive branch. The Federal Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 limited campaign contributions and set up an independent agency to enforce strict election laws. The Ethics in Government Act required financial disclosure by high government officials throughout all branches of government. The FBI Domestic Security Investigation Guidelines Act restricted the FBI’s political intelligence-gathering activities. Congress also laid out a means to appoint an independent counsel to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing by high government officials.
Many Americans developed a distrust of public officials. Others, such as Bob Woodward, believed the affair proved that no one is above the law: “Watergate was probably a good thing for the country. . . . The problem with kings, and prime ministers, and presidents, is that they think . . . that they have some special rights. . . . We have our laws and believe them, and they apply to everyone, [which] is a very good thing.”

Changes in Immigration Law
guidingquestion How have important immigration laws affected legal and illegal immigration to the United States?
After the introduction of the national origins quota system in the 1920s, the sources and character of immigration to the United States changed dramatically. For the next few decades, the total number of immigrants arriving annually remained markedly lower. The quota system, which favored immigrants from northern and western Europe, remained largely unchanged until the mid-1960s.
The Immigration Act of 1965 abolished the national origins quota system. It gave preference to skilled persons and persons with close relatives who are U.S. citizens—policies that remain in place today. The preference given to the children, spouses, and parents of U.S. citizens meant that migration chains were established. As newcomers became citizens, they could send for relatives in their home country. Also, the legislation introduced the first limits on immigration from the Western Hemisphere. The act further provided that immigrants could apply for U.S. citizenship after five years of legal residency.
At the time of its passage, few people expected that the new law would cause much change in the pattern or volume of immigration to the United States. Supporters of the law presented it as an extension of America’s growing commitment to equal rights for all people, regardless of race or ethnicity. As U.S. Representative Philip Burton of California explained:
604
PRIMARYSOURCE
«Just as we sought to eliminate discrimination in our land through the Civil Rights Act, today we seek by phasing out the national origins quotas to eliminate discrimination in immigration to this Nation composed ofthe descendants of immigrants.”
—from a speech before Congress, August 25,1965
Supporters of the new law also assumed that the new equal quotas for non-European nations would generally go unfilled. In fact, immigration from non-European countries soared. Some newcomers arrived in the United States as refugees. Beginning in 1948, refugees from countries ravaged by World War II were admitted, although they were counted as part of their nation’s quota. The Cold War brought more refugees. According to the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, anyone who was fleeing a Communist regime could be admitted as a refugee. The Refugee Act of 1980 further broadened U.S. policy by defining a refugee as anyone leaving his or her country due to a “well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular group, or political opinion.”
The growing problem of illegal immigration also prompted changes in immigration law. During the Reagan administration, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which established penalties for employers who knowingly hired unauthorized immigrants. This law strengthened border controls to prevent illegal entry into the United States. It also set up a process to grant amnesty, or a pardon, to any undocumented alien who could prove that he or she had entered the country before January 1,1982, and had since lived in the United States.

26C explain how the contributions of people of various racial, ethnic, gender, and religious groups shape American culture
Despite these changes, illegal immigration persisted, and the number c unauthorized immigrants grew. By 1990 an estimated 3.5 million unauthorized immigrants resided in the United States. By the mid-1990s, Congress was debating new ways to combat illegal immigration. It passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which made several changes to American immigration law.
First, it required families sponsoring an immigrant to have an income above the poverty level. Second, it allocated more resources to stop illegal immigration, authorizing an additional 5,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents am calling for the construction of a 14-mile fence along the border near San Diego. Third, the law toughened penalties for smuggling people or providing fraudulent documents. Finally, the law made it easier for immigration authorities to deport undocumented aliens.
Another change in immigration law was spurred by the terrorist attacks of September 11,2001. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 put immigration under the control of the newly created Department of Homeland Security. It also tripled the number of Border Patrol agents, Customs Service inspectors, and Immigration and Naturalization Service inspectors along the Canadian border.

guiding question Howhasthe federal government addressed immigration reform in the twenty-first centu
Certain states experienced a larger influx of immigrants than others. In 19? California, Texas, New York, New Jersey, and Florida had the largest populations of foreign-born residents. High numbers of immigrants also increased the ethnic diversity of these states, as their Latino and Asian populations grew. Among the immigrants who arrived during the 1990s, just over 10 percent came from Europe. More than half of new immigrants came from Latin America, while about another 25 percent came from Asia. By 2001 the top five countries of origin for legal immigrants to the United States were Mexico, India, China, the Philippines, and Vietnam.
Refugees added to the growing immigrant population. In the 25 years following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, more than 800,000 Cubans arrived in the United States. So many settled in the Miami, Florida, area that the only city that is home to more Cubans is Havana, Cuba. Also, the Vietnam War

created refugees. Some 600,000 immigrants from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia arrived in the decade after 1974.
Other immigrants arrived without official permission. The largest number of unauthorized immigrants came from Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The amnesty program established in 1986 had been designed to solve the problem of illegal immigration. Yet, over the next 20 years, the number of unauthorized immigrants more than tripled. Americans were divided over whether unauthorized immigrants should be able to obtain driver’s licenses or send their children to public schools and receive other government services.
Some believed that unauthorized immigrants should be deported. Others favored allowing them to apply for temporary work visas so the government could keep track of them. Some supported permitting them to earn permanent residence if they learned English, paid back taxes, and had no criminal record.
In 2006 President George W. Bush made immigration reform a top priority, but members of Congress strongly disagreed over how to solve the problem. A bipartisan majority of the Senate favored legislation that blended tougher enforcement of immigration laws with some form of earned citizenship.
The Senate bill included a provision that allowed undocumented aliens who grew up in the United States and graduated from high school to apply for citizenship. Conservative Republicans who held the majority in the House objected that this would reward illegal behavior. “Granting amnesty to people who broke the law penalizes the millions of people who are waiting to come to America legally,” argued Republican senator Phil Gramm of Texas.
The House rejected any form of amnesty and called for the United States to build a wall along its Mexican border. By this time, the United States had already tripled the size of its border patrol without reducing illegal immigration. As Congress debated a bill that would subject undocumented aliens to criminal prosecution, Latinos held rallies across the country, carrying signs that read:
“We are not criminals.”
Advocates of immigration reform promoted alternatives such as expanding quotas through a guest-worker program and establishing a legalization process for those already in the country. Some undocumented immigrants had lived in the United States for years and had raised families. Deporting them would mean separating husbands, wives, and children. Some had arrived as children and had lived in the United States most of their lives.
Their own children, born in the United States, were native-born citizens even though their parents lacked legal status. Among those who became legal citizens, most wanted other family members to join them.

On our third attempt, my wife, children, and I escaped by boat from Vietnam and arrived in Hong Kong, where we remained for three months. Then my brother, who came to America in 1975, sponsored us, and we arrived in America in 1978....
Neither I nor anyone in our family spoke any English before our arrival in America. I realized that I must study to communicate.... For nine months we lived in one town, where my children went to school. My wife and I also attended school to learn English....
[W]e still have the need to return to Vietnam one day. This is our dream. In Vietnam, before the Communists came, we had a sentimental life, more [mentally] comfortable and cozy, more joyful....
Here in America, we have all the material comforts, very good. But... In Vietnam ... when we were out from the home, we laughed, we jumped. And we had many relatives and friends to come to see us at home. Here in America, I only know what goes on in my home; my neighbor knows only what goes on in his home. We have a saying, ‘One knows only one’s home.’ In America, when we go to work, we go in our cars. When we return, we leave our cars and enter our homes [and do not meet neighbors],... That’s why we do not have the kind of being at ease that we knew in Vietnam.
Everything is very smooth for us in America, and we have quickly adapted to our new life here.... This is our fourth home. When we le our previous place, our neighbors cried, for they liked us very much. We used to visit one another and exchange gifts at Christmas. When we came to this place, two or three of our neighbors came to see us. Since that day they like us. Thanks to God, I have that thing, that kind of nature.

ORAL INTERVIEW
Usually we catch young men, who are looking for work to support their families back in Mexico. But more and more we are seeing entire families. They start coming around 7:30 P.M. over the mesa near Cristo Rey Mountain. A steady stream of people all night. We use our night vision “infrared” equipment to spot a lot of illegals who would otherwise go unnoticed.
Sometimes border patrolmen ride horseback to patrol these hills. It’s an interesting contrast-high-tech infrared machines directing cowboys on horseback. Other times we patrol in small trucks, which provide maneuverability. Before we begin using night-vision equipment, aliens had an easier time coming through this area without getting caught. Now we can sit on top of a hill, spot undocumented aliens, then radio for patrol vehicles to come apprehend the groups or individuals after they enter into Texas or New Mexico.
This time of year, in late winter, the aliens try to find work on farms in the Upper Rio Grande Valley. This is the time when farm laborers start pulling weeds and preparing the ground for planting. Between New Year and June ... many ofthe aliens we apprehend are usually agricultural workers or people heading for cities further north, like Denver or Chicago. Perhaps our greatest concern is the trafficking of drugs tied to the smuggling of illegal aliens. Smuggling of all sorts has become big business in the border regions....
We catch illegal immigrants who come from as many as eighty-five countries around the world. Even people from Eastern Europe, who are smuggled in for large fees through South America and Mexico City.
It’s a pretty lonesome feeling out here at night, alone or with a partner. We do get the feeling that we’re outnumbered.... I’ve jumped into a boxcar or a freight-train gondola, turned on my flashlight, and seen twenty-five or thirty aliens. What can I do? Surround them? I can only tell them to get off the train. If they want to fight,
I’m in trouble. That does happen from time to time but, fortunately, not very often. Most of the freight-yarders are from farther down south in Mexico. They’re real docile. There have been times I’ve jumped off a moving train while chasing people, stepped in a hole, and fallen face down. The guy I was chasing stopped and came back to help me. He said, ‘Gee, did you hurt yourself? I’m sorry.’
... The great majority of them are decent people coming here to look for work. Their families’ economics conditions are pretty bad in Mexico. You have to sympathize with them to a point. But if you open the border wide up, you’re going to invite political and social upheaval. Our job is to prevent illegal entry to our country, but we know that they’re going to keep coming as long as our grass is greener. And we also know that we can’t catch them all.”

Using a Database
Why Learn This Skill?
Do you have a large collection of MP3 music files or a collection of digital photos? Do you have a list of email addresses, phone numbers, or SMS contacts on your phone or computer? If so, you have created a database. In the world today, there a literally millions of databases and if you want to be successful, you will almost certainly need to know how to use a database.
Learning the Skill
A database is simply information that has been collected and arranged so that it is easy to find information. A database can hold any kind of information—photos, maps, text, data, music, etc. A database is not the same thing as the Internet. The information in a database is usually more reliable and better organized because it is "curated." Someone reviewed the data to make sure it was accurate and appropriate.
A database can be created entirely on paper. An old printed phone book is a database. But the term is generally used to refer to information stored on a computer. Programmers create software called database management systems (DBMS) that let people store, organize, search, and retrieve data. Modern database software allows users to display the data visually. Instead of just presenting lists of facts and numbers, the software takes the information you want from the database and presents it as a graph, or chart, or table, or even sets it as a layer over top of a map so you can see the relationship between the data and geographical locations. Database software also allows users to easily add, delete, change, or update information.
When searching a database, it is helps to understand how a database is structured. A database is made up of records. A record represents one item of data, such as a photo, 01 song, or an article, etc. Each record has standa; fields of information. For example, there is usually a title field, a subject field, and a field with a date, and usually there are many other fields as well. Think of a database as a giant table of information made up of columns and rows. The words used to describe each item in the cells of the table are the fields. The words p into fields and the words used to label the columns and rows are called metadata. Metad< is what the computer searches when you ask it find information in a database.
Follow these steps to use a database:
1.	Determine what information you want t access. Be as specific as possible.
2.	Databases typically have a number of fields where you can select words or categories for a specific search. Think about what you already know about the information. Use that knowledge to decide what terms you want in the field! for your search.
3.	If there is not a field that fits with what you want to find, you often can use a keyword search. This is similar to using search engine on the Internet. Keyword searching allows you to combine terms and concepts to find exactly what you ar looking for. Most databases let you use Boolean operators. Boolean operators are connecting words that give commands t< the computer. Boolean operators are the words "AND" "OR" and "NOT." They le you combine search words and shape your search more effectively.
4.	Create a search string with keywords using Boolean operators that matches what you are trying to find.
5.	Review the records or information retrieved from the database to determine if it is what you wanted. If not try a new search.
610

Practicing this Skill
In recent years, databases have become an extremely popular way to display geographic information. The databases take the geographic information requested and draw it on a map so that it is easy to visualize. These kind of databases can be used to see geographic distributions and geographic patterns. A geographic distribution shows where things are located and how much is located in each area. A geographic pattern shows how things change geographically over time or over distance.
The United States Census Bureau now has online many database systems for looking up geographic information. Go to www.census.gov. Locate the Census Data Mapper and launch it. Select "Population and Race" for the data theme field, "Percent Hispanic" for the data table field, and 5 classes. Have the database make your map then answer the following questions:
1.	Analyzing Geographic Distributions What states have the highest percentage of Hispanics?
2.	Analyzing Geographic Patterns What pattern do you see in how Hispanic Americans are distributed in the United States?
3.	Posing Questions about Geographic Distributions Based on the areas where Hispanic populations are highest, what three countries do you think might be the source for most Hispanic immigrants? What questions do you need to ask about the geographic distribution to be able to know for sure where most Hispanic immigrants originated?
4.	Posing Questions about Geographic Patterns Now change the data table field to Percent Asian. How is the geographic pattern of Asian Americans similar to Hispanic Americans? How is it different? What questions do you need to ask to understand why the Asian pattern is different from the Hispanic pattern?

The first electronic digital computer began operation in 1946 and was the size of a small house. In 1959 Robert Noyce designed the first integrated circuit—a whole electronic circuit on a single silicon chip. In 1968 Noyce’s company, Intel, put several integrated circuits on a single chip. This made circuits much smaller and easy to manufacture.
By the late 1960s, manufacturers were making microprocessors, or single chips with many integrated circuits containing both memory and computing functions. These microprocessors made computers even smaller and faster.
Using microprocessor technology, Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak set out to build a small computer suitable for personal use. They founded Apple Computer in 1976. The following year they launched the Apple II, the first practical and affordable home computer. In 1981 International Business Machines (IBM) introduced the “Personal Computer, or PC. In 1984 Apple put out the Macintosh, which used on-screen symbols called icons that users could manipulate with a hand-operated device called a mouse.
As Jobs and Wozniak were creating Apple, Bill Gates cofounded Microsoft. In 1980 IBM hired Microsoft to make an operating system for its new PC. The system was called MS-DOS. Microsoft came out with the “Windows” operating system in 1985. Computers became essential tools in almost all businesses. By the late 1990s, many workers were able to telecommute, or work from home via computer.
Telecommunications also underwent a revolution. In 1996 Congress passed a law allowing phone companies to compete with one another and to send television signals. It also allowed cable companies to

offer telephone service. Soon wireless digital technology made it possible to make small, inexpensive satellite dishes for home use. Cell phones, invented in the 1940s, became popular as wireless digital technology made phones smaller and service cheaper. As this technology became more advanced, companies developed interconnectable digital music players, cameras, radios, televisions, and music and video recorders.

The Rise of the Internet
guiding question How have advances in telecommunications and the rise ofthe Internet affected the U.S. standard of living?
The Internet began as a system of networked computers of a U.S. Defense Department agency that linked to a system of networked supercomputers ofthe National Science Foundation. Similar networks grew across the world, and this communications system became known as the Internet.
As personal computer ownership rose, individuals—rather than just government agencies—began connecting to the Internet. By 2007, more than 1 billion people around the world were regularly using the Internet. Birth of the World Wide Web
In 1990 researchers in Switzerland developed a new way to present information on Internet-linked computers. Known as the World Wide Web, this system used hypertext, or “links,” and was accessed with Web browser software. Users could post information on Web pages and use links to move between sites.
Enthusiasm for the World Wide Web spawned a “dot-com” economy. The stock of Internet-related companies helped fuel the prosperity of the 1990s. It fell dramatically in 2000 when many unprofitable online companies failed. A few “dot-com” companies were very successful. This new economy also required American workers to acquire new skills. This retraining increased productivity as well as the nations GDP. Driven by the information technology industry, the GDP rose more than 20 percent during the mid- to late 1990s.
The Internet Changes Society
For many people, the World Wide Web builds a sense of community. People with common interests visit the same Web sites to post comments and interact with one another. They share stories and photos about themselves on blogs— short for Web logs. “People read and publish blogs because they recognize that there is a way to put themselves into this virtual world and interact within it. With every new sign-up ... our world gets a little smaller and the web gets more character,” explained Internet entrepreneur Biz Stone.

The New Global Economy
guidingquestion How did NAFTA and other regional trading blocs affect the global economy?
In the 1990s, economies of individual nations were becoming more interdependent as new technology helped link the world together economically and culturally. Also, many world leaders were convinced that free trade and the global exchange of goods contributed to prosperity and economic growth. This idea that the world is becoming increasingly interconnected is called globalism, and the process is globalization.

THE WORLD IN SPATIAL TERMS
What large countries make up the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation? HUMAN SYSTEMS
Why might it be beneficial for countries within a region to join in a free-trade agreement?
Selling American-made goods abroad had long been important to U.S. prosperity. American businesses make money selling goods abroad, and consumers benefit by having the option to buy cheaper imported goods. Opponents, however, argued that global trade could cost American workers jobs. The debate became an important part of American politics. Regional Blocs
Regional trade pacts, like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), increase international trade. Approved by Congress in 1993, NAFTA linked Canada, the United States, and Mexico in a free-trade zone. Many Americans feared that NAFTA would cause industrial jobs to move to Mexico, where labor costs were lower. Although some jobs were lost, the U.S. unemployment rate fell as wages rose. Many American businesses upgraded their technology, and workers shifted to more skilled jobs or to the service industry.
In 1993 the European Union (EU) was created to promote economic and political cooperation among many European nations. It created a common bank, encouraged free trade, and created a common currency called the euro. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) came together in 1989 to promote economic cooperation and lower trade barriers. Major political differences, however, kept its members from acting together.
The World Trade Organization
In 1995 the World Trade Organization (WTO) formed to represent some 120 nations in efforts to negotiate international trade agreements and trade disputes. Supporters of the WTO cited benefits for American consumers, including cheaper imports, new markets, and copyright protection. Opponents argued that the United States would have to accept the WTO’s rulings in trade disputes even if they hurt the American economy.

Trade With China
China presented a huge potential market for American goods, but some were wary of trading with China due to its poor record on human rights President Clinton urged Congress to grant China permanent normal trade relation status to bring it into the world community. Although many groups objected, Congress passed the bill in late 2000.

Identifying What trade agreements and organizations promoted globalization?
Global Environmentalism
guiding question How have the United States and other nations responded to global environmental concerns?
The rise of a global economy also increased awareness of environmental issues. Environmentalists began thinking of the environment as a global system and addressing issues they believed were of global concern. In the 1980s, scientists discovered that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were affecting the layer of ozone in Earth’s atmosphere. Ozone blocks many of the sun’s ultraviolet rays. At that time, CFCs were widely used in air conditioners and refrigerators. In that same decade, scientists documented a large hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica. In 1987 the United States and many other nations agreed to phase out CFCs and other chemicals that might be weakening the ozone layer.
During this time, another environmental issue emerged when some scientists warned that global warming could lead to more droughts and other forms of extreme weather. Many experts concluded that carbon dioxide emissions from factories and power plants caused global warming, but others disagreed. The issue became controversial because of the cost of controlling emissions. Industries would have to pay the cost of reducing emissions, and these costs would be passed on to consumers. Developing nations trying to industrialize would be hurt the most. Economic growth in wealthier nations would be hurt as well. Concern about global warming led the EU and many other nations to sign the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, promising to reduce emissions. President Clinton did not submit the protocol for ratification because most senators opposed it. President George W. Bush withdrew the United States from the agreement entirely, citing flaws in the treaty.

In the election of 2000, the division between liberals and conservatives widened. The election itself was one of the closest in American history.
The Candidates Campaign
The Democrats nominated Vice President AI Gore for president. For his running mate, Gore chose Senator Joseph Lieberman, the first Jewish American to run for vice president on a major party ticket. The Republican candidate was Texas governor George W. Bush, son of former president George H. W. Bush. For his vice-presidential candidate, Bush chose Dick Cheney, who had served as George H. W. Bush’s secretary of defense. Well-known consumer advocate Ralph Nader also entered the race on the Green Party ticket.
The election campaign revolved around the question of what to do with surplus tax revenues. Both Bush and Gore agreed that Social Security needed reform, but they disagreed on the details. Both promised to cut taxes, to improve public education, and to support plans to help senior citizens pay for prescription drugs.
A
Close Vote No candidate won a majority in the 2000 election, but Gore received the most votes, with 48.4 percent of the popular vote compared to 47.9 percent for Bush. To win the presidency, however, candidates must win a majority of votes in the Electoral College.
The election came down to the results in Florida—both men needed its 25 electoral votes to win. The counts in Florida were so close that state law required a recount of the ballots using vote-counting
machines. There were, however, thousands of ballots the machines could not read. Gore then asked for a recount of ballots in several strongly Democratic counties. After the machine recount showed Bush still ahead, a battle began over the manual recounts.	6
Most Florida ballots required voters to cast a vote by punching a small piece of cardboard out of the ballot beside the candidate’s name. This small piece is called a chad. Vote counters had to determine how to count a ballot if the chad was still partially attached. On some, the chad was still in place, and the voter had left only a dimple on the ballot’s surface. Vote counters thus had to determine what the voter intended—and different counties used different standards.
Under state law, Florida officials had to certify the results by a certain date. When it became clear that not all of the recounts could be finished in time, Gore went to court to challenge the deadline. The Florida Supreme Court agreed to set a new deadline. At Bush’s request, the U.S. Supreme Court intervened to decide whether the Florida Supreme Court had acted constitutionally. The hand recounts continued, but not all ofthe counties were able to meet the new deadline. On November 26, Florida officials certified Bush the winner by 537 votes.

iiiiiiii ANALYZING SUPREME COURT CASES
BUSH v. GORE, 2000
Background ofthe Case
The outcome ofthe 2000 presidential election hinged on Florida's 25 electoral votes. When the polls closed on November 7, the vote in Florida was so close that it triggered an automatic recount. Bush led by only 1,784 out of more than 6 million votes cast. When ballots were again run through tabulation machines, Bush's lead shrank to fewer than 200 votes. Gore requested hand recounts of ballots in four predominantly Democratic counties where thousands of punch-card ballots had recorded no vote for president. Bush asked the U.S. District Court to block any further recounts.
While the manual recount was still in progress, the Florida secretary of state certified Bush as the winner by 537 votes. Gore appealed this action, and the Florida Supreme Court authorized manual recounts of disputed ballots to begin immediately. Bush appealed the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ordered the recount to stop.
How the Court Ruled
The Florida Supreme Court ordered any recounts to use a general standard set forth in Florida law to discern the "clear intent ofthe voter." In a 7-2 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that because different vote counters used different standards, the recount did not treat all voters equally.
In addition, both federal law and the Constitution require the electoral votes for president to be cast on a certain day. If Florida missed that deadline, its electoral votes would not count. The Court ruled 5-4 that there was not enough time left to conduct a manual recount that would pass constitutional standards.

Bush v. Core
Gore’s lawyers returned to court, arguing that thousands of ballots remained uncounted. The Florida Supreme Court ordered all state counties to begin a hand recount of ballots rejected by the machines. As counting began, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the recount to stop until it had issued its ruling. On December 12 in Bush v. Gore, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that because identical ballots might be treated differently by different vote counters, the recount violated the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. Bush remained the certified winner in Florida.

September 11,2001
guiding question What contributed to the rise in terrorist groups, and why did these groups resort to violent attacks?
On September 11, 2001, two passenger jets slammed into the two towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Soon afterward, a third plane crashed into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Within about two hours, the World Trade Center collapsed in a billow of dust and debris, killing nearly 3,000 people. The airplanes did not crash accidentally. Hijackers deliberately flew them into the buildings. Hijackers had also seized a fourth airplane. Passengers on that flight had cell phones and had learned of the earlier attacks. Four passengers decided to fight the hijackers, and the plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania.
A
National Emergency The attacks shocked Americans. Citizens donated food, money, supplies, and their own time toward the recovery effort. They rallied together to show their unity and resolve. On September 14, President Bush declared a national emergency. Congress authorized the use of force to fight whoever had attacked the nation. Osama bin Laden and his organization, al-Qaeda (al KY*duh), were soon identified as the plotters behind the attacks.
Middle East Terrorism and the United States
The 9/11 attacks were acts of terrorism, the use of violence by nongovernmental groups to achieve a political goal. Most terrorist attacks on Americans since World War II have been carried out by Middle Eastern groups.
In the 1920s, the United States invested in Middle East oil. The ruling families in some kingdoms grew wealthy, but most other people remained poor. Many Muslims feared their traditional values were weakening as the oil industrialists also brought Western ideas into the region. New movements arose calling for a strict interpretation of the Quran—the Muslim holy book—and a return to traditional religious laws. Some militant supporters began using terrorism to achieve their goals.
The United Statess support of Israel also angered many in the Middle East. In 1947, as a response to global outrage over the Holocaust, the UN proposed to divide the British Mandate of Palestine into an Arab state and a Jewish state. The Jews accepted the UN plan and established Israel in 1948. Arab states responded by attacking Israel. The territory that the UN had proposed as an Arab state came under the control of Israel, Jordan, and Egypt. In the 1950s, Palestinians began staging guerrilla raids and terrorist attacks against Israel. Since the

Whatcanyou infer about terrorist networks by the many targets that have been attacked? United States gave aid to Israel, it became the target of Muslim hostility.
In the 1970s, several Middle Eastern nations realized they could fight Israel and the United States by providing terrorists with money, weapons, and training. This is called state-sponsored terrorism. The governments of Libya, Syria, Iraq, and Iran have all sponsored terrorists.
The Rise of Al-Qaeda
In 1979 the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, and Muslims from across the world headed there to help fight the Soviets. Among them was Osama bin Laden. In 1988 bin Laden founded the organization called al-Qaeda or the Base.” This organization carried out attacks on U.S. embassies and other targets in the years leading up to the 9/11 attacks.

The War on Terrorism Begins
guiding question What major actions marked the beginning of the United States's war on terrorism?
On September 20, 2001, President Bush demanded that the Taliban regime in Afghanistan turn over bin Laden and his supporters and shut down all terrorist camps. The United States began building international support against terrorism and began deploying troops to the Middle East. The war would not end quickly, but it was a war the nation had to fight:

Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment.... Our Nation—this generation—will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future. **
—President George W. Bush, Address to Joint Session of Congress, September 20,2001
Homeland Security and the USA PATRIOT Act
One effective way to fight terrorist groups is to cut off their funding. On September 24, President Bush issued an executive order freezing the financial assets of individuals and groups suspected of terrorism. He asked other nations to help, and soon some 80 nations had issued orders freezing the assets of the organizations and individuals on the American list.
To protect against further attacks, Bush created the Office of Homeland Security and asked Congress to pass legislation to help law enforcement agencies locate terrorist suspects. Congress had to balance Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure with the need to increase security, but in October 2001, Bush signed into law the antiterrorist bill called the USA PATRIOT Act. The law made it easier to wiretap suspects, track Internet communications, and seize voice mail. Authorities were permitted to conduct secret searches and were allowed to obtain a nationwide search warrant usable in any jurisdiction. In June 2002, Bush asked Congress to combine the agencies responsible for public safety into a new cabinet department, the Department of Homeland Security. This agency worked to coordinate efforts to fight terrorism.

Bioterrorism Strikes the United States On October 5, 2001, a new threat arose when a newspaper editor in Florida died from an anthrax infection. Anthrax, a type of bacteria, has been used to create biological weapons Antibiotics can cure anthrax, but if left untreated, it can quickly become lethal. Anthrax was also found in offices in New York and Washington, D.C It became clear that these anthrax attacks were being delivered via the postal service. As a result of these attacks, 5 people died and 17 were sickened.
The War in Afghanistan Begins On October 7, 2001, the United States began bombing al-Qaeda camps and Taliban military forces in Afghanistan. Addressing the nation, Bush explained that Islam and the Afghan people were not the enemy, and that the United States would send aid to refugees. He also declared that the war on terrorism would continue until victory was achieved. An Economic Crisis
Even before the terrorist attack on September 11, the American economy had been weakening. The attacks triggered an economic crisis. Stock markets plunged and the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its biggest one week loss in history up to that point. Unemployment, which had already begun to rise, became even worse.
With the United States facing a new war and a great deal of uncertainty, President Bush knew he had to act quickly to prevent the mild recession that had already begun from turning into a serious economic downturn. In his address to the nation on September 20, he asked Americans for their “continued participation and confidence in the American economy” and he stressed that while “terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity; they did not touch its source.”
Three months earlier, the president had convinced Congress to pass a major tax cut in order to help the economy. The Bush tax cuts reduced tax rates for all Americans and cut the capital gains tax. The economy remained weak throughout 2002, however, in part because of the uncertainty caused by the war on terror. Bush pushed Congress to pass a second tax cut in 2003 that accelerated the tax cuts passed in the first bill. By mid-2003, the economy was in full recovery and unemployment had begun to fall. Critics argued that cutting taxes while funding the war on terrorism helped turn the budget surpluses of the late 1990s into a deficit by the end of 2002.
Supporters argued that the tax cuts prevented the recession from becoming much worse and causing even greater deficits.

IT MATTERS BECAUSE
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan, the Central Asian nation that had sheltered many al-Qaeda members. In 2003, troops invaded Iraq and toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein.
The Taliban and WMD
guiding question Why did the United States want to overthrow the Taliban regime?
Soon after the September 11 attacks, the United States launched a war in Afghanistan to bring down the Taliban regime that had sheltered Osama bin Laden and other members of al-Qaeda. U.S. warplanes bombed Taliban forces as the United States began sending military aid to the Northern Alliance, a coalition of Afghan groups that had been fighting the Taliban for several years. The U.S. bombing campaign quickly shattered the Taliban’s defenses, and the Northern Alliance launched a massive attack. In December 2001, the Taliban government fell, and surviving members fled to the mountains of Afghanistan. Afghanistan slowly began to recover from decades of war. Rebuilding Afghanistan
After the Taliban fled, the United States and its allies helped local Afghan leaders create a new government. Meanwhile, thousands of U.S. and allied troops arrived to act as peacekeepers. In 2003 NATO took command of the peacekeeping. Afghanistan held its first nationwide democratic election in December 2004, and Hamid Karzai was elected president. One year later, the Afghan people elected a National Assembly. Despite these successes, Afghanistan continued to suffer from violence. The U.S. military has remained in Afghanistan in an effort to help stabilize the country.
The Search for Bin Laden
U.S. intelligence agencies believed Osama bin Laden had fled to Pakistan. Reports in the summer of 2010 suggested he was hiding north of Pakistan’s capital city of Islamabad. In May 2011, bin Laden’s
628

exact location was verified and President Obama ordered U.S. troops to attack m Laden was killed after a brief fight and DNA tests verified his identity President Obama announced to the nation that “justice has been done”
fracking Down Al-Qaeda
Former President George W. Bush responded to bin Laden’s death by reminding the nation that “the fight against terror goes on, but [nlo matter how long it takes, justice will be done.” During the almost decade-long search for bin Laden, the U.S. and its allies captured or killed hundreds of al-Qaeda members. In 2003 Pakistani and U.S. forces captured Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the man suspected of planning the September 11 attacks. Between 2002 and 2006, the U.S. government believes to have prevented at least 10 major al-Qaeda attacks, including at least three on the United States and two on Great Britain.
Iraq and Weapons of Mass Destruction
The terrorist attacks ot 9/11 showed that groups such as al-Qaeda were determined to kill as many Americans as possible. President Bush and his advisers were deeply concerned that terrorists might acquire weapons of mass destruction (WMD)—including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons—that could kill large numbers of people all at once.
During the Cold War, the United States relied upon a policy of deterrence to prevent the use of such weapons. The rise of state-sponsored terrorism created a new problem. If a nation secretly gave weapons to terrorists who then used them against the United States, the U.S. military might not know whom to attack in response to their use.
The "Axis of Evil"
In his 2002 State of the Union address, President Bush warned that an “axis of evil” made up of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea posed a grave threat. Each nation had been known to sponsor terrorism and was suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction. Bush warned that the United States “will not permit the world’s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world’s most destructive weapons.”
The president and his advisers believed Iraq to be the most immediate danger. It had used chemical weapons against the Kurds, an ethnic group in northern Iraq. After the 1991 Gulf War, UN inspectors found evidence that Iraq had developed biological weapons and had been working on a nuclear bomb. Between 1991 and 1998, Iraq appeared to be hiding weapons of mass destruction from UN inspectors. In 1998 the Iraqi government expelled the inspectors. In response, President Clinton ordered a massive bombing attack on Iraq to destroy its ability to make such weapons. Despite the attack, intelligence agencies continued to believe Iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction.
Hamid Karzai (1957-)
Hamid Karzai was elected president in Afghanistan's first democratic election on October 9,2004. He had worked to remove the Taliban and its supporters from Afghanistan. In 2001, participants ofthe UN-sponsored Bonn Conference elected him Chairman ofthe Interim Administration. He was then elected President ofthe Transitional Government on June 13,2002, by members of the Emergency Loya Jirga (grand council). Karzai had been a strong proponent of establishing a Loya Jirga, believing it to be the only way to resolve the differences among the various Afghan factions. Though there have been charges of corruption in his administration, as president, Karzai has been an advocate of human rights and has appointed several women to his cabinet.
CRITICAL THINKING
Drawing Conclusions Why do you think Hamid Karzai was elected president of Afghanistan?
An Ultimatum to Iraq
In 2002 President Bush decided to deal with Iraq. On September 12, he asked the United Nations for a new resolution against Iraq. If Iraq s dictator, Saddam Hussein, wanted peace, he would have to give up Iraqs weapons of mass destruction, readmit the UN weapons inspectors, stop supporting terrorism, and stop oppressing his people. A t oug e was asking the United Nations to pass a resolution, the presi ent ma e it c e that the United States would act with or without UN support. Bush asked

gREADING PROGRESS CHECK
Identifying Why did President Bush call Iraq, Iran, and North Korea the "axis of evil"?
Confronting Iraq
guiding question What factors led to the U.S. invasion of Iraq?
The war in Iraq relied heavily on advanced technology. U.S. forces used new tools such as remote-controlled drone bombers and laser-guided pointers to precisely target enemy bunkers.
CRITICAL THINKING
Interpreting What advantages does this soldier seem to have over the enemy? In November 2002, Iraq agreed to readmit UN weapons inspectors. It then submitted a statement admitting it had weapons of mass destruction before the Gulf War, but denying it currently had them. Secretary of State Colin Powell said that Iraq’s declaration contained lies and was in “material breach” of the UN resolution.
As the United States and a coalition of some 30 nations prepared for war with Iraq, others in the UN Security Council argued that the inspectors should be given more time to find evidence of Iraq’s WMD programs. By March 2003, inspectors still had found nothing, and the United States began pressing the United Nations to authorize the use of force.
France and Russia, two UN Security Council members with veto power, refused to back such a resolution. As war became imminent, world opinion divided between those who supported the United States and those who opposed an attack on Iraq. Around the world, antiwar protesters staged rallies and marches. Several nations that had supported the United States in its war on terror and had sent troops to Afghanistan—including France, Germany, and Canada—refused to join the coalition against Iraq. Saudi Arabia and Turkey—both American allies—refused to allow the United States to attack Iraq from their territories. The only nation bordering Iraq that granted permission to use its territory was Kuwait.
The Invasion Begins
On March 20, 2003, the U.S.-led coalition forces attacked Iraq. More than 150,000 U.S. troops, some 45,000 British troops, as well as a few hundred special forces from Australia and Poland took part in the invasion. Much of the Iraqi army dissolved as soldiers refused to risk their lives for Saddam Hussein. A few fierce battles took place, but the Iraqis were unable to slow the coalition advance significantly. On May 1, President Bush declared that the major combat was over. About 140 Americans and several thousand Iraqis had died. Hussein was captured in late 2003. After a prolonged trial, an Iraqi court found him guilty of ordering mass executions. He was executed in 2006. Insurgents and Reconstruction
Soon after the coalition took control of the country, small groups of Iraqis began staging bombings, sniper attacks, and sporadic battles against coalition forces. Some carrying out the attacks were former members of Saddam Hussein’s military. Others were affiliated with al-Qaeda and other radical Muslim groups who believed the invasion offered a chance to build support in the Muslim world by organizing resistance to the United States. Militias belonging to the different religious and ethnic groups in Iraq also carried out some attacks.
The majority of Iraq’s population is Shia Muslim, but there is also a large Sunni Muslim minority. The Sunni are themselves divided between Sunni Arabs, who ruled the country under Saddam Hussein’s leadership, and Sunni Kurds. The collapse of Hussein’s dictatorship renewed old hostilities among these groups, forcing coalition troops to protect them from attacks from each other’s militias.
Having aimed to overthrow a tyrant and eliminate the possibility of weapons of mass destruction being given to terrorists, the United States found itself trying to suppress an insurgency, prevent a civil war, and establish a new Iraqi government. The United States and its allies spent more than $30 billion to improve infrastructure, but insurgent attacks slowed these efforts. Despite the problems, Iraq’s economy began to grow rapidly and a substantial improvement in living standards took place.
U.S. policy makers now faced a dilemma. If they pulled troops out too soon, Iraq might fall into civil war and provide a safe haven and breeding ground for terrorist groups. At the same time, the longer the United States stayed, the more its presence might stir resentment and support for terrorist groups. The best solution seemed to be to get a functioning, democratic Iraqi government in place as quickly as possible and then train its forces to take over the country’s security. To do this, in January 2005, the Iraqi people went to the polls in huge numbers for the first free elections in their country’s history. After much debate, voters then overwhelmingly approved a new constitution in October 2005. Problems in Iraq
Many Americans were encouraged when large numbers of Iraqis turned out to vote in democratic elections, but hope for peace in Iraq soon faded. Many Americans had expected the war to end quickly, but between 2003 and 2006, insurgents killed more than 3,000 U.S. soldiers. As the fighting dragged on, support for the war began to decline. Also, the failure to find any WMD added to growing controversy as to whether the war had been a mistake.
The elections were followed by a rise in sectarian violence as Sunni and Shia militias turned against each other. Ongoing suicide bombings, kidnappings, and attacks on U.S. soldiers set a majority of Americans against the war. As a New York Times editorial argued:
[PRIMARY SOURCE

In 2005 Iraqis were able to vote in their first free elections.
CRITICALTHINKING
Predicting Consequences Will regular elections lead to a more stable national government in Iraq? Iraq is becoming a country that America should be ashamed to support, let alone occupy. The nation as a whole is sliding closer to open civil war. In its capital, thugs kidnap and torture innocent civilians with impunity, then murder them for their religious beliefs.... The stories about innocent homeowners and storekeepers who are dragged from their screaming families and killed by... militias are heartbreaking,
as is the thought that the United States, in its hubris, helped bring all this to pass.

Defending Was Operation Iraqi Freedom a success? Why or why not? Democrats demanded the president set a timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops, a policy that President Bush described as “cut and run.”
Troops Surge to Iraq
In 2006 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld resigned, and President Bush appointed Robert Gates to replace him. Bush then announced a plan to send a “surge” of some 20,000 more troops to Iraq to restore order in Baghdad, where the violence was concentrated. With the additional surge of troops, General David Petraeus began clearing and holding areas of Baghdad that had been plagued by crime and insurgent attacks. His forces also began reaching out to Sunni groups in western Iraq that had been opposed to the American presence.
In the western province of Anbar, a militant group known as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was trying to impose a militant version of Islam through murder and intimidation. The Sunni groups in that area began working with U.S. forces to fight AQI. These actions helped change the course of the war.
By the fall of 2008, violence in Iraq had been dramatically reduced. Coalition forces had handed over control of 12 of Iraq’s 18 provinces to the Iraqi government and coalition casualties were lower than at any time since the war began in 2003. In August 2010, Operation Iraqi Freedom officially ended as the number of U.S. troops remaining in Iraq was reduced to about 50,000. Their job was primarily to train Iraqi troops.

It Matters because
After a close campaign, President Bush was reelected in 2004, but scandals and continued difficulties in Iraq helped Democrats win control of Congress in 2006.
Security vs. Liberty
guiding question Howdid the September 11th terrorist attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq increase tension between the need for national security and protecting civil liberties?
In early 2004, President Bushs approval ratings began to fall. The ongoing war in Iraq and the failure of inspectors to find any weapons of mass destruction weakened his support, as did the scandal at the Iraqi prison of Abu Ghraib, where some prisoners were abused by American soldiers. These events gave Democrats the opportunity to mount a serious challenge in the 2004 election.
President Bush and Vice President Cheney were renominated by the Republicans. The Democrats nominated Massachusetts senator John Kerry for president and North Carolina senator John Edwards for vice president. Despite the problems in Iraq, voters felt it safer to stay with the incumbent. Nationwide, Bush won both the popular and the electoral vote.
Prisoners at Guantanamo
The war on terror heightened the tension between national security and civil liberties. People questioned whether terrorist attacks justified limits on civil liberties and whether captured terrorists had any rights at all.
In 2004 President Bush decided to hold captured members of al-Qaeda at the American military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they could be interrogated. This decision was very controversial. Some people argued that the prisoners should have the right to a lawyer, formal charges, and a proper trial. The Bush administration insisted that the prisoners were enemy combatants, not suspects charged with a crime, and did not have the right to appeal their detentions to an American court. The administration also declared

Hamdan v. Rumsfeld
Al-Qaeda associate Salim Ahmed Hamdan was captured in 2001 and was moved to Guantanamo Bay in 2002. President Bush later determined that Hamdan was eligible for a military trial on counts of committing war crimes. Writing for the Supreme Court, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the military commission created to conduct the trial violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Conventions. Stevens stated: “It is not evident why the danger posed by international terrorism ... should require ... any variance from the courts-martial rules.”
CRITICAL THINKING
Drawing Conclusions How did the ruling affect the policy on detainees? controversial given to controversy, disputable
that the procedures regarding the treatment of prisoners, as specified in the Geneva Conventions, did not apply to terrorists since they were not part of any nations armed forces.
The Supreme Court disagreed. In Rasul v. Bush (2004), the Court ruled that foreign prisoners who claimed that they were unlawfully imprisoned had the right to have their cases heard in court. In response, the Bush administration created military tribunals to hear detainee cases. The Supreme Court struck this plan down in 2006 in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.
Bush then asked Congress to establish new tribunals that met the Court’s objections. Congress passed the Military Commissions Act, which stated that noncitizens captured as enemy combatants had no right to file writs of habeas corpus. In 2008, in Boumediene v. Bush, the Supreme Court ruled that the detainees had a right to habeas corpus and declared that section of the Military Commissions Act unconstitutional.
Domestic Surveillance
As part of the war on terror, the National Security Agency (NSA) began wiretapping domestic telephone calls made to overseas locations when they believed one party in the call was a member of al-Qaeda or affiliated with al-Qaeda. When the monitoring program became public in 2005, it created a controversy. Civil rights groups argued that the program violated the Fourth Amendment. In 2006 a federal judge declared the wiretapping to be unconstitutional, but the following year an appeals court overturned the judge’s decision. When Congress began drafting legislation to address the issue, the Bush administration suspended the program and announced that future wiretaps would require a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Debating Social Security
One priority of Bushs second term domestic policy was Social Security reform. He proposed that workers be allowed to put 4 percent of their income in private accounts rather than in Social Security. He believed that private accounts would grow rapidly and help cover the expected shortfall in Social Security accounts. Democrats argued that privatizing any part of Social Security was dangerous. With the public unenthusiastic, the plan was never brought to a vote in Congress. Although this plan failed, Bush did convince Congress to enact a new prescription drug program for seniors. Under the new program, provided by Medicare, people age 65 and older can sign up for insurance that helps cover the cost of prescription drugs.
Hurricane Katrina
On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina smashed into the Gulf Coast of the United States, spreading devastation from Florida to Louisiana. The fierce winds, rain, high tides, and storm surges destroyed buildings, roads, and electrical lines, left thousands of people homeless, and cost at least 1.200 lives. After the hurricane had passed, rising waters breached levees protecting New Orleans and flooded the low-lying city, causing thousands to flee to rooftops and for shelter in the convention center and at the Superdome. Waiting for days with little food, clean water, or information from authorities, survivors were shown on television news in deplorable conditions.
Reporters asked why the government was not responding more quickly. The mayor of New Orleans was faulted for not issuing a mandatory evacuation until the storm was less than a day away and for having failed to provide public transportation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) seemed unprepared in its response. With polls showing a sharp drop in confidence in his administration, President Bush fired the head of FEMA and traveled to New Orleans to pledge federal funds for rebuilding the city. Congress approved $200 billion for the massive task.

America's Challenges for a New Century

Kelo v. City of New London
The Fifth Amendment states that the government cannot take property for public use without giving property owners just compensation. In 2000, the city of New London, Connecticut, seized property from several homeowners and gave the land to a corporation in order to have it redeveloped as part of a plan to rejuvenate the city’s economy. The homeowners challenged the taking of their land, arguing that it was not being seized for public use, as specified in the Constitution.
In 2005, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court interpreted the term “public use” in a broad way. The Court interpreted the phrase “public use” to mean the government can take property if it serves a public purpose, even if it is not truly for public use. In other words, if government wants to promote development in a community so as to create new jobs, or increase tax revenue, it can take property from one private owner and give it to another.
The case outraged people across the political spectrum. Many conservatives saw it as example of the Court violating rights by going beyond what they believed was the actual meaning of the Constitution. Many liberals were outraged that government could take land from individual homeowners and give it to large corporations. After the decision, more than 40 states passed laws restricting the ability of state and local jurisdictions to take land away from homeowners for “economic development” by businesses.

In 2005 President Bush filled two vacancies on the Supreme Court. In the spring of 2005, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor announced her retirement. Although appointed by President Reagan, Justice O’Connor had been a pivotal swing vote on the Court, sometimes siding with conservatives, sometimes with liberals. As her replacement, Bush nominated federal judge John G. Roberts, Jr., a conservative who was well regarded in the Senate. Before the Senate could act, however, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died. Bush then named Roberts to replace him. Again attempting to fill Justice O’Connor’s vacancy, President Bush nominated federal judge Samuel Alito, Jr., a well-known conservative justice. Roberts and Alito were confirmed by the Senate.
The 2006 Midterm Elections
The first two years of President Bush’s second term had not gone well. At the same time, Americans had also grown frustrated with Congress. The Republican majority seemed awash in scandals. Two Republicans had resigned from Congress after being convicted of corruption, and House majority leader Tom DeLay had resigned after being indicted for violating campaign finance laws. Congress seemed unable to control spending, partly because Republicans and Democrats had been adding an increasing number of special funding requests to spending bills.
Voters expressed their unhappiness with the president and the Republican Congress in 2006. The Democrats won a majority in both the House and the Senate for the first time since 1992. House Democrats then elected California representative Nancy Pelosi to be the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives. She summed up Democrats’ interpretation of their victory:
PRIMARYSOURCE
“The election of 2006 was a call to change, not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country.... Our Founders envisioned a new America driven by optimism, opportunity, and courage.... Now it is our responsibility to carry forth that vision of a new America into the 21st century. W
—from a speech to the House of Representatives, January 4,2007
Despite promises to end the war and change how Congress operated, Speaker Pelosi and other Democrats were not able to get enough votes to cut funding, set a deadline for pulling troops out of Iraq, or reduce spending.
The American economy was on a downturn.
Economic Recession
By 2008, the American economy was in crisis. In 2007 many people with low incomes or poor credit began defaulting on their mortgage payments. At the same time, housing prices began to fall. People could no longer borrow against their home values, and banks across the country that had relied on mortgage-backed investments did not know what their investments were worth. Without adequate “real” funds to lend, banks reduced the amounts they lent, and many businesses feared they could not borrow enough money to keep operating. This led to a long recession and caused a number of well-known investment banking firms to face bankruptcy and collapse. Companies began laying off workers in response to the financial crisis. By January 2009, the unemployment rate was up to 7.2%. The country was in an economic recession. P READING PROGRESS CHECK

A.
it Matters Because
The 2008 election of Barack Obama as the nation's first African American president was a watershed event. The nation became increasingly polarized, however, as he began to carry out his agenda. After the 2010 midterm elections, the Republicans regained control of the House.

The Election of 2008
guiding question What issues and events attracted support for Barack Obama's presidential campaign?
In 2007 a major financial crisis developed. Millions of Americans found themselves unable to make payments on their home mortgages. Financial institutions failed. As the 2008 election approached, the economy had replaced the war in Iraq as the most important issue for most Americans.
Choosing the Candidates
Senator John McCain of Arizona, a widely admired hero of the Vietnam War, won the Republican nomination for president. He chose Sarah Palin, the conservative governor of Alaska, as his running mate.
Illinois senator Barack Obama bested New York senator Hillary Clinton to win the Democratic nomination. Obama had delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. His speech impressed Democrats and made him a national political figure. Senator Joe Biden of Delaware was his running mate. Bidens 35 years in the Senate helped balance criticism of Obamas relative inexperience.
Obama Wins
In October 2008, President Bush and Congress passed a $700 billion bailout for the nation’s financial institutions, intended to help the worsening crisis. Americans opposed it. With the approval ratings of the president and Congress at all-time lows, McCain and Obama both promised change. Obama made good use of the Internet and formed a strong grassroots network of young supporters. On Election Day, Obama won 53 percent of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes.

When Americans voted President Obama into office, many expected him to improve the shaky economy. Obamas domestic agenda proposed to create jobs, relieve suffering families, assist home owners, and ease the financial crisis. Yet as the economy worsened, Obamas specific plans to solve the nations problems drew criticism. Some people believed he was not doing enough, while others argued that he was misusing government authority by doing too much.

SKILLS PRACTICE
The Economy in 2009
Despite the Bush administration’s bailout of financial institutions and insurance companies, the American economy continued to weaken. More Americans lost their homes, and banks closed. Many large companies reported record losses. They laid off workers, contributing to a spike in unemployment. With fewer workers, less money went into Social Security, threatening the sustainability of the program. As the crisis spread worldwide, global trade lessened and the world economy shrank.
Obama's Response
In response to the failing economy, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February 2009. The act aimed to stimulate the economy

by providing tax cuts to working families and small businesses. It allocated federal funds for growth and investment as well as for education, health, and other entitlement programs. Many Americans were still angry about Bushs bailout plan. They believed it favored large businesses at the expense of ordinary people. To counter this anger, the act set up a system to monitor how the recovery money was spent. Obama pushed additional legislation through the Democrat-controlled Congress in July 2010. Among other things, this financial reform bill provided protection for consumers. It also called for more government oversight of financial institutions and large companies.
By the end of 2009, there were signs that some of Obamas measures were working. The nations gross domestic product (GDP) had climbed. Some of the large businesses that had accepted stimulus funds were reporting gains. The unemployment rate, however, continued to rise, as did the federal deficit. And many Americans were uncomfortable with what they viewed as a rapidly growing role for the federal government in the economy.

Health Care Reform, Energy,
and the Environment
guidingquestion What other major domestic events defined Obama's first years as president?
As a candidate and president-elect, Obama stressed many other domestic issues. Two priorities were to reform and expand the health care system and to solve the nation’s energy and environmental problems.
Health Care Reform
Obama’s health care reform plan aimed to lower health care costs, introduce better procedures for delivering care, and insure all Americans. In a speech to Congress delivered in 2009, he said, “We are the only advanced democracy
640
„„ E,rth-the only wealthy nation-that allows such hardships for millions of Its people. There are now more than thirty million American citizens who cannot get coverage.”
Obama wanted to pay for the plan through higher taxes on the wealthy and by reducing wasteful spending. Yet some Americans opposed what they saw as another expensive government intrusion. Months of heated partisan debate took place within Congress. No Republican voted for the final bill that passed in March 2010, and many vowed to overturn it. Though Obama had promised to reform the system of earmarks, the bill contained many.
The bill extended coverage to about 32 million more Americans who could not previously afford it. It prevented insurers from denying insurance to people who had preexisting medical conditions. It also gave tax credits to small businesses that provide health care to their employees. According to the White House, it would lower costs, strengthen the Medicare program, and expand the Medicaid program.
Interpreting Significance
Energy Policy and the Environment
President Obama’s energy plan enforced limits on the amount of pollution companies could emit. Conservatives who opposed the idea stalled the bill in Congress. Then, an environmental disaster struck the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. A British Petroleum (BP) oil rig exploded, sending nearly 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf. It was the worst marine oil spill in history. Commercial fishing and tourism in the Gulf region suffered. Obama required BP to create a $20 billion fund to assist people affected by the oil spill. Federal agencies directed the recovery, which lasted through October. H READING PROGRESS CHECK
Drawing Conclusions How did the British Petroleum disaster in the Gulf of Mexico affect the environment?
When President Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to fill vacancies on the U. S. Supreme Court, he became the first president to successfully nominate two women to the nations highest court. These women are now the third and fourth female justices in the nations history. Born and raised in a Puerto Rican family in the Bronx, New York, Sotomayor is the nations first justice of Latin American descent. Determining the significance of both womens service to the Supreme Court will be based on their interpretations of the legal questions that come before the Court.

2010 Midterm Elections
guiding qu estion IV/wf did the results of the elections say about the mood of the nation at that time?
As the 2010 midterm elections approached, Obamas approval rating was at a low point. Many Americans felt that the stimulus and health care bills had been too expensive and had not strengthened the economy. A grassroots movement called the “Tea Party” sprang up to protest the Obama administration. The movement took its name from a reference to the Boston Tea Party protests against British taxation. Most in the movement opposed what they called “big government”—including taxes, the health care program, and the economic stimulus plans of Bush and Obama. Yet they disagreed on many other issues.
Republicans gained a rousing win in the midterm elections. Republicans gained 60 seats in the House of Representatives and took back control of that House of Congress. It was the biggest shift in power in over 60 years. The Republicans also captured six Senate seats, though the Democrats maintained the majority. It was clear that Americans of all political beliefs needed to work together to solve the issues facing the nation. In a White House conference a day after the election, President Obama said, “Over the last two years, we ve made progress. But, clearly, too many Americans haven t felt that progress yet, and they told us that yesterday.” The United States had obstacles to overcome, the worst economic depression in 70 years and two ongoing wars. Yet opportunities to innovate in the nations economic system gave new challenges. The commitment remained to strengthen the nations political institutions as a foundation to address any future conflict.

Polarized Politics
guiding question How did Americans react to the slow economic recovery from the recession?
The Income Gap
The recession widened the gap between income levels in America. The economy slowly recovered, but slow wage growth and high unemployment hit those in middle and lower incomes the hardest. As wealthier individuals recovered from the recession faster, their share of the nation’s total income increased. The 2010 Census showed that the middle-income families’ share of income had fallen to 45 percent, while the wealthiest’s share of income has risen to 46 percent.
Middle income Americans cut back on their spending, which further restrained the recovery. These families were hurt by the decline in manufacturing jobs. The family home was usually their biggest investment. When housing values fell sharply during the recession, some people found themselves paying higher mortgages than their homes were worth. Rising costs of health care and college tuition also hurt those in the middle incomes.
Occupy Wall Street
The widening gap between income groups helped spark a movement that called itself “Occupy Wall Street.” Protesters claimed that they represented “the 99 percent” of the population against the wealthiest one percent. They began by occupying a park in New York City’s financial district. Occupy Wall Street drew attention to economic inequality, tax breaks for the wealthy, and corporate greed.
Most of the protesters were young and identified themselves as political independents. They were critical of both major parties. President Obama acknowledged that the movement expressed people’s frustration with the financial crisis. After police moved demonstrators out of the parks they had occupied, the movement dwindled. Although the Occupy Wall Street movement expressed popular anger, it suffered from a lack of leadership and specific solutions to the nation’s economic problems.
The Tea Party in Congress
Public anxiety over the rising national debt was also reflected in a political protest group known as the Tea Party. Some leaders of the Tea Party
642
movement won seats in Congress during the 2010 midterm election They were determmed to cut federal spending and prevent taxes from rising. As a large bloc of members of the House of Representatives, these freshmen politicians favored confrontation rather than cooperation.
Republicans called for deep cuts in federal spending while Democrats called for raising taxes for the wealthy. House Speaker John Boehner attempted to negotiate a budget compromise with President Obama, but the large Tea Party faction was dissatisfied with the agreement they reached and refused to support it. A deadlock developed between the House controlled by Republicans and the Senate by Democrats, which kept either party from effecting economic growth.
As public disapproval of polarized politics rose, the number of Americans who called themselves independents grew. In some areas independents outnumbered registered Republicans or Democrats. Political independents told pollsters that they favored cooperation. These independents increasingly played a role in determining election outcomes.
New Civil Rights Issues
The first decades of the 21st century have seen several different civil rights issues emerge. In 2008, President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a new federal law prompted by the 1998 murders of Matthew Shepard, a gay man, and James Byrd, an African American. In both cases, the savage nature of the murders attracted national attention, and began to build support for new hate crimes legislation. A decade later, the new law was signed. It expanded the definition of hate crimes, provided funds to state and local authorities to encourage investigation of hate crimes, and gave federal authorities greater power to examine possible hate crimes when local authorities choose not to follow up.
Another civil rights issue that emerged in the 1990s also gained momentum in the early 21st century. The gay and lesbian civil rights movement began to push for the right to same-sex marriage in several states. In 2003, the state of Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage. Laws regulating marriage have historically been a responsibility of state governments. As a result, the push for same-sex marriage took place largely at the state level.
The problem facing gay and lesbian couples was that while they might be married in one state, if they moved to another state where the laws were different, their marriage might not be considered valid. In 1996 Congress, with the support of President Clinton, had passed the Defense of Marriage Act, defining marriage for federal purposes as a union between one man and one women and specifying that states can refuse to recognize same-sex marriages allowed in other states.
In 2012, in Windsor v. United States, the Supreme Court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, saying that the federal government could not limit marriage to one man and one woman. Doing so deprived people of their Fifth Amendment rights under the due process clause because it meant treating people from different states in different ways. It also violated the rights of states to have different legislation on the issue.
The Court’s decision, however, did not overturn state laws regarding marriage. In early 2014, 17 states allowed same-sex marriage and 28 states had amended their constitutions to define marriage as between one man and one woman. Also in early 2014, in eight different states, judges had overturned state bans on same-sex marriage and efforts were underway to bring the issue to the Supreme Court for final resolution.
America's Challenges for a New Century 643
Clarifying Second Amendment Rights
Another major development involving the Bill of Rights came in 2008, in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller. For the first time, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment of the Constitution gives individuals the right to own firearms.
The Second Amendment states: “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” For decades, supporters of gun control had pointed to the reference to a well-regulated militia as evidence that the right did not extend to individuals, but only to militias organized by state and federal governments. In Heller, the Supreme Court found for the first time that an individual right to bear arms exists.
In 2010, in McDonald v. Chicago, the Court incorporated the Second Amendment, ruling that it also applies to the states, and that state laws must recognize the right of individuals to bear arms. For many conservatives, and organizations such as the NRA, the decisions represented a major victory in their decades-long effort to assert individual rights under the Second Amendment.
P READING PROGRESS CHECK
Identifying Central Issues What were the causes of disagreement over setting economic policies?
Political and Economic Issues
guidingquestion Why was it so difficult for Congress and the president to reach agreement on ways to improve the economy?
Despite the president’s stimulus plan, the national economy suffered from persistently high rates of unemployment. At the same time that federal funding expanded, many state and local governments cut back on their spending and laid off teachers and other public workers. Young people who were just entering the workforce found the worst job market since the Great Depression. The National Debt, Spending and Taxes
The national debt grew alarmingly high. Among the causes of the increased debt were President Obama’s stimulus plan, President George W. Bush’s tax cuts, the two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, an expansion of Medicare to cover prescription drugs, the housing crisis, and the recession. Unemployment was a significant factor because those who lost their jobs or took lower-paying employment paid less in taxes. Federal deficits required more borrowing, which meant that the government had to pay more for the interest on its debts.
The issues of deficit spending, the national debt, and taxes, drove the two political parties further apart. The president appointed a commission to reach a compromise, but its proposed solutions of cutting spending and raising taxes won little support in Congress. Rather than confronting economic problems, Congress delayed these problems for future consideration. Significant Supreme Court Decisions
Like Congress, the Supreme Court was deeply divided over the issues facing the nation, and it reached major decisions with 5 to 4 margins. In the case of Citizens United v. the Federal Elections Commission (2010), the Supreme Court lifted many of the limits Congress had set on campaign financing as a restriction on freedom of speech. As a result, corporations could make political contributions, and wealthy individuals were free to make unlimited
donations. This ruling sent both political parties scrambling to raise campaign finances. The ruling also allowed non-party groups to spend massive amounts on media advertising. The resulting onslaught of negative political advertising further propelled political polarization.
Since conservative justices held a narrow majority on the Supreme Court, there were doubts that it would uphold President’s Obama’s healthcare law as constitutional. Four of the justices believed that the government could not mandate that individuals must purchase health insurance or face a penalty. Four of the justices believed equally strongly that the government had constitutional authority to require insurance under its power to regulate interstate commerce. Chief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote in 2012. In another 5-4 decision, the Court determined that Congress could not legally command people to buy insurance, but the federal government did have the power to tax those who did not buy insurance.
The 21 st Century Economy
Despite the wars and recessions that have affected the world since 2001, globalization has continued and the world’s economy has become increasingly interconnected. Contributing to this was the ongoing revolution in digital technology and communications. The use of cell phones, the Internet, and the computer has converged in a way that allows people to connect, interact, research, create, and work from anywhere, at any time, using a wide range of devices.
This new level of interactivity, sometimes called hyperconnectivity, has begun to transform society and the economy. As Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund observed: “If the previous revolutions were about using machines for brawn, this is about using machines for brains.”
Multinational corporations rapidly adopted the new Information and communications technology. This allowed them to integrate their operations worldwide to a degree that was not possible in previous decades. Global financial corporations also used this technology to enable the worlds capital to flow rapidly to new opportunities. Yet these interconnections also posed a danger. The world learned in 2008 that economic problems in one part of the world could affect other parts of the world very quickly.

America's Challenges for a New Century 645
Several new corporations led by innovative entrepreneurs found ways tc profit from the new interconnectivity. Steve Jobs led Apple Corporation to enormous success through the introduction of new digital devices, includim the iPhone, introduced in 2007, and the iPad, a tablet computer introduced in 2010. Another key entrepreneur in the early 21st century was Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon.com in 1995 as an online bookstore. Amazon revolutionized online retailing and rapidly became one of the top 500 companies in the world selling almost any product through its website. Amazon has also helped drive the adoption of eBook readers and tablets.
Google is another major multinational corporation that arose because o] the Internet. Founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google began as a search engine for the Internet. The company had the goal of organizing the world’s information, and making it accessible and useful. Google rapidly became the most widely used search engine in the world, and as the company grew, it expanded its research and development into other areas of software. Google Maps revolutionized online map use and navigation. Google also financed, and later acquired, the Android operating system, widely used on smart phones and tablets. Google continues to fund research into new applications of digital technology, including artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, robotics, translation software, renewable energy, and biotechnology.
Although the digital revolution has led to the rise of many new technology companies, many of the largest multinational corporations shaping the world’s economy predate the digital revolution. Of the 25 largest companies in the world in 2013, eleven were oil companies, and four were car companies. The need for energy and transportation continues to drive much of the world’s economic growth.
Efforts are underway to develop alternative energy sources, but the primary sources of the world’s energy remain fossil fuels: oil, coal, and natural gas. In the 1990s, an oil and gas company run by entrepreneur George P. Mitchell developed a new technology—hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking—to extract gas from shale. The technology triggered what has been called the “shale boom”—the rapid growth of the gas and oil industry in parts of the United States where large shale formations exist.
Fracking technology has helped reduce American dependence on foreign energy, and played an important role in the economy’s recovery from the recession of 2008. After critics raised concerns about its environmental impact, political debates erupted in several states as to whether or not to allow fracking operations to proceed.

U.S.
Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan President Obama came to office determined to follow a more international approach to foreign policy. His foreign policy therefore relied more on the United Nations and sought to build consensus among American allies.

the president expanded the American combat role in Afghanistan. Its mission was to fight the Taliban until Afghan forces could defend the country on their own. In 2011, a Navy SEAL team located and killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda who had planned the 9/11 attacks on the United States. The U.S. also made increased use of pilotless drone aircraft to track and eliminate other militant leaders of al-Qaeda. While the drones reduced the chances of American and NATO casualties, they raised protests when they caused injury and death to innocent civilians near the target. Critics warned that the drone attacks would work against U.S. policy by alienating civilians who felt threatened by them.
Between the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, including military operations, foreign aid, and wounded veterans’ health care costs, the United States paid more than a trillion dollars a year. These costs helped fuel the deficits and national debt.
The Arab Spring
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan heightened tension between the United States and Muslims around the world. Violent extremists sought to exploit this situation. President Obama went to Egypt to speak at Cairo University in 2009. He called for a “new beginning” between the U.S. and the Muslim world, based on mutual respect. He pledged to pursue a peaceful settlement of long dispute between Israelis and Palestinians, and also to promote democracy and human rights against ruthless governments.
In 2011, popular unrest in the Middle East led to a series of revolutions against oppressive governments. The movement, known as the Arab Spring,” overthrew dictators in Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. Since American troops were engaged in combat in Afghanistan, President Obama was reluctant to provide American military support to the rebels in these nations. Instead, he relied on other NATO nations to provide the air support that helped rebels remove Muammar Qaddafi from power in Libya.
Overthrowing dictators caused political instability that posed serious problems for U.S. policy in the Middle East. Some of the government that fell had been security partners with the U.S. There was a danger that religious extremists might gain power, which would complicate relations with the U.S.,

make compromise with Israel more difficult, and jeopardize the supply of oil and other commerce from the Middle East. Another uncertain danger was the possibility that Iran could develop nuclear weapons.
The Euro Crisis

European debt crisis affected the American economy. Like the United States, European nations had also experienced a collapse of their real estate markets, bank failures, and recession. Some of these governments, including Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Ireland, struggled with high deficits and national debt. High unemployment in these countries diminished their ability to trade with the U. S., which further slowed the American recovery. Many European countries share a common currency—the Euro—so nations in the Euro bloc that had economic problems looked for loans from other nations with stronger economies. Germany boasted the most prosperous economy in Europe, but Germans were unhappy about “bailing out” those nations that mismanaged their finances. In order to get financial support from the wealthier nations, the debtor governments had to agree to reduce their government spending, even though this triggered higher unemployment and further depressed their economies.
Trade and investments closely connected the United States economy to Europe. Uncertainties over Europe’s economic future worried American investors. American official encouraged European leaders to stabilize their economies. Debating UN Treaties
From the moment the United Nations was founded in 1945, it had critics in the United States. Some Americans have been disappointed with the UN’s inability to act collectively to preserve peace and advance human rights. Others have worried that UN treaties and rules might pose a danger to national sovereignty and American freedom.
Frustration with the UN has continued in the 21st century. The Bush administration found it very difficult to rally the UN to support its war in Iraq. At the same time, others have been concerned that new international treaties developed by the UN endangered the nation’s sovereignty. Two recent issues have been the Law of the Sea treaty and the Arms Trade Treaty
The Law of the Sea treaty defines the rules and responsibilities of nations in their use of the world’s oceans. Various versions of the treaty have been debated for decades. Supporters argue that the treaty clearly establishe. rules for the use of the ocean and resolving disputes. Opponents argue that it undermines national sovereignty by creating an international organization—the Seabed Authority—to resolve disputes. They also point out that the treaty forces businesses to buy licenses to extract resources fron the seabed—a form of taxation without representation. Although the Unitec States signed the treaty, the United States Senate has not approved it.
Another point of contention has been the Arms Trade Treaty. The treaty establishes international rules for the sale and transfer of arms between nations. The proposed treaty was a result of growing concern that much of the violence and human rights violations in the world were a result of the illegal arms trade.
The treaty has been controversial. Many UN members have argued that it is an infringement of national sovereignty. Within the United States, opposition to the treaty has been strong. The NRA and Heritage Foundation, as well as other political advocacy groups, have argued that the treaty would infringe on the Second Amendment right to bear arms.
Supporters of the treaty argue that it specifically pertains to international arms sales, and would have no effect on the right to own
Many international treaties proposed by the UN have been controversial and a subject of debate in American politics.
weapons within a nation. Critics point out the requirements of the treaty to monitor and track sales across borders necessarily means nations have to register the ownership of guns within their borders. Although the Obama administration signed the treaty in September 2013, a majority of Senators indicated they would not vote to approve it.

Drawing Conclusions What economic consequences did international issues have?
The Election of 2012
guidingquestion What issues defined the campaigns of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney?
Having been elected president in 2008 by promising hope and change, President Obama found his reelection jeopardized by the disappointingly slow recovery from the recession. His opponents proposed a different route to economic revival.
The Republican Nomination
After Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 2010, the party’s chances of defeating President Obama seemed stronger. The campaign for the Republican nomination began more than a year before the election. From the start, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney was the front-runner. As a former business executive, he promised to apply his business leadership skills to improving the economy and putting more people back to work.
Romney faced a large number of more conservative Republican rivals. Although his rivals appealed to the Tea Party protest movement, they could not match Romney’s organization and financial resources. They portrayed Romney as more liberal, pointing out that he had signed into law a state healthcare bill that was strikingly similar to the president’s plan.
Romney won the nomination, in large part because Republicans felt that he had the best chance of beating President Obama. Romney selected
| Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan for vice president. As chair of the 1 House Budget Committee, Ryan appealed to conservatives for budget plans I for cutting government spending and reducing the budget. The most 1 controversial provision of Ryan’s budget plan would convert Medicare into a ' system of vouchers.

THE WORLD IN SPATIAL TERMS
What commonalities can you identify that united the states that voted for Mitt Romney? PLACES AND REGIONS
Why do you think President Obama won Upper Midwest states such as Ohio andMichigan?
A
Choice of Different Paths Mitt Romney asked voters if they were better off after four years of Obama’s leadership. Because the economy had collapsed before Obama took office, however, Romney could not blame the recession on him. Instead, Romney had to convince voters that he could do a better job leading the nation to economic recovery.
Republicans believed that government controlled too much of citizens’ lives and that people should take care of themselves. Democrats argued that government had to do more to help citizens in need and raise living standard
Republicans saw the deficit as holding back economic development. Democrats said that deficit spending would stimulate the economy and create jobs. Republicans warned that government regulations were keeping business from being more productive and hiring more people. Democrats responded that after the economic collapse government should be more vigilant in regulating business to prevent further abuse. Republicans pledged to make further cuts in taxes. Democrats called for the wealthy to pay a larger share ol
the taxes.
Economic issues dominated the campaign. The two parties also disagreed over such social issues as same-sex marriage and abortion, with Republicans defending traditional moral values and Democrats calling for greater tolerance. On international issues, by contrast, the differences between the parties were less stark.
Politics and the New Media
The Internet increasingly played a role in American politics. By the 2012 elections, two-thirds of all Americans were using social networks. Unlike the traditional media, social networks created more interaction by encouraging people to respond and to share information. Studies showed that many people were likely to vote if they learned through social network that their friends were voting. Political parties recognized that social networking had become a new way of getting their messages out. Pollsters

began charting public interest in the campaign by the number of tweets sent during the conventions and other political events. The parties also made much use of email for fundraising.
Presidential campaigns still relied largely on web sites to raise funds, recruit volunteers, and provide lengthier discussions of their positions on the issues. Independent bloggers, commentators, and satirists were also active, much of it anonymously. A popular tool was to post videos. The candidates were the subjects of the videos, and the traditional media made the videos, but they were posted and spread online because of average citizens, creating more democracy in the media. This allowed ordinary citizens rather than politicians and the established media to frame the stories that the public will see and discuss.
Obama Wins a Second Term
After a long, expensive, and hard-fought campaign, President Obama won a second term in 2012. The polls showed that the weakened economy remained the leading issue for the voters. While people expressed disappointment over the slow recovery, they credited the president’s efforts to rebuild the economy and restore employment.
A devastating hurricane also affected the campaign. In October, a major storm hit the Atlantic coast, flooding portions of New Jersey and New York. President Obama took charge of the government’s response to the crisis. His actions earned him some bipartisan support in the final days of the election and may have played a role in convincing some undecided voters. As Americans debated the role of government in their lives, the storm showed how essential effective government could be during an emergency.
The election left Congress divided between a Republican majority in the House of Representatives and a Democratic majority in the Senate. Major issues of deficits, taxes, immigration, and the environment remained unresolved. They challenged both parties to break the partisan divide and legislative gridlock. On election night, however, President Obama spoke to the nation in hopeful terms, suggesting that whatever the challenges ahead, the nation would continue to move forward.
