CHAPTER 5: European Exploration and Colonization 43
European merchants and rulers were anxious to find a sea route to reach China and the Spice Islands of the East Indies. This would allow them to ship these luxury goods more easily back to Europe.
Advances in Technology. Europeans had benefited from contacts through trade with China, which had invented gunpowder and the magnetic compass. From Arabia, Europeans learned how to make better sails. Europeans also developed the moveable rudder, so they could steer larger ships more easily. These technological improvements in navigation made it possible for Europeans to sail farther than ever before. European sailors began to use the sun’s angle to determine their location, allowing them to judge distances.
These innovations allowed them to sail into the open ocean instead of hugging the coastline.
Exploration was fanned by the Renaissance spirit of inquiry and a desire to find an all-water
route to the East. In Portugal, Prince Henry the Navigator (1394-1460) sponsored the exploration of the Atlantic coast of Africa by Portuguese sailors. He developed a new, lighter ship better suited for distant oceanic exploration. Many historians believe Prince Henry played a key role in encouraging European exploration and maritime trade with other continents.
Emergence of Powerful European Rulers. In the early fifteenth century, the sea-faring countries of Europe hoped to extend their influence through exploration. Strong rulers had established power over unruly nobles. These rulers built large armies and amassed great wealth by collecting taxes.
Desire for Profits. Italian city-states had once profited by shipping goods across the Mediterranean, but routes to Asia were cut-off by the Turkish capture of Constantinople in 1453. The capitalist economy was just emerging. People were seeing new wealth from investment and trade. Some hoped to increase their profits through exploration.
Religious Enthusiasm. European missionaries, especially from Spain and Portugal, sought to spread the Christian religion. Christian missionaries believed they not only had a superior religion, but also a superior culture.

EUROPEAN COLONIAL EMPIRES
Spanish conquistadors used horses and superior weaponry to defeat the Aztecs and Incas.
By 1494, news of the “New World” was in print throughout Europe. This greatly stimulated the appetite of European monarchs for overseas exploration. The establishment of New Spain in the Caribbean, Mexico, Florida and South America further heightened the interest of Spain’s chief rivals: France, Holland, and England. The rulers of these nations sent their own explorers to claim lands in the Americas. Where each nation explored and settled was affected by many factors, including ocean currents, weather patterns, and where rival powers had claims.
NEW SPAIN
Spanish conquistadors {conquerors) like Hernando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro used horses and superior weapons, such as cannons and crossbows, to conquer the powerful Aztecs of Mexico and the Incas of Peru.
Cortes allied with other Native American peoples, who had been conquered by the Aztecs, to achieve his victory. In Peru, the Incas had been weakened by civil war shortly before the arrival of Pizarro.
The Spanish conquerors murdered the ruling classes of Mexico and Peru, and destroyed their temples and palaces. New Spain was ruled by the viceroys of the king. The Spanish monarchy became enriched by shipments of gold and silver. One fifth of all the gold and silver from the New World went to the king. When the Spanish first arrived in the New World, they brought with them a set of customs and traditions from Spain.
Spaniards took large tracts of land for mining, ranching, and farming, known as encomiendas. Although the encomienda system was introduced with the idea of caring and providing for Native Americans, it quickly became a highly abusive and destructive system.

At first, New Netherland was a company owned and operated business, run by the Dutch West India Company. The intent of the company directors was to make a profit for the investors in the company. Dutch families settled in present-day Albany and New York City (then known as New Amsterdam). New Netherland became active in trading for furs. Beaver skins and other furs were highly valued by Europeans. The settlement of New Amsterdam, with its fine natural harbor, became a leading center for trade.
The Dutch welcomed people from other countries. They also practiced religious toleration. Walking around New Amsterdam in the 1660s, a visitor might have seen Irish, British, German or French people talking in the streets. Others there might be Native Americans or Africans. The Dutch West India Company introduced enslaved persons to the colony in 1625. Most Africans in New Netherland had been brought from Africa or the West Indies as enslaved persons.
The earliest known view of New Amsterdam (1651).
Which European countries established colonies, and where did they settle?
What role did the Dutch West India Company play in creating colonial settlements?


The colonization of America shifted wealth and power away from the Mediterranean region to the countries of Western Europe. Spain was greatly enriched by American gold and silver. Protestant England became engaged in a series of wars against Catholic Spain. England’s rulers desired to stake a claim for lands and riches in the New World, so that they could match Spain’s wealth. England’s colonies were established for political, economic, religious, and social reasons.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Captain John Smith recorded what he later learned in his history of the colony — The Generali Historie of Virginia, published in 1624.
“These miserable and poor creatures were [kept alive] for the most part by roots, herbs, acorns, walnuts, berries, and fish, even the skins of horses. So great was our famine, that when an Indian was killed, and buried, the poor dug him up and [ate] him, and others boiled and stewed with roots and herbs: One amongst us killed his wife, powdered her, and ate part of her before it was known, for which he was executed.”
What hardships did the first settlers at Jamestown face?
How did some of the Jamestown colonists survive the “Starving Time”?
Despite these initial setbacks, the colony at Jamestown became profitable by growing tobacco for sale in Europe. By 1619, Jamestown was exporting tons of tobacco to England for the new fashion of smoking. Jamestown’s new tobacco economy created a labor shortage. The need for laborers was so great that early settlers attempted to enslave the area’s Native American Indians. However, these Indians were unwilling to be used as forced laborers and often escaped into the surrounding forests. The first enslaved people from Africa arrived in the colony in 1619, as well as the first women. As the success of tobacco planting spread, using African slaves would grow to become the foundation of the Southern agrarian economy.
Later, the area of colonial settlement spread from Jamestown to other parts of Virginia. The capital of the colony was moved to Williamsburg. Virginia eventually had both rich plantation owners and smaller farmers, and grew to become one of the wealthiest colonies.
In a country without roads, rivers played an important role. The first colonists depended on rivers to ship crops from the farm to the marketplace. The marshy coastal plain along the Chesapeake Bay contained many navigable streams. Land-owners constructed their buildings along these streams, while ocean-going ships sailed up these streams for many miles, stopping to load goods at each plantation. These geographic conditions encouraged the development of independent farms and plantations in Virginia and Maryland. At the same time, land away from the rivers remained largely unsettled. These colonies developed few Large towns, since buying
and selling often took place at a farmer's dock.

Unlike the adventurers at Jamestown, the Pilgrims and Puritans sailed to the “New World” as entire families, along with their wives and children. Eventually, their two settlements merged into the single colony of Massachusetts. Early Puritans and Pilgrims lived simple, religious lives. Their clothing was usually black or gray. They believed that hard work was the key to getting into Heaven. Sundays and holidays were strictly observed. Religious leaders played an important role in governing the colony.
51
Building a settlement in Massachusetts.
Other English colonies were founded for a variety of reasons:
Rhode Island. The Puritans did not ordinarily permit others to practice their religion freely in Massachusetts. In 1636, Roger Williams therefore left Massachusetts to start his own new colony at Rhode Island, based on principles of religious toleration.
Among those who also fled to Rhode Island was Anne Hutchinson.
While living in Massachusetts, she had often met with friends after church and held religious discussions. She expressed her belief that God revealed himself to individuals without the aid of clergy. Puritan leaders saw these meetings as acts against God, since they believed that God could only be revealed to ministers. Anne Hutchinson was put on trial, where she claimed God had spoken to her directly. She was found guilty of lying. In 1637, she was banished from Massachusetts. Soon after, she joined Williams and other dissenters in Rhode Island.
Connecticut and New Hampshire. Other Massachusetts settlers formed new colonies in Connecticut and New Hampshire. Set-
tlers in Connecticut, led by Thomas Hooker (1586-1647), established self-government in the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut (1639). In addition, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut provided a basis for future governing in the colony.
New York. At one time, New Netherland separated English colonies to the north and south of it. England, at war with Holland in Europe, sent four ships into the harbor of New Amsterdam in 1664. Dutch settlers, fearing British cannons, refused to fight. Governor Peter Stuyvesant surrendered the colony. Under British control, New Netherland was renamed New York. Fort Orange became Albany, and New Amsterdam became New York City.

CHAPTER 5: European Exploration and Colonization

The colonists who established the first English colonies braved the dangers of crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The ships they came on were small and crowded. Their destination was a strange and unfamiliar land with primitive living conditions. Why did they come?
POLITICAL REASONS: ENCOURAGEMENT FROM RULERS
British monarchs encouraged the development of colonies as new sources of wealth and power. They granted charters to groups of businessmen, like the Virginia Company, who offered to help colonists settle in the “New World.”
ECONOMIC REASONS: HUNGER FOR GOLD AND SILVER
Based on the success of Spain, the first colonists believed that gold and silver existed in great abundance in the Americas. These early adventurers came to the Americas in search of precious metals.
The availability of land was a major attraction drawing settlers to Colonial America.
ECONOMIC REASONS: LAND HUNGER
Colonial settlements presented new business opportunities for merchants. The “Proprietors” who owned the Carolinas encouraged people to come. Many colonists came to obtain their own land. Most people in Britain, Ireland, and the rest of Europe were peasants or tenant farmers occupying small, over-worked lands and paying high rents. In America, free land still
seemed plentiful. The settlers did not recognize the rights of Native American Indians or understand their use of the land. Many of the first settlers were given free land by the colony or were able to purchase land cheaply.
Later many colonists came as “indentured servants.” A colonial landowner paid for an indentured servant’s passage across the Atlantic, and the indentured servant then promised to work on the landowner’s plantation or farm, usually for a period of seven years. Once the debt was paid off, indentured servants obtained freedom and began saving to buy their own land.

Questions
What differences existed between the main regions of the thirteen colonies? What was life like in Colonial America?
What factors contributed to religious freedom in the thirteen colonies?
How did the economic system of mercantilism affect the thirteen colonies?
A.
Different patterns of life developed in three regions of the colonies, based on differences in geography, climate, settler origins, and economic activities. B.
In New England, a short growing season, cooler climates, rocky soil, and an influx of Puritan settlers encouraged the development of small farms and the growth of fishing, shipping, and handicraft trades. C.
In the Southern Colonies, a long growing season and warmer climate, as well as the arrival of mainly Anglican settlers seeking to make their fortune, encouraged the development of larger farms that often grew cash crops for sale to England. Along main water routes, large plantations developed. D.
Part of the Southern Colonies’ economy was based on slave labor. Slaves grew cotton, tobacco, rice and indigo. They were taken by force from Africa and faced a horrific “Middle Passage” journey across the Atlantic. Most Southerners, however, did not own slaves. E.
The Middle Atlantic Colonies had greater ethnic and religious diversity than either New England or the Southern Colonies. Some of these colonies had once been under Dutch rule and were conquered by the English in 1664. The Middle Atlantic Colonies had fertile soil and grew food crops. Name
CHAPTER 6: Life in Colonial America
65
NEW ENGLAND
The colonies of New England —
Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Connecticut, and Rhode Island — had rocky soil and less fertile land. Since the New England Colonies were the farthest north, they had longer winters and a colder climate than the other colonies. Many New Englanders had small farms where they grew crops for their own use.
Others used the forests in the region for lumber and building ships. These colonies were located near the ocean where there was an abundance of whales and fish. Large numbers of New Englanders became sailors, fishermen, and merchants. The practice of religion, especially Puritanism, also remained important in New England.
New Englanders frequently owned and manned ships. They carried sugar from the West Indies to New England, where it was turned into rum. The rum was carried to
Africa, where it was traded for slaves. New England merchants also carried sugar from the West Indies to England. Their ships were then loaded with manufactured goods and sailed back to New England. You will learn more about these “triangular trades” later in this chapter.

The main crops planted on a plantation were very labor intensive. A successful harvest depended on slaves working from sunrise to sunset. Women usually worked the same hours as the men. Women were expected to return to the fields not long after giving birth to children. The mortality (death) rate among slaves was high. Slave women were encouraged to have large numbers of children to replace slave losses. The great majority of whites did not live on plantations. They often farmed their land on a smaller scale.

CHAPTER 6: Life in Colonial America 69
The colonists enjoyed several institutions of representative government based on both English political traditions and new practices that emerged in the colonies.
During the Middle Ages, England had developed traditions of liberty and limited self-government that were unique in Europe.
MAGNA CARTA
In 1215, the English king was forced by his barons to promise not to take away any free man’s property or to imprison any free man without following procedures established by the laws of the land. The “Great Charter” guaranteed individuals the right to a fair trial by their peers and forced the king to obtain the consent of a council of nobles before imposing any new taxes.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR.
HISTORIAN__________________________t “Clause 29. No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or [have] his Freehold, or Liberties [taken away], or be outlawed, or [sent away], or any other wise destroyed; nor will We pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers [equals], or by the Law of the land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.”
How did Clause 29 of the Magna Carta help to guarantee the rights of individuals living in England?
Why did this become an important feature of political life in the colonies?
THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT
In the Middle Ages, the English king summoned his nobles and representatives from counties and towns to show support for the crown. Parliament developed into a national legislature consisting of nobles and elected representatives. New taxes had to be approved by Parliament. After two revolutions in the 1600s, Parliament achieved supremacy over the king.
BILL OF RIGHTS OF
1689 After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the rights of English subjects were confirmed by the Bill of Rights of 1689. England’s rulers agreed not to have a standing army or to impose new taxes without the permission of Parliament. The English Bill of Rights also guaranteed trial by jury, the right to petition Parliament, and other personal freedoms, as well as freedom of speech and debate in Parliament.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN_____________________
Select one of the thirteen colonies and conduct research on the Internet or at school or your local library on how that colony’s government operated. Include information on who ran the colony, how laws were made, and if the colony had its own court system.
The colonies also saw the growth of religious freedom. The first two English colonies had people of very different religious backgrounds. Virginia was mainly founded by Anglicans — those who belonged to the Church of England. Massachusetts was founded by Pilgrims and Puritans — members of Protestant groups who came to the Americas to worship God in their own way.
In Massachusetts Bay Colony, Puritans originally set high standards for Church membership. They wanted to promote virtue (goodness). Puritans thought the members of their Church were chosen by God, and that only those “Elected” would go to Heaven. Each Sunday was a day of rest in which the whole community went to church. The minister often gave a sermon threatening sinners with the punishment of damnation after death.
Puritans wore simple, plain clothing. Observe the woman carrying a Bible.
The Puritans believed that a state-endorsed religion would insure a bond between members of society, helping to maintain order and stability. They felt that having more than one religion might threaten social stability. Although they came to America to worship God in their own way, they did not support religious toleration for others.
Name______________________________________________________
CHAPTER 6: Life in Colonial America 73

The importance of religion to the colonists was illustrated by the Great Awakening of the 1740s. Ministers emphasized the importance of religious feelings. During the Great Awakening, preachers like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield often addressed large crowds in open fields. They told listeners that God was merciful and that people could save themselves from damnation by repenting for their sins. Colonists were told to study the Bible for themselves and many became more emotionally engaged in religion. The Great Awakening emphasized people’s equality in the eyes of God. The preachers of the Great Awakening were also strong supporters of religious free-
dom and toleration. They wanted their listeners to accept Christianity as an act of free will.

Conduct research on the Internet or in your local library about the development of religious toleration in the American colonies. Select one colony and summarize how it treated religious differences and beliefs in a written report.
MERCANTILISM
The economy of the British colonies was based on mercantilism. Under this economic system, Parliament passed laws controlling the trade of the colonies in order to benefit the “Mother Country.” The aim was to get more gold and silver. Under mercantilism, colonists were expected to sell their raw materials, such as tobacco, rice, fur, and fish, at low prices to Britain.
In exchange, the colonists were supposed to buy British manufactured products, such as glass, paper, and tea, which were more expensive. Mercantilists believed
this unequal trade would increase the wealth of the “Mother Country.”

COLONIAL SOCIETY
Colonial society was divided into several social groups. A handful of wealthy landowners and merchants stood at the top of colonial society; then came independent farmers who worked their own land; tradesmen, shopkeepers, and craftsmen working in towns and villages came next; apprentices or servants were below them; and at the very bottom of the colonial social ladder were unskilled laborers and slaves.
SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE TRADE
One of the areas of greatest hardship and profit in colonial society was the slave trade. No concern was given to the feelings or comfort of the victims of this trade. “Slavers” usually bought captured Africans on the West Coast of Africa and put them on slave ships for the voyage to the Americas. Enslaved Africans were treated so harshly that many failed to survive the voyage. Traders were so greedy they sought to carry as many slaves as possible on their ships. Slaves were chained and crammed together below the deck, where sitting or standing room was limited. The air below deck was so stifling that some suffocated. Others tried to starve themselves or to jump over board. When the slaves reached the Americas, they were sold off in auctions. Families were broken up.
Captured Africans experienced horrific conditions on the “Middle Passage.”
Enslaved people made up a significant part of the population of Colonial America. The number of Africans in New England grew from under 1,000 in 1700 to about 16,000 in the 1770s. The number of slaves in the South was far greater, reaching 125,000 by 1740. Enslaved men and women were owned by plantation owners, farmers, ministers, doctors, and merchants. They were used to perform household chores and skilled jobs as well as field labor.

His writings gave advice to young ministers on a wide range of topics such as performing virtuous acts, poetry, music, and writing style. This passage deals with educating young people:
“Where [Godly] schools are not vigorously encouraged, whole colonies will sink into a degenerate and contemptible condition, and become horribly barbarous.

It is a serious thing, a weighty thing, and a thing that hath much of the interest of Christianity in it, that youth be well-trained, and that schools, and school-masters be maintained. Learning is an unwelcome guest to the Devil, and therefore he would fain starve it out.”’ What did Mather think might happen if colonists failed to educate their youth? Why did Mather choose to quote the words of Martin Luther?
Some of the earliest colonial writers were women, like Anne Bradstreet (1612-1672), who wrote poems. Her poetry eloquently expressed the concerns of a Puritan wife and mother. She is considered by many to be the first American poet. Her collection of poems was the first book written by a woman to be published in the United States. She helped lay the groundwork for other female writers in an era when most women tended to family and domestic matters.
Benjamin Franklin (1706 -1790) was a printer, publisher, and scientist who became popular with the stories and sayings in Poor Richard’s Almanac, begun in 1733, and in his Autobiography (1777). Franklin openly admitted that many of the sayings in Poor Richard were borrowed, rather than coined by himself. Franklin once stated: “Why give my readers bad lines of my own, when good ones of other people’s are so plentiful?” Nevertheless, these sayings, taken from “many Ages and Nations,” became one of the bases for
Franklin’s international fame.
Phillis Wheatley (1753-1784), was an African who was kidnapped and brought to the colonies as a slave at the age of seven. She soon learned to speak and write English, taught by the daughter of her owner; within 16 months she could read difficult passages in the Bible. She became a sensation in the 1760s when her poem on the death of the preacher George Whitefield made her famous. A constant theme running through her poetry was that of Christian salvation.

In this chapter, you will study one of the most important events in American history — the American Revolution. You will learn how British colonists in North America objected to new taxes imposed by the British. This dispute, along with other issues such as the Proclamation Line of 1763, eventually brought the colonists into armed conflict with Great Britain. Actual fighting between the British army and the colonists broke out in Massachusetts at Lexington and Concord in 1775. Open warfare finally pushed colonial leaders to declare their independence from England a year later.

By the 1750s, the British claimed control of the Ohio River Valley just across the Appalachians from the British colonies. Meanwhile, the French had built forts along the Great Lakes. They also claimed control of the Ohio River Valley, southwest of their settlements.
War between Britain and France broke out in 1754. Because many Indian tribes sided with the French, the conflict became known in North America as the French and Indian War. French military bases were located in Quebec and Montreal, while the British had bases along the Hudson River. The area between them became the main battleground. In 1756, the war spread from North America to Europe.
The French and Indian War was fought for control of North America.
A
British force captured the French city of Quebec in 1759. This victory gave the British control of the St. Lawrence River. Under the terms of the peace treaty (1763), France lost most of its colonial empire in North America, including Canada and all lands east of the Mississippi River. These lands became British.

THE ISSUE OF TAXATION
Disagreements quickly arose over the right of the British Parliament to tax the colonists. After the French and Indian War, Britain faced a huge national debt. It also cost money to station British troops in the 13 colonies and the West Indies. In Britain, people already paid higher taxes than the colonists.
The British government therefore proposed a series of new taxes on the colonists. However, these taxes were passed by the British Parliament without first consulting the colonists. British leaders thought this was only right because the colonists were not paying their fair share towards their own defense. Since the colonists lived so far away from London, it seemed impossible for them to participate effectively in the British Parliament.
Taxation without Representation. Wealthy colonial merchants and landowners, used to acting in their colonial assemblies with little British interference, resented these new policies.
Colonial leaders were also influenced by Enlightenment writers, like John Locke and William Blackstone. Locke had written that government was a “social contract.” He said the purpose of government was to protect individual freedom and property.
If a government failed to do this, Locke argued its citizens had the right to overthrow it. Blackstone defined the rights of individuals in English law, as well as property rights that could not be violated, even by the king.
Following both Locke and English traditions, Samuel Adams and other colonists argued that the British government should not tax the colonists w nists believed that “taxation without representation” wa
The Stamp Act. The next new British tax was the Stamp Act (1765). Parliament ordered that every newspaper, pamphlet, and other public or legal document had to be printed or written on paper with an official stamp, or seal, on it. This was a form of tax, because the British government was to be paid for the official stamp.
The Stamp Act created a firestorm of protests in the colonies. Colonists objected that the British government had imposed this new tax without their consent. Colonists held meetings, boycotted (refused to buy) British goods, and even attacked British officials in protest. In Virginia, Patrick Henry (1736-1799) denounced the Stamp Act, and the House of Burgesses passed resolutions against it. Samuel Adams organized a series of protests in Boston. A “Stamp Act Congress” against the act was held in New York City.
Colonists produced petitions to the king and Parliament stating their position on these new taxes. These petitions argued that the colonists could only be taxed by their own consent.

Crispus Attucks, a man of mixed African and Native American Indian ancestry, was the first colonist killed. The soldiers were put on trial, but were ably defended by a young attorney, John Adams (1735-1826). Adams argued that the soldiers acted in self-defense and they were found to be innocent. Nevertheless, his cousin Samuel Adams and other opponents of British rule called this incident the “Boston Massacre.” They circulated pictures and used this tragedy to win public support against the British.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The following statement was given by Captain Thomas Preston, of the 29th British Regiment, concerning events on March 5, 1770 (the Boston Massacre):
“... I was soon informed of [a mob of colonists’] intention
to carry off a soldier and murder him ... I sent an officer and 12 men to protect the sentry and followed myself. The mob became more outrageous, raising their bludgeons and calling out, ‘come on you scoundrels, fire if you dare.’ I [used] all my power to persuade them to retire peaceably. They continued to advance. [Someone] asked if I intended to order the men to fire. I answered no.... While speaking, a soldier received a severe blow, and instantly fired his gun. Turning to ask him why he fired without orders, I was struck with a club on my arm, which had it been on my head would have destroyed me....”
How do you think Samuel Adams’ description of this event might have differed?
In 1772, Samuel Adams formed the first Committee of Correspondence with James Warren and his wife, Mercy Otis Warren (1728-1874). Mary wrote a series of pamphlets and satires against the British. The new Committees of Correspondence organized opponents of British polices throughout the colonies. With her husband off fighting, Mercy wrote the first history of the American Revolutionary War using her notes from meetings and conversations. Her ideas and writings convinced many people in the colonies to take up the Patriot cause.
Mercy Otis Warren
The Tea Duty and the Boston Tea Party.
In response to colonial protests, the British again canceled all of the new taxes except the duty on tea. In the evening of December 1773, a group of colonists dressed as Mohawk Indians boarded three British ships in Boston Harbor and seized 45 tons of tea. They protested against the tea tax by dumping the tea into Boston Harbor.

THE STRUGGLE SPREADS
In May 1775, colonial representatives met again In Philadelphia for the Second Continental Congress. All of the colonies sent delegates to Philadelphia. Delegates included John and Samuel Adams from Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin from Pennsylvania, and Thomas Jefferson from Virginia. The delegates quickly voted to join Massachusetts in its fight. In Williamsburg, Virginia, Patrick Henry (1736-1799) considered the finest orator in America, convinced the House of Burgesses to support the war with his stirring speech,
97
Patrick Henry, “The Voice of the American Revolution.”
“Give me liberty or give me death.” Although the Second Continental Congress lacked the legal authority to govern, it boldly assumed that responsibility.
The Continental Congress appointed George Washington, a Virginian who had fought in the French and Indian War, to lead the Continental Army. The selection of a Virginian helped to unify the colonies. Washington proceeded directly to Boston. In March 1776, using cannons captured by Ethan Allen at Fort Ticonderoga in upstate New York, Washington drove the British out of Boston. The British retreated to New York City.
Imagine that you and your classmates are representatives meeting in the Continental Congress. Hold an imaginary session in which you discuss: (1) complaints of the colonists against Great Britain; and (2) possible solutions to the crisis.
THOMAS PAINE'S COMMON SENSE
A variety of colonial viewpoints developed in response to the outbreak of war. Loyalists still wanted to remain under British rule. In the provinces of Canada, colonists stayed loyal to the Crown. There were also many Loyalists in the thirteen colonies. Some wanted to stay a part of the British Empire, but with more rights for the colonists. The Iroquois sided with the British, as did many black slaves, who were promised their freedom for helping the British in the war.
Thomas Paine, an Englishman living in the colonies, published a pamphlet, Common Sense, early in 1776. Paine believed it was ridiculous for America to be governed by a small, distant island across the vast ocean. He said the colonists derived no benefit from British rule. In fact, the British had dragged the colonists into European wars. Many Patriots {supporters of the Revolution) began to demand complete independence.

This philosophy teaches that each individual is endowed at birth with rights that are “unalienable” because they were given to us by our Creator. This idea of “unalienable rights” became a basic belief of American government — that some rights are derived from nature and may not be taken or violated by the government.

Jefferson argued that citizens had the right to overthrow an oppressive government to protect these unalienable rights. This argument is found in the most important paragraph of the Declaration:
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government....” Briefly summarize this paragraph in your own words.

THE ROAD TO VICTORY
In the first years of the war, the colonial army barely managed to escape disaster. Washington and the Continental Army occupied New York City in 1776. However, the British drove Washington and his army out of New York after the Battle of Long Island. British troops then occupied New York City.

CHAPTER 7: The American Revolution: The Road to Independence
The plan then failed entirely when the largest army, commanded by General John Burgoyne, was defeated at Saratoga in 1777 by General Horatio Gates. General Burgoyne was unprepared because, like many British generals, he held the erroneous belief that the rebels were ignorant farmers who could easily be swept away by highly trained British regulars.
One of those fighting in Saratoga was church leader, historian, and judge Wentworth ChesweSl (1746-1817). Cheswell is considered the first African American elected to public office in America.
The Battle of Saratoga marked a turning point in the war. The victory at Saratoga helped Ben Franklin and John Adams, who had been sent overseas to persuade the French government to supply military assistance to the Americans.
101
THE WINTER OF
AT VALLEY FORGE
Despite the victory at Saratoga, the war was far from over. The Continental Congress had to leave Philadelphia, which was occupied by British troops. Washington and his battle-weary army spent the winter at Valley Forge in Pennsylvania. Here, Washington faced the problem of feeding his 12,000 troops, and even faced threats to his leadership from some of his officers. Long marches had destroyed the soldiers’ shoes, and warm blankets were scarce. There were desertions, and many suffered from diseases such as typhus, typhoid, and pneumo- nia. Although no battle was fought at Valley Forge, it represented a major test for the new Continental Army.
Washington used his time at Valley Forge to train and discipline his troops. Foreign volunteers, like Baron von Steuben from Germany and the Marquis de Lafayette (1757-1834) from France, helped train the soldiers of the Continental Army. Although the French King forbid him from going to America because France was not at war with England, Lafayette purchased a ship and gathered a group of French officers to help in the struggle. His volunteer service was seen as a major triumph for the American cause.

Cornwallis surrenders to Washington.
THE BATTLE OF YORKTOWN
(1781) After several more years of fighting, General Washington managed, with French help, to force General Charles Cornwallis and the main British army into a comer at Yorktown, Virginia. The French fleet blocked their escape by sea. After a few days of combat, Cornwallis and his 8,000 British soldiers were forced to surrender in October 1781.
The Battle of Yorktown turned out to be the last major battle of the war. Occasional fighting contin-
ued after the surrender at Yorktown, and Washington feared the war might still drag on for another year. However, when word reached England of the defeat at Yorktown, the Prime Minister was forced to resign and the new government decided to give up the fight.
INDEPENDENCE RECOGNIZED
The Treaty of Paris of 1783 formally ended the American Revolutionary War. Under its terms, the British recognized the independence of the colonies. The British promised to remove all of their troops from the country. In addition, they gave all the land between the Mississippi River and the Atlantic, from the Great Lakes to the border with Florida, to the new United States. This move gave the new nation twice the area of the former colonies.
A variety of factors were responsible for the American victory over Great Britain, then the world’s richest and most powerful empire:
.............. • "*"i
THE AMERICAN VICTORY WAS DUE TO MANY FACTORS
hi
Fighting for their Homeland. The colonists were defending their own soil. The British were fighting a war thousands of miles from their homeland.

Methods of Warfare. Colonial forces used unconventional methods to fight the British. They took advantage of hiding behind trees and other tactics. The British fought in a more traditional manner, with soldiers aligned in a straight formation out in the open.
Local Support. The Continental Army received support from the local population, including women. The British were fighting a war on a hostile terrain. Nevertheless, the British did receive support from Loyalists, and used Canada as a refuge and as a staging ground for attacks against the colonists.
Leadership. Washington was a very capable general. He received help from experienced foreign military leaders, such as Baron von Steuben, Kasimir Pulaski, and Marquis de Lafayette. These European volunteers helped turn the Continental army into a more disciplined fighting force.


	
The French Alliance. Volunteers, money, troops and naval support from France were essential to the
American victory.

CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788
115
A.
After declaring independence from Great Britain, each colony became an independent state and adopted its own state constitution. B.
The Second Continental Congress enacted the Articles of Confederation. This created a loose confederation of states. Each state had one vote in the Confederation Congress, and nine states were needed to pass a law. The Confederation Congress controlled foreign affairs but was unable to raise its own army or collect taxes. It depended on the state governments for support. C.
The Confederation Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, establishing principles for the orderly future expansion of the United States. Slavery was prohibited in the Northwest Territory. D.
During the “Critical Period,” (1781-1787), the new nation faced many problems under the Articles of Confederation. States taxed goods from other states, and each state printed its own money, making trade difficult. E.
In 1786, farmers in Massachusetts rose up in Shays’ Rebellion. Although it was put down by state militia, there was no national army if it had spread. F.
American leaders decided a stronger government was needed. At Annapolis, they decided to invite delegates to Philadelphia to revise the Articles. G.
The Constitutional Convention was held in Philadelphia in 1787. The delegates soon decided to abandon the Articles and write a new constitution. H.
The delegates agreed that the new government should be based on the principles of republicanism, popular sovereignty, and limited government. They also agreed on the need for a stronger national government. I.
Several important issues divided members of the Convention. Delegates from larger states wanted representation in Congress by size, while smaller states wanted each state to be equal. The “Great Compromise” settled the dispute. J. A
second issue divided the delegates over the issue of how slaves would be counted towards a state’s representation in Congress. The issue was settled with the “Three-fifths Compromise.” K.
The new constitution established the principles of federalism, popular sovereignty, limited government, separation of powers, and checks and balances to make sure the new central government would not become too strong. L.
The Preamble of the Constitution stated the purposes of the new government. The delegates also created a process to amend the Constitution. M.
After the Constitution was completed, the country debated whether to ratify (approve) it. Anti-Federalists believed the new government would be too strong and tyrannical. Federalists believed a stronger government was needed and that the principles of federalism and separation of powers were sufficient safeguards to protect individual liberties. N.
The Constitution was ratified after its supporters promised a Bill of Rights. Name___________________________________________________
CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788
117
The first governments of the new United States were actually established at the state, not the national level. After declaring independence, each former colony became an independent state. Colonial charters were rewritten as state constitutions.
Americans also recognized the need for some form of central, or national, government. The Continental Congress itself was inadequate to serve as a permanent form of national government. But because of their recent experiences with British rule, the former colonists were afraid of creating a central government that would be too powerful. The Constitutional Congress drafted the Articles of Confederation in 1776 and 1777 to solve this problem.
After the Articles of Confederation were written, the document had to be approved by each state before it could become official. Although the Articles were sent to the states in November 1777, it took almost four years, until March of 1781, for each state to approve them in full.
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The thirteen new states finally adopted the Articles of Confederation in 1781. Here are some of its major provisions:
II.
Each state retains its sovereignty [supreme power], freedom and every power, jurisdiction and right, which is not expressly delegated to the United States.... Article III. The States hereby enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other against all attacks upon them....
Article V. In determining questions in the United States in Congress assembled, each State shall have one vote.
Article VI. No State, without the consent of the Congress, shall enter into any conference, alliance or treaty with any king, prince or state.”
What were the goals of the new Confederation?
Identify one advantage and one disadvantage of one of the articles above.
STRUCTURE 01
Members of the Continental Congress feared that individual freedom might be threatened by the national government if it had too much power. Therefore, the Articles of Confederation deliberately placed more power in the hands of the individual states, making the new national government very weak. It was only a loose association — a “league of friendship,” with only one branch of government — the Congress.

ACHIEVEMENTS
Despite its shortcomings, the Articles of Confederation created a national government that had some important achievements. It successfully concluded the peace treaty with Britain, ending the American Revolution. It helped develop the concept of limited government — a system in which government has only certain powers and cannot act beyond the powers it was specifically given. The Articles of Confederation also developed the idea that American citizenship included both privileges and immunities {rights to take certain actions without penalty). State governments could not deny these privileges and immunities to citizens who came from other states.
The Confederation Congress also passed the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. These acts prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory, encouraged free public education, and guaranteed both religious freedom and trial by jury. Procedures were also established for governing the Northwest Territory, which was divided into smaller territories.
The Northwest Ordinance introduced a method for admitting these territories into the Union as new states once a population of60,000 people was achieved within each territory. The new states were admitted on terms of complete equality with the original thirteen states.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 spurred the westward expansion of the United States. Here is one of the most important provisions of this document:
“Article 5. There shall be formed in the territory, not less than
three nor more than five States; And when any of the said States shall have sixty thousand free inhabitants, such State shall be admitted into the Congress of the United States on an equal footing with the original States in all respects, and shall be at liberty to form a constitution and State government: Provided the constitution and government shall be republican, and in conformity to the principles contained in these articles....”

The rebels wanted to stop state courts from seizing their property and imprisoning them for unpaid debts. They also wanted the state to issue paper money. There was no national army to put down the uprising if it had spread to other states. Although the state militia was able to put it down, many property-owners across the country now felt the need for a stronger national government.
A meeting of representatives at Annapolis in 1786 called for a convention of delegates to revise the Articles of Confederation. Since only five of the 13 states were represented at Annapolis, they agreed to assemble again a few months later in Philadelphia.
In May 1787, representatives from the states met in Philadelphia to revise the Articles of Confederation. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and
The signing of the U.S. Constitution at Independence Hall
Alexander Hamilton were among the delegates. The representatives quickly agreed on discarding the Articles of Confederation. Instead, they decided that a new national constitution was needed.

Although it was agreed that the discussions of the Constitutional Convention were to be kept secret, James Madison wrote down every speech. Madison is known as the “Father of the U.S. Constitution.” If not for his notes, little of what took place at the
Constitutional Convention would be known. Below is a speech that Madison gave at the Convention:
“In time of war, great powers are given to the Executive. Constant [fear] of war has the same tendency to make the head too large for the body. A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not be a safe [protector] of liberty. The defense against foreign threats has been the instrument of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing truth to stir fear of a war, whenever a revolt was threatened. The armies were kept on under the [excuse] of defending [the people, but they] enslaved them.”

MAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL COMPROMISES
Issue: How should states be represented in the national legislature?
Issue: How should slaves be counted?
]
—

-

The "Great Compromise:" Larger states felt they should have a greater say in the national government. Smaller states felt each state should have an equal voice. In this compromise, a two "house" (bicameral) legislature was created — Congress. In the House of Representatives, states were represented according to their population size. This allowed states with a larger population to have a greater number of representatives. In the Senate, each state, no matter what its size, would be represented by two Senators. Senators were elected indirectly. All laws needed the approval of both houses of Congress.
The "Three-Fifths Compromise:" Southern states wanted slaves counted as part of their population, to have more members in the House of Representatives. The states compromised by agreeing to count every five slaves as three free persons for both taxation and representation.

The "Commerce Compromise." Another dispute involved the taxing of trade. Southern landowners, who sold cash crops to England, feared taxes on exports of their tobacco and other crops. In the “Commerce Compromise,” the delegates agreed to prohibit all taxes on exports (goods sold to foreign countries). Only imported goods could be taxed. The delegates also agreed that Congress could not regulate or limit the slave trade for at least the next twenty years — until 1808.

Name______________________________________________
CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788	125
Because the delegates to the Convention did not entirely trust the common people, they arranged for the President to be chosen by an indirect election. Voters would first choose members of the Electoral College. Once selected, these electors would then vote to choose the President. Each state is free to choose its electors as it wishes. In the late 1700s, America was largely rural. Most people were farmers who knew little about politics. In this environment, a direct election of the President would probably have been difficult.
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
The new national legislature was called Congress. Based on the “Great Compromise,” it consisted of two houses: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Congress had the power to make laws, declare war, borrow and issue money, pay for military forces, and regulate commerce (trade) between different states or with foreign countries.

THE JUDICIAL BRANCH
Anew national judiciary was created, consisting of the Supreme Court and any lower courts later created by Congress. The Supreme Court could rule on cases involving either the new Constitution or laws passed by Congress. Its Justices (judges) were to be appointed for life by the President, with the approval of the Senate. Life tenure meant that the Justices would not have to run for election and could be completely independent.

CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788
127
The basic challenge faced by the authors of the Constitution was to create a national government that would be strong, but not so strong that it might undermine individual liberties identified in the Declaration of Independence. To achieve this goal, the new Constitution adopted a number of important principles:
LIMITED GOVERNMENT
One of the most important principles of the U.S. Constitution is the belief that the powers of government should be limited. A self-governing people gives their government leaders only certain specific powers. These are the “just powers” of government mentioned in the Declaration of Independence. Under our system of limited government, our national government has no duties or powers, other than those powers specifically granted to it in the Constitution.
REPUBLICANISM
Americans created a republican form of government — a democratic government chosen by the people. A republic describes a government in which decisions are made by elected representatives, not handed down by a king.
POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY
Another key principle of the U.S. Constitution is that the people are sovereign — they hold supreme power. The “just” powers of the government come from the consent of the governed. The people exercise their sovereignty by electing representatives to Congress, and by indirectly electing the President.
FEDERALISM
The authors of the U.S. Constitution created a “federal republic.” Government powers were divided between the national government and the states. To accomplish this, the writers of the Constitution created a system in which power was shared between the national (or federal} and state governments. The federal government treats issues facing the entire nation, while state governments handle local affairs. Because power was divided between the national and state governments, the
authors of the Constitution believed the national government would not become too strong.

INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
You will leam about the issues surrounding the protection of individual rights in the next
chapter.
PROVISIONS FOR CHANGE: THE AMENDMENT PROCESS
The Constitution included provisions for change. The way the U.S. Constitution keeps pace is through the amendment process, which allows changes and additions to the text of the Constitution. To prevent changes for unimportant reasons, the amending process was made more difficult than passing an ordinary law. Although over 200 years old, our Constitution has thus kept up with the changing needs of our nation.
A special “elastic clause” in the U.S. Constitution further provided Congress with the power to enact any laws they deemed “necessary” to carry out its other powers. These provisions have made our Constitution into a “living document.” The “elastic clause” has allowed the powers of Congress to increase dramatically since the early 1800s, due in large part to the decisions of the Supreme Court.

CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788	131
The Declaration of Independence (1776) had listed a series of grievances committed by King George III of England against the colonists. A number of those grievances addressed violations by the King of his duties under the English Bill of Rights. Many of the provisions of the U.S. Constitution were included to prevent a repetition of such abuses:
IMPACT OF COLONIAL GRIEVANCES ON THE CONSTITUTION
UCUdldIIUII U! 11 lUt?UCIIUdlUC r	
The King imposed taxes without the consent of the colonists.	U.S. Constitution provides that all taxes must be approved by the House of Representatives.
The King made the military superior to the civil government.	U.S. Constitution provides that the Com-mander-in-Chief is a civilian — the President.
The King kept a large standing army among the colonists.	Congress has the right to raise and support an army. It determines its size through its control of funds.
The King made judges dependent on his will.	All federal judges are appointed for life.
Members of the Constitutional Convention knew they could not adopt their new plan on their own authority. They decided that before the Constitution could become law, nine states should ratify {approve) it. Special conventions were held in each state for this purpose.
FEDERALISTS AND ANTI-FEDERALISTS
Opponents of the new Constitution were known as Anti-Federalists. They included such patriots as Patrick Henry and George Mason.
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In this address to the Virginia legislature in June 1788, Patrick Henry objects to scrapping the Articles of Confederation:
“The Confederation, this same despised government, merits, in my opinion, the highest [praise]: it carried us through a long and
dangerous war; it rendered us victorious in that bloody conflict with a powerful nation; it has secured us a territory greater than any European monarch possesses: and should a government which has been that strong and vigorous, be accused of imbecility, and abandoned for want of energy? Consider what you are about to do before you part with this government.... Before you abandon the present system, I hope you will consider not only its defects, but likewise those that of which you are about to substitute for it.”
What arguments does Henry raise against abandoning the Articles of Confederation?
Name___________________________________________________
CHAPTER 8: Establishing a New Government, 1777 to 1788
The Federalist Papers helped to persuade Americans to approve the new constitution. Thomas Jefferson called them the best explanation ever written about the principles of government. Some have even called these essays the most significant public-relations campaign in history. To obtain the necessary votes for ratification, supporters promised to add a bill of rights. With this assurance, by the end of 1788, eleven states had voted to ratify {approve) the U.S. Constitution.
133
Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay —authors of the Federalist Papers.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Many Americans believed, as Baron de Montesquieu had written, that liberty was only safe in small societies governed either by direct democracy or by legislatures with small districts. James Madison, in Federalist No. 51, argued the opposite. In a large republic, different interests would have to come together to form a coalition (alliance)
in order to govern the nation. Government was created to prevent politicians or small groups from using government for their own unjust purposes
“In republican government, the legislative authority dominates. The remedy for this is to divide the legislature into different branches; and to [make] them, by different [methods] of election and different principles of action, as little connected with each other as their common functions will [allow].... In a single republic, all the power surrendered by the people is submitted to ... a single government; and [misuse of that power] is guarded against by dividing the government into separate departments. In America, the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two distinct governments, and then the power of each is subdivided among separate departments.
Hence a double security arises to protect the rights of the people. Different governments will control each other, at the same time that each will be controlled by itself. If a majority is united by a common interest, the rights of the minority might be
threatened. There are two ways of providing against this evil: by creating a will in the community independent of the majority of the society; the other, by comprehending in the society so many separate descriptions of citizens as will render an unjust combination of a majority of the whole improbable, if not impractical.”
What arguments does Madison make to calm fears of some that the new government could threaten people’s liberties?

EXAMINE the question. This question tests your ability to understand a political cartoon. Recall what you know. The cartoonist has drawn a large ship representing the Articles of Confederation. It is sailing through rough waters. The waves are high, threatening to sink the ship. These waves symbolize different shortcomings of the Arti-
cles — no national army, no power to enforce treaties, and no power to raise an army. The caption raises the question whether the government under the Articles is in danger of sinking. Apply what you know. You should realize that Choices A, C, and D do not really define the main idea of the cartoon. The best answer is Choice S5, since the cartoonist implies the Articles of Confederation had many shortcomings.

CHAPTER 9: The Rights and Responsibilities of American Citizens 143
A.
Anti-Federalists criticized the Constitution for the absence of a “Bill of Rights.” The first Congress proposed ten amendments. These amendments were added to the Constitution in 1791 as the Bill of Rights. B.
The First Amendment guarantees freedom of religion, free speech, freedom of the press, the right to assemble, and the right to petition the government. It also states that the Congress shall not establish any religion. C.
These First Amendment rights are crucial to our democracy. They allow us to criticize government officials and debate issues without fear of government reprisals. Few of these rights, however, are absolute. Government can place reasonable limits on these freedoms. For example we cannot scream fire in a crowded theatre as a joke. D.
The Second Amendment guarantees our right to “bear arms.” This allows citizens to own guns. The Third Amendment prohibits government from quartering troops in our homes without consent. These rights arose out of circumstances that developed during the American Revolutionary War. E.
The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments protect individuals accused of a crime from unjust accusations and government abuse. F.
The Fourth Amendment prevents the police from conducting “unreasonable searches and seizures.” Unless a specific exception applies, the police need a search warrant before they can conduct a search. G.
The Fifth Amendment states that individuals cannot be tried twice for the same crime, or be forced to incriminate themselves. H.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees those accused of a crime a fair and public trial by a jury and the assistance of a lawyer. J.
The Eighth Amendment prevents judges from setting bail that is too high, or inflicting “cruel and unusual” punishments. K.
The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not granted to the federal government to the state governments and the people. L.
The Bill of Rights protected individuals from abuse by the federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals from actions carried out by state governments. It grants citizens “due process” and “equal protection” of the law. M.
Anyone bom in the United States or with U.S. citizens as parents is a citizen of the United States. A foreigner can become a naturalized citizen. To become naturalized, a person must be 18 years old, live in the United States for 5 years, be of good moral character, pass a test on U.S. history and government, and take an oath of allegiance to the U.S. Constitution. N. U.S.
citizens had additional rights and responsibilities beyond those specified in the Bill of Rights. They are able to vote, to serve on juries, and to hold public office. They should try to remain informed on public issues and to participate actively in public life. Name______________________________________________________________
CHAPTER 9: The Rights and Responsibilities of American Citizens 145

One of the most important amendments in the Bill of Rights was the First Amendment:
The First Amendment actually covers several rights at the same time:
Let’s look at each of these rights more closely.
FREEDOM OF RELIGION
It is no mistake that a guarantee of religious freedom is stated at the start of the First Amendment. From the very beginning, many people had migrated to the American colonies for the freedom to practice their own religious beliefs.
The First Amendment guarantees individuals the right to freely engage in any religious practices that do not directly harm other individuals. In many countries in Europe at that time, there was an established religion supported by the government. The First Amendment
states that Congress will not “establish a religion.” This is sometimes called the establishment clause. While the ban on government involvement in religion seems clear, there have been instances in which the proper role of government has been debated. For example, it is clear that Congress cannot pass a law saying that a particular religion is the established religion of the United States. Nor can Congress vote to give money to a particular church or religious group. But can public schools have prayers in school? The Supreme Court, which has the role of interpreting these amendments, has said no.
Some limited government activity concerned with religion has been declared “constitutional” by the Supreme Court. For example, the Supreme Court has said that a state can pay for bus transportation to students who choose to go to a full-time religious school. This is to support the expenses of these students’ general education. However, because government cannot “establish” a religion, there can be no religious activities, such as prayers, in public schools.

CHAPTER 9: The Rights and Responsibilities of American Citizens 147
THE RIGHT OF ASSEMBLY
In some countries, people cannot peacefully gather to protest against government policies without fear of punishment. If they gather or demonstrate, they fear they might be beaten, arrested, imprisoned, or even killed. The First Amendment states that Congress cannot deny individuals the right to “peacefully assemble.” This means that people have a right to gather peaceably with others without fear that the government will use force against them. In a democracy, many groups and organizations often use the right to “peacefully assemble” as a way to get the word out. They gather in parades and demonstrations to show their support for certain ideas and beliefs.
THE RIGHT TO PETITION
Congress also cannot deny individuals the right to write to government representatives or officials, seeking a change in the law. This is known as the right to petition. This right is based on the belief that citizens have a right to complain to their representatives about things that they do not like and would like to see changed.
If there is a law or policy that citizens dislike, they gather people’s signatures on petitions. These petitions are then sent to government officials.
The right to gather signatures on a petition is protected by the First Amendment.
Rewrite the First Amendment in your own words. Which rights in the First Amendment do you think are the most important? Explain your reasons.
THE SECOND AMENDMENT
Americans recognized the important role played by the militia in winning the Revolutionary War. A militia is a “citizen’s army,” a force made up of ordinary citizens who take up arms. The Second Amendment states that “a well-regulated militia” is necessary for the security of a free state. For this reason, it says people should have the right to keep and bear arms {carry weapons). Because of the Second Amendment, Americans have the right to own guns. In other countries, citizens do not have this right. Some Americans question whether this right is still necessary today and whether it encourages violence.
Name_______________________________________________________
CHAPTER 9: The Rights and Responsibilities of American Citizens
149
THE FIFTH AMENDMENT
A citizen cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. This means that certain legal procedures must be carried out according to established rules before a person can be punished.
Eminent domain refers to the power of the government over property in its territory. Sometimes, the government needs to take over property — such as to build a public highway or construct a school. A person’s property cannot be taken away for public use without payment (“reasonable compensation”).
A person cannot be tried for a serious federal crime, that could lead to imprisonment or execution, without an indictment by a grand jury. An indictment is a formal accusation by a court before a person is arrested. A grand jury is a group of citizens that meet to review if there is enough evidence available to hold a trial.
No person can be subject to double jeopardy — being tried twice for the same crime. The government, with all its power and resources, should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for a suspected offense, subjecting him or her to embarrassment and great expense.
-It An accused person cannot be forced to say things that will be used against him or herself (seif-incrimination). A person’s confession of a crime is not valid if he or she was not first informed of the right to have a lawyer.
This amendment guarantees a fair and impartial trial to all persons accused of a crime. They must be told of the charges against them; they have the right to a trial by jury; and they have the right to be represented by a lawyer.
THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT
Federal courts cannot require unusually high bail. Bail is the money an accused pays to a court as security so that he or she need not remain in jail while awaiting trial. This amendment also states that no one can be punished in a cruel or unusual way. On this basis, the Supreme Court has ruled that a state cannot pass a law with a mandatory death sentence. Some critics say that capital punishment itself should be prohibited by the Eighth Amendment, but the Supreme Court has yet to agree.
The freedoms our citizens enjoy because of the Bill of Rights are important to the fabric of life in America. Design and create a poster that showcases these freedoms.

OTHER
AMENDMENTS_______i THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT
This amendment guarantees the right to a trial by a jury in many civil disputes — cases where one person sues another for injury or for breaking a contract.
THE NINTH AMENDMEN
This amendment says that just because the Constitution lists some specific individual rights, this does not mean that citizens do not also hold other rights.
HE TENTH AMENDMEN
"The powers not delegated to the United. Stales by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.'’
The system of federalism divides power between the states and federal government. This amendment states that all powers not specifically given to the federal government are reserved (left) for the states or the people. The federal government has powers only over things specifically given to it in the Constitution. All other powers are given to the states or the people.
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS
Some of the rights in the Bill of Rights, like some provisions in the original Constitution, were responses to the grievances in the Declaration of Independence:
IMPACT OF COLONIAL GRIEVANCES ON THE CONSTITUTION
Grievances listed in the Declaration of Independence	Where each was addressed in the Bill of Rights

The King deprived some colonists of a trial by jury.	The Sixth Amendment guarantees a trial by jury to all persons accused of a crime.
Name______________________________________________________________
CHAPTER 9: The Rights and Responsibilities of American Citizens 153
THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT
After the Civil War, another series of important amendments was added to the Constitution. These abolished slavery and guaranteed the freed slaves and other citizens certain rights against the actions of state governments. The Fourteenth Amendment was especially important. The original Bill of Rights had only protected citizens against the actions of the federal government. The Fourteen Amendment now applied to actions by state governments. This amendment was mainly intended to help the freed slaves but actually applied to all citizens. The Supreme Court later reached the conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed all the rights in the Bill of Rights against the actions of state governments as well as by the federal government.
The Fourteenth Amendment protects individual citizens from abuses by state governments in two ways:
Due Process Rights. According to the Fourteenth Amendment, state governments must follow the same procedures as the federal government when arresting, searching, or convicting persons suspected of a crime. Everyone is guaranteed rights of “due process.”
Equal Protection Rights. The Fourteenth Amendment also guarantees each of us the “equal protection” of the laws. Neither the federal government nor a state government can treat members of different groups unequally, unless there is some compelling reason to do so, such as to protect national security. On the basis of this provision, the Supreme Court held in 1954 that states cannot send people to different public schools based on their racial or ethnic backgrounds.

CHAPTER 9: The Rights and Responsibilities of American Citizens

What is a citizen? A citizen is a participating member of a community. It is not an accident that the term citizen sounds like “city.” The first citizens were participating members of the city-states of Greece, with rights and responsibilities. Later, the Roman Empire expanded the notion of citizenship. The empire allowed people in conquered states to become full citizens.
Surprisingly the term “citizenship” was not defined in the original U.S. Constitution. It was not until 1868, with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, that the requirements for American citizenship were stated in the Constitution. There are two paths to American citizenship — by birth or naturalization.
The Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment apply to all people living in the United States. They apply to permanent residents in this country and visitors as well as American citizens. However, there are some special rights that only U.S. citizens enjoy. These include the right to vote in elections and to participate in government by holding public office.
"BIRTHRIGHT" CITIZENSHIP
According to the Fourteenth Amendment, persons bom in the United States, or who have U.S. citizens as parents, are citizens.
NATURALIZATION
The second way for individuals to become American citizens is through the process of naturalization. This is a legal process by which someone from another country is made into a U.S. citizen. To become a U.S. citizen today, an individual must meet the following requirements:
Individuals being sworn in to become U.S. citizens.

Celebrating Freedom Week
During "Freedom Week," students in Texas study and celebrate the three founding documents of our system of democracy. You have learned about these three "Charters of Freedom" in the last three chapters — the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.
The Declaration of Independence (1776)
You learned that this document was shaped by English traditions and by new traditions established by colonial representative assemblies. In the opening lines of the Declaration, Thomas Jefferson restated John Locke's political philosophy — that all people have certain unalienable rights that cannot rightfully be taken from them: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
You should memorize the following lines and practice them with a classmate:
e holdthese truths to he self-evident, that a([ men are created equal, that they are endowed hy their Creator with certain Unalienable (Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of (Happiness. Lhat to secure these rights, (governments are instituted among (Men, deriving their just powers y from the consent of the governed._______________._________________
Your teacher may want to quiz you on these words. You should also try to write down what the paragraph means in your own words. You can check back on pages 95-96 to review the meaning of this passage. You should recall that the rest of the Declaration went on to explain why the colonists felt they had the right to rebel and to establish their own country. The colonists also listed their many grievances against the British king.
The U.S. Constitution (1787)
This document established the basic structure of our government. It established a I government based on popular sovereignty — "We the People" — in which power I rests with the people, who elect their representatives. The authors of the Constitution sought to create a national government strong enough to defend the nation's ] interests and to promote its general welfare. They gave the new national government many important powers, and made federal law supreme over state law. To ensure that j the new national government was not too strong, they divided its powers between ! the federal and state governments. Power was further divided at the national level ] through a separation of powers. The idea was to create an effective government, but ! one that would respect the rights of its citizens.	?

CHAPTER 10: The Early Republic, 1789-1828	169
IMPORTANT IDEAS —
A.
Americans and their leaders faced many challenges in the years after the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, when the new republic was established. B.
George Washington became the nation’s first President in 1789. He established the first Cabinet. The first Congress passed the Bill of Rights and the Judiciary Act of 1789, completing the nation’s federal court system. C.
To create a stable economic system, Alexander Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, set out an economic plan in which the federal government would both assume the debts of the national and state governments and create a national bank, a whiskey tax, and a protective tariff to help American manufacturers. All of Hamilton’s Financial Plan was accepted except for the tariff. D.
Western farmers rebelled against the new whiskey tax. The “Whiskey Rebellion” collapsed when Washington and Hamilton made a show of force. E.
Jefferson and Madison disagreed with Hamilton’s Plan, giving rise to the first American political parties—the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans. F.
Americans were also divided in their support of the French Revolution. Jefferson and Madison supported it, while Adams and Hamilton feared mob rule in America. Washington kept the nation neutral when war broke out between France and Britain. In his Farewell Address, Washington warned against entangling alliances, believing the nation should avoid ties to Europe. G.
Jefferson was elected in the “Revolution of 1800.” This was a peaceful transition of power from the Federalists. In 1803, Jefferson approved the Louisiana Purchase, doubling the nation’s size and giving America control of the Mississippi River. Jefferson continued Washington’s policy of neutrality with Europe. H.
Chief Justice John Marshall issued a series of landmark Supreme Court decisions which helped strengthen the national government, established the role of the Supreme Court, and unified the nation. In Marbury v. Madison, Marshall established the principle of judicial review — that the Supreme Court can rule whether a law is constitutional. In McCulloch v. Maryland, he established the supremacy of federal law and the ability of Congress to exercise powers needed to carry out its duties. In Gibbons v. Ogden, he expanded the scope of Congress’ power to regulate commerce between the states. I.
Americans finally became involved in a conflict with Britain in the War of 1812. Britain’s impressment of U.S. sailors and U.S. ambitions in Canada were the main causes. The war proved the nation could defend itself. J.
The Federalist Party collapsed after the war, giving rise to the “Era of Good Feelings.” During these years, Americans felt renewed national pride. The Missouri Compromise (1820) preserved unity, and the Monroe Doctrine (1823) asserted American influence in the Western Hemisphere. K.
During these years, Americans also saw the spread of steamboat travel, increasing numbers of factories, and construction of canals, such as the Erie Canal. CHAPTER 10: The Early Republic, 1789-1828	171
DEFINING OUR NEW CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
The Constitution allowed the President to appoint officials in charge of executive departments. The chief officials that Washington appointed began meeting together with him in what came to be known as the Cabinet. Over the years, additional Cabinet departments were created. The Cabinet was one of the important precedents established by Washington. A precedent is an action taken for the first time, which is followed by others afterwards.
CREATING A STABLE ECONOMY
The most pressing problems facing Washington’s government were economic. As a result of the American Revolution, the national government owed $54 million. The
states owed another $24 million, and the paper money issued by the Continental Congress and the Articles of Confederation was worthless. The job of solving these economic problems fell to Alexander Hamilton, our nation’s first Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton drew up a four-part plan for getting the nation on a sound financial basis:

THE RISE OF POLITICAL PARTIES
Hamilton’s program was strongly opposed by Thomas Jefferson, Washington’s Secretary of State. Jefferson, Madison and their followers believed Hamilton’s plan would just benefit wealthy Americans since speculators had bought up much of the debt. They also felt that the Constitution did not give the federal government the right to create a national bank. This disagreement gave rise to America’s first political parties — associations that try to elect their members to government offices so that they will pass laws favorable to their ideas.
Alexander Hamilton
PROJECT WITHOUT PERMISSION
CHAPTER 10: The Early Republic, 1789-1828	173
Washington called up the militia to put down the rebellion. Washington, with Alexander Hamilton by his side, was ready to use force, but the rebels fled before any fighting took place.
Imagine you are a representative in Congress in 1794. Write a speech either for or against Hamilton’s financial plan.
How were Shays’ Rebellion and the Whiskey Rebellion handled differently? Explain your answer.
During Washington’s Presidency, the revolution in France became increasingly violent. The revolutionaries overthrew and executed Louis XVI, the French King. War between France and Britain then broke out in 1793. Jefferson’s supporters continued to favor the French revolutionaries, while Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and other Federalists favored the British.
PROCLAMATION OF NEUTRALITY
(1793) The United States had won its independence largely through the military and financial support of France. Some French leaders thought it was time for the Americans to return the favor and that the Franco-American alliance of 1778 was still in effect.
Hamilton and his supporters were able to persuade Washington that France’s war was totally European in nature. Washington finally became convinced that there was nothing to be gained if the United States involved itself in this European conflict. Compared to European powers, the United States was weak militarily. To avoid being drawn into the Anglo-French conflict, Washington adopted a policy of neutrality — the United States would avoid taking sides in any European conflict or becoming involved in any foreign war.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
Washington believed America should not become entangled in the conflicts of foreign nations. His Proclamation of Neutrality stated this nation’s position:
“It appears that a state of war exists between Austria, Prussia,
Sardinia, Great Britain, and the Netherlands on the one part, and
France on the other. The duty and interest of the United States require that they should adopt a conduct friendly and impartial toward the [warring] powers.

Construction of the National Road begins.
Whitney’s plan was for machines to produce standardized parts which could be used with other parts to assemble a whole product without a laborer filing and fitting each part together. This interchangeability allowed easy assembly of new devices and easier repair of existing devices, while minimizing the time and skill needed for a person to assembly or repair a product. Use of interchangeable parts in the manufacture of muskets (guns) was a major contribution to the development of America industry.
The shift of manufacturing to factories, known as the Industrial Revolution, would soon lead to the rise of new industries and rapidly growing cities.
Transportation. America’s vast and untamed landscape made travel difficult. Cities were connected by roads that were little more than dirt trails. A few had log or plank roads. Most short travel was done by walking. For longer trips, people rode on horse-drawn wagons. Travel on roads was slow: a trip from Boston to New York took three days by stage coach. Western settlers sought roads to aid settlement and for the transfer of goods. They wished for a way to make it easier to market their goods and to buy essential supplies in return. In 1806, Congress set aside funds to build the first federally funded road,
the National Road. Travel by water was easier and cheaper than travel overland. Goods were often carried along streams and rivers to ports along the coast. People took ferries to cross rivers and took boats to travel down rivers, across lakes, or along coastlines.
Communication. Communications were slow. There were no telephones, telegraphs, televisions, or computers. People communicated primarily by letter. Letters had to be carried over dusty, unpaved roads or by packet boat. Mail was often mangled or even lost. News about events traveled slowly. Most people received their information from local newspapers. Most were published weekly or monthly, and were shared by many readers.
Regional Differences. The three main regions from colonial times — New England, the Middle Atlantic Colonies, and the South — were replaced by the North, the South and the emerging West. The nation’s population was growing at an enormous rate. The land available for settlement increased by almost the size of Europe — from 4.4 million to 7.8 million square kilometers.

CHAPTER 10: The Early Republic, 1789-1828	179
The second President of the United States, John Adams, was a Federalist who continued many of Washington’s policies. In 1800, John Adams lost the Presidential election to Thomas Jefferson.
Jefferson sought to show that he was one of the people. The capital had just been moved from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. Jefferson walked alone from his boardinghouse to the Capitol to take the oath of office. His inauguration marked the first transition of the executive branch from one party to another. Sometimes known as the “Revolution of 1800,” this change occurred without violence.
JEFFERSON'S VIEWS ON GOVERNMENT
Jefferson saw his election as a turning point. He believed the best government was one that governed least. Jefferson opposed special privileges for the wealthy and had strong sympathies for the common farmer. As President, he set about reducing the size of the army,
ending naval expansion, and lowering government costs.	Thomas Jefferson
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In his First Inaugural Address (1801), Jefferson spoke of what he thought was necessary to make America a prosperous nation. Here is what he said:
“With all these blessings, what more is necessary to make us
a happy and prosperous people? Still one thing more, fellow citizens — a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it had earned. This is the sum of good government.”

-fc Is what Jefferson said 200 years ago still relevant to our nation today?
THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE
(1803) Jefferson had always dreamed of extending the United States westward. He sent envoys to France to negotiate the right to send goods down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. In 1803, Napoleon Bonaparte, the new ruler of France, offered to sell the Louisiana Territory.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Marbury v. Madison was the first significant decision handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court after John Marshall was sworn in as its Chief Justice in 1801:
“It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart-
ment to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity [explain] and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each....”
What was Marshall’s decision? Do you agree with his decision?
-fc Why was the court ruling in Marbury v. Madison of such importance?
THE EMBARGO ACT OF
1807 War continued to rage between Britain and France. British ships started stopping U.S. ships to search for deserters from the British navy. Sometimes they took Americans to serve on British ships. This practice of impressment {forced military service) greatly humiliated Americans and put pressure on President Jefferson to take action.
To avoid war, Jefferson pushed the Embargo Act through Congress. Under the act, American ships were prohibited from trading with European nations. In the last days of Jefferson’s Presidency, Congress replaced the Embargo Act with the Non-Intercourse Act (1809). This act lifted the embargo on U.S. shipping except for ships bound for British or French ports.

CHAPTER 10: The Early Republic, 1789-1828	183
After Jefferson served two terms as President, he followed the precedent set by Washington and stepped down from the Presidency. His good friend and fellow Democratic-Republican, James Madison, became the nation’s fourth President in 1809. Three years later, Americans were drawn into another war with Great Britain in 1812. This war is known as the War of 1812, or the “Second War for Independence.”
CAUSES OF THE CONFLICT
Ever since 1793, France and Britain had been continuously at war against each other with only one short break. Americans continued to trade with Europe, but tried to keep out of the war between these two nations. However, British ships continued to stop American ships and to seize (or impress) U.S. sailors. Some British troops in Canada also encouraged Native American Indians to attack American settlements. At the same time, several young Congressmen thought the time was ripe to seize Canada from the British, who were fighting Napoleon in Europe. In 1812, President Madison asked Congress to declare war on Britain.
MAIN EVENTS OF THE WAR
American forces tried to invade Canada, but they were unsuccessful. In retaliation, British troops temporarily occupied Washington, D.C. and burned down the White House. Madison’s wife, Dolley Madison, acted quickly to remove paintings and other valuables from the White House before the British arrived.
Much of the fighting during the War of 1812 took place on the Great Lakes and in upstate New York. In 1813,
British troops further retaliated for the attack on Canada by burning the American settlement at Buffalo. Meanwhile,
American and British ships clashed in the Battle of Lake Erie.
In December 1814, a peace treaty was finally signed between Britain and the United States. This agreement actually left things much as they had been before the war. The British prom-
ised they would no longer search American ships for British deserters. Americans promised to respect British rule in Canada. Americans felt they had proved they could protect their independence. Communications from Europe were so slow that the bloodiest battle of the war was actually fought after the treaty was signed. General Andrew Jackson defeated the British at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815.
CHAPTER 10: The Early Republic, 1789-1828	185
CLAY'S "AMERICAN SYSTEM"
In these years, Americans cooperated to improve their transportation routes by building roads and canals. Henry Clay, a spokesman for moderate policies, sought to resolve differences between the North and South while representing the nationalist outlook of the West. Clay proposed his “American System” to Congress.
His system consisted of a high tariff {tax on imports) to protect American manufactured goods from competition with cheaper British products. Clay then proposed that the revenues collected from the tariff should be used to pay for internal improvements, such as new roads and canals, in the West. In this
way, Clay hoped his American System would bind the industrial Henry Clay 777~1852'> East and the agrarian West together. Despite Clay’s good intentions, the American System never went into effect. The national system of internal improvements was never adequately funded by Congress; the failure to provide funds was due in part to sectional jealousies and a belief that such spending was never provided for in the Constitution.
THE ERIE CANAL
In the early 1800s, it was easier and cheaper to ship goods by water than by land. In 1816, the Governor of New York proposed a 360-mile canal connecting Lake Erie to the Hudson River. Farmers could then ship goods from the Great Lakes to New York City entirely by water. After a long and heated debate, state lawmakers voted to build the canal.
The Erie Canal was the most ambitious project ever constructed up to that time. A path 50 feet wide had to be cut through forests, swamps, and hills. Then a ditch 40 feet wide and 4 feet deep had to be dug. The canal was an important modification of the physical environment. Without the heavy equipment we have today, thousands of workers were needed to cut trees, rip out tree stumps, blast through rock, and dig the canal. One out of every four workers was Irish. At the peak of construction, more than four thousand workers were laboring on the canal. Canal workers earned about $10 a month in 1832.

GIBBONS v. OGDEN (1824)
During this period, the Supreme Court encouraged the growth of a national market by its decision in the case of Gibbons v. Ogden.
Background. Ogden had been granted a monopoly by New York State to operate a steamboat between New York and New Jersey. Gibbons was granted a similar license by the federal government. Ogden sued to stop Gibbons from competing with him. Gibbons appealed to the Supreme Court.
Decision / Significance. Marshall ruled that Congress could regulate ferry boats crossing the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey as part of its power under the Constitution to control “interstate commerce” {trade between states). Only the federal government, according to the U.S. Constitution, could regulate interstate commerce, including activities affecting interstate commerce. This established the federal government’s right to regulate anything that involves commerce between the states. It set the stage for future expansion of Congressional power over other activities once thought to be under the control of the states.
THE PURCHASE OF FLORIDA
(1819) The border between Spanish colonial territory and the United States was a source of heated debate with Spain. Plagued by many problems, Spain feared losing Florida without compensation. Spanish leaders therefore chose to negotiate a settlement. The United States agreed to purchase Florida in 1819 for $5 million. It also agreed to recognize Spanish sovereignty over Texas.
McCULLOCH v. MARYLAND (1819)
Another key decision by Chief Justice John Marshall was McCulloch v. Maryland. This case also tested the relationship between state and federal law.
Background. In 1818, the Maryland legislature imposed a tax on the Maryland branch of the Second National Bank. The National Bank was unpopular since it competed with state banks. Maryland legislators hoped that state taxes on the federal bank would shut down the Maryland branch. James McCulloch, the federal bank’s cashier, did not pay the taxes the Maryland law required, and Maryland sued for payment. After the state of Maryland won the dispute in its own courts, the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Decision/Significance. The case presented two key issues: (1) Does Congress have the power to create a bank, even though that power is not specifically mentioned in the Constitution? (2) Does Maryland have the power to tax an institution of the federal government? Marshall ruled that Congress could indeed charter a national bank, since this would help Congress carry out its other powers. Marshall said that the “necessary and proper” clause {elastic clause) in the Constitution gives Congress all those powers needed to carry out its powers listed in the Constitution. He also said that since the federal government had the right to establish the bank, Maryland had no right to interfere by taxing it.

THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE OF
1820 The American Revolution and the Constitutional Convention had failed to resolve the issue of slavery in America. George Washington had freed his own slaves on his death, but Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, had not. Many early American leaders had imagined that slavery would just gradually die out. However, the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in 1793 made it easier for unskilled slaves
to remove seeds from the type of cotton that grew in the South. This invention led to the spread of slavery in the South. The factories of England and the Northern United States kept up the demand for raw cotton. With the purchase of the Louisiana Territory, the issue of slavery again came into sharp focus. Should the territories of the Louisiana Purchase enter the Union as free or slave states?
THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE
1820 Henry Clay engineered a compromise in which slavery was forbidden in the Louisiana Territory north of the “Missouri Compromise Line” (3 6° 30"), except Missouri. One free state (Maine) and one slave state (Missouri) were admitted to the Union at the same time to keep the balance between free and slave states in the Senate.
THE MONROE DOCTRINE
James Monroe fought in the American Revolution, helped negotiate the Lousiana Purchase, and served as Secretary of State under President Madison. In 1817, Monroe became President. In 1823 in his annual message to Congress, Monroe issued a bold statement on foreign policy. He repeated the nation’s longstanding commitment to neutrality and offered a warning to Europe. The American and French Revolutions had inspired people in Latin America to be free. During the Napoleonic Wars, Spain had been cut off from its colonies. The Spanish colonists grew accustomed to self-government. When Spain’s king was restored, he tried to reassert control. Colonists in Latin America then declared their independence. Later, it was feared that France would help Spain reconquer her colonies.
Monroe announced that the United States would oppose any attempts by European powers to establish new colonies or to restore Spanish rule in countries in the Western Hemisphere that had achieved their independence.

CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 199
A.
Andrew Jackson, a popular military hero, accused John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay of stealing the election of 1824 by a “corrupt bargain.” B.
Jackson was elected President in 1828. He saw himself as the representative of the “common man” and invited the public to attend his inauguration. C.
In these years, state governments ended property requirements for voting, allowing all adult white males to vote. Political parties adopted new tactics to reach more voters: popular rallies, parades, and nominating conventions. D.
Jackson favored the “spoils systems”— replacing government officials with his own supporters. This policy gave more citizens a role in government and prevented the creation of a permanent class of government officials. E.
Jackson proposed the Indian Removal Act in 1830. The act required the Indians to adopt Western ways or move West. The Cherokees refused to do so and appealed their case to the Supreme Court. John Marshall ruled in their favor. In Worcester r. Georgia, the Court again ruled in favor of the Cherokees. This could not prevent Jackson from removing the Cherokees. The delay in their move led to thousands of Cherokee deaths along the “Trail of Tears.” F.
Southerners opposed the Tariff of Abominations and the Tariff of 1832. John C. Calhoun wrote that a state had the right to nullify within its borders a federal law it believed was unconstitutional. In 1832, South Carolina threatened to secede but backed down when President Jackson threatened to use force. G.
Jackson opposed the Second National Bank, which he felt favored the rich in the North. He withdrew government funds and refused to renew its charter. H.
The American free enterprise system is based on respect for private property, minimal government interference in the economy, and the free interaction of producers and consumers. Prices are set by the interaction of consumer demand and the available supply from producers. I.
The Industrial Revolution started in the 1760s in Britain and spread to the United States. It began in the textile industry, but soon transferred to other industries. Work shifted from homes to factories, where workers could be supervised and where water and steam power could be used to run machines. J.
The Age of Jackson was a period of reform. Protestant preachers traveled the countryside and preached for days at camp meetings in the Second Great Awakening. Abolitionists sought to end slavery. Dorothea Dix campaigned to improve conditions in mental hospitals. Other reformers belonged to the Temperance Movement, which sought to ban the drinking of alcohol. K.
During this period, women met at the Seneca Falls Convention (1848) where they demanded equality with men, including the right to vote. L.
This period was also a golden age of literature and art, with such prominent writers as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and Edgar Alan Poe, and the painters of the Hudson River School, including Thomas Cole. Name_______________________________________________
CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 201
THE AGE OF JACKSON
A native of Tennessee, Andrew Jackson was not bom to wealth. He defeated British forces at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. Later, he spent several years fighting Native American Indians in Georgia and Florida. After his defeat in the election of 1824, Jackson and his supporters spent the next four years campaigning for the Presidency. They introduced new campaign tactics, like popular rallies, parades, and nominating conventions.
The Age of the "Common Man." Jackson was finally elected President in 1828. His supporters were the “common people” — laborers, farmers, and frontiersmen. Jackson saw himself as the spokesman of the “common man” — the average American.
The Inauguration. Jackson invited the public to visit the White House for his inauguration.
A crowd of 20,000 people, many in muddy boots, passed through the building. Some broke glassware and china dishes in their struggle to get refreshments.
The Expansion of Democracy.
Jackson’s two terms in office saw an expansion of American democracy. This was a time in which state governments were changing their requirements for voting.
When the republic was founded,
most states required white adult males to own some property in order to vote. Now, these property qualification were lifted.
DEMOCRATIC CHANGES UNDER JACKSON
Voting Rights.
In the 1820s, states eliminated the requirement that voters own property, so that most white males over 21 could vote.
Choosing a President.
Selection of Presidential candidates by party leaders was replaced by nominating conventions, where popularly elected members of each political party chose their candidates.
Campaign Methods.
With increased numbers of voters, new campaign methods emerged. Candidates held dinners, rallies, and public meetings. Jackson invited ordinary people to his inauguration.

The "Spoils System." Jackson believed the President should act as the voice of the common people. To make government more responsive to popular needs, Jackson favored the “spoils system. ’ Supporters who helped in his election campaign were appointed to government posts in place of existing officials.

CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 203
Based on their accomplishments, the Cherokees rejected Jackson’s proposal. When the State of Georgia tried to remove them, the Cherokees took their case to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, they claimed they were an “independent” nation, protected by treaty. John Marshall held that the tribe was a “dependent” nation subject to federal, not state, law. The Cherokees won their case, but Jackson was determined to remove them anyway. He concluded a treaty with some Cherokee tribe members, giving them two years to relocate to Oklahoma.
Worcester k Georgia, Meanwhile, Georgia passed a law in 1830, stating that any white person living among Indians without a license from the governor would be sent to prison. State legislators feared white missionaries were encouraging Indians to resist removal. Samuel Worcester, a missionary, was arrested and sentenced to prison for four years for living among the Cherokees. Worcester sued to obtain his freedom. His case came before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1832.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In Worcester v. Georgia, John Marshall freed Worcester and declared:
“The Cherokee Nation is a distinct community, occupying its own territory, with boundaries accurately described, in which
the laws of Georgia can have no force, and the citizens of Georgia have no right to enter without the [permission] of the Cherokees themselves. The whole [relationship] between the United States and this nation is, by our Constitution and laws, [placed] in the government of the United States. The act of Georgia under which the plaintiff was prosecuted is void.... The acts of Georgia are [against] the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States.”
Based on this excerpt, why did the U.S. Supreme Court free Worcester?
Cherokee leaders delayed moving. Ironically, because of this legal delay, the Cherokees were now forced to move in late fall and winter, when the weather had turned bitterly cold.
In 1837, federal troops were called in to escort 16,000 Cherokees to their new home in Indian Territory. One-fourth of them died from exposure, starvation, and fevers, during the march along the 800-mile journey, known as the “Trail of Tears.”
The “Trail of Tears” journey of the Cherokee.
CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 205
Webster also pointed out that the Constitution assigned the task of determining a law’s constitutionality to the Supreme Court, not to the states. He ended his speech with the stirring words: “Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.”
Several months later, the nation learned President Jackson’s views when he confronted his Vice President, John C. Calhoun, with a toast to “Our federal Union — it must be preserved.” Calhoun replied with a toast to “the Union — next to our liberty, most dear.”
South Carolina Threatens Secession. In 1832, a new tariff lowered duties by ten percent. South Carolina, believing the tariff was still too high, put Calhoun’s nullification theory into practice. A state convention passed a law, the Ordinance of Nullification, voiding the tariff, banning the collection of its duties in South Carolina, and threatening to secede from the Union if the federal government tried to enforce it.
President Jackson immediately spoke out against nullification, calling it nothing more than treason. He acted quickly by dispatching U.S. naval ships to Charleston harbor and ordered that federal fortifications there be strengthened. To bolster Jackson, Congress responded with the Force Bill, giving the President the power to use military force against South Carolina. Jackson also issued a warning in his “Proclamation to the People of South Carolina,” which called resistance to federal law a form of treason.
Henry Clay finally proposed a compromise through a reduction in tariffs over the next ten years. Faced with the use of federal troops, South Carolina withdrew its nullification law and averted a national crisis. Jackson showed that, despite his support for states’ rights, he would use force to preserve the Union.
JACKSON DECLARES WAR ON THE BANK
President Washington had introduced a National Bank as part of Hamilton’s financial plan. A Second National Bank had been chartered in 1816. Jackson greatly disliked the National Bank. He thought it gave an unfair monopoly to wealthy moneyed interests in the Northeast.
Although the Bank was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court in McCulloch v. Maryland, Jackson set out to eliminate it. When Jackson was reelected President in 1832, he ordered the removal of all federal deposits from the National Bank. This massive withdrawal of funds had the effect of crippling the National Bank. Jackson ordered these funds to be placed in state banks, which he felt were more agreeable to lending money to farmers. When it came up for renewal, Jackson refused to renew the National Bank’s charter. Although many Americans admired Jackson, others thought he was far too dictatorial in the way he handled the bank and other matters.

CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 209

Before the Industrial Revolution, weavers and craftsmen worked at home, spinning wool, cotton and linen by hand into finished cloth. This was known as the domestic system. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the 1760s. Britain already enjoyed many advantages, including a powerful middle class, a colonial empire to supply it with raw materials, plentiful coal to run its machines, and a prosperous agriculture in which fewer people were needed to work on farms.
NEW INVENTIONS PROPEL CHANGE
Two important British inventions helped trigger the Industrial Revolution. The spinning jenny (1764) allowed several threads to be spun at once, permitting many threads to be made quickly and inexpensively. James Watt’s improved steam engine (1769) made steam power available for mechanical purposes. Steam power could be used to drive many machines at once. The steam engine led in turn to the construction of large factories, the invention of the steamboat, and the development of railroad trains.
THE SHIFT FROM HOME TO FACTORY
You have already learned that in the 1790s, Samuel Slater had begun producing cotton thread by machine in a factory in New England. In Massachusetts, Francis Cabot Lowell (1775-1817), a successful merchant, and other investors built new factories during the War of 1812. In factories, workers could be supervised and could use machines driven by w.ater or steam power, resulting in increased production. As the production of textiles and other goods increased, their prices fell.
A young female Lowell factory worker.
With lower prices, consumer demand rose for textiles. People could now afford factory-made clothes. Producers were able to produce for mass markets at home and internationally, not just for a few local customers. As demand grew, more and more factories were built, employing ever larger machines and greater numbers of workers. These changes set in motion the chain reaction known as the Industrial Revolution:

CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 211
THE NATURE OF WORK
The mass production of goods in factories required new work habits. Pre-industrial craftsmen had worked at home and performed a variety of tasks. They could divide their time between tasks as they wished. Factory work was tedious and monotonous: workers, including children, often performed the same simple task for 12 hours each day. Factory work was also highly disciplined: workers had to arrive at the factory on time and pay close attention to their work throughout the day. In 1820, there were only 350,000 factory workers in the United States; by 1860, there were already two million.
THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN
During these years, women were an important part of the workforce. Farm women had to work in the fields as well as cook, clean, make clothes, and care for their children. Other women worked outside the home as servants, laundresses, cooks, or factory workers. With the rise of industry, even more women found work outside the home. For example, the Lowell factories in New England employed young single women as workers.
Children were expected to respect and obey their parents. Often they worked on the farm, in addition to helping with household chores. With the rise of industry, some children worked long hours in mines and factories. Industrial society also required more educated leaders and managers. People became more aware of childhood as a distinct stage of life, with its own special needs.

The period from the 1820s to the Civil War witnessed the growth of several new reform movements. The spread of “Jacksonian Democracy,” as well as the new challenges of industrialization, helped stimulate these movements.
RELIGIOUS REVIVAL:
THE "SECOND GREAT AWAKENING"
There was a revival of strong religious feelings, sometimes called the “Second Great Awakening.” Methodists, Baptists and other Protestant groups held outdoor religious services and won new converts.
CHAPTER 11: The Age of Jackson 213
Eliza Farnham was the warden of a women’s prison in New York State in the 1840s. She believed in treating prisoners fairly. She allowed prisoners to talk, opened a prison library, and established a school inside the prison to teach prisoners to read and write.
IMPROVED TREATMENT FOR MENTAL ILLNESS
In the 1800s, most people lacked the knowledge needed to care for those with mental illness. Many mentally ill patients were locked in unheated rooms, chained to their beds and beaten into obedience. Some were even sent to jail. Dorothea Dix (1802-1887) led the fight for better treatment of the mentally ill. Dix was distressed to learn that they were often housed with criminals or abused. Her report to the state legislature of Massachusetts revealed these shocking conditions. Dix toured other states to report on their treatment of the mentally ill. Dix also campaigned for general prison reform. Some states established separate buildings to house those with mental disorders. These patients were permitted to work outdoors and to enjoy recreation. Further improvements in treatment were delayed until mental illness was better understood in the next century.
Dorothea Dix
TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT
Many Americans worried that drinking alcoholic beverages ruined people’s health, disrupted family life, led to unemployment, and promoted “ungodly” behavior. Some Protestant preachers denounced drinking alcohol as a sin. In 1826, the American Temperance Society was founded. Its chief objective changed from moderation to total abstinence from alcoholic drinks. In
851, Maine became the first state to ban drinking of alcohol.
Excessive drinking was considered a serious social issue.
ICATION:
COMMON SCHOOL MOVEMENT
Industrial Revolution, most American children received little formal schooling, 'ldren were taught reading, writing, arithmetic, foreign languages, and prayers futor. Reformers like Horace Mann of Massachusetts fought to provide free "ary school to every child. He and other reformers insisted that elementary both free and compulsory. These reformers wanted American children of mix together in the same common schools. Mann also introduced the
teachers.

His Birds of America, containing life-sized portraits of 1,065 individual birds, is the most important work on birds ever published. Audubon’s works in pastel show what American wildlife and woodlands were like before the spread of human settlement. Audubon was also responsible for the discovery of many new species of North American birds and mammals. His influence on birds and natural history was far reaching. Most later works about birds were in some way inspired by his artistry. Despite a few errors in his observations, Audubon’s notes make up one of the most important contributions to our understanding of the anatomy and behavior of birds.

CHAPTER 12: Manifest Destiny and the Rise of Sectionalism
227
A.
The United States expanded westward to the Pacific Ocean by acquiring a series of new territories. These territories included the Louisiana Purchase, the purchase of Florida, the annexation of Texas, the acquisition of part of the Oregon Territory, the Mexican Cession, and the Gadsden Purchase. B.
Americans came to believe it was their fate, or “Manifest Destiny,” to occupy North America from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Manifest Destiny had political, economic, and social roots. Americans felt they needed these territories to be secure against foreign powers and that these lands would bring new wealth. Finally, Americans believed God had ordained them to occupy the West. C.
By the mid-nineteenth century, the nation consisted of three different regions or “sections.” Many Americans felt greater loyalty to their section than to the country as a whole. This strong regional loyalty was known as sectionalism. D.
The North was the most industrialized. Factory workers produced manufactured goods. Farmers raised livestock to supply food to towns and cities. Railroads connected natural resources with factories and consumers. E.
The West became the “breadbasket” of the country, growing wheat and other crops. Cities developed on the banks of the Great Lakes and along major rivers. F.
The South was transformed by the invention of the cotton gin and the growing demand for cotton by English and Northern factories. Plantation owners grew, harvested, and shipped cotton with large forces of slaves. Ge Immigrants contributed to both economic and demographic growth in this period. Irish immigrants came to escape the famine in Ireland. German immigrants came to escape political repression. Many Irish settled in cities in the Northeast, while Germans often settled in Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.
H.
Northern states abolished slavery. Some Southern slaves were freed by their owners and became free blacks. Most moved to the North. I.
Abolitionists wanted to abolish slavery. William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Tubman were leading abolitionists. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin revealed the brutality and violence of slave life. J.
Some slaves escaped slavery in the South on the Underground Railroad. K.
Henry David Thoreau developed the strategy of civil disobedience, refusing to obey laws a citizen believed to be unjust. Slavery apologists, like John C. Calhoun, argued that slavery was justified by the Bible. L.
The struggle over slavery focused on the issue of its extension into new territories. Southerners feared the North would take control of Congress and abolish slavery. Under the Compromise of 1850, California was admitted as a free state, and the Fugitive Slave Law was greatly strengthened. M.
The system of compromise started to breakdown when the Kansas-Nebraska Act let settlers decide if they wanted slavery, adding violence to the issue. N.
The Republican Party was founded against the further spread of slavery. O.
The Dred Scott decision, holding that African Americans had no right to citizenship, and that Congress could not limit slave owners’ control of their property, ended the possibility of further compromise of the issue. Name ________________________________________________

OREGON TERRITORY
(1846) In 1818, Great Britain and the United States had agreed to joint control of the Oregon Territory, which reached as far north as the latitude 54° 40'. In the 1840s, large numbers of pioneers began moving along the Oregon Trail to the fertile Wil-liamette Valley in Oregon.
Thousands caught “Oregon Fever.” Groups crossed the 2,000-mile trail in covered wagons. After crossing the Rocky Mountains, most of
these pioneers moved to Oregon, but some moved southwest to California — then still a part of Mexico. The trail was often treacherous — over deserts, rivers, and mountains — and more than 20,000 people died along the route.
THE MORMONS IN UTAH
The Mormons were founded in upstate New York in 1830 by Joseph Smith, at the time of the “Second Great Awakening.” They moved from New York to Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois, but were driven out of these states because of their unique religious beliefs, which included marrying several wives. In 1847, their leader, Brigham Young, led them westward by covered wagon to the Great Salt Lake in Utah, a seemingly desolate and barren region in the Great Basin, which

could be cultivated only through irrigation. Here they found comfort in their isolation. By the time of Young’s death in 1877, 125,000 Mormons lived in Utah.
THE ANNEXATION OF TEXAS
(1845) In the 1820s, a group of Americans reached an agreement with the government of Mexico to settle in the region of Mexico known as “Texas.” As the number of Anglo-American settlers increased, the Mexican government feared losing control of the area. In 1830, the Mexican government announced a law prohibiting additional settlers from immigrating to Texas from the United States.

A joint Congressional resolution stated that if any new states were to be created out of the lands of Texas, those north of the “Missouri Compromise Line” should enter as free states, while those south of the line should choose whether or not to permit slavery. Many Americans feared that the annexation of Texas, with its boundaries in dispute, was likely to lead to war with Mexico. Northern critics suspected that the whole project was being carried out in the interests of slavery.
U.S.-MEXICAN WAR
(1846-1848) Shortly after Texas was annexed, a dispute broke out between the United States and Mexico over the southern border of Texas. Was the border to be the Rio Grande or the Nueces River? President Polk ordered troops into the contested area.
Hoping to use the incident to extend America’s borders, Polk declared war on Mexico. Americans living in California also rebelled and declared their independence. U.S. troops landed in Mexico and marched to Mexico City. Mexico was defeated and forced to give up California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and parts of Colorado and New Mexico. In the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States agreed to pay Mexico $15 million for these areas, known as the Mexican Cession.
In the Mexican-American War, more than 1,700 Americans were killed.
GADSDEN PURCHASE
(1853) In 1853, the United States completed its expansion in the Southwest with the Gadsden Purchase. This small slice of territory was purchased from Mexico for $10 million. President Franklin Pierce was anxious to insure U.S. possession of the area. As the railroad age progressed, business-oriented Southerners saw that a railroad linking the South with the Pacific Coast would greatly expand trade opportunities.
The area was seen as the most practicable route for a southern
railroad to the Pacific. James Gadsden, U.S. minister to Mexico, was responsible for negotiating the deal.

Many women and children worked in factories. In 1840, the federal government agreed to the ten-hour workday on public projects. A few states also passed ten-hour workday laws.
THE WEST
The Appalachians had once posed an obstacle to the opening of lands further west, but the availability of cheap land and construction of the National Road and canals opened the region to settlers. Pioneers carried their possessions in Conestoga wagons. After the construction of the Erie Canal, farmers could send their produce up the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes, over the Erie Canal and down the Hudson River to New York City. The Midwest, with its flat land and fertile soil, became the main producer of grains like wheat and com. Farmers began using machines like the mechanical plow, reaper, and thrasher. The West replaced the North as the nation’s “Bread Basket” — growing com and wheat, and milling flour.
By the mid-1800s, the number of settlers moving to the West (now the Midwest) had increased rapidly. The desire for land and new opportunities continued to fuel westward expansion. The region’s fertile soil attracted many farmers. Removal of the Native Americans to lands west of the Mississippi greatly accelerated westward settlement. All along major rivers, towns like Pittsburgh, Louisville, St. Louis, and Memphis sprang up. Ohio soon had more residents than Massachusetts.
Settlers moving west with a Conestoga wagon.
Settlers to the West set about clearing the land and preparing it to grow crops.
The attraction of the West was more than just farmland for settlers — the lure of timber, gold, silver and grazing lands was an important motive for many to endure the hardships of the region. White settlers poured across the Mississippi to establish ranches, dig mines, and farm the land. Some free blacks also came West, convinced that economic prosperity could be found there.
What role did geography play in helping to make the North and West different? What role did technological advances play in helping to shape each of these regions?

THE SOUTH
At the time of the Constitutional Convention, it appeared that slavery in the United States would gradually die out. The prices of tobacco, rice, and indigo were falling, and planters in Virginia were introducing wheat, which did not require slave labor. Thomas Jefferson denounced slavery as despotism, although he did not free his own slaves.
Impact of the Cotton Gin. In 1792, however, the inventor Eli Whitney developed the cotton gin — a machine that combed through cotton and separated out the seeds. One machine could do the work of fifty workers separating the seeds by hand. As a result of this invention, cotton cultivation became profitable. Plantation owners began using more slaves, and the price of slaves more than doubled almost overnight. Over the next forty years, the plantation system and cultivation of “King Cotton” spread throughout the South. It was hard to satisfy the enormous demand for raw cotton from the factories of the Northeast and England.
In Jacksonian times, the South actually had a variety of economies based on its geographic diversity. In the Piedmont and Appalachian regions of Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, families were mainly subsistence farmers, who may have grown a few cash crops. Few farmers had slaves. On the Atlantic Coastal Plain, however, plantation owners used slave labor to grow cotton, rice, and tobacco for export to Northern cities and European markets. Major Southern cities, like New Orleans and Charleston, served as ports for shipping Southern exports.

What relationship do you see between these two graphs?
An over-emphasis on the cultivation of cotton and other cash crops led some Southern states to ignore improvements in industry and transportation. Southern plantations often exhausted the soil, fell into debt, and failed to develop new technologies. The South fell behind the North in the number of railroads, factories, and schools. Southern cities generally remained small and lacked industry.

CHAPTER 12: Manifest Destiny and the Rise of Sectionalism 239
Despite their horrible living and working conditions, many slaves held onto their rich African heritage through music, religion, and folklore. Many also resisted slavery by not cooperating, by escaping, committing sabotage or theft. In some cases, open rebellion was carried out. Nat Turner’s Rebellion in 1831 caused a wave of fear among slave owners. The uprising terrorized white Southerners. As a result, Southern lawmakers passed stricter regulations, tightly controlling the activities of both enslaved and free blacks.
THE FREE BLACKS
Benjamin Franklin and others organized an end to slavery in Pennsylvania, which became the first state to abolish it in 1780. Most other Northern states passed laws gradually eliminating slavery, while many Southern states then passed laws making it easier for slave owners to free individual slaves.
After the American Revolution, thousands of slaves were freed. In 1800, there were already 100,000 free blacks in the United States, while by 1810, three-quarters of the African Americans in the North were free. On the eve of the Civil War, about ten percent of African Americans in the United States, about a half a million people, were free.
Even free blacks however, lived in an atmosphere of racial prejudice. Some stayed in Southern cities where they became skilled craftsmen. A large number moved to the North, especially to port towns, where they worked in dockyards or opened shops in their own neighborhoods. Free African Americans also opened their own churches, which became centers for education and community life. Discrimination against free blacks increased as white workers began facing new competition from immigrant laborers. In the South, free blacks had few legal rights.
By the mid-1800s, each of these sections of the country had developed its own distinctive way of life. These differences led to sectionalism — the greater loyalty many Americans felt toward their own section than to the country as a whole. In particular, Southerners felt their way of life was being threatened by the North. Northerners feared the South wanted to spread slavery throughout the nation. The North’s focus was on business and industry, as they concentrated on manufacturing, shipping, and trading goods. By contrast, the South’s economy centered around plantations, cash crops, and steady agricultural growth.

Frederick Douglass (1818-1895)
Abolitionists believed that slavery was morally wrong and wanted to end it. In the decades leading up to the Civil War, abolitionist leaders were men and women of high moral purpose and courage who sought to make the issue of slavery a focus of national politics. At first, most abolitionists were widely denounced. Mobs sometimes attacked them even in the North. Southerners burned antislavery pamphlets and excluded them from the mails. The U.S. Congress imposed the “gag rule” to avoid considering abolitionist petitions. John Quincy Adams, who had returned to Congress after his term as President, spent much of the final years of his political life fighting against this gag rule.
In 1833, the British Empire abolished slavery. By 1838, more than 1,350 antislavery societies existed in the United States with almost 250,000 members. The book Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1853) by Harriet Beecher Stowe depicted the evils of slavery and stirred the public conscience of the North.
William Lloyd Garrison and other abolitionists, including former slaves Harriet Tubmann and Frederick Douglass, published anti-slavery writings and delivered speeches throughout the North. They were also active in the “Underground Railroad,” which helped many fugitive slaves to escape to Canada.
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879)
William Lloyd Garrison was a prominent abolitionist who started his own newspaper, The Liberator, in 1831. The passage below appeared in Vol. 1, No. 1:
“I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject [abolition of slavery] I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation. No! No! Tell a man whose house is on fire, to give a moderate alarm; tell the mother to gradually [pull] her baby from the fire into which it has fallen; — but urge me not to use moderation in this cause. I will not [hesitate] — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD. The apathy of the people is enough to make every statue leap from its pedestal, and to hasten the resurrection of the dead....”

Escaping along the Underground Railroad.
The Underground Railroad. Some slaves escaped from the South with the help of the Underground Railroad — a vast network of people who helped fugitive slaves escape to the North or Canada (where slavery had been abolished). People allowed the escaping fugitives to rest in their bams, cellars, or houses.
These safe places were called “stations.”
The fugitive slaves usually moved by foot at night, helped on their journey by a “conductor.” They took advantage of the protection offered by nature, by hiding in swamps, bayous, forests, and waterways. They would
generally travel 10 to 20 miles, until they reached the next station. There they would rest and eat, hiding in bams and other out-of-the-way places until they moved on to the next station. Some runaways sought refuge in cities such as Baltimore and New Orleans, where they tried to blend in with free blacks living there.

HISTORIAN____________________________t This passage by Frederick Douglass was taken from his book, My Escape from Slavery. Douglass was a gifted writer and speaker. In this passage, he describes his escape from slavery and how dehumanizing slavery was:
“Though I was not a murderer fleeing from justice, I felt perhaps quite as miserable as such a criminal. The train was moving at a very high rate of speed for that [period] of railroad travel, but to my anxious mind it was moving far too slowly. Minutes were hours, and hours were days during this part of my flight. After Maryland, I was to pass through Delaware — another slave state, where slave-catchers awaited their prey, for it was not in the interior of the state, but its borders, that these human hounds were most vigilant and active. The border lines between slavery and freedom were the dangerous ones for the fugitives....”
Why did Douglass fear when he came to a border crossing?

CHAPTER 12: Manifest Destiny and the Rise of Sectionalism 247
Founding of the Republican Party (1854). Critics of the Kansas-Nebraska Act formed a new political party, the Republican Party. Republicans agreed to let slavery continue in the South, but they opposed any further extension of slavery into any of the new territories.
Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857). A Southern slave, Dred Scott, was taken by his owner to the North and then back into slavery in the South. Scott sued for his freedom. Having been on free soil, he argued that he could not be taken back into slavery.
Decision/Significance. In 1857, Chief Justice Roger Taney read the Supreme Court’s decision As a “descendant of African bom slaves,” Dred Scott was declared to be a non-citizen, and therefore was not entitled to bring a lawsuit before the court. Taney further asserted that Africans could never become U.S. citizens since Africans were not included when the Constitution was written. Taney then ruled that slaves were property, and that Congress had no right to take away a slaveholder’s property. This meant that Congress could not lawfully prohibit slavery in new territories: since slavery was still legal, the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was unconstitutional. Chief Justice Taney’s ruling meant that slavery could spread.
Dred Scott
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR.
HISTORIAN_________________________________t In 1857, 80-year-old Chief Justice Taney was a Southern supporter of slavery who was intent on protecting Southerners from attacks by abolitionists. In delivering the Court’s majority opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford, he said:
“[African Americans] had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit. He was bought and sold and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise, whenever profit could be made by it. [Referring to language in the Declaration of Independence] it is too clear for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed and adopted this declaration....”
Most abolitionists were enraged at this decision, but Frederick Douglass found a bright side, believing that the decision would bring slavery to the attention of the nation and would be a step toward its ultimate destruction. Was Douglass justified in his optimism about the case?
Lincoln-Douglas Debates. The Dred Scott decision questioned the power of Congress to control the spread of slavery. In 1858, Lincoln challenged Senator Stephen Douglas, author of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, to a series of formal debates. Douglas had introduced the doctrine of popular sovereignty to the slavery question.

THE ELECTION OF
1860 By the late 1850s, deep divisions existed among Americans over the future of the nation, and especially over the institution of slavery. In the Presidential election of 1860, the Republican Party nominated the former U.S. Representative from Illinois, Abraham Lincoln. “Honest Abe” ran on a platform that opposed the extension of slavery in the territories but not the system of slavery in the South.
Democrats could not agree on a candidate. Northern and Southern Democrats chose separate candidates. The split in their party allowed Lincoln to win the election with only 39% of the popular vote. Lincoln did not campaign in the South, and not surprisingly, did not win a single Southern state.
Lincoln as he looked after winning the 1860 election.
CHAPTER 13: The Civil War, 1861-1865	261
Three weeks after Davis spoke, Lincoln responded to the challenge posed by the secession in his First Inaugural Address.
Lincoln reassured Southerners that he would not interfere with slavery in the South. But he warned that the Constitution was based on the idea that “the Union of these states is perpetual” and that “no state can lawfully get out of the Union.”
Thus, he would do his utmost to preserve the Union, by force if necessary. He denied Jefferson Davis’ claim that Southern states had a lawful right to leave it. He further stated that even if the Constitution were
taken to be a simple contract, it could not be legally cancelled without an agreement between all the states, both North and South. He saw the Union as a union of people, not states.
March 1861, Lincoln delivers his First Inaugural Address.
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
When Lincoln delivered his Inaugural Address, thousands came, not just to see the new President, but to hear what he had to say about the crisis facing the nation. Part of his address was a direct appeal to the seceding Southern states:
“... In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you. You can have no conflict, without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to ‘preserve, protect and defend’ it.... We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”
What message was Lincoln giving to Southern states in his address? -fc How did his views on the Union differ from those of Jefferson Davis?
FIRING ON FORT SUMTER
Fort Sumter was a federal fort in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. The garrison of federal troops stationed there was running out of food and supplies and had no way of obtaining these onshore after South Carolina seceded.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Look at the following four viewpoints on the causes of the Civil War. Three of them are from primary sources from the time of the Civil War. The fourth one provides the views of a modem historian.

Stephens Confederate Vice-President		Sumner's Speech
"Thomas Jefferson's ideas rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error.... Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are Laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery — subordination to the superior race — is his natural and normal condition." — Alexander Stephens, Confederate Vice-President March 1861.		"[T]here are two [causes] to this war. One is slavery and the other is state rights. If slavery were out of the way, there would be no trouble from state rights. The war is for slavery, nothing else. [The South] seeks to install this barbarism as the truest civilization. Slavery is declared to be the 'corner-stone' of their new [structure]." — Republican Senator Charles Sumner, in a speech delivered in July 1863.
		
Lincoln's Speech		A Modern Historian
"My object in this struggle is to save the Union, .... If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and Leaving others alone I would also do that.... I here state my purpose ... and I intend no modification of my often expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free." — President Abraham Lincoln in a speech delivered in August 1862		"If the North fought to uphold the justice, power and authority of the federal government, the opposite, many assume, must be that the South fought for the power of the states. But the equation did not balance in that way: the North did not fight at first to end slavery, but the South did fight to protect slavery. It is vital that we grasp this truth ... before it fades even further from view." — Edward Ayers, Professor of History, University of Richmond, April 2011
Based on these viewpoints, write a short essay of one page on what you see as the main causes of the Civil War. Refer to at least two of these documents In your essay.
CHAPTER 13: The Civil War, 1861-1865	265
For the next four years, Americans were engaged in the bloodiest conflict in their history. Southerners were fighting to defend their independence and preserve their way of life, even though this included denying independence to others — the slaves. Northerners fought to maintain national unity. Later, they also fought to end the system of slavery.
When the war began, the North enjoyed several important advantages over the South:
Transportation. The North had a superior transportation system with more railroads, canals, ports, and roads.
Population. The North's population was 22 million in 1860, compared to only six million free citizens in the South.
Resources. The North had more factories and grew more food. The South was primarily rural and agricultural. It produced mainly cotton and cash crops to be sold to others. The South lacked manufacturing centers.
Leadership. Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, lacked the political skills of President Lincoln. However, the South appeared to have superior military leadership in the early years of the war, with commanders such as General Lee.
Naval Power. The South had few war ships, while the North had a powerful navy, which blockaded Southern ports and helped in the Mississippi campaign. This naval power would prove decisive.
..............................
____
Although the North had superior wealth and resources, Southerners thought they had one very important advantage: they were fighting to defend their own way of life.
Categorize the advantages and disadvantages of the North and the South during the war as either political, economic, or social.
WARTIME STRATEGIES
Northerners adopted a long-term strategy, first suggested by General Winfield Scott, that was aimed at strangling the South. Because the North hoped to surround and strangle the South like a giant anaconda snake, this plan became known as the “Anaconda Plan.” President Lincoln ordered a naval blockade of the Confederacy that was practically unchallenged. His objectives were to prevent Southerners from receiving supplies from Europe, to block Southern states from exporting cotton, to prohibit the South from importing war materials, and to thwart the creation of a Confederate navy.
u PROJECT WITHOUT PERMISSION j
In July 1861, a Union army of 30,000 soldiers marched towards Richmond but was defeated at the Battle of Manassas (also called the Battle of Bull Run). General “Stonewall” Jackson and other Confederate leaders, commanding 22,000 soldiers, forced the Union army to retreat. Jackson displayed remarkable skill on the battlefield, which inspired his soldiers. He is widely regarded as one of the best Confederate commanders. Later, he was accidentally shot by Confederate troops returning from battle.
CHAPTER 13: The Civil War, 1861-1865	267
“Stonewall” Jackson (1824-1863)
Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee decided that the best way to end the war was to invade the North. In late 1862, Lee’s forces crossed into Maryland. Confederate and Union forces fought a major battle at Antietam Creek. At the Battle of Antietam (also known as the Battle of Sharpsburg), six thousand soldiers were killed in just one day — the bloodiest single day of the war. Lee retreated to Virginia, but to Lincoln’s disappointment, Union leaders did not pursue his forces.

Julia Ward Howe
By the start of the Civil War, “John Brown’s Body” had become a popular marching song of the Union Army. One day, Julia Ward Howe watched as Union soldiers marched off to war singing “John Brown’s Body.” Howe believed
the tune needed better words. In 1861, she “scrawled the verses almost without looking at the paper.” “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” first appeared in a magazine as a battle song for the republic. Before long, the entire nation was inspired by her hymn and singing her words based on the old tune. Below are the first and fifth stanzas of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic”:
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord:
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword:
His truth is marching on.
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat: Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet! Our God is marching on.
Explain the meaning of these two stanzas in your own words.
Research the “Battle Hymn of the Republic” on the Internet. Read how these words have been interpreted by historians and see how your interpretation matches those.
EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION
(1862) President Lincoln did not originally believe he had the power to end slavery. However, as the war progressed, he believed he should do so if it would help save the Union. Lincoln used the victory at Antietam as the occasion for announcing the Emancipation Proclamation. The death toll was now so great that Lincoln wanted to give the war effort a greater moral purpose. Lincoln also wanted to prevent Britain and France, which opposed slavery, from taking sides with the South. Finally, he wanted to prevent Southern States from using black troops for combat and to keep border states, such as Missouri, from deserting the North for the South.
The Emancipation Proclamation only freed the slaves in rebelling states, not in the loyal border states. It was the most controversial document of Lincoln’s Presidency. The announcement of the Proclamation met with both hostility and jubilation in the North. On approving it, Lincoln remarked, “I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.”

THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS
Lincoln was invited to the battlefield of Gettysburg in 1863 to dedicate a cemetery to the Union soldiers who had died there. He spoke for only two minutes. Simply and eloquently, Lincoln explained the meaning of the Civil War to the 20,000 people who had come to see him.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
By the third year of bloodshed, Lincoln began to feel that the war was being fought not just to preserve the Union but to test the system of democracy itself. The purpose of the war was to see if the American experiment in democracy, launched in 1776, could survive. Lincoln told his listeners that those who had sacrificed their lives had already made holy the ground
where they were buried. The best that those still living could do was to continue with the terrible task that the fallen soldiers had died for:
Lincoln stands to deliver the Gettysburg Address.
“The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they [the soldiers who died] did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the ... great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devo-
tion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”
What did Lincoln see as the “great task remaining”?
Why do you think this speech is one of the most famous in American history?
The Battle of Vicksburg. Meanwhile, Union forces had captured New Orleans and were slowly working their way up the Mississippi River in order to divide the South in two. Vicksburg was located on top of a 200-foot bluff, allowing the Confederacy to control movement along the Mississippi River. In the spring of 1863, General Ulysses S. Grant’s armies focused on taking Vicksburg to trap the Confederate army. The day after the Battle of Gettysburg, Vicksburg surrendered after a 47-day siege.

CHAPTER 13: The Civil War, 1861-1865	275
The devastation caused by Union armies in the South caused many Confederates to lose hope. General Lee’s army slowly dwindled. By late 1864, half of his soldiers had deserted to return home to protect their families.
In April 1865, Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy, fell to Union armies. A few days later, Lee met Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. Under the terms of the agreement, the officers and men of Lee’s army surrendered and were pardoned. All Confederate arms were collected by Union troops as captured property. Both generals signed the document of surrender. The war was finally over.
Richmond, Virginia lay in ruins in 1865.
Lincoln's Assassination. Just weeks after the surrender, President Lincoln was assassinated on April 15, 1865, in Washington, D.C., exactly four years after his call to put down the rebellion.
Lincoln was shot in the back of the head by the actor John Wilkes Booth, who thought Lincoln was a tyrant. Lincoln died the next day. Had Lincoln lived, he was prepared to forgive the South and to work together as Americans dedicated to a system of government based on liberty,
equality, and unity. Lincoln’s greatest achievement was his ability to energize and mobilize the nation by appealing to its highest ideals, while acting “with malice towards none.”

Name
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 285
A.
During the Reconstruction Era, Southern states needed to rebuild their economies and to be re-admitted into the Union. B.
Lincoln sought to treat the South leniently by asking 10% of its voters to take an oath of allegiance and have the state ratify the Thirteenth Amendment. When he was assassinated, the next President, Andrew Johnson, sought to follow Lincoln’s plan by treating the South leniently, pardoning former Confederates. C.
One of the biggest issues facing the South was the fate of the freedmen. Despite experiments during the war, the freedmen were not given their own land. The federal government set up the Freedmen’s Bureau, with offices throughout the South, to help the freedmen adjust and to set up schools to educate them. D.
Southern state legislatures created “Black Codes,” based on older slave codes. These limited the civil rights and freedom of movement of the freedmen. E.
Radical Republicans in Congress were outraged by the Black Codes. They passed the Civil Rights Bill, granting freedmen their civil rights. This act later became the Fourteenth Amendment. The Congress passed Military Reconstruction, dividing the South into districts governed by the army. Former Confederate leaders lost their political rights, while the freedmen were given the right to vote. F.
Congress also impeached President Johnson. He was “impeached” {accused) by the House of Representatives, but the Senate failed to remove him from office. G.
During Reconstruction, three amendments were added to the Constitution. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed all citizens “equal protection of the laws” and “due process.” The Fifteenth Amendment prohibited denial of voting rights on the basis of race. H.
During Reconstruction, freedmen, carpetbaggers, and scalawags held power in Southern governments. For the first time, African Americans were elected to government posts. Hiram Rhodes Revels became the first African American elected to Congress. Reconstruction governments built roads, schools, and took steps towards racial equality. However, after Northern troops were withdrawn, Southern states passed segregation laws in the 1880s. I.
Southerners also developed a new economy during Reconstruction. Many former slaves became tenants and sharecroppers, giving a share of their crops to the landowner. New industries developed in the South, especially in larger cities. J.
This period also saw the opening of the Great Plains to settlement in the West. Congress passed the Homestead Act and Morrill Act during the Civil War, giving away federal lands to settlers in the West. The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad (1869) helped develop the West. K.
The Indian Wars forced Indians onto government reservations, while the widespread massacre of the buffalo on the Great Plains destroyed their food supply. In 1887, the Dawes Act, meant to help Indians, failed to respect tribal customs and led to the loss of most of their remaining land. L.
The Civil War provided a great stimulus to industrial production in the North. New banking laws and higher tariffs helped Northern industries to expand. Immigration from Europe stimulated the growth of Northern cities, while workers organized into trade unions for higher wages and better working conditions. Name
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 287
The looming battle between Lincoln and Congress over Reconstruction never occurred. In 1865, only a few days after the South surrendered, Lincoln was assassinated. The new President, Andrew Johnson, was from the border state of Tennessee, and lacked President Lincoln’s stature and authority.
Initially, Congress believed Johnson would not be lenient on the South. Johnson made wealthy planters write personal letters for clemency. One Senator remarked about Johnson: “I thank God that you are here. Lincoln had too much of the milk of human kindness to deal with these dam rebels. Now they will be dealt with according to their just deserts.” But in the end, President Johnson followed Lincoln’s plan of lenient treatment. Johnson was especially sympathetic to poor Southern whites. He recognized newly formed Southern state governments and pardoned most rebel leaders. Many Southern states then elected former Confederate leaders for seats in the new Congress.
Portrait by Matthew Brady of President Andrew Johnson.
THE "BLACK CODES"
Another problem facing the South was how to deal with the millions of freed slaves, known as freedmen. During the war, the Union army had even given some freed slaves land in the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia as an experiment. Congress established the Freedmen’s Bureau to help the freed slaves with food, clothing and medical care.
Some of these agents were former Northern veterans, empowered to settle disputes between the freedmen and their former masters. The
bureau also searched for lost family members, made slave marriages legal, opened schools to teach former slaves to read and write, and organized to demand their civil rights. The new Southern states were slow to extend voting rights to the freedmen. Some freedmen called for Southerners to give them their own land and tools —“20 acres and a mule” — but Southern governments refused to do so.
	
A
Freedmen’s Bureau school. Instead, Southern states passed “Black Codes,” based on older “Slave Codes,” in order to regulate the lives of the freedmen. The aim of these codes was to preserve traditional Southern society despite the abolition of slavery. For example, the “Black Codes” made it illegal for freedmen to hold public office, to travel freely or to serve on juries. Any freed-man found without a job could be fined and jailed.
Name
THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON
Even before 1867, a number of Radicals had called for Johnson’s removal, fearing that Reconstruction could never be successful so long as he remained in office. To enforce its program, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, limiting the President’s power to dismiss his own Cabinet members. Johnson refused to obey this law, which he believed was unconstitutional. When Johnson dismissed his Secretary of War, Congressional leaders moved to remove Johnson from office through the process of impeachment. Under
the Constitution, this process involves two steps. Johnson was first impeached {accused) by the House of Representatives. Next, the process moved to the Senate, where the Radical Republicans fell one vote short of removing Johnson from office.
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 289
Impeachment hearing for President A ndrew Johnson.
THE GRANT PRESIDENCY
Shortly after the attempt to remove Johnson from office, Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877), the Republican candidate, was elected President. Although Grant had been a brilliant general, his administration was characterized by weak Presidential leadership and widespread corruption at the national and local levels. His two terms in office coincided with the rest of Reconstruction.
Following the Civil War, the Radical Republicans in Congress introduced three new Constitutional amendments: the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, known as the Civil War Amendments. Their purpose was to abolish slavery, provide citizenship to the freedmen, and guarantee their civil rights.
THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT
(1865) "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any plate subject to their jurisdiction."
Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation has been called a hollow document since it “freed no slaves.” The Proclamation only freed persons held as slaves in rebelling states. Lincoln realized that as President, he had no legal grounds to single-handedly end the institution of slavery. He recognized that the Emancipation Proclamation needed to be followed by a constitutional amendment in order to guarantee the abolition of slavery. Passed in 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery throughout the nation, confirming the intent of the Emancipation Proclamation.
Name______________________________________________________
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 291
One special motive behind the Fifteenth Amendment was the Republican desire to secure its power base in both the North and the South for future elections. African-American voters were expected to support Republicans. Ratification of the amendment actually had little effect in the South, since terrorism and special hurdles to voting were later used to prevent African Americans from voting once Reconstruction ended.

-It Make a poster explaining the Civil War Amendments in your own words.
Women reformers, who had been key to the abolitionist movement, were greatly disappointed when the Fifteenth Amendment guaranteed the right to vote for freedmen, but not for women. In 1872, Susan B. Anthony was arrested for illegally leading a group of women to vote in Rochester, New York, in the Presidential election. An all-male jury found her guilty of the election laws. The judge ordered Anthony to pay a $100 fine — which she refused to pay.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
Susan B. Anthony asked to say a few words before Judge Ward Hunt passed his sentence. She told the court:
“Your Honor, all forms of law are made by men, interpreted by men, administered by men, in favor of men, and against women.
Your verdict of guilty against a citizen for the exercise of ‘that citizens’ right to vote,’ is simply because that citizen was a woman and not a man. But, yesterday, that same man declared it a crime punishable with a fine and imprisonment, for you or me to give a cup of cold water, a crust of bread, or a night’s shelter to a fugitive as he was making his way to Canada. Every man or woman in whose veins coursed a drop of human sympathy violated that wicked law, [regardless] of consequences, and was justified in so doing.... [N]ow women, to get their voice in this government, take it. I have taken mine, and mean to take it at every possible opportunity.”
What historic comparison did Susan B. Anthony make to prove her point?
Later that night, Anthony wrote in her diary that the trial was “the greatest judicial outrage history has ever recorded!” Why do you think she felt that way?
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 293
Reconstruction was a first step in correcting the many injustices done to African Americans since colonial times. Republican governments came to power in each Southern state. African Americans held positions of authority in Southern governments for the first time. New state constitutions established free statewide public school systems, open to African Americans as well as to whites. Reconstruction governments built new hospitals, orphanages, roads, and railroads. They banned racial discrimination.
Representative of the changes taking place in the South was the election of Hiram Rhodes Revels. He became the first African American to serve in the U.S. Congress. Born in North Carolina, Revels attended college in the North and became a minister. He helped raise two regiments of African Americans during the Civil War. During Reconstruction, he moved to Mississippi, where he served in local and state governments before being elected as a U.S. Senator in 1870. In the Senate, he spoke on behalf of racial equality and amnesty for former Confederates. Senator Charles Sumner, a Radical Republican, spoke of the importance of Revels’ election: “The Declaration was only half established by Independence. The greatest duty remained behind. In assuring the equal rights of all, we complete the work.”
Hiram Revels (1827-1901)
THE SHARECROPPING SYSTEM
Following the war, plantation owners in the South faced a dilemma. Even if a family still owned a large amount of land, they could not farm it by themselves: they needed workers. The Southern economy was in such shambles that in many instances landowners lacked the money to buy seed and farm implements, much less to hire laborers. To deal with the South’s economic problems, plantation owners and freedmen developed the system of sharecropping as a replacement for slavery. Former plantation owners provided livestock, tools, and land to former slaves in exchange for a share of the crop. Other former slaves became tenant farmers, paying rent for use of the land.
A group of sharecroppers work the land raising cotton.
Their arrangements soon developed into a new means of oppression of the freedmen. The larger plantations even printed their own paper money as an advance to their tenant farmers against the following year’s crop, rather than giving them real cash. Plantation money could only be used at plantation stores, which often charged high prices for basic necessities.
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 295
African-American leaders such as Booker T. Washington, author of the book Up From Slavery, and W.E.B. DuBois, founder of the N.A.A.C.P., spoke out against these injustices. But it would take another 80 years before these conditions were reversed by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and the efforts of leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

The state could then sell this land and use its earnings to fund public colleges that taught agriculture and the mechanical arts. Sixty-nine colleges were founded using these land grants. Although they began as agricultural and technical schools, many of these colleges grew into large public universities that later helped educate millions of Americans.
THE SETTLEMENT OF THE FRONTIER
The American frontier has generally been defined as the line separating areas of settlement from “unsettled” wilderness territory. From another point of view, the American frontier marked the dividing line between areas where Native Americans lived and areas where more technologically advanced peoples lived. Since the arrival of the first colonists, the American frontier had moved slowly westwards. By the end of the Civil War, American settlers occupied the mid-Western prairies and had a foothold along the Pacific coast. Between these two lines was a vast expanse of territory.
Much of this last frontier consisted of the Great Plains, home to millions of buffalo and the Native American Indians who lived off their food and hides. From about 1860 to 1890, these herds of buffalo were destroyed, the Native Americans were forced onto reservations, and the Great Plains were divided into farms and ranches.
THE IMPACT OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD
The extension of the railroads was one of the principal factors behind the settlement of the Great Plains. Before the Civil War, Northerners and Southerners could not agree on a route for a transcontinental railroad. After the South seceded, it was clear that the route would go through the North. After the war, separate crews of engineers and laborers worked from California eastward and from the middle of the country westward.
Name________________________________________________________
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 299

Native Americans Indians had once occupied all of the United States. Native Americans were composed of many different groups, speaking hundreds of languages. The advancing line of settlement and diseases from Eurasia like smallpox had severely reduced Native American populations and pushed them westwards. By the end of the Civil War, Native American Indians nevertheless still occupied the Great Plains.

As settlers moved westward, they killed off millions of buffalo — essential to Indian survival.
Tribes, like the Sioux, lived by hunting the millions of buffalo that grazed the Great Plains.
However, with the Homestead Act and completion of the transcontinental railroad, land-hungry settlers wanted this land for themselves.
The "Indian Wars." Expansion into the Great Plains and mountain regions by miners, ranchers and settlers led to a growing number of conflicts with the Native American Indian population of the West.
From the 1840s to the 1880s the
U.S. military fought several battles, usually in the form of small skirmishes, in an effort to clear routes to the West for white settlers and to establish government control over this vast territory. During these “Indian Wars,” the U.S. Army defeated the Plains Indians and forced them onto reservations. The technological superiority of the federal troops’ made resistance by the Native American Indians impossible. Government reports estimate that as many as 45,000 Indians and 19,000 whites were killed.
THE RESERVATION
Once a particular Native American tribe submitted to federal authority, its members were settled on reservations. Reservation lands were usually smaller than the lands from which the tribe was removed and often consisted of undesirable land. The federal government promised food, blankets, and seed, but this policy clashed with tribal customs since Native Americans were traditionally hunters, not farmers.

Immigration. Industrial growth also led to increased immigration. The development of ocean-going passenger vessels made the journey to America easier, cheaper, and faster for many immigrants. Immigrants continued to come from Germany and Ireland, but they were now joined by newcomers from Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Poland.
Anti-union cartoon showing a competent worker supporting an incompetent one on his back.
One of the main reasons for the rapid economic growth of the North following the Civil War was the increasing exploitation of industrial workers. Gains in industrial productivity were made at terrible costs to workers. Working conditions at factories were often hazardous. Employers hired the cheapest possible laborers. Immigrants were willing to work for low wages. Factories often employed women and children at especially low pay.
The 1860s saw the emergence of labor as an organized force in the United States. A trade union is an association of workers who act together in making demands to employers for higher wages and better working conditions.
The earliest unions were also mutual assistance societies.
Members contributed part of their wages to create a fund to help members who became sick or died. Trade unions were formed on a national scale between 1861 and 1866.
The first attempt to unite all trade unions into a single federation took place in 1866, with the formation of the National Labor Union. However, in 1872 this union disbanded because of internal friction.
In 1869, the National Labor Union was succeeded by the Knights of Labor. By 1886, they had grown into a national organization with more than 700,000 members. Their policies pushed for state and national laws to improve conditions. The Knights demanded an 8-hour work day, higher wages, safety codes in factories, an end to child labor, and equal pay for women. They backed restrictions on immigration, which they saw as competition for their jobs.
In what ways did the further growth of industry contribute to the birth of a national labor movement at this time?
Were labor unions justified in opposing immigration to the United States? Explain your answer.
Why do you think the initial public reaction was hostile to labor unions?
CHAPTER 14: The Reconstruction Era 305
Bom in Missouri, Mark Twain (1835-1910) was the first major American writer bom away from the East Coast. Two of his masterpieces, Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, chronicled life along the Mississippi River. His fictional characters spoke like real people and sounded distinctively American, using local dialects, newly invented words, and regional accents. His honest and candid approach revealed what life was really like for many African-Americans along the Mississippi. As he grew older, his writings came to express the sad view that all human motives were selfish. Today, he is best remembered as a humorist who used sharp wit, comedy, and exaggeration to attack false pride and self-importance.
Mark Twain
AMERICAN MUSIC
The music of America is the culmination of many different styles that have grown and changed over the years. American music has been especially influenced by both African and European musical styles.
Slave spirituals and work songs grew in popularity after the Civil War. Chamber music and parlor songs were also quite popular in many American homes during this period. Stephen Foster (1826-1864) was a noted composer whose songs were uniquely American in theme, characterizing a love of home, work, politics, battlefields, slavery and plantation life. His songs included “My Old Kentucky Home,” and “Oh! Susana.”
In these years, most small towns in America had an amateur brass or wind band. Many of these bands originated in the military. Brass bands were especially popular in parades. John Philip Sousa was a key early composer, who composed many marches. He is most famous for The Stars and Stripes Forever.

A.
Americans won their independence during the American Revolution. Jonathan Trumbull was the only colonial governor to side with the colonists. John Peter Muhlenberg was a Protestant minister who recruited soldiers and rose to the rank of general. B.
The Declaration of Independence stated the colonists’ decision to separate from Britain. The Declaration listed colonial grievances against Britain and provided a theory of government: government’s purpose is to protect individuals’ unalienable rights to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” When a government oppresses citizens’ rights, they have a right to overthrow it. C.
Signers of the Declaration included John Hancock, Benjamin Rush, Charles Carroll, and John Witherspoon. D.
The first national government established by the new United States was a weak association. Americans created a stronger federal government when they ratified the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution created a national executive, a two-house legislature known as Congress, and a national judiciary. John Jay was the nation’s first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. To ensure the national government would not challenge citizens’ rights, the Constitution rested on certain key principles — limited government, the separation of power, federalism, checks and balances, and popular sovereignty. E.
The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution in the form of the first ten amendments to further protect individual rights from government abuse. F.
The First Amendment protects freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly and the right of citizens to petition their government. G.
The Second Amendment protects the right of citizens to bear arms. H.
The Third Amendment says government cannot “quarter” soldiers in private homes without their consent. I.
The Fourth Amendment protects people from “unreasonable searches.” J.
The Fifth Amendment protects individuals from double jeopardy, and from being forced to incriminate themselves, and further guarantees citizens “just compensation” for property taken by government’s right of eminent domain. K.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees those accused of a crime a fair and public trial by a jury and the assistance of a lawyer. L.
The Seventh Amendment guarantees jury trials in some civil cases. M.
The Eighth Amendment prevents judges from setting bail that is too high, or from inflicting “cruel and unusual” punishments. N.
The Nihth Amendment lists certain rights and does not deny other rights. O.

CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History
Strong support for independence came from several colonial religious leaders. In colonial times, these religious leaders held great influence. Many colonists attended church on Sundays, where ministers made their views known in weekly sermons. John Peter Muhlenberg was bom in Pennsylvania, studied In Germany and America, and became a Protestant minister.
At one of his sermons, Muhlenberg pulled off his clerical robe to reveal a uniform underneath. Then he enlisted more than a hundred men into the Continental Army. Rev. Muhlenberg became part of a group known as the “Black Regiment” — ministers who wore black clerical robes while preaching and who worked to recruit large
numbers of volunteers for the Revolutionary cause. During the war, Muhlenberg rose to the rank of general under Washington. Later, he served as a U.S. Senator and Congressman.

John Peter Muhlenberg (1746-1807)
Representatives at the Second Continental Congress began discussing the issue of American independence early in 1776. After much debate, the delegates decided to go ahead and declare their independence from Britain. A “Committee of Five” was charged with the task of writing a draft for the Declaration of Independence. The members of the Committee decided that Thomas Jefferson should write most of the document.
The final Declaration of Independence, issued on July 4,
1776, explained the reasons why the colonists sought independence from Great Britain. The Declaration not only freed the colonists from Britain, but also put forward a theory of government. Many of its ideas were borrowed from John Locke. The Declaration explained that the purpose of government should be to protect citizens’ unalienable rights.
These were rights that cannot be taken away, such as the rights to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”
The Declaration further argued that ordinary citizens had the right to overthrow an oppressive government that failed to protect these unalienable rights. The Declaration of Inde-
pendence then went on to list the grievances of the colo-	The De(daratl°n w®s read
nists against King George III. Most ol these grievances were
based on the belief that the British Crown was threatening the colonists’ rights in favor of tyrannical rule.

They signed by state from North to South, starting with New Hampshire. They acted courageously since the British viewed the Declaration as an act of treason, punishable by hanging. Who were some of these signers of the Declaration?
John Hancock. The most recognizable signature on the Declaration of Independence was that of John Hancock, a prosperous merchant from Boston and the President of the Continental Congress. Hancock made his signature so large so that King George III could read it without his glasses. When the first version of the Declaration was printed and sent to each colony, it carried only John Hancock’s signature, since the official document had not yet been drawn up for others to sign. Hancock’s name quickly became second only to that of George Washington as a symbol of freedom in the colonies.
Benjamin Rush. Another signer of the Declaration, Rush was a physician, educator, and humanitarian. Dr. Rush is sometimes known as the “Father of American Medicine.” He was a pioneer in the fields of physiology and psychiatry. Rush is also known for his proposal to establish a national public university to train public servants. He favored the education of women, and helped to establish and finance the oldest African-American church in the country (the African Methodist Episcopal Church) in Philadelphia. His son later became U.S. Ambassador to England.
Charles Carroll of Carrollton. One of the wealthiest men in the colonies, Carroll helped finance the Revolution with his own money. Carroll was one of the first to recognize the necessity for independence from Britain and strongly argued for armed resistance to Britain. From Maryland, Carroll was a Catholic. At that time, Catholics made up less than two percent of the colonial population and lacked political rights. Carroll helped in the struggle for the acceptance of the Roman Catholic religion in America.
41
John Hancock (1737-1793)
John Witherspoon. A Scottish immigrant, Witherspoon became a leading member of the Continental Congress and took part in more than a hundred of its committees. Shortly after signing the Declaration of Independence, he responded to a person who argued that the colonies were not ready for independence. Witherspoon commented that it “was not only ripe for independence, but in danger of rotting for the want of it.” He was a Presbyterian clergyman, and he became President of the College of New Jersey, later known as Princeton University. Under his leadership, the college rose to become a leading institution of learning in America.

CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History

The Declaration of Independence only set up a series of aspirations, or goals, for Americans. It promised a system of government that promoted liberty, equality, and individual rights, and that was based on the will of the people. The U.S. Constitution actually turned these goals into a concrete system of government with a series of specific, fundamental laws.
The Constitution was not the first central government that the colonies established after independence. The colonies originally set up a very weak national association under an agreement known as the Articles of Confederation. This association was an experiment in government that failed. In 1786, American leaders met at Annapolis, Maryland, and decided that a stronger government was needed.
They decided to meet again and invited delegates to Philadelphia to revise the Articles. The Constitutional Convention, meeting in Philadelphia in 1787, quickly decided to abandon the Articles altogether and to write an entirely new constitution.
The Articles of Confederation
PRINCIPLES OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION
The U.S. Constitution, written by the Constitutional Convention, established the basic structure of our national government. It established a government in which power rested with the people, who elect their own representatives. The framers of the Constitution sought to create a national government strong enough to defend the nation’s interests and to promote its general welfare. They gave the new national government many important powers, and made federal law supreme over state law.
The signing of the U.S. Constitution at Independence Hall
The new Constitution created an elected President, a Congress with two houses, and a Supreme Court. To ensure that this new national government was not too strong, the new Constitution also adopted a number of important principles:
Name_________________________________________________
CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History
45
THE BILL OF RIGHTS
The original Constitution contained few specific guarantees of individual rights. Ratification of the Constitution was only obtained when its supporters promised to add a Bill of Rights to protect individual liberties. As soon as the first Congress assembled in 1789, it began deciding which rights to include in the “Bill of Rights.” A list of possible rights was reduced to ten, which were approved by the members of Congress. They were then sent to the states for approval. Two-thirds of the state legislatures approved these amendments by 1791, when they came into effect.
The First Amendment actually covers five separate rights at the same time. Let’s look at each of these rights more closely.
FREEDOM OF RELIGION
The First Amendment guarantees freedom of worship.
It also prohibits Congress from establishing an official, or “state” religion. This is sometimes called the separation of church and state.
FREEDOM OF SPEECH
The First Amendment protects our freedom to say or write most things in public. Americans cannot be put in jail just for criticizing the government or for expressing unpopular beliefs. This does not mean, however,
that we can say whatever we want. In some circumstances, our speech can be limited. For example, a person cannot yell “fire” in a crowded movie theater as a joke, since this might threaten other people’s lives. The Supreme Court has ruled that government can limit speech when that speech creates a “clear and present danger.”
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
The First Amendment allows newspapers, radio, and television to write or announce what they want without fear of punishment. This freedom is essential in a democratic society since people need to be well-informed to vote.
THE RIGHT OF ASSEMBLY
The First Amendment states that Congress cannot deny individuals the right to “peacefully assemble.”
Name_________________________________________________
CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History
47
In colonial times, people protested against British customs officers randomly entering their homes. The Fourth Amendment was added to protect individuals from “unreasonable” searches and seizures by government officials.
If there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, a judge must sign a “search warrant,” presented by a police officer, before the search can be conducted. Our laws provide that only in exceptional circumstances can the police make a search without a warrant.
The police must follow certain procedures before they can enter a persons home.
A citizen cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property without “due process of law.” This means that certain legal procedures must be carried out according to established rules before a person can be punished.
A person cannot be tried for a serious federal crime, which could lead to imprisonment or execution, without an indictment by a grand jury — a formal accusation before a person is arrested. A grand jury is a group of citizens that meet to review if there is enough evidence available to even hold a trial.
No person can be subject to double jeopardy — being tried twice for the same crime.
An accused person cannot be forced to say things that will be used against him or herself (self-incrimination). Under the Supreme Court decision of Miranda v.
Arizona (1966), a person’s confession of a crime is not valid if he or she was not first informed of the right to have a lawyer present during police questioning.
Eminent domain refers to the power of a government over property in its territory.
Sometimes the government needs to take Persons cannot be made to testify against themselves. over private property for public use. For
example, the government may need to build a highway or construct a school where private homes are located. The government has the right to do so under the power of eminent domain. According to the Fifth Amendment, “private property [shall not] be taken for public use without just compensation.” In other words, before the government can exercise Its power of eminent domain, it must provide the owner with “just compensation.”
Name_________________________________________________
CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History
49
The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to a trial by a jury in many civil disputes — cases where one person sues another for injury or for breaking a contract.
The Ninth Amendment states that just because the Constitution lists some specific rights, this does not mean that citizens do not also hold other rights.
The Tenth Amendment states that the federal government has only those powers specifically given to it in the Constitution. All other powers are reserved to the states or the people.

CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History
51
At the time of the American Revolution, some writers began noticing that America was a very different place from Europe. At that time, most of Europe was still divided into hereditary social classes. Nobles enjoyed special privileges, while in many countries, there were still serfs with no rights at all. Throughout most of Europe, land was owned by a few wealthy families: there was very little free land available for people to settle or buy.
One of the first attempts to describe the new American culture was by a French immigrant, Hector St John de Crevecoeur. In 1755, he moved to New France in North America and in 1759, he moved to New York. He was very intrigued by what he found in America. He tried to define what it meant to be an American in 1782. He was greatly impressed by the mixing of peoples of different nationalities, the rich resources of North America, the absence of kings and nobles demanding a share of the worker’s labor, and the willingness of Americans to work hard out of their own self-interest:
ACTINS AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In his Letters to an American Farmer, Crevecoeur (1735-1813) wrote about how this mixture of different peoples was being transformed by the American environment to create a new American society and culture:
“What then is the American, this new man? He is either a European, or the descendant of an European, hence that strange mixture of blood, which you will find in no other country.
He is an American, who, leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the new rank he holds.... Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men, whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in
the world.... Here the rewards of his industry follow with	____
equal steps the progress of his labor; his labor is founded on the basis of nature, self-interest', can it want a stronger allurement? Wives and children gladly help their father to clear those abundant fields where crops grow to feed and clothe them all; without any part being claimed, either by a despotic prince, a rich abbot, or a mighty lord.”
According to Crevecoeur, what were the chief differences between Europeans and Americans?
What do you think surprised him most about Americans?

CHAPTER 4: Foundations: Background to American History 53
Tocqueville also found, however, that the system of democracy did not always place the best people in positions of leadership in government: “On my arrival in the United States, I was surprised to find so much distinguished talent among the citizens and so little among the heads of the government. It is a constant fact that at the present day the ablest men in the United States are rarely placed at the head of affairs.” Indeed, Tocqueville came to the conclusion that by guaranteeing general prosperity and well-being, America did not necessarily promote the cultivation of excellence, as he believed Europe did.
Historians studying Tocqueville have identified five values that he found crucial to America’s success as a constitutional republic:
EGALITARIANISM (EQUALITY)
Egalitarianism refers to a society of equals. In Europe, society was built around hereditary distinctions separating the nobles, middle classes, and peasants. In America, there were differences in wealth, power, and intelligence, but everyone was equal socially. The availability of free land also promoted equality. Owning land allowed Americans to view themselves as equal to their neighbors and further contributed to their feeling of equality. Tocqueville believed that the primary concern of the nation should be to safeguard liberty, since it created the conditions for Americans to become economically prosperous. Two exceptions to this were slavery and the treatment of Native Americans, which Tocqueville also wrote about.
POPULISM (POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY)
Tocqueville wrote that democratic government, — “a government where the people more or less participate in their government,” — is closely bound up with the idea of “political liberty.” Populism refers to the participation of the common people in political life — another distinguishing characteristic that Tocqueville found in American society in the early nineteenth century. Since everyone in society was equal, everyone had the same right to participate in government. The goal of such a society was peace and prosperity for all.
LIBERTY
By “liberty,” Tocqueville meant protection against tyrannical government. The great danger in democratic government was the tyranny of the majority. He noted that Americans were devoted to the rule of law, and that America’s federal system helped prevent the rise of an over-powerful government. Most important of all, American customs and manners were devoted to the spirit of liberty. In America, Tocqueville wrote, religious faith helped strengthen the belief in individual liberty.
INDIVIDUALISM
In American society, the government did not direct individual activity to the same extent as Tocqueville had seen in Europe. People in America were free to flourish without hereditary distinctions, and individuals believed they could rise in society. Individuals even organized themselves into their own private, voluntary associations, such as charities.

CHAPTER 5: Industrialization and the "Gilded Age"
63
American industrialization proceeded at a rapid pace in the decades after the Civil War. Some historians consider this period America’s “Second Industrial Revolution.”
New inventions and technologies helped fuel the great economic expansion of the late nineteenth century. In the decades after the Civil War, steam and electricity replaced human and animal strength. Iron replaced wood, and steel replaced iron. The Bessemer process made the production of steel more economical. Before the Bessemer process, it took an entire day to produce 5 tons of steel; afterwards, the same quantity of steel could be made in a mere 15 minutes.
In 1855, Henry Bessemer developed a new and more efficient method of making steel.
The power of steam now drove textile mill spindles, sewing machines and other equipment. This steam generally came from the burning of coal to heat water. New pneumatic drills were able to cut deeper into the Earth than ever before to mine this resource. In 1860, 14 million tons of coal were mined in the United States; by 1884, the amount was 100 million tons. The center of the coal mining industry was western Pennsylvania. The first oil well was also drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859. Improvements in refining allowed petroleum products to be used in lighting and machine lubrication. The internal combustion engine, developed at from oil to run cars and the first airplanes.
One of the earliest oil wells in Pennsylvania.
end of the nineteenth century, used gasoline
The Commercial Use of Electricity. The application of electricity was another of the period’s most significant developments. For its first commercial use, electricity was used as a means of communication along telegraph wires. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell, (1847-1922) an educator of the deaf, invented the telephone. The telephone and telegraph allowed people to communicate across great distances.

DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL MARKET
In the late nineteenth century, a truly national market emerged for the first time. Railroads, canals, telegraphs and telephones linked together different parts of the country. Shipping raw materials and finished goods became less expensive. National producers could make and ship goods more cheaply than local producers, since they could take advantage of more machinery and greater economies of scale. The high investment costs of mass-production manufacturing required a large market to be profitable. New methods of selling were developed, such as department stores, chain stores, and mail-order houses, including Sears and Roebuck. Manufacturers could advertise in magazines and newspapers, and sell the same goods throughout the country.
THE IMPACT OF POPULATION GROWTH
In the late nineteenth century, the United States experienced continuous population growth in nearly every part of the nation. Between 1850 and 1900, the population more than tripled. In 1850, there were 23 million Americans; by 1900, there were 76 million. This large population increase was fueled by a high birthrate and a constant stream of European immigrants. Population growth created favorable conditions for business expansion. There was a steadily rising demand for goods, and a plentiful supply of cheap labor to make them. But the growing population also made Increasing demands on the natural environment, using up resources.
NEW TYPES OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
Before the Civil War, most American businesses were owned by individuals or by a group of partners. After the war, the corporate form of business became much more common. A corporation is a company chartered by a state and recognized in law as a separate “person.”

Create a chart or Venn diagram listing the advantages and disadvantages of the corporate form of business organization.
An entrepreneur is a person (or small group) who starts a business in the hope of making a profit. In the 1870s, entrepreneurs began to exercise a dominant influence on American economic life. Through the efficiencies of large-scale production, these industrial entrepreneurs lowered the prices of goods, making them more affordable, while also improving their quality. These entrepreneurs were also able to reap huge profits for themselves, creating immense wealth. Because of their lavish lifestyles, the period from 1865 to 1900 became known as the “Gilded Age.”
Some observers considered these entrepreneurs “Captains of Industry” because they forged the modem industrial economy. Their critics called them “robber barons” because of the ruthless tactics they used to destroy competition and to keep their workers’ wages low. Two of the most successful entrepreneurs in this era were Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller.
ANDREW CARNEGIE
Andrew Carnegie worked his way up from a penniless Scottish immigrant to one of America’s richest and most powerful men.
He first worked as a boy in a cotton mill. Later, he was a telegraph operator for a railroad. Carnegie became friends with the president of the railroad, who promoted him and advised him on investments.
After the Civil War, Carnegie invested in ironworks and built a steel mill in Pittsburgh, selling iron and steel to railroad companies for tracks. With his profits, he bought other steel mills and founded the Carnegie Steel Corporation in 1892. His steel mills undercut the competition. He bought iron ore fields, coal mines and ships so he could mine his own iron ore and ship it to his steel
mills In Pennsylvania. Carnegie paid his workers low wages and forced them to work 12-hour long shifts, while he crushed attempts by his workers to form labor unions. Carnegie spent his later life In acts of philanthropy, giving away $350 million to build libraries and endow universities.
Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919)
CHAPTER 5: Industrialization and the "Gilded Age"
69
In 1873, America experienced a depression (an economic downturn in business). Large producers like Carnegie and Rockefeller began driving smaller companies out of business or purchasing them. In some cases, rival companies reached agreements to consolidate (join together). Many producers hoped to eliminate competition by establishing a monopoly. Monopoly power allowed a manufacturer to dictate prices to consumers.
THE PROS AND CONS OF BIG BUSINESS
PROS
•	Large business are more efficient, leading to lower prices.
•	They can hire large numbers of workers.
•	They can produce goods in large quantities.
•	They have the resources to support expensive research and invent new items.
CONS
•	They have an unfair competitive advantage against smalLer businesses.
•	They sometimes exploit workers.
•	They are less concerned with where they do business and pollute the area.
•	They have an unfair influence over government policies affecting them.
LAWS AGAINST ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES
At first, the government did little to regulate big business. Government leaders believed in laissez-faire — the theory that the government should not interfere in the operation of the free market. Of course, even under a laissez-faire system, government had a role in the economy: it provides laws to protect property and enforce contracts. It establishes a system of patents to promote inventions, and enacts tariffs to help manufacturers. Many believed that the economy worked best when it was not burdened by government regulations. Government leaders also doubted that the Constitution gave them the right to regulate business. However, some of the anti-competitive practices of business were so glaring that reformers called for legislation to remedy them, giving government an even greater role.
Interstate Commerce Act (1887). Railroads sometimes charged local farmers more to haul their crops over short distances than they charged for large companies to ship goods longer distances on more competitive national routes. Some states passed laws prohibiting this practice, but the U.S. Supreme Court held these laws to be unconstitutional. The Court ruled that only Congress had the power to regulate interstate commerce. In response, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act. This federal law prohibited unfair practices by railroads, such as charging higher rates for shorter routes. A special regulatory commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, was established to enforce the act. This was a landmark measure, since it was the first time that Congress stepped In to regulate business in America.
Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890). The purpose of this federal law was to stop monopolies engaging in unfair practices that prevented fair competition. The act marked a significant change in the attitude of Congress toward the abuses of big business.

One Important factor behind America’s astonishing economic growth in the late nineteenth century was the increasing exploitation of its industrial workers.
LONG HOURS AND LOW WAGES
The average workday and work week were long by today’s standards: 10 to 14 hours a day for six days a week. Employers hired the least expensive laborers. Pay averaged from $3 to $12 weekly, but immigrants were often willing to work for far less. Women and children were also frequently employed as low-paid workers.
POOR CONDITIONS, BORING AND REPETITIVE TASKS
As factories and work places grew larger, workers lost all personal contact with their employers. Jobs were offered on a “take-it or leave-it” basis. As industrialists sought to achieve greater speed and efficiency, each worker became nothing more than a human cog in a vast machine. Work became less skilled, more repetitive, monotonous and boring. Industrial working conditions in the late nineteenth century were also often extremely hazardous. Safeguards around machinery were inadequate. Thousands of workers were injured or killed in industrial accidents each year.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
This poem, “The Sweatshop,” was written by Morris Rosenfeld, a Russian-Polish immigrant who found work in the garment industry in New York City. A “sweatshop” was a workshop, like a small factory, often in a city. Rosenfeld wrote this poem about how he felt at work:
“The machines are so wildly noisy in the shop That I often forget who I am.
I get lost in the frightful tumult —
My self is destroyed, I become a machine.
I work and work and work endlessly —
I create and create and create
Why? For whom? I don’t know and I don’t ask.
What business has a machine thinking?”
How would you summarize Rosenfeld’s feelings about his work?
Suppose you were going to interview Morris Rosenfeld. Prepare two questions you would ask him.

CHAPTER 5: Industrialization and the "Gilded Age"
Gompers limited his goals to winning economic improvements for workers, higher pay, an 8-hour work day, and better working conditions. Gompers fought hard to improve members’ job security by seeking closed shops {places where only union members could be hired). The AFL quickly emerged as the principal voice of organized labor. However, the AFL was weakened by its continuing exclusion of unskilled workers, who made up the bulk of the labor force. As late as 1910, less than 5% of American Workers were unionized.	Samuel Gompers
(1850-1924).
73
Government leaders were critical of the early labor movement. In the late nineteenth century, most government leaders favored business and opposed unions for a number of reasons:
THE GREATER INFLUENCE OF BUSINESS
Business leaders often contributed heavily to political campaign funds. Moreover, many politicians shared the same outlook as business leaders. They believed that successful businesses were responsible for American prosperity, and saw worker demands as greedy.
PROTECTOR OF THE ECONOMY
More than 20,000 strikes involving more than 6 million workers took place between 1880 and 1900. Government leaders feared the disruptive effect of these strikes on the American economy. In 1895, the U.S. Supreme Court even applied the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890) against unions. The Court ruled that unions were illegal combinations in restraint of trade. This ruling encouraged government leaders to use troops to put down strikes and to restore order.
PUBLIC OPINION
Public opinion also supported laissez-faire policies. Many Americans believed that businesses should have the right to hire and fire employees as they pleased. Many were hostile to unions because they feared workers’ wage demands would lead to higher prices. Union activities were often associated with violence and radical ideas. In the Haymarket Affair of 1886, labor leaders were blamed when a bomb exploded during a demonstration of striking workers at Haymarket Square in Chicago. Seven policemen were killed and 67 others were severely wounded.

In this chapter, you will leam how industrialization affected American society in the late nineteenth century. You will leam how people migrated from the countryside to cities, and people from other countries came to the United States. You will also leam how technological change made it possible to transform the physical geography of the Great Plains. Finally, you will explore how Native American Indians were forced onto reservations, the buffalo were killed, and new settlers built ranches and farms.

■
A.
In the 19th century, Americans moved from the countryside to cities as the nation became more urbanized. The use of farm machinery meant fewer workers were needed on farms, while demand for labor in factories and cities expanded. B.
Urbanization brought many problems. Cities often lacked adequate public services for their growing populations. Streets were noisy, dirty, and congested. Many newcomers lived in crowded tenement housing. C.
Political “bosses” ran “political machines.” They provided basic services for immigrants and the poor, in exchange for their votes; they used their control of city government to make personal fortunes on overpriced city contracts. D.
Immigration escalated in the late nineteenth century. A variety of “push” and “pull” factors brought more immigrants to the United States seeking a better life. E.
The “New Immigrants” came from Southern and Eastern Europe — Russia, Italy, Poland, and Greece. Most were Catholic or Jewish, spoke no English and were often poor. They tended to settle in large Eastern cities. They lived in ethnic communities in ghettos, where they could speak their native language. F.
The children of the immigrants were often “Americanized” in the public schools. G.
Nativists opposed immigration. The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first federal law restricting immigration. It prohibited Chinese immigration for 10 years. H.
The frontier was the line between areas of settlement and those areas dominated by nature and Native American Indians. The last frontier consisted of the Great Plains and mountains, deserts, and basins of the Far West. The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad and the defeat of the Indians during the Indian Wars closed the final frontier and opened the region to settlement. I.
Miners were attracted to the Far West by discoveries of precious metals such as during the California Gold Rush of 1849 and the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896. J.
Ranchers came to drive their cattle herds across the open range to rail lines. Farmers occupied land under the Homestead Act and built homes and farms. To overcome the lack of rain and trees, they built homes of sod, dug water wells, and used steel plows and barbed wire. K.
Government policy drove the Indians onto government reservations in the West. L.
The Dawes Act, although intended to help Indians, had the opposite effect. It gave tribal lands to individual Indians, who often sold them. The American Indian Citizenship Act (1924) made all Indians into U.S. citizens. Name

Urbanization led to physical changes in the landscape. Trees and fields were replaced by wood and brick buildings and by paved roads. American cities mushroomed so quickly that municipal (city) authorities were often unable to deal adequately with all of their problems.
OVERCROWDING AND CONGESTION
Cities grew haphazardly. Streets were often not wide enough to bear the increased traffic. Horse-drawn cars crowded the streets, making movement almost impossible. Factories and trains polluted the air, while sewage sometimes contaminated drinking water and spread disease. Cities lacked the ability to deliver essential services — like clean water, garbage collection, and public schools — to so many residents. As cities grew, whole families crowded into tenements — single-room apartments often without heat or lighting. Frequently many families shared a single toilet.
Inadequate Public Services. Cities lacked the ability to deliver increased public services — hospitals, police forces, schools, fire departments, street cleaning, and garbage collection.			Transportation. Horse-drawn coaches and later electric trolleys were needed to transport workers to their jobs. To eliminate the pollution created by coaches and trolleys, New York City built a subway in 1900. By 1930, New York City had the world's largest subway system.
	' b THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY GROWING CITIES |		
			:,
Overcrowding. Families were crowded into tenements (small apartment buildings). These tenements often lacked daylight, heat, fresh air, and adequate plumbing.
Social Tensions. In cities, rich people lived next door to the poor. Seeing the luxuries of the wealthy distressed poor people and increased social tensions and crimes.
CHAPTER 6: American Society in Transition 85
While the political machines were corrupt, they did play a useful role. They helped immigrants settle into their new homeland, find housing, and obtain jobs. They also helped immigrants become naturalized citizens and even provided money to help them through hard times. The political machines were often the ones to get a street paved, extend a water pipe, or approve construction. But these services came at a very high price.

In the late nineteenth century, European immigrants flooded American cities in search of work and places to live. In many of the largest American cities, European immigrants even came to outnumber native-born Americans.
WHY IMMIGRANTS CAME
Immigrants have always come to the United States for a variety of reasons. Historians often divide these into “push” and “pull” factors. A desire to escape oppression, poverty, religious discrimination or ethnic persecution “pushed” immigrants out of their homelands. A belief that America offered freedom and economic opportunity as well as ties to relatives already living here generally “pulled” immigrants to these shores. They saw the United States as a land of unbounded opportunities. Immigrants who fled oppressive regimes in Europe yearned to live in a democratic society like the United States.

Before 1880, most immigrants to America came from parts of Northern Europe, especially Great Britain, Ireland, and Germany. In general, these immigrants were Protestants, except for large numbers of Irish Catholics. Most of these early immigrants spoke English.
Name______________________________________________________
CHAPTER 6: American Society in Transition 87
In their own communities, immigrants could speak their native language, attend their own churches and synagogues, and be among relatives and friends from the “Old Country.” Some of these communities even published newspapers in their own native language. However, living In these ethnic ghettos also isolated Immigrants from mainstream American life, making it harder for them to adopt new customs.
THE PROCESS OF AMERICANIZATION
While some adult immigrants attended night school to leam English, most were too busy working and caring for their families to spend time learning a new language or culture. It was left to their children to leam English and become “Americanized” — learning to dress, speak, and act like other Americans.
These immigrant children eventually became “assimilated” — similar to other Americans. America was seen as a “melting pot” in which immigrants were “melted” down and reshaped. America’s public schools greatly assisted in this process. Often Americanization was accompanied by conflict. For example, immigrant parents might desire an arranged marriage for their children, while their children insisted on finding their own marriage partners according to the American custom.
Immigrant children learn to speak English in a New York City public school.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
The following passage is from a letter that former President Theodore Roosevelt wrote to the President of the American Defense Society in January 1919:
“We should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good
faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else. It is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin .... There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn’t an American. We have room for but one language, and that is the English language, and we have room for but one loyalty and that is loyalty to the American people. We can have no ‘50-50’ allegiance in this country. Either a man is an American and nothing else, or he is not an American at all.”

THE INDIAN WARS
After the Civil War, Union troops were stationed in forts along the frontier. They defeated several of the tribes on the Great Plains and Southwest during the Indian Wars and moved them onto reservations. Typical was the contest with the Sioux Indians. After the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of Dakota in 1875, the Sioux were asked to move from their sacred grounds. The following year, Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse defeated General George Custer and killed 264 soldiers at Little Big Hom. Within two years, Crazy Horse was captured and killed and most of the Sioux were forced onto reservations. However, unrest among the Sioux in 1890 led to the slaughter of 300 unarmed Sioux men, women and children by machine gun fire at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.
THE IMPACT OF THE RAILROADS
As you learned in the last chapter, the Transcontinental Railroad, completed in 1869, reduced the journey from New York to San Francisco from six months to just ten days. Rail travel increased dramatically with its completion. Soon the United States led the world, with more railroad track mileage than England and France combined. The railroads attracted an increasing number of settlers to the west. Settlers could now ship their crops by rail to distant Eastern markets.
Railroad tracks also often ran through Native American territories, leading to new conflicts. From 1870 to 1890, the herds of buffalo on the Great Plains were destroyed by sharpshooters traveling by train. This development affected the ability of the Plains Indians to remain on the Plains.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
When the Texas legislature was considering a bill to protect the buffalo from sharpshooters, General Philip Sheridan spoke out against the bill:
“These men have done more in the last two years, and will do more in the next year, to settle the Indian question, than the entire regular army has done in the last forty years.
They are destroying the Indians’ [food supply] . And it is a well known fact that an army losing its base of supplies is placed at a great disadvantage. Send them powder and lead, if you will; but for a lasting peace, let them kill, skin, and sell until all of the buffaloes are exterminated. Then your prairies can be covered with speckled cattle.”

How did Sheridan feel about the slaughter of buffalo on the Great Plains? What effect did he predict if the slaughter continued?
Name_____________________________________
CHAPTER 6: American Society in Transition
93
In the late 1870s and 1880s, the herds were driven farther north a year before they were ready for slaughter. They fattened themselves by grazing on the plains of Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. However, by 1886, overgrazing had destroyed much of the grass.
Sheepherders and farmers had bought up much of the open range and enclosed it with barbed wire fences. Two severe winters and very hot summers killed millions of cattle in 1886-1887, finally ending the long drive.
But cattle ranchers remained, breeding cattle on the “closed range,” and sending their cattle eastwards by train each year to be fattened by eastern farmers.
FARMING ON THE GREAT PLAINS
The railroads also led farmers to occupy the Great Plains. The Homestead Act and the sale of railroad land-grants stimulated the movement of farmers westwards. The railroads made it possible for farmers on the Great Plains to ship their crops to the East. About half of the settlers were immigrants from Europe; the other half were the children of farmers from the East and Midwest.
At first, these farmers faced the hostility of both Indians and cattlemen. The Indians were defeated by federal troops in the “Indian Wars.” The cattlemen formed associations and hired men to commit acts of violence against the early homesteaders. Eventually, the farmers won this conflict because they came in greater numbers and were able to enclose their lands with barbed wire.
The farmers faced many natural obstacles on the Great Plains. From railroad advertisements, they had expected to find well-watered, wooded lands. Instead, when they arrived, they found little rainfall, few trees, tough soil, extreme temperatures, plagues of grasshoppers, and personal isolation. Some starved or returned to the East. Families that stayed were forced to do endless hours of heavy work. During the winter months, families might be snowed in for months on end. With technological ingenuity, they were able to overcome many obstacles. To make up for the lack of trees, they built sod-houses from clumps of grass and soil; they used barbed wire to keep cattle and other animals off their farms. They used steel plows to turn the soil, drilling equipment to dig deep water wells and windmills to haul water. They used harvesters and threshers to farm more acres with fewer workers.

—B

Native American Indians once occupied all of the present United States. They were composed of many different groups, speaking hundreds of different languages. The advancing line of settlement and diseases from Eurasia like smallpox severely reduced Native American populations and pushed them westwards.
GOVERNMENT POLICY
From 1830 to 1890, the U.S. government systematically followed a policy of pushing Native Americans from their traditional lands onto government reservations in the West.
Forced Removal. In 1830, Congress ordered the removal of all Native American Indians to west of the Mississippi. Nearly one-quarter of the Cherokees perished on the journey westward, known as the Trail of Tears.		Flood of Settlers. Large numbers of settlers overwhelmed the Native Americans. In 1869, the Transcontinental Railroad was completed. Along with the Homestead Act, the continuation of railroad lines made Native American lands even more desirable.
		
FACTORS ERODING NATIVE AMERICAN CONTROL OF THE WEST

Warfare. The technological superiority of the U.S. government made resistance futile. The Indian Wars, which pitted settlers and federal troops against Native American Indians, lasted from 1860 to 1890.		Destruction of Natural Environment. Competition between settlers, miners, and farmers for the land led to the destruction of the natural environment on which Native Americans depended for their livelihood.
THE RESERVATION
Once a particular Native American tribe submitted to federal authority, its members were settled on a reservation. Reservation lands were usually smaller than the lands from which the tribe was removed and often consisted of undesirable land. The federal government promised food, blankets, and seed but this policy clashed with tribal customs, since Native Americans were traditionally hunters, not farmers.
Under the new act, Indians did not need to give up tribal lands or customs to become citizens, as they did under the Dawes Act. Some historians see the act as a reward for Native American enlistment as soldiers in World War I. Since Native American Indians had served the nation in wartime, they deserved to be given American citizenship. Ten years later, the Dawes Act was replaced by an act guaranteeing tribal self-government.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Under the American Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, the government offered the following:
“[A] 11 non citizen Indians bom within the territorial limits of the United States be, and they are hereby, declared to be citizens of
the United States: Provided that the granting of such citizenship shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of any Indian to tribal or other property.”
Imagine you are a member of a government commission in 1930. Compare the Dawes Act, American Indian Citizenship Act, and earlier policies towards Native Americans. Then decide, after balancing all of the interests involved, which policy was most effective. Which best represented Native American Indian rights? Present your conclusions in a brief report.
Urbanization
Immigration
Urbanization. Movement of people from the countryside to cities.
Urbanization brought many problems:
•	Crowded tenements: one-room apartments that lacked daylight, adequate plumbing.
•	Pollution, sewage contamination of water.
•	Inability to supply essential public services — hospitals, police, schools, and clean streets.
•	Political corruption: "Political machines" run by political "bosses" helped immigrants but stole from city governments through overpriced contracts.
Why They Came:
•	"Push" Factors: oppression, poverty, wars, and ethnic persecution.
•	"Pull" Factors: belief in American freedom, economic opportunity, and cultural ties.
"New Immigrants:" Came from Southern and Eastern Europe, mostly Catholic and Jewish; often less educated; spoke no English. Process of Americanization.
•	Americanization. Immigrants learned to speak, act, and behave like Americans; often left to immigrant children.

?a/mAswa
A.
Farmers faced problems in the late 19th century. New farm machinery and the opening of the Great Plains led to overproduction. Food prices fell, as farmers’ expenses remained the same. Farmers fell into debt, while they were also charged excessive rates by railroads and grain storage operators. B.
Farmers organized in the Grange Movement to fight for their special interests. They passed laws regulating railroad rates. When the law was overturned by the Supreme Court, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act (1887). C.
Farmers next combined with industrial workers and miners into the Populist Party. They advocated many reforms that were later adopted by the major political parties and enacted by Congress. Populists believed the shortage of currency was responsible for falling prices. In 1896 and 1900, William Jennings Bryan was the candidate for the Populists and Democrats. Bryan lost both elections. D.
The Progressive Movement flourished in 1900-1920. Like the Populists, Progressives sought reform. They were mainly educated members of the middle class. They sought to correct abuses of big business, such as exploiting workers. They also sought to reform the corrupt practices of government. The roots of the movement were with the Populists, muckrackers, and Social Gospel Movement. Muckrakers, like Upton Sinclair, were investigative reporters. E.
States passed political reforms and social legislation. F.
On the eve of the Progressive Era, the federal government was reformed by the Pendleton Act, which reduced the number of political appointments and replaced them with candidates who had passed a competitive examination. G.
Progressive reforms were introduced at the national level by Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. H.
Theodore Roosevelt believed in a strong Presidency, and used his powers to safeguard the public interest. He used the anti-trust laws to curb the unfair practices of business. His Square Deal program passed laws protecting consumers. J.
William Howard Taft continued most of Roosevelt’s policies. When Roosevelt decided to run as the Bull Moose candidate in 1912, he split the Republican Party, helping Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic candidate, to win the election. K.
Woodrow Wilson furthered Progressive reforms with his New Freedom program. He lowered tariff duties and introduced a graduated income tax, made possible by the 16th Amendment. He created the Federal Reserve System to control the nation’s money supply. To control the unfair practices of big business, he passed the Clayton Anti-trust Act, creating the Federal Trade Commission.
L.
In art and literature, realism was popular in the late 19th century. Realism attempted to show things as they were, and gave writers and artists a way to depict the hardships and abuses of the new industrial workers. Some of the greatest writers included Horatio Alger, Mark Twain, and Kate Chopin. Noted artists included James McNeil Whistler, Winslow Homer, and Thomas Eakins. PROJECT WITHOUT PERMISSION
CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 107
GRANGER COOPERATIVES
Grangers tried to eliminate middlemen by forming farmers’ cooperatives to buy machinery, fertilizers, and manufactured goods in large numbers at a discount. The cooperatives also sold their crops directly to city markets. Because of a lack of business experience, many of the Granger cooperatives failed.
THE GRANGER LAWS
Farmers mainly blamed the railroads for their difficulties. They felt they were being overcharged by railroads and by grain storage operators. In several Midwestern states, Grangers elected candidates to state legislatures who promised reforms. These states passed laws regulating railroad and grain storage rates. In Munn v. Illinois (1877), the Supreme Court upheld the right of a state to regulate businesses that affected the public interest within the state.
However, in 1886 the Supreme Court reversed itself in a case involving the state regulation of railroad rates. The Court ruled that only Congress could regulate rates on interstate commerce. This decision ended the state regulation of railroads. The Grangers then turned their attention to Congress for help. As you learned in the previous chapter, Congress then passed the Interstate Commerce Act (1887). This act prohibited railroads from charging more for short hauls than for long hauls over the same route. The Interstate Commerce Commission, created to investigate complaints and to enforce the act, was the first federal government agency to regulate unfair business practices. These new regulations marked a change from the laissez-faire economy of the past.
Create a graphic organizer showing the costs and benefits of the Interstate Commerce Act (1887).
In 1892, farmers gave their support to the Populist Party, a new national political party representing the “common man” — farmers, industrial workers, and miners — in the battle against banking and railroad interests. Women played a prominent role in the Populist Movement as speakers and organizers.
THE POPULIST PLATFORM
Populists were convinced that rich industrialists and bankers had a stranglehold on government. Like the Grangers before them, the Populists wanted government to take a larger role, ending oppression, injustice, and poverty. In 1892, the Populists held a national convention at Omaha, Nebraska, where they chose a Presidential candidate. They also drew up a party platform that had several innovative proposals:
CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 109
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In 1896, the Democratic Party held its National Convention to pick their Presidential candidate. William Jennings Bryan’s “Cross of Gold” Speech was so powerful that he won the nomination:
“My friends, the question we are to decide is: upon which side will the Democratic Party fight; upon the side of 4the idle holders of idle capital’ or upon the side of 4the struggling masses’? That question the party must answer. You tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard; we reply that the great cities rest upon our broad and fertile prairies. Bum down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic. But destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.”
Bryan delivering his speech.
Which groups did Bryan appeal to in his speech to the Democratic Convention? How did he try to show that farmers were superior?
Election of 1900. Four years later, Bryan ran against McKinley again. When McKinley won a second time, this virtually brought an end to the Populist Party. New gold discoveries, higher farm prices, and rural migration to the cities weakened national interest in a separate farmer’s party in later years.

THE LEGACY OF POPULISM:
The Role of Third Parties
The Populist Party appeared suddenly in the 1890s and disappeared just as fast. Yet it left its mark on American history. Third parties often have an impact on the political process. They provide an outlet for minorities to voice grievances and generate new Ideas.
CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 111
The Progressive Movement flourished between 1900 and the start of World War I. Progressives took their name from their belief in “progress.” Although the Progressives borrowed ideas from the Populists and the labor movement, they differed in important ways. Progressives were mainly middle-class city dwellers, rather than farmers and workers. Their activities reflected the rising influence of the middle class. Writers, lawyers, ministers, and college professors provided their leadership.
The primary goal of the Progressives was to correct the political and economic injustices that had resulted from America’s industrialization. Progressives were appalled at the increasing inequalities between the wealthy and the poor. They did not oppose industrialization, but they wanted to use the power of government to correct its evils so that all
Americans, not just the wealthy, could enjoy better lives. To achieve this, the Progressives felt they also had to reform government itself — which had become corrupted by big business and political machines.
A poster from the Progressive Era alludes to class warfare.
Progressivism arose out of a combination of Protestant Evangelicalism, the activities of journalists, Populism, and the reaction of the educated middle class to abuses in industry and government. Progressives often felt threatened by the rise of big business, large labor unions, and corrupt political bosses. They acted out of a sense of moral responsibility, often based on their religious beliefs. Progressives exalted science and placed great confidence in the ability of using a scientific approach to solve social problems. Rather than accept corruption and poverty, they believed the government should take positive steps to identify problems and promote progress.
THE SOCIAL GOSPEL MOVEMENT
In the late nineteenth century, a new social movement emerged that was spearheaded by Protestant clergymen. Protestant ministers in the Social Gospel Movement called for social reforms — including the abolition of child labor and safer working conditions. They objected to the harsh realities of unregulated free enterprise and emphasized the ancient idea that each man was his brother’s keeper. Instead of accepting the existence of social problems as God’s will, groups like the Salvation Army emphasized the Christian duty to help those who were less fortunate.
CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 113
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Upton Sinclair’s book The Jungle portrayed the new industrial economy as inhumane, destructive, and uncaring. One scene in the book described piles of rat-infested, rotting meat being used to make sausages:
“[T]he meat would be shoveled into carts, and _________________
the man who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he saw one—there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.
There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner, and so they made a practice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage.
How might a reader in 1906 have reacted to this passage? Explain your answer.


The early Progressives identified political and social problems and made individual or local efforts to remedy them. The Progressives provide one of the best examples of Americans attempting to overcome problems through reform. The demand for reform has been a continuing theme throughout American history. Reform movements are usually based on the belief that society can be made better.
THE SOCIAL REFORMERS
Progressives were so shaken by the abuses of industrial society that some even made individual efforts at social reform. Settlement houses were started in slum neighborhoods by Progressives like
Jane Addams.
A settlement house was an all-purpose community center for poor people living in crowded city neighborhoods. The settlement house provided child care, nursing services, and English lessons to immigrants. Most of the settlement houses were staffed by volunteers. Jane Addams and her volunteers actually lived at Hull House among the people they were trying to help. Addams once described the main purpose of a settlement house as being to “help the foreign-bom conserve the value of their past life and to bring them into contact with a better class of Americans.”
Jane Addams (1860-1935)

CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 115
They also expanded city services to deal with urban overcrowding, fire hazards, and the lack of public services. Municipal governments often took direct ownership of utilities, such as water, electricity and gas. Some called this “gas and water” socialism. In some cities, Progressives even introduced new forms of municipal government to discourage corruption, such as governance by a city-manager or commission.
THE REFORM OF STATE GOVERNMENT
At the state level, Progressive governors like Robert LaFollette in Wisconsin and Theodore Roosevelt in New York similarly took steps to free their state governments from corruption and the influence of big business. LaFollette, for example, challenged political bosses and reduced the influence of railroad owners.
Progressives also introduced important political reforms to many states, such as the initiative, referendum, and recall. The purpose of these reforms was to end corruption and to make state government more directly accountable to the people. These reforms sought to raise the level of public participation in the political process and to give citizens more of a direct voice in state government by by-passing politicians. Many of these measures were borrowed from the Populists:
							
	Secret Ballot. Voters were less subject to pressure and intimidation when they could vote in secret.			Initiative. Voters could directly introduce bills in the state legislature and could vote on whether they wanted a bill passed.		Referendum. Voters could compel legislators to place a bill on the ballot for approval.

ROOSEVELT'S SQUARE DEAL
Before the Progressive Era, manufacturers could make wild and unsupported claims for medicines. There were no government agencies to check the purity and safety of food products. In the laissez-faire economy, consumers were supposed to look out for themselves. Roosevelt promised Americans a “Square Deal.” He launched new laws to protect consumer health and prevent false advertising. This Progressive legislation limited the operation of the laissez-faire economy. Roosevelt also worked to preserve the nation’s natural resources.

Although Roosevelt was young and popular, no President had ever run for more than two terms. In 1908, Roosevelt refused to break with tradition to run again. Instead, he helped his friend William Howard Taft win the Republican nomination.
A conservative Progressive, Taft was elected President with Roosevelt’s endorsement. Taft continued many of Roosevelt’s policies, such as trust-busting. However, Taft was not a skilled politician and alienated Progressives. He promised a lower tariff but was unable to get it passed. He returned to public sale some of the federal lands Roosevelt had withdrawn to protect the environment.
LABOR
During the Progressive Era, public attitudes towards unions began to change. One event that contributed to this change was the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in 1911, which killed 146 garment workers. Public sympathy for the workers grew when it was learned that the factory doors had been bolted shut from the outside, that the building lacked a sprinkler system, and that it had only one inadequate fire escape. Soon after this tragedy, Congress passed legislation sympathetic to unions.
CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 121
Witnesses thought owners were tossing fabric out of windows, but soon realized it was workers jumping to their deaths.
Department of Labor (1913). Congress created a separate Cabinet post to study the problems of labor, collect statistics and enforce federal labor laws. The Department of Labor was the direct result of a campaign by organized labor for a “Voice in the Cabinet,” and a goal of the Progressive Movement. The purpose of the department was “to promote and develop the welfare of working people, and to improve their working conditions.”
Clayton Anti-Trust Act (1914). A provision of this act prevented courts from applying anti-trust laws to restrict unions. The act also banned the use of federal injunctions (court orders) to prohibit strikes in labor disputes.
Child Labor Act (1916). Wilson passed a law prohibiting the sale of goods created by child labor in interstate commerce. However, this law was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court two years later.

CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 123
The Progressive Movement was accompanied by significant gains in women’s rights, for which women had been fighting for nearly a century.
In the early nineteenth century, the United States was a patriarchal society — men held positions of authority and women were considered to be inferior. Women lacked the right to vote, to serve on juries, or to hold public office. They were excluded from public life and were left in charge of the home and children. In most states, once a woman married, she lost control of her property and wages to her husband.
By the mid-nineteenth century, some women began to organize. In 1848, they held a convention in Seneca Falls, New York. The convention passed a resolution paraphrasing the Declaration of Independence. It proclaimed that women were equal to men and deserved the right to vote.
After the Civil War, women reformers hoped that freed slaves and women would be enfranchised at the same time. Women reformers were bitterly disappointed when the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments gave citizenship and the right to vote, or suffrage, to male freedmen, but not to women.
SUSAN B. ANTHONY
In 1872, Susan B. Anthony, a prominent reformer, attempted to vote in Rochester, New York, on the grounds that she was citizen and had that right under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, a judge refused to grant her the right to vote. In 1874, the Supreme Court then ruled that although women were citizens, they could not vote. Voting, according to the court, was not necessarily a “privilege” of citizenship.
Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906)
The fact that women did not have suffrage continued to be seen as a symbol of their inferior status and a violation of basic democratic principles. Anthony and other women reformers were able to obtain suffrage in a number of Western states, but they could not succeed in introducing a constitutional amendment requiring all states to give women the vote.
By 1890, the failure to achieve women’s suffrage led several women’s groups to merge together into the National American Woman Suffrage Association, under the leadership of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.

CHAPTER 7: The Progressive Era 125
THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT COMES TO AN END
The passage of women’s suffrage was the last notable reform of the Progressive Era. By 1920, the force of the Progressive Movement had spent itself. Americans had met many of the challenges posed by industrialization and were once again poised for economic growth.
The late nineteenth century was one of the most fertile periods of American literature. As the nation grew, the increasing rates of literacy, the rapid growth in urbanization, a rising population, and an increase in middle-class affluence provided a fertile environment for readers interested in understanding these rapid shifts in culture. The prevalence of newspapers and magazines, as well as cheap “dime novels,” created a market for literary works. Improvements in transportation and communications made it easier to travel and to share experiences. American writers were also deeply influenced by European novelists.
During these years, realism — defined as “nothing more or less than the truthful treatment of material” — was the leading literary fashion. Realists described life with as much detail as they could. Realism provided an opportunity to show the impact of industrialization and social change on people.
Just after the Civil War, the novels of Horatio Alger (1834-1899) praised hard work and discipline, and saw wealth as a sign of divine favor. His first novel, Ragged Dick (1868), was his most popular, and remained in print for the next forty years. The story of each novel was simple — a poor boy with few prospects significantly improves his position in life due to hard work and help from adults.
The novels of Mark Twain (1835-1910) reflected the differences between pre-Civil War society and afterwards. Twain associated the Old South with romanticism and the present with realism. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) described his childhood adventures in fictional form. The Gilded Age (1873) depicted the boom times after the Civil War, and gave a name to a historical period. His greatest work, Huckleberry Finn, treated the moral conflicts created by slavery. Twain’s use of regional accents gave his works a sense of realism.
William Dean Howells (1837-1920) was an important magazine editor who promoted realism. His novel, The Rise of Silas Lapham, described the struggles of the new rich to find acceptance in established society.

Ess| iiAL Questions
How did the Spanish-American War mark a "turning point" in American history? What strategic and political factors led America to become an imperial power? What were the main consequences of American imperialism?
J


This chapter looks at American foreign policy. Foreign policy refers to a country's policies towards other countries. Social scientists believe there are certain characteristics that make foreign policy special.
International Anarchy. Each independent, sovereign nation has its own laws that citizens must obey. If citizens fail to obey these laws, they can be punished. Sovereign countries, however, are not subject to such higher laws. For this reason, social scientists say that sovereign nations exist in a system of international anarchy. Each nation must depend on its own military and economic power to survive. On the other hand, countries usually follow some rules and customs to get along with one another.
Balance of Power. When one country becomes too powerful, other countries sometimes band together in an alliance or coalition to protect themselves and make sure the threatening power does not become any stronger. This tendency is known as maintaining the balance of power.
Control of U.S. Foreign Policy. In the United States, the Constitution places control of foreign policy in the hands of both the President and Congress. While the President and Secretary of State handle day-to-day diplomacy, they need Congress to vote funds to support their policies, or to declare war.
Traditional Foreign Policy. For much of their early history, Americans felt safe behind their two oceans. These oceans protected Americans from attack. President Washington had warned Americans to avoid entanglements with European nations, who were frequently at war with each other. Instead, he advised Americans to focus on the Western Hemisphere. For the first 150 years after independence, Americans largely followed Washington's advice.
National Interests. In the conduct of foreign policy, each nation is usually guided by its national interests. For the United States, these include security from attack, protecting American investments, and promoting American democracy and its way of life. To evaluate a particular foreign policy, you must determine how well it promotes these goals.

CHAPTER 8: America Builds an Empire 139
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In this climate of public opinion, President McKinley felt he had no choice but to ask Congress for permission to intervene in Cuba:
“[O]ur acts hitherto have been an unselfish desire for peace and prosperity in Cuba. The forced intervention of the United States as a neutral to stop the war may be briefly summarized as follows
First, in the cause of humanity to put an end to the barbarities, bloodshed, and miseries now existing there .... It is our duty, for it is right at our door. Second, we owe it to our citizens in Cuba ... to terminate the conditions that deprive them of legal protection. Third, the right to intervene may be justified by the serious injury to the commerce, trade, and business of our people .... Fourth, the present condition of affairs in Cuba is a constant menace to our peace — all these and others that I need not mention, with the resulting strained relations, are a constant menace to our peace and compel us to keep a semi-war footing with a nation with which we were at peace.”
Explain how would you have voted as a member of Congress in 1898.
Teddy Roosevelt (center) with his Rough Riders after taking San Juan Hill.
The Spanish-American War was fought on two fronts — in the Pacific and the Caribbean. Shortly after the start of the war, the U.S. Pacific fleet sailed to the Philippines to aid Filipino rebels already in revolt against Spain. The navy defeated a squadron of Spanish ships in Manila Bay.
Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt raised a volunteer force, known as the “Rough Riders.”
Acting with other army regiments, they defeated Spanish forces at San Juan Hill in Cuba. The U.S. Navy also took Guantanamo Bay. Nevertheless, some U.S. Army troops had to withdraw from Cuba because they were contracting Yellow Fever. Other forces occupied Guam and Puerto Rico. Within four months, Spain was defeated. American forces were left in occupation of the Philippines, Cuba,
Puerto Rico, and Guam.
THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR AS A TURNING POINT
The Spanish-American War marked the end of Spain’s colonial empire and the emergence of the United States as a world power. The war had let the United States demonstrate its naval strength to the world. It also raised a critical issue for Americans: What should the United States do with the former Spanish colonies it was now occupying? Many historians see the war as a turning point because the United States had awakened to its potential as a world power.
CHAPTER 8: America BuiLds an Empire 141
By the war’s end, the United States was occupying four of Spain’s former colonies. Many Americans believed they should annex them. These American “imperialists” saw this as a unique opportunity, pointing out how European powers had recently acquired colonies in Africa and Asia. They believed the United States should take its own colonies before there was nothing else left to grab.
The imperialists gave these arguments on behalf of U.S. colonial expansion:
Need For Raw Materials and Markets. The United States was now an industrial power. Colonies could provide needed raw materials for factories, a guaranteed market for manufacturers, and a place for farmers to sell their surplus crops.			Strategic Reasons. Some Americans believed colonies would promote American naval strength. With naval bases throughout the world, America would be able to maintain a powerful navy to protect its interests.
			
REASONS FOR COLONIAL EXPANSION
it ———1 			
Nationalism. Some saw colonial expansion as a means of showing that the United States was a great and powerful nation. They argued that the European powers were gathering colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, and that the United States should grab its own colonies before nothing was left.			Attitudes towards other Peoples. Many Americans believed in Anglo-Saxon superiority — that Americans were a "superior race" that should rule others. Progressives believed that by spreading American institutions, they could help other, less fortunate peoples. Missionaries wanted to convert native peoples to Christianity.
Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan, President of the Naval War College, was America’s leading advocate for imperial expansion. Theodore Roosevelt was one of Mahan’s followers. In his The Influence of Sea Power upon History (1890), Mahan focused on the harsh political realities of expansion. Mahan argued that to achieve world power, a country needed a powerful navy. For this, a country also needed a large merchant marine to supply its sailors. Finally, a world power required colonies and naval bases to provide coaling stations for its steamships, and to create the trade needed to support its merchant ships.
Because other powers were also competing for naval supremacy Alfred Thayer Mahan and world markets, Mahan believed it was essential for Americans	7
to seize control of Pacific trade routes, to construct a canal through Central America, and to dominate the Caribbean region. Geographically, Americans would then control the sea lanes from the Caribbean Sea across the Pacific Ocean all the way to China and Japan.
CHAPTER 8: America Builds an Empire 143
In the end, the Imperialists won the argument. After the Spanish-American War, the United States acquired a colonial empire consisting of the Philippines, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Samoa, and Midway. One U.S. Senator and Anti-Imperialist League member mourned “the danger that we are to be transformed from a Republic, founded on the Declaration of Independence, into a vulgar, common empire, founded on force.” A Congressional resolution, passed just before the war, had guaranteed the independence of Cuba, but even this island came under the informal control of the United States. Cubans were forced to agree to the Platt Amendment, which gave the United States the right to intervene in Cuban affairs at any time.

CHAPTER 8: America BuiLds an Empire 145
Geography placed Americans in an advantageous position for trade with East Asia: they were separated from this region only by the Pacific Ocean. Clipper ships brought Chinese tea and other goods from East Asia to the United States. After 1898, control of several Pacific islands gave the United States greater influence in the Pacific. These colonial acquisitions also increased American opportunities for trade with both China and Japan.
CHINA
In China, European powers had already established exclusive “spheres of influence” (areas where they enjoyed special privileges) in the 1850s. The United States did not have a sphere of influence there, but had long carried on active trade in China. If other nations were permitted to partition China, the United States would likely be blocked from future economic activities. U.S. Secretary of State John Hay was anxious to protect American businessmen and investors there. He worried that American trade
would be shut out of China by these European powers. Hay saw China as a vital market for America’s new industrial economy.
In 1899, Hay announced the “Open Door” Policy, giving equal trading rights to all foreign nations in China. Hay sent notes to the other major powers and declared his policy to be in effect.
Only a few months later, in 1900, a rebellion erupted in China.
It was led by the Boxers, a group opposing Western influence in China. The Boxer Rebellion threatened the lives of foreigners living in China. An international army, with U.S. participation, was sent to China where it crushed the rebellion. Hay announced that the United States would oppose any attempt by other nations to use the rebellion as an excuse to dismember China.
JAPAN
The United States opened an isolationist Japan to Western trade and influence when Commodore Matthew Perry landed there with American gun ships in 1853. By the 1890s, Japan had adopted Western ways and had become the first Asian industrial power. Japan also adopted imperialist policies, defeating China in 1894. In 1905, Japan surprised the West by defeating Russia in the Russo-Japanese War. President Roosevelt brought the Russians and Japanese together and negotiated a peaceful settlement in the Treaty of Portsmouth (1905). He won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.
President Roosevelt meets with the Japanese and Russian delegates.

CHAPTER 8: America Builds an Empire 147
CUBA
Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean. As you learned earlier, Congress had passed a resolution before the Spanish-American War not to annex Cuba. Nevertheless, after the war, Cuba became a “protectorate” under American control. U.S. forces remained on the island, and American businesses invested heavily in Cuba. Cubans were forced to agree to the Platt Amendment, which gave the United States the right to intervene in Cuban affairs at any time. The Platt Amendment was not repealed until the 1930s.
PANAMA CANAL
During the Spanish-American War, warships in the Pacific fleet had to sail 16,000 miles around the tip of South America to reach the Caribbean. This highlighted the need for a canal to send ships back and forth between the two oceans instead of having two separate naval fleets. The Isthmus of Panama, the narrowest point in Central America, was the best place to build the canal.
At this time, Panama was a part of Colombia. The United States and the government of Colombia entered into negotiations but could not agree on terms. While President Roosevelt was waiting to hear from Colombia, he struck a
deal with Panamanian rebels who wished to obtain their independence. Roosevelt sent a U.S. warship to Panama to protect the rebels when they took action. Immediately afterwards, Roosevelt recognized Panama as a new country. In return, the new government of Panama gave the United States complete control of a 10-mile strip of rainforest through the center of Panama, known as the Panama Canal Zone.
The Challenges of Building the Canal. President Roosevelt ordered the building of the canal almost at once. The construction of the canal presented as many problems as the political obstacles. Construction of its 51-mile length took 10 years (1903-1914) to complete, at a cost of thousands of lives and $400 million.
Because the canal crossed landforms at different elevations, engineers had to design a series of six giant locks. Panama’s tropical climate posed special challenges: workers labored in intense heat as they cut through mountains and dense rainforests. Heavy rains caused frequent mudslides. Dr. Walter Reed had just discovered that yellow fever was spread by mosquitoes. To reduce the threat of yellow fever, Dr. William Gorgas of the U.S. Army, ordered all swamps drained, vegetation cut down, and all standing water sprayed with oil to prevent further breeding of mosquito larvae.

Wilson quickly followed the pattern of Presidents Roosevelt and Taft by sending troops to Haiti, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic to protect American interests. President Wilson also expanded America’s colonial empire by purchasing the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917.
Mexico was already undergoing a violent revolution when Woodrow Wilson became President. Wilson refused to recognize its new government, which had seized power through violence. Instead, he adopted a policy of “watchful waiting.” When troops of the rebel leader Pancho Villa murdered Americans in New Mexico and retreated across the border,
Wilson reacted. He sent an American Expeditionary Force into Mexico under General John J. Pershing to apprehend him. Nevertheless, Pancho Villa eluded capture. Wilson
finally withdrew these troops in 1917, when America entered World War I in Europe.

CHAPTER 9: America in World War I 155
IMPORTANT IDEAS
■ill
A.
Nationalism, economic rivalry, the alliance system, and militarism contributed to the outbreak of World War I in Europe. In 1914, Europe was divided Into two alliances. The spark that began the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Slav nationalists with Serbian help. B.
German troops marched through neutral Belgium and invaded France, but were halted before they could take Paris. New and improved weapons, like the machine gun, created a new form of warfare. Each side dug trenches, set up machine guns, and put land mines in the “no-man’s land” between the trenches. C.
Germany tried to use its U-boats {submarines) to break the British naval blockade that sought to starve Germany and Austria-Hungary into submission. D.
By 1918, the war had become deadlocked. Neither side was strong enough to overcome the other. E.
President Woodrow Wilson tried to follow America’s traditional policy of neutrality, by not taking sides in the early years of the war. However, the United States shared its language, political system, and many traditions with Great Britain and France. Americans were shocked by Germany’s invasion of Belgium, which was sensationalized in the press. Germany sent a message offering to help Mexico regain the American Southwest if it joined the war on Germany’s side. F.
German submarines sank ships with American passengers, such as the Lusitania and the Sussex. Germany attempted to avoid such incidents, but Americans were supplying Britain with war materials while Germany was suffering from a British blockade. In 1917, Germany announced it would resume unrestricted submarine warfare and sank more ships. Wilson asked Congress to declare war. G.
The United States prepared the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), under the command of General John Pershing. When the AEF arrived in Europe, it broke the deadlock in the war. Men like Alvin York showed great bravery in the war. H.	| President Wilson announced America’s war aims in the Fourteen Points before
the war’s end. The Fourteen Points demanded the reorganization of Europe based on nationalism. Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey would be divided into smaller national states. Poland would be restored as an independent country. Economic barriers like tariffs would be lowered. Finally, Wilson envisioned a League of Nations — an international peace-keeping organization.
I.
Germany surrendered in 1918. President Wilson traveled to Europe to participate in the Paris Peace Conference. To get his allies to agree to the League of Nations, Wilson made many concessions. Against Wilson’s wishes, the Versailles Treaty treated Germany harshly. Germany was made to accept responsibility for starting the war and had to pay reparations to the victorious allies. J.
When Wilson returned home, the U.S. Senate, led by Henry Cabot Lodge, rejected the treaty. The United States never joined the League of Nations. CHAPTER 9: America in World War I 157
Austria gave an ultimatum to Serbia and then invaded Serbia to avenge the assassination. They were encouraged by their ally, Germany. Existing alliances quickly brought the other major powers into the war. Russia was allied to Serbia; Germany was allied to Austria-Hungary; and Britain and France were allied to Russia. What might have been a minor regional crisis quickly escalated into a major European war. The generals on each side hoped for a quick victory before their enemies could get their forces into action.

Military leaders on both sides predicted the war would be over quickly. To avoid a two-front war, German war plans called for their army to march through neutral Belgium to take Paris before Russia could enter the war. The Germans advanced across Belgium into France, but they were stopped before reaching Paris.
New and improved weapons were used to fight the war, including the machine gun, poison gas, submarines, and airplanes. These weapons made it easier to defend positions than to attack. Soldiers dug deep, fortified trenches. Soon trenches extended hundreds of miles along eastern France, on Germany’s “Western Front.”
“Trench warfare” was a new and strange form of warfare that the world had never seen. These trenches were separated by fields of barbed wire and mines known as
“no man’s land.” Anyone who climbed out of the trenches faced instant death from enemy machine gun fire. Soldiers spent years in the trenches, facing shelling from artillery fire for hours each day. Since neither side could advance, fighting lines became stationary.

CHAPTER 9: America in World War I 159
Freedom of the Seas. The main reason for American entry into World War I was German unrestricted submarine warfare:
The British Blockade. A British naval blockade prevented food and arms from being shipped to Germany. Meanwhile, the United States became the main source for Allied arms, supplies and food. The German navy was too weak to break through the British blockade. By using submarines, Germany was able to retaliate by sinking merchant ships delivering goods to Great Britain. However, unlike battleships, submarines had no room to pick up survivors.
+ Sinking of the Lusitania. The Lusitania was a British passenger ship. In 1915, the Lusitania left New York City for Liverpool. Unknown to her passengers, much of the cargo below deck was made up of munitions for the British war effort. A German submarine sank this British passenger ship, killing more than 1,000 passengers, including 128 Americans. The sinking of the Lusitania enraged opinion in the United States.
A
U-boat sank the Lusitania, killing 1,198 passengers Sussex Pledge. The Sussex was a French ship that provided ferry service on the English Channel. After a German submarine attacked the ship in 1916, killing more than 50 passengers, President Wilson threatened to break off relations with Germany. Germany pledged not to sink any more ocean liners without prior warning or providing help to passengers.
Germany Announces Unrestricted Submarine Warfare. Suffering from near-starvation by the British blockade, desperate German leaders announced finally that they would sink all ships in the blockaded areas. This declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare violated the principle of “freedom of the seas” — the right of neutral nations like the United States to ship non-military goods to nations at war. When German submarines then actually attacked American merchant vessels, President Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany.

CHAPTER 9: America in World War I 161
Alvin York (1887-1964) was a devoted Bible reader, and almost avoided military service as a conscientious objector. He was drafted into the army at age 29. In many respects, he was typical of the draftees — underprivileged and undereducated — who were sent to France to make the world “safe for democracy.” In the Battle of the Argonne Forest, with nothing more than his rifle and pistol, he reportedly killed 25 Germans and captured 132 prisoners.
Alvin York
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The passage below is from The Diary of Alvin York. York was bom in a two-room log cabin in the hills of Tennessee:
“My little old mother and Pastor Pile wanted to get me out [of the army]. Pastor Pile put in a plea to the government that it
was against the religion of our church to fight. He filled the papers out and sent them to me to sign. The army told me all I had to do was to sign them. I refused. My mother, too, put in a plea to get me out as her sole support. My father was dead and I was supporting my family. I had brothers [in Tennessee] that could look after my mother. So I never asked for an exemption from service. I never was a conscientious objector. I didn’t want to fight and kill. But I had to answer the call of my country.”
Imagine you are Sergeant York or some other soldier in the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front during World War I. Write a letter to your family at home describing your experiences.
To fight the war, President Wilson was given sweeping powers by Congress. He established several agencies to regulate the economy during the war. Railroads were placed under direct government control. Congress passed the Selective Service Act (1917) and millions of Americans registered for the draft. Almost two million American troops eventually reached Europe, while women and African Americans filled many of their jobs at home. The cost of the war, about $30 billion, was paid for by higher taxes and war bonds. The war greatly benefited the American economy, since exports to the Allied powers greatly increased.
During the war, civil liberties were curtailed to meet wartime needs. The Espionage Act of 1917 made it a crime to criticize the war effort.

THE U.S. SENATE REJECTS THE TREATY
President Wilson hoped that the League of Nations would prevent future wars, but his opponents in Congress argued that it would drag the country into unnecessary military commitments. Wilson needed two-thirds of the U.S. Senate to ratify the Versailles Treaty, but he rejected any compromise with the Senate.
Henry Cabot Lodge (1850-1924) had studied history and political science at Harvard University. He was a friend of Theodore Roosevelt’s and a strong supporter of imperialism. Lodge had been in charge of the Congressional committee that had investigated the conduct of the U.S. Army in suppressing rebels in the Philippines. He was a strong opponent of the League of Nations. He believed that if the United States joined the League, it would lose its freedom of action.
Henry Cabot Lodge
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Below is a speech by Henry Cabot Lodge, Senate Majority Leader in 1919, He sets forth his objections to the League of Nations:
“The independence of the United States is not only more precious to ourselves but to the world than any single possession.
Is there any country today on the face of the earth which can compare with our liberty, our peace, and our freedom? I will go as far as anyone in world service, but the first step to world service is the maintenance of the United States. I have always loved one flag and I cannot share that devotion [with] a mongrel banner created for a League of Nations. I have never had but one allegiance, and I cannot divide it now. The United States is the world’s best hope, but if you tie her to the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the [troubles] of Europe, you will destroy her power for good and endanger her very existence.”
What reasons does Lodge give for opposing membership in the League of Nations?
To overcome the Senate’s objections, President Wilson decided to appeal directly to American voters for support, He went on a national speaking tour, but he had failed to gauge the feelings of most Americans. During his tour, Wilson suffered a stroke. Later, the Senate refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. Despite Wilson’s grand vision, the United States never joined the League of Nations.
AMERICA RETREATS INTO ISOLATIONISM
By 1919, most Americans were disillusioned with world affairs. The small gains they seemed to have made in World War I came at a terrible cost. Americans once again heeded George Washington’s advice to avoid European entanglements, and they turned their attention towards their material well-being at home.

The weather was gloomy and the air chilled one to the bones.

IMPORTANT IDEAS
A.
The 1920s were a period of economic prosperity and of new cultural values. B.
Immediately after the war, Americans experienced a temporary recession as businesses adjusted from a wartime to a peacetime economy. Americans, frightened by the triumph of Communism in Russia, experienced a “Red Scare.” Attorney General Palmer arrested thousands of suspects and deported them. C.
Nativism and racism were also on the rise, and Americans retreated to a more traditional isolationist foreign policy. D.
Three Republican Presidents pursued pro-business policies with low taxes and high tariff rates. Warren Harding proposed a “return to normalcy,” but his administration was beset by corruption as later revealed by the Teapot Dome Scandal and other scandals. Calvin Coolidge believed the “business of America is business,” while Herbert Hoover saw “rugged individualism” as the spirit that had made America into a great nation. E.
Several factors contributed to the economic prosperity of the 1920s. The most important one was the spread of the automobile. Henry Ford used assembly-line production to lower car prices, bringing ownership in reach of most Americans. F.
Electricity and electrical appliances also greatly helped to stimulate the economy. G.
Corporate profits led stock prices to rise. Many Americans became involved in speculation in the stock market and real estate, in the hopes of getting rich. H.
The 1920s saw a clash of cultural values. The Eighteenth Amendment banned the sale of alcoholic beverages. Tennessee passed a law banning the teaching of evolution. This law came to national attention in the Scopes “Monkey Trial.” A teacher broke the law and was defended by Clarence Darrow. William Jennings Bryan helped the prosecution. I.
There was also a rise of Nativist feeling and the introduction of restrictions on immigration, establishing quotas for the first time. Eugenics attempted to promote what were considered to be superior genetic characteristics. J.
Women gained the right to vote with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. The 1920s saw greater freedom for women as they wore less restrictive clothing, entered the work force in greater numbers, and began gaining college educations. K.
Millions of African-Americans began moving from the rural South to cities in the North and Midwest during and after World War I In the Great Migration. L.
The vibrant African-American community in Harlem in New York City became the cultural center of the Harlem Renaissance. Writers like Alaine Locke and Langston Hughes celebrated their heritage. Marcus Garvey attempted to organize African Americans in a Back-to-Africa Movement. M.
Writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald depicted the lifestyles of the young and materialistic rich in the 1920s, while Sinclair Lewis ridiculed American hypocrisy. CHAPTER 10: The "Roaring Twenties" 175
The end of World War I brought new fears to many Americans of Communists, anarchists, and immigrants. Russia had been ill-prepared for the war. In 1917, strikes in cities and soldiers’ mutinies had led to the overthrow of the Tsar. Later in the year, Communist revolutionaries, led by Vladimir Lenin, had seized power.
Communists threatened to spread their revolution to other countries in Europe, like Germany and Hungary. When a wave of strikes also hit the United States in 1919, many Americans feared this was the start of their own Communist revolution. This “Red Scare” created an atmosphere of panic.
Palmer Raids. In January 1919, an Italian anarchist set off a bomb outside the home of Attorney General Mitchell Palmer. The bombing was one in a series of attacks that day on judges, politicians, and law enforcement officials in eight American cities, including Cleveland and New York. The nation demanded that action be taken. This convinced Palmer that a radical plot to overthrow the U.S. government was underway. In January 1920, Palmer ordered the round-up of 4,000 suspects in several cities without warrants. His assistant, J. Edgar Hoover, directed the raids. Palmer arrested men he accused of plotting to overthrow the government. Most were later released, but 600 were eventually deported.
The Sacco and Vanzetti Case. The anti-Communist hysteria affected immigrants as well. Two Italian immigrants, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, were convicted of committing murder during a robbery. The robbery was allegedly committed to obtain funds for an anarchist revolution. Pressure for their release came from around the world. Many Americans feared looking weak to the rest of the world if they let them go. Although the evidence was insufficient to convict them, the judge was extremely partial in his conduct of the trial. Both Sacco and Vanzetti were found guilty and executed in 1927. Supporters of Sacco and Vanzetti’s innocence believed their conviction was due to their anarchist views, despite jurors who insisted that anarchism had played no part in their decision.
Sacco (left) and Vanzetti.
THE RISE OF NATIVISM AND RACISM
The Red Scare, anarchist bombings, and the Sacco and Vanzetti trial contributed to the rise of nativism — a dislike of foreigners. Nativists believed white Protestant Americans were superior to other people. As you will leam later in this chapter, these attitudes led to new restrictions on immigration. The migration of African Americans from the South to Northern cities also led to Increased racial tensions after the war. The Ku Klux Kian, dead for decades, found new life in 1915. Kian members were hostile to immigrants, Catholics, Jews, and African Americans. Major race riots broke out just after the war in many American cities. The worst riot occurred in Chicago, where 38 people were killed. The lynching of African Americans also continued, as well as segregation In the South.

Harding also resisted anti-Semitism. His campaign manager was a Jewish-American from Texas, Albert Lasker, also known as the “Father of Modern Advertising.” Harding signed an act creating child health care centers. He also pursued arms reduction by sponsoring the Washington Naval Conference and supporting U.S. membership in the World Court.
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The message below was delivered by President Harding as part of his Inaugural Address in 1921:
“We must seek the readjustment with care and courage. [W]e must strive for normalcy to reach stability .... The forward course of the business cycle is unmistakable. Peoples are turning from destruction to production. Industry has sensed the changed order and [is] turning to resume their normal, onward way. The call is for productive America to go on. I speak for administrative efficiency, for lightened tax burdens, for sound commercial practices, for adequate credit facilities, for sympathetic concern for all agricultural problems, for the omission of unnecessary interference of government with business, for an end to government’s experiment in business, and for more efficient business in government administration.”
How did Harding intend to return Americans “to normalcy”?
One of Harding’s most serious weaknesses was that he appointed personal friends — the Ohio Gang — who turned out to be dishonest. One Cabinet member, the Secretary of the Interior, leased oil-rich government lands at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, to two business friends in exchange for personal bribes. The Teapot Dome Scandal, uncovered just after Harding’s death in 1923, was one of the worst scandals in U.S. history.
Additional scandals emerged in other departments. Another of Harding’s appointments, Charles Forbes, stole millions from the construction of hospitals for returning war veterans. Because of Harding’s poor choices for Cabinet positions, these scandals have left a lasting stain on his reputation.
As Governor of Massachusetts, Calvin Coolidge had come to national attention during the Boston police strike of 1919. In a telegram to Samuel Gompers, President of the AFL, he wrote, “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anyone, anywhere, any time.” Based on his record as Governor, Coolidge was selected as Harding’s Vice-President. He became President when Harding died suddenly in 1923. Coolidge was then elected for another term in 1924.

Ford’s new assembly line production was so efficient he was able to double wages overnight while slashing prices, Ford wanted to give workers enough buying power to purchase the cars and other goods they were mass-producing.
THE RISE OF OTHER NEW INDUSTRIES
The 1920s saw new discoveries and inventions in almost every field, laying the framework for many new businesses. These inventions included improvements in transmitting electrical power, improved motors, and a new trans-Atlantic telephone service. New household appliances, like the vacuum cleaner, refrigerator and toaster, were also introduced. Radio and motion pictures became widespread. The American chemical industry expanded and the use of oil and natural gas increased. These new industries created new jobs, and changed the ways Americans lived.
Glenn Curtiss. The first airplane, using an engine similar to that in a car, was flown by the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1902. Glenn Curtiss was an early aviation pioneer. In 1908, he turned his attention to designing a seaplane that could take off and land on water. Three years later, he successfully flew his “hydroeroplane” in San Diego Bay, landing on a naval ship. His landing marked the birth of U.S. naval aviation, and convinced the Secretary of the Navy to buy the navy’s first aircraft. In 1912, Curtiss developed a larger “flying boat.” In 1919, he constructed the first airplane to cross the Atlantic Ocean for the U.S. Navy.

Ford Motors was the first to master the assembly line.
The 1920s saw remarkable improvements in manufacturing efficiency.
As you know, Ford had introduced electric conveyor belts to his assembly lines. Each car moved along the belt to different groups of workers who completed one small part of the assembly. With this method, production was suddenly six times faster.
Use of the conveyer belt and other new techniques spread, making industry generally more productive.
When manufacturers first adopted the assembly line to their production process, they often achieved
dramatic gains in productivity, and consumers benefited from lower prices. However, one unforeseen consequence was a radical change in the nature of factory work. Skilled workers were no longer needed, even in complex manufacturing operations like car assembly.

By 1933, most Americans saw this “experiment” in morals as a failure. Many people had simply refused to accept the ban on alcohol. Although illegal, alcoholic drinks were widely available at “speakeasies” and other underground drinking establishments. Even President Harding drank alcohol in the White House. Fewer than fourteen years after the ban on alcoholic drinks went into effect, Prohibition was repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment (1933). The experience of Prohibition demonstrated that unpopular laws are sometimes unenforceable.
THE SCOPES "MONKEY TRIAL" OF
1925 An even greater clash between traditionalists and modernists took place in the 1920s in Tennessee, the first state to pass a law against the teaching of Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. State legislators believed that Darwin had contradicted the Biblical account of Creation. In 1925, John Scopes, a biology teacher, was arrested for teaching his class about the theory of evolution. Scopes was arrested and put on trial.
The Scopes “Monkey Trial” drew nationwide attention for pitting older religious beliefs against new scientific theories.
The state was represented by William Jennings Bryan as special prosecutor, while the famed attorney Clarence Darrow defended Scopes. Bryan and Darrow were considered to be the greatest orators of their day, and the Scopes trial became the first in American history to be broadcast over national radio. Darrow cross-examined Bryan as an expert on the Bible, pointing to seeming contradictions in the Biblical text. In the end, Scopes was convicted for teaching evolution, but his $1 fine was later set aside.
Clarence Darrow argues one of this points during the Scopes “Monkey Trial.”
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Journalist H.L. Mencken wrote the following just before the trial:
“No principle is at stake ... save the principle that school teachers, like plumbers, should stick to the job that is set before them, and not go roving around the house, breaking windows, raiding
the cellar, and demoralizing children. When a [teacher] takes his oath of office, he renounces his right to free speech quite as certainly as a bishop does, or a colonel in the army, or an editorial writer of a newspaper. He becomes a paid propagandist of certain definite doctrines, and every time he departs from them deliberately, he deliberately swindles his employers.”
Which side does Mencken support and what were his reasons for doing so? Do you agree or disagree with this argument? Why?

Write a brief position paper on whether you believe in the basic ideas of eugenics. Support your position using research from the Internet or from your school library.
In opposition to these traditional values were the newer, modem values of the period, which encouraged greater openness and self-expression.
WOMEN
The decade opened with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, giving women the right to vote. New household appliances reduced housework, and greater numbers of women now went to college. As more women worked, they demonstrated a new economic independence and became more assertive. This brought about changes in manners and morals. Young women began to smoke and drink in public. They rejected restrictive clothing and instead adopted the new look of the “flapper.” Flappers wore short dresses that revealed their body shapes as well as their legs and arms. Their hair was short and choppy, and they also wore a lot of make up. Young women went out on dates or to dances without a chaperone. Flappers enjoyed energetic popular dances like the Charleston. People began reading Sigmund Freud and treating sexuality more openly.
The “flapper” look.
TIN PAN ALLEY
After the Civil War, thousands of pianos were sold to individuals. As a result, the demand for sheet music exploded. Around 1910, New York City began to emerge as the capital of popular music publishing. Tin Pan Alley, a section of New York City, was the area where song-writing and musical ideas mixed together to form American popular music. Various styles, such as blues, jazz, and ragtime, were melded together.
Publishers were surprised to discover that sheet music for popular tunes was being bought up by ordinary people who just wanted to play these songs at home. During this same period, vaudeville became the most popular form of stage entertainment. Vaudeville shows had a great need for music and the publishing houses of Tin Pan Alley were glad to provide them since a great deal of money was made by selling the songs they popularized.

CHAPTER 10: The "Roaring Twenties" 189
In the first two decades of the twentieth century, Chicago’s African-American population more than doubled; Cleveland’s grew by three times; and Detroit’s increased sixfold. African Americans were still greeted by racism, housing shortages and crime, even in the North, but they also found organizations such as the National Urban League and the NAACP, which were dedicated to helping them adjust to their new lives. Confined to allblack neighborhoods, African Americans created cities-within-cities. The largest of these was Harlem, in upper Manhattan of New York City. About 200,000 African Americans lived together there in one of the most vibrant communities of the 1920s.
THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE
The 1920s is often referred to as the Jazz Age, reflecting the great importance of this new form of African-American music. The general awakening of African-American culture in these years has become known as the Harlem Renaissance.
The Harlem Renaissance was begun by a rising middle class of African Americans. It was more than simply about music. It reached into other forms of art such as dance and visual arts. It sought to bring recognition to the African-American community. It was an era in which many African Americans felt as though they
Famous hot spots included the Cotton Club and the Apollo Theater.
Langston Hughes (1902-1962)
had liberated themselves from a past marked by self-doubt and uncertainty. They shared an unprecedented level of optimism, a pride in all things black, and a confidence in their own future that reached beyond Harlem to other African-American communities.
Poets and writers like Langston Hughes (1902-1967) and Alain Locke expressed this new pride in their heritage, while attacking racism. They felt their accomplishments in literature and art demonstrated their value as a people. Hughes is recognized as one of America’s best poets. Bom in Missouri, he was drawn to Harlem like other African-American artists and writers.
Hughes drew on his personal experiences in writing about what it was like to be an African American growing up in America. His poems, novels, plays and newspaper columns made him one of the most popular writers of the Harlem Renaissance. His writings expressed the new mood of rugged determination to overcome racial prejudice. Countee Cullen was another leading poet, who won more major literary prizes than any other African-American writer of the 1920s. Zora Neale Hurston became one the first
successful African-American women authors. In 1937, she published what is considered her greatest novel, Their Eyes Watching God.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Lindbergh’s flight served as a bridge between tradition and modernity. John Ward wrote an essay, The Meaning of Lindbergh’s Flight, in which he looked at the impact of his flight on history:
“Lindbergh, in every remark about his flight and in his writings,
resisted the tendency to exploit the flight as the achievement of an individual. He never said ‘I,’ he always said ‘We.’ But there was always the fact that his exploit was a victory of the machine over nature. There was another aspect, one in which the public celebrated the machine and the society of which it was a product. By calling Lindbergh a pioneer, people could read into history the need [for] turning back to the frontier past. Yet people could also read history in terms of progress into the future. They did this by emphasizing the machine involved in Lindbergh’s flight.”
What did Ward think was the one of the meanings of Lindbergh’s flight?

Ess :al Questions
OWhat were the causes of the Great Depression?
O/z Why was Herbert Hoover unable to cope with the Great Depression?
O— what were the effects of the Great Depression?
O" " How did the New Deal offer a new approach to confronting the Depression?
Economies historically pass through good and bad periods that regularly repeat themselves. These up-and-down periods of business activity are referred to as the business cycle. The bad times are called depressions — characterized by business failures, high unemployment, and falling prices. The Great Depression was the worst depression in our nation’s history.
A variety of factors caused the economy to move from the prosperity of the 1920s to the severe depression of the 1930s.
OVERPRODUCTION
The 1920s had witnessed rapid economic expansion as manufacturers made and sold new products like cars, radios, and refrigerators. Many consumers, however, lacked the money to buy these goods. Manufacturers were soon producing more goods than they could sell.
SPECULATION
In the 1920s, stocks soared in value. As you learned in Chapter 10, many people bought stocks hoping to “get rich quick.” This drove stock prices ever higher. Each day the speculative boom on the stock market saw more people investing in Wall Street. By 1929, stock prices had tripled since 1920.
Buying on Margin. In the 1920s, stocks could be purchased for a 10% down-payment, called a margin. The
rest of the price was financed by a loan from the stock broker. It was similar to making a purchase on the installment plan. The buyer paid only 10% of the stock’s value and promised to pay the rest when the stock was sold.

CHAPTER 11: The Great Depression and the New Deal
FROM WALL STREET TO MAIN STREET
After the stock market crash, corporations could no longer raise funds. People who lost their money in the stock market could not repay their loans or rents, leading to bank failures. Thousands of people lost their life savings.
In this new economic climate, the demand for goods decreased. As prices fell, factories closed, and workers lost their jobs. Demand was reduced still further, causing prices to fall even more. Other factories closed, and the country became caught in the grips of a vicious downward spiral. People could not pay their rents or mortgages, and people lost their homes. There was no one to buy the foreclosed houses and home prices plummeted downward. Without any kind of “safety net,” such as unemployment insurance, hundreds of thousands of American workers found themselves living on the street or in makeshift shacks.
203
Many Americans lost their homes in the Depression.
THE HUMAN IMPACT OF THE DEPRESSION
The Great Depression was a national nightmare. During the 1920s, many Americans had started to equate their self-worth with their material possessions. When the Great Depression struck, people felt worthless. The reality of economic chaos and confusion replaced the nation’s traditional optimistic outlook. People waited for events to turn, spinning in circles as they fought for their daily survival. Businesses failed, farmers lost their farms, banks failed, and millions of people were out of work. There was no unemployment insurance or bank deposit insurance. Private charities were overwhelmed. People were homeless and went hungry. Millions depended on soup kitchens for their food.
Writers like John Steinbeck and photographers like Dorothea Lange recorded the misery of the Great Depression.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In 1932, a young lyricist named E.Y. Harburg wrote the song that became the anthem of the Great Depression, “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?”:
“They used to tell me I was building a dream, and so I followed the mob,
When there was earth to plow, or guns to bear, I was always there right on the job. They used to tell me I was building a dream, with peace and glory ahead,
Why should I be standing in line, just waiting for bread?
Once I built a railroad, I made it run, made it race against time.
Once I built a railroad; now it’s done. Brother, can you spare a dime? Once I built a tower, up to the sun, brick, and rivet, and lime;
Once I built a tower, now it’s done. Brother, can you spare a dime?”
-fc The song lists several accomplishments of the singer: “I built a railroad,” “I built a tower.” What point was the songwriter trying to make?
One key phrase seems to summarize Harburg’s message: “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime.” Why does that phrase continue to “speak” to listeners even today?
A farm buried under a sea of dust.
THE DUST BOWL
During the 1930s, farmers on the Great Plains faced a natural disaster as well as financial disaster. Since the 1870s, farmers had been tilling the Great Plains, cutting the grasses covering the topsoil, and tapping underground water supplies. A series of droughts {long periods without rain) in the early 1930s dried up crops and topsoil, turning the soil to dust. The ground cover that had held the soil in place was now gone.
Lasting for a decade, heavy winds carried topsoil across hundreds of miles, burying homes and destroying harvests. Unable to
grow enough to pay their bills, farmers were forced to abandon their farms. Many farmers moved west to California. Over one million farmers were driven from their lands by the “dust bowl.”
John Steinbeck wrote a series of articles on these Oakies — farmers from Oklahoma who moved to migrant worker camps in California. In 1936, Steinbeck published The Harvest Gypsies, a series of articles first printed in the San Francisco News, based on his own research on migrant workers living In California during the Great Depression. This research later provided the background for his famous novel, The Grapes of Wrath.

“Employers pushed repatriation efforts as private charities and government agencies provided railroad transportation for tens of thousands of Mexicans to their ‘homeland.’ ‘[Immigration officials] put all the people in the boxcars instead of inside the trains,’ a witness recalled. They were in here illegally but the
moral part of It, the separation and putting them in boxcars, I’ll never forget it as long as I live. ’
Many of the ‘repatriates’ were children bom in the United States. The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce estimated that 60 percent of the ‘repatriated’ children were American citizens without much hope of ever coming back to the United States.
Repatriation was an employment program for whites — a way to remove surplus Mexican laborers and preserve the few remaining jobs for white workers. Even as they supported repatriation, however, employers viewed the action as temporary .... The border existed only when Mexican labor was not needed.”
— Professor Ronald Takaki, A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America (1993).
What are this historian’s feelings about the Mexican Repatriation program? Explain your answer.
-It Suppose you were a lawyer who had to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court either for or against the Mexican Repatriation program. Write a brief (a short written argument) for either side.



In the months leading up to the Presidential election of 1928, Herbert Hoover had conducted a study of American society. He had hoped to use this information to promote national economic development and to relieve poverty. But by 1932, the leader who had once been one of the most respected men in the nation had become one of the most despised. Hoover’s name became identified with the Great Depression. Despite the spiraling economic catastrophe, President Hoover had remained true to his conviction in laissez-faire capitalism.
HOOVER'S PHILOSOPHY
Despite rising unemployment, Hoover had rejected demands for the federal government to provide direct payments to the unemployed and needy. He believed that this would reduce the incentive to work, undermining Americans’ “rugged individualism.” Instead, Hoover believed that voluntary private organizations should provide such emergency relief. Hoover believed it was not the role of government to step in for voluntary philanthropy.

WOMEN IN THE GREAT DEPRESSION
Women often experienced the Depression as mothers and homemakers. While men tried to find new jobs, women had the quiet but demanding task of making ends meet — cooking, cleaning, and caring for children.
In 1933, Eleanor Roosevelt rallied women with her book, It’s Up to the Women. She called on them to pull their families through the crisis: “The women know that life must go on and the needs of life must be met and it Is their courage which, time and again, have pulled us through worse crises than the present one.”
Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962)
Another prominent woman reformer, Frances Perkins, became the first female member of the U.S. Cabinet when she was appointed Secretary of Labor in 1933. Perkins remained at this post for 12 years, overseeing the Civil Conservation Corps and the Public Works Administration. She played a key role in the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Social Security Act.
In his First Inaugural Address, President Roosevelt attempted to calm the American people, reassuring them that the “only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” He also blamed the selfishness of bankers and financiers for the current crisis. As soon as Roosevelt took office, he called Congress into special session. Roosevelt then pushed through legislation that would have been difficult to pass in less critical times. The President immediately began to submit a flood of measures for Congressional approval. Virtually all of the important bills he submitted in these First Hundred Days were enacted by Congress. Roosevelt explained these New Deal measures in terms of the three R’s — Relief, Recovery, and Reform.
RELIEF
Relief measures were short-term actions designed to tide people over until the economy recovered. They were especially important in the first years of the New Deal.
The Banking Crisis. If depositors feared a bank was unsound, they would remove their funds. Often, this news would spread to others, causing bank customers to also withdraw their money before It was too late. These runs on banks were widespread during the early days of the Depression. Ten thousand banks had failed during the Great Depression. To stabilize the banking situation and restore consumer confidence, Roosevelt immediately declared a Bank Holiday, closing all of the nation’s banks. Each bank was permitted to reopen only after government inspectors found the bank to be financially sound.
Name________________________________________________
CHAPTER 11: The Great Depression and the New Deal
213
REFORM
Reform measures were aimed at remedying defects in the structure of the American economy in order to ensure that such a severe Depression would never strike again. Many reform measures were based on the belief that government should protect individuals against risks they could not handle on their own.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (1933) insured bank deposits so that people would not lose their savings in the event of a bank failure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEGISLATION DURING THE NEW DEAL |
Tennessee Valley Authority (1933) built 21 government-owned dams along the Tennessee River, controlling floods and producing electricity. Some feared the "TVA" as a form of socialism.		Securities and Exchange Commission (1934) was I created to watch over the stock market, prevent J fraud and guard against another stock market | collapse.	!
		
National Labor Relations Act (1935), often called the Wagner Act, gave workers the right to form unions, to bargain collectively, and to submit grievances to a National Labor Relations Board.		Social Security Act (1935) was probably the most important measure of the New Deal. It provided workers with unemployment insurance, old age pensions, and insurance if they died early. Workers and their employers each paid new contributions to fund these benefits.
••••••••••••••••ft

ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In 1935, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins delivered a radio broadcast to explain Social Security to the American people:
“The process of recovery is not simple. We cannot be satisfied merely with arrangements which will tide us over the present emergencies. We must devise plans that will not merely [lessen] the ills of today, but prevent, as far as it is possible, their recurrence in the future. The task of recovery is inseparable from the task of social reconstruction. Among the objectives of that reconstruction, President Roosevelt in his message to Congress placed “the security of the men, women and children of the nation first.” He went on to suggest that social insurances ... will provide safeguards against ‘misfortunes which cannot be wholly eliminated in this man-made world of ours.’
Social Security, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) still affect us today. Choose one of these programs and explain how it continues to affect us.

The greatest growth in union membership in American history took place in the 1930s as a result of the New Deal. Roosevelt sought to raise the wages of labor to help fight the Depression.
					
	Norris-LaGuardia Act (1932) prohibited the use of injunctions against peaceful strikes.				
					
NEW DEAL LEGISLATION FAVORABLE TO LABOR
1 			■		
	National Industrial Recovery Act (1933) guaranteed workers the right to form unions. Employers could not refuse to hire union members. This act was declared unconstitutional in 1935, but was replaced by the Wagner Act.			Wagner Act (1935) greatly stimulated the unionization of American workers by protecting the right of unions to bargain collectively with their employers. Union membership grew rapidly with this new law.	
					
Although the New Deal was generally popular, Roosevelt did face criticism. Some of his critics proposed alternative approaches to dealing with the Depression. Conservative critics like the Liberty League, charged Roosevelt with being a “traitor to his class,” and attempting to establish a popular dictatorship.
Radical critics felt that Roosevelt did not go far enough in reforming the American economy. Dr. Francis Townsend wanted to give citizens over 65 years old a pension of $200 a month, to be spent within the month. Townsend believed these pensioners would soon spend the money and this would create new jobs, bringing an end to the Depression.
U.S.
Senator and former Governor of Louisiana, Huey Long, promised to give each American family an income of $5,000 a year, to be paid for by taxing the rich. Long was assassinated before he was able to mount his campaign against FDR. Huey Long was a fiery speaker who riled up crowds.
Father Coughlin gave radio addresses to millions, calling for the nationalization of banks and utilities. Coughlin was also violently anti-Semitic {prejudiced against Jewish people). Coughlin found an audience among nativists and those who distrusted Wall Street bankers. Eventually, the Catholic Church ordered an end to Coughlin’s broadcasts.

A.
Conditions in Europe after World War I were favorable to the rise of dictatorships. The Russian Revolution led to the world’s first Communist state in the Soviet Union. The dissolution of the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires led to the creation of fragile new democracies in other parts of Europe. B.
Benito Mussolini formed the Fascist Party, which took power in Italy in 1922. Adolf Hitler took power in Germany in 1933 after the high unemployment caused by the Great Depression. These new dictatorships glorified violence, obedience to leaders, and extreme nationalism. They arrested, imprisoned and often killed their opponents. Hitler’s Nazi Party condemned Jews and others. C.
Hitler had an expansionist foreign policy. He re-armed Germany, helped Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, annexed Austria, and demanded the Sudentenland in Czechoslovakia in 1938. The League of Nations failed to stop aggressors. British and French leaders gave in to Hitler’s demands in an attempt at appeasement. Hitler took the rest of Czechoslovakia, and then demanded part of Poland in 1939. This time, British and French leaders refused to give in. After signing a non-aggression pact with Stalin, Hitler attacked Poland, starting World War II in Europe. In Asia, Japanese military leaders had already occupied Manchuria in 1931 and had invaded eastern China in 1937. D.
The German army developed a new form of offensive warfare — the Blitzkrieg. Rapid coordinated movements of airplanes, tanks, mechanized troop carriers and infantry made it possible to advance at rapid speed. Germany quickly conquered Poland, defeated France, and controlled most of Europe by 1940. In 1941, Germany violated its non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union. E.
Americans at first tried to stay neutral in the war. After World War I, there had been a return to Isolationism. Congress passed the Neutrality Acts, prohibiting Americans from traveling on ships of nations at war, or selling arms to nations at war. They could only sell non-military goods on a “cash-and-carry” basis. F.
President Roosevelt was concerned at the rise of totalitarian states and the threat it presented to democracy. When Japan attacked China in 1937, he proposed that peaceful states quarantine aggressive nations. American volunteers also formed the Flying Tigers, a squadron of airplanes that helped keep supply lines to China open. After Germany occupied France, Congress passed the first peace-time draft. In 1941, Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act in order to sell, rent or lend wartime equipment to Britain, which stood alone in facing the terror of Nazi Germany. In 1941, Roosevelt secretly met Churchill and they agreed to the Atlantic Charter, laying the foundation for the future United Nations. G.
Surprisingly, events in Asia rather than Europe brought the United States into the war. Roosevelt threatened an embargo to force Japan to give up some of Its conquests. Japanese leaders wanted to seize Indonesia for its oil. On December 7, 1941, Japanese planes launched a surprise attack on the U.S fleet at Pearl Harbor. The next day Roosevelt asked for a declaration of war against Japan. CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 227

EssdENT)iAL Questions CJ z What factors led to the outbreak of World War II?
O " How were the United States and its Allies able to win victory in World War II? What were the major effects of World War II on America and the world?
After World War I, Americans had returned to their traditional policy of isolation. They were more concerned with events at home than abroad. They felt safe behind the oceans separating them from Europe and Asia. They raised tariffs, restricted immigration, and even insisted that their wartime allies, France and Britain, pay back the war debts owed to Americans.
There were notable exceptions to this trend towards isolationism. In 1921, President Harding hosted the Washington Naval Conference, in which leading world powers agreed to limit the size of their navies. In 1928, the United States also promoted the Kellog-Briand Peace Pact, signed by 62 nations, renouncing the use of war.
Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt both also tried to improve U.S. relations with Latin America. Under the “Good Neighbor Policy,” the United States agreed not to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American nations, and relations between the United States and the countries of Latin America began to improve.

In 1939, Hitler made new territorial demands in Poland. Fearing Hitler Intended to dominate Europe, Britain and France refused to give in. Hitler responded by signing a nonaggression pact with Stalin, in which the two secretly agreed to invade and divide Poland. When Germany invaded Poland In September 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany. World War II had begun.
In Poland, the German army unveiled a new type of warfare — the Blitzkreig — which consisted of rapid, coordinated movements by airplanes, tanks, troop carriers, and infantry. The Germans quickly defeated the Poles, and before long they had also defeated the French and taken over much of Europe. While the main advantage in battle in World War I had been with the defense, the use of airplanes, tanks and mechanized transport brought the advantage in warfare back to the offense during World War IL The Germans, and later the Allies, also bombed civilians in cities to increase the terrors of war.

AMERICA PRESERVES A CAUTIOUS NEUTRALITY
In the early 1930s, Americans were too absorbed with recovering from the Great Depression to be very involved in affairs overseas. As tensions in Europe rose, Congress passed a series of laws to keep the country out of war. Americans had been drawn into World War I when German submarines had attacked American ships. To avoid similar events, the Neutrality Acts (1935-1937) prohibited Americans from traveling on the ships of nations at war. Americans were also prohibited from selling
arms to countries at war. Americans could sell nonmilitary goods to Britain and other nations opposed to aggression, but only on a “cash-and-carry” basis.
When Japan invaded China In 1937, President Roosevelt delivered his “Quarantine” Speech. He warned Americans of the growing unrest In the world and told them that peaceful nations had to act together to quarantine (isolate) aggressive nations.	FDR delivering his “Quarantine Speech.

President Roosevelt believed that U.S. entry into the war was inevitable. If Hitler defeated Britain, many feared he would later attack the United States. In 1941, armed American merchant ships were authorized to carry supplies directly to Britain. It seemed that U.S. Involvement in the war was only a matter of time.
INCREASING UNITED STATES-JAPANESE TENSIONS
Surprisingly, events in Asia, not Europe, finally brought the United States into the war. Just as German ambitions had triggered the war in Europe, Japan’s aggressive designs led to war In Asia.
Japan’s late 19th century industrialization had been remarkably successful. But Japanese leaders needed raw materials and markets for their industries. They also wished to replace European imperialism in Asia with the imperialism of an Asian power. Japan’s military began to influence Japanese national policy. In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria. In 1937, Japan attacked the rest of China. When Japan occupied southern Indochina in 1941, Roosevelt reacted by freezing Japanese assets in the United States and cutting off all trade with Japan. Roosevelt offered to resume trade only if Japan withdrew from China and Indochina. Japanese leaders refused.
JAPAN PREPARES A SURPRISE ATTACK
Japanese military leaders decided to attack Indonesia to obtain oil for their war effort. Realizing such a move would bring America into the war, they decided to attack first. Japanese leaders believed a surprise attack would catch the Americans unprepared, temporarily eliminate U.S. naval power from the Pacific, and allow Japan to fortify its positions in the Pacific. The Japanese assumed that before the United States could recover from this surprise blow, Japan would be able to achieve all of its objectives In East Asia and the Pacific.

THE OFFICE OF WAR INFORMATION
A primary focus of the federal government during the war was control of the content and imagery of war messages. In 1942, the President created the Office of War Information (OWI). Among its wide-ranging responsibilities was the production of pro-Allied, anti-Axis propaganda, such as movies and posters, to make citizens aware of how they could help in the war effort. The OWI produced its own radio programs, released its own newsreels, and required that all movies produced during the war contribute in some way to the war effort. OWI messages asked citizens to contribute time and money, to create products, to conserve resources, and to donate to the war effort in personal ways. The OWI also started the Voice of America during the war, sending messages overseas. The OWI tried to stir up distrust of German, Italian, and Japanese leaders, to lower the morale of enemy troops and populations, and to encourage their surrender.

WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE
For many women in America, World War II brought not only sacrifices, but also new jobs, new skills, and new opportunities. Although prevented from enlisting in the regular armed forces, women joined the new Women’s Army Corps, or WACS, in large numbers. After basic training, most of these women took clerical jobs in the military.
In civilian life, many women replaced jobs formerly held by men, such as in shipbuilding and aircraft production. The idea was to have women fill jobs formerly held by men so that more men could be sent into combat. Songs like Rosie the Riveter celebrated women’s new roles,
although some private contractors still refused to hire women. Between 1941 and 1945. more than 6.5 million women entered the work force.
Millions of women entered the workforce when men were drafted into the military.

African-American soldiers also played a significant role in World War II. More than two and a half million registered for the draft, of whom one million eventually served, even though they were forced to serve in segregated units. African Americans had to battle on two fronts: the enemy overseas and prejudice at home.

Executive Order 9066 by President Roosevelt resulted in the internment of 110,000 Japanese Americans in camps for the duration of World War II:
“[A]s President and Commander In Chief of the Army and Navy, I hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of War, and the Military Commanders, whenever he or any designated Commander deems such action to be necessary or desirable, to [order] military areas in such places and of such extent as he or the appropriate Commander may determine, from which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any persons to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever restriction the Secretary of War or the appropriate Military Commander may Impose in his discretion ...”

What arguments would you have used either in support of or against this order?
The relocation raised constitutional issues in wartime. Roosevelt justified the measures as a military necessity. The Supreme Court upheld the relocations in Korematsu v. U.S. Korematsu was a Japanese American convicted of continuing to remain in a restricted area. He believed his constitutional rights had been violated. The Supreme Court upheld Roosevelt’s order on the grounds that constitutional liberties may be limited in wartime. Fifty years later, Congress apologized to the interned Japanese Americans and voted to pay compensation to the families involved.
During the war, a small number of German and Italian resident aliens were also interned. About 2,000 German alien residents were forcibly sent back to Germany. Germans were also sent from Latin America to the United States to be used in prisoner exchanges with Germany.

THE WAR IN EUROPE
Although the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt decided to focus American energies on defeating Germany first. By the time the Americans entered the war, Hitler was in control of most of Europe and North Africa. Hitler made his greatest mistake when he invaded the Soviet Union In June 1941 and declared war on the United States before defeating Britain. By late 1941, the rapid German advance into the Soviet Union was stopped just short of Moscow. Roosevelt and Churchill promised Stalin they would open a second front against Germany in the West, to relieve pressure on the Soviet army.
AXIS EXPANSION AT ITS HEIGHT:
1942 The Americans and British now began one of the greatest collaborations in military history. Churchill advised delay before invading Europe. In 1942, Allied troops landed in North Africa.
After defeating German forces, they crossed the Mediterranean and advanced into Sicily and Italy in 1943.
George Patton was one of the commanders of the forces that invaded North Africa and Sicily. He came from a military family, had participated in the expedition against Pancho Villa, and served under Pershing in World War I. He played an important role in the use of tanks. Patton told American soldiers they must have a “killer instinct” to succeed. An uncon-
ventional military leader, Patton was given command of the General George Patton American Third Army. He was popular among his troops because he had high survival rates, but he could also be harsh In his treatment of those under his command. Under Patton’s leadership, the Third Army would quickly move through Europe, capturing large numbers of enemy soldiers, and freeing a vast territory.

CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 241
Genocide is an effort to murder an entire people or nationality. Part of Hitler’s Nazi philosophy was his intense hatred of Jewish people, on whom he blamed all of Germany’s problems. The Holocaust refers to the attempted genocide of the Jews during World War II. After the outbreak of the war, Hitler and other Nazi leaders decided to murder all European Jews. He called his plan the “Final Solution.” At first, Jews were machine gunned
next to open trenches they had been forced to
When this method of extermination proved too slow for the Nazis, large concentration camps were built across Europe. Jews from Nazi-controlled countries were sent in cramped railroad cattle cars to these camps. When they arrived in the camps, most were killed with poison gas and their bodies were burned in large ovens. Some were spared to do the work of running the camp. These inmates were half-starved and subjected to Inhumane conditions. About six million Jews — two-thirds of those living in Europe — were killed during the Holocaust. Six million gypsies, Slavs, political prisoners, elderly, mentally-disabled, and others also died in Nazi concentration camps.

Liberation of the Concentration Camps. During the last months of the war, the Allies advanced into Germany, where the true horror of Nazi brutality was revealed. American army units were the first to liberate concentration camps. They were shocked to see the half-starved, dehydrated, disease-ridden prisoners.

The following account is from Woman Prisoner #T-917 at Lenzing Concentration Camp:
“Now began a frightful time of waiting. We were locked in the camp without food. I was asleep when my sister wakened me.
She reported that in front of the camp were two young men .... They told us that they would get help from the American soldiers who were nearby but had no idea our camp was there .... It took a few hours until they arrived. It was General Patton’s 3rd Army. The soldiers broke open the gate. It must have been a shock for the soldiers when they saw us, emaciated or swollen, pale and dirty creatures. They first provided us with their food rations and soap ....”
Who do you think was more surprised at the meeting: the concentration camp inmates or the American soldiers? Explain your answer.
CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 243
THE WAR IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC
In these same years, Americans remained at war with Japan. Geography played a critical role in the Pacific campaign during World War IL The United States and Japan were separated by the vast Pacific Ocean. After its attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese achieved quick victories in overrunning Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and the Western Pacific Islands. They soon
threatened Australia, India, Midway, and Hawaii.
THE BATAAN DEATH MARCH,
1942 The Philippines faced an invasion by the Japanese army on the day Pearl Harbor was attacked. A month later, U.S. and Filipino forces surrendered to the Japanese. The Japanese forced their prisoners to undertake a 60-mile march through the jungle, which became known as the Bataan Death March. These prisoners of war faced starvation, disease, exposure to the sun, and no water. About 5,000 of the Americans, almost half, died along the way. Some were bayoneted, shot, beheaded or just left to die along the side of the road.
American soldiers along the Bataan Death March.
In 1943, the tide began to turn against Japan. The United States regained naval superiority in the Pacific and American forces by “island-hopping” — liberating Pacific islands from Japanese control, one at a time.
THE NAVAJO CODE TALKERS
One group of Americans who played a key role in the Pacific campaign were the Navajo code talkers. The American military needed an undecipherable code to communicate that could not be broken by the Japanese. The Navajo language is unwritten and extremely complex. By using this language, American forces could transmit messages by telephone and radio in a code that the Japanese were unable to break.
THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY
The Battle of Midway was the turning point of the war in the Pacific. The Japanese were using their control of the Western Pacific to protect their home islands and vast new empire. The Japanese Pacific fleet commander had devised a plan to lure the U.S. Pacific fleet into a battle near Midway, a tiny mid-Pacific island, where he believed he could destroy them. However, the U.S. Navy could decipher Japanese secret codes and knew that a surprise attack by the Japanese fleet was at hand.
CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 245
His successor, President Harry Truman, feared that an invasion of Japan might lead to a million American casualties. Truman preferred to use the atomic bomb against Japan rather than to sustain such high losses. He selected centers of Japanese military production as targets.
On August 6, an atomic bomb was exploded over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, a second bomb was exploded over Nagasaki. About 230,000 people were killed in both explosions combined. Critics argued that Truman could have exploded bombs on unoccupied islands in the Pacific as demonstrations, instead of on heavily populated cities. Japan surrendered shortly after the second explosion, once American leaders agreed to allow the Japanese Emperor to remain on his throne.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Presidents Roosevelt and Truman had different leadership styles.
President Roosevelt came from wealth, had an elite education and had an abundance of self-confidence. A life-long politician, he excelled at communicating with the public. This was sharply different from President Truman, who spent his early years running a small clothing business and served as a local judge before being elected as U.S. Senator. He was chosen by Roosevelt as his Vice President in 1944. Truman was Vice President only 82 days when he suddenly found himself as President. Roosevelt rarely consulted with him, and Truman knew nothing at all about the development of the atomic bomb until after Roosevelt’s death. With limited foreign policy experience, one might think that Truman simply allowed his advisers to make decisions. In fact, nothing better describes his leadership style than the sign on his
desk in the White House: “The Buck Stops Here!” Truman chaired morning staff meetings, issued directions and assignments to his advisers, and made all major policy decisions himself. He tended to look at things as they were presented to him, examined both sides of the issue, and then made his decision — much as during his earlier years as a judge.
Select one of these Presidents and evaluate his domestic and international leadership during World War II. Conduct research on the Internet or in your library for information. You might consider how FDR forged a close relationship with Churchill and mobilized Americans for war. Or you might select how Truman reached his decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan.
Then prepare a short report, poster, or oral presentation to communicate your conclusions about the leadership style of the President you researched.
CHAPTER 12: America in World War II 247
THE NUREMBERG TRIALS,
1945-1946 The liberation of concentration camps in Europe revealed millions of dead, along with half-starved survivors. With the full extent of Nazi brutality revealed, the Allies put surviving Nazi leaders on trial for “crimes against humanity” in Nuremberg, Germany. Those on trial defended themselves by claiming they had only been following orders. Many were found guilty of committing atrocities and were hanged or imprisoned. The Nuremberg Trials demonstrated that individuals are responsible for their actions, even in times of war.

ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Read this statement by one of the U.S. prosecutors at the military trials at Nuremberg.
“Germany became one vast torture chamber. Cries of its victims were heard round the world and brought shudders to civilized
people. I am one who received most atrocity tales with suspicion and [doubt]. But the proof here will be so overwhelming that I predict these defendants will only deny personal responsibility. The elements of the German population which were both decent and courageous were [reduced to nothing]. Those which were decent but weak were Intimidated. The Nazis not only silenced discordant voices, they practiced the [leadership principle] which centralized control of the Party over the lives and thoughts of the German people. This German State is incomprehensible to my people [the United States public] ....
The prosecutor says these Nazi leaders did not deserve mercy. Would you have agreed? Explain your answer.
AND THE DIVISION OF GERMANY
After the war, Germany was divided into four zones by the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Each occupied one zone. The occupying powers introduced programs explaining the evils of Nazi beliefs to the German people. Hitler’s attempts to put his racist doctrines into practical effect also played a large role in discrediting racism, anti-Semitism, Social Darwinism, eugenics, and similar ideas worldwide. The Nazi nightmare showed where these ideas could lead. This contributed to the later Civil Rights Movement in the United States.
THE OCCUPATION OF JAPAN
General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, was assigned the task of rebuilding and reforming post-war Japan. Under his leadership, important changes were introduced to make Japan less aggressive. Japan’s overseas empire was taken away, and her military leaders were put on trial and punished. Japan renounced the use of nuclear weapons and the waging of war.

Ess^ENTIal Questions
Why did the United States and Soviet Union enter into the Cold War? Why did the Cold War last so Long?
How did Civil Rights leaders change American society?
r
Although the United States and the Soviet Union had been allies during World War II, these two Superpowers soon became rivals in the Cold War. This war was “cold” only in the sense that, because of nuclear weapons, the two Superpowers never confronted each other directly in open warfare. However, their global competition led to frequent conflicts on every continent.

CHAPTER 13: America in the Cold War and Civil Rights Years
THE COLD WAR BEGINS
After the war, the Soviets saw a growing threat from capitalist governments.
Stalin wanted to insure the safety of the Soviet Union and greatly distrusted the West, which had delayed invading France until 1944. He decided to create a wall of satellite countries as a buffer against any future invasions. As a result,
Stalin refused to allow free elections in Poland. He had no intention of losing control over the country through which Germany had invaded Russia twice in the previous 30 years. The United States also refused to share the secrets behind the atomic bomb. The Cold War now began in earnest. Soviet troops continued to occupy Eastern Europe. They placed local Communists in power in
all the governments of Eastern Europe. Trade and contact between Eastern and Western Europe was cut off. An Iron Curtain fell over Eastern Europe, closing it off from the West. Over the next forty years, travel and communication between the East and West remained limited. Eastern European nations became “satellites” of the Soviet Union.

Speaking on a visit to Missouri, Winston Churchill told Americans in 1946 that “from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.” What did Churchill mean by the phrase “iron curtain”?
American leaders responded to the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe by developing a policy of containment. Under this policy, they did not attempt to overturn Communism where it already existed, but they resolved to prevent it from spreading further.
When Communist rebels threatened Greece and Stalin pressured Turkey, Truman decided to offer these countries military aid. He felt it was important not to make the same mistake as the appeasers in Munich who failed to stand up to Hitler in 1938.

A DIVIDED GERMANY AND THE BERLIN AIRLIFT,
1948 In 1948, the French, British and Americans decided to merge their zones of occupation into a single state, West Germany. Berlin, the old capital of Germany, was located in the Soviet zone. It had also been divided into four sectors, each occupied by a different power. The Soviets reacted to the merging of the Western zones by announcing a blockade of West Berlin, closing all highway and railroad links to the West.
The Western Allies refused to abandon West Berlin. They began a massive airlift to feed and supply the city. Within a year, Stalin lifted the Soviet blockade. The United States had met another test of the
Cold War. The United States and its allies had shown that they would not retreat when faced with aggressive behavior by the Soviet Union.

THE FORMATION OF NATO AND THE WARSAW PACT
In response to Cold War tensions, the United States, Canada, and ten Western European countries formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949. NATO was based on the concept of collective security — each NATO member pledged to defend every other member if attacked.
Through NATO, the United States extended its umbrella of protection from nuclear weapons to Western Europe. The
Soviet Union responded by creating the Warsaw Pact with its Eastern European satellites in 1955.

When President Truman refused his ideas, MacArthur criticized Truman to a Congressman, who reported this to the news media. Faced with public criticism from a commander in the field, Truman relieved MacArthur from his command. Truman believed this step was necessary to reassert civilian control over the military, although the step was unpopular at the time.

CHAPTER 13: America in the Cold War and Civil Rights Years 269

As the Cold War grew more intense, Americans became more concerned with their own internal security.
THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE
Following World War II, Americans feared a possible Communist menace inside the United States. President Truman ordered the establishment of Loyalty Review Boards to investigate individual “un-American” activities, such as participation in the American Communist Party. Many Americans were accused of “un-American” actions on very little evidence. These victims were often unable to defend themselves or even to know who had accused them. The process violated their constitutional rights.
Congress decided to conduct its own loyalty checks through its special House Un-American Activities Committee. This committee questioned actors, directors, writers, and others about their possible Communist sympathies. Those identified as present or former members of the Communist Party were frequently “blacklisted” and lost their jobs. Some, like Alger Hiss, were later prosecuted for perjury. Those who cooperated with the committee were often asked to inform on others.
THE ROSENBERG TRIALS
In 1950, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were charged with selling national secrets to the Soviet Union about making the atomic bomb. The Rosenbergs were found guilty and executed for spying. Like the Sacco and Vanzetti case in the 1920s, many Americans doubted the Rosenbergs’ guilt. However, in 1997, the National Security Agency released the Venona Papers. This was a secret effort by the United States to gather and decode messages sent In the 1940s by Soviet military intelligence agents. The Venona Papers revealed the identities of several Americans who had spied for the Soviet Union, including Julius Rosenberg. It showed that some Soviet agents had in fact penetrated American government, science and industry during the Cold War.
the McCarthy hearings
The fall of China increased fears of internal subversion. In 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy shocked Americans by claiming that he knew the names of hundreds of Communists who had infiltrated the U.S. State Department and other government agencies. Like the Red Scare of the 1920s, McCarthy’s allegations created fears of a Communist conspiracy. After three years of hearings, McCarthy never provided any real proof for his charges. He was censured {formally criticized) by the Senate. Although McCarthy never proved any of his claims, his witchhunt frightened many Americans. The term “McCarthyism” has become Identified with making harsh accusations without evidence.

President Eisenhower gave control of foreign policy to his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, a devoted anticommunist. Dulles sought to contain the spread of Communism by preventing the Soviets from gaining additional influence.
In 1957, Eisenhower announced he would send U.S. forces to any Middle Eastern nation that requested help in defending against Communism. This extension of the containment policy became known as the Eisenhower Doctrine. The United States also signed a series of treaties around the world to contain Communism.
President Dwight Eisenhower
The 1950s were a period of recovery and economic growth. Millions of veterans returned home from World War II. They benefited from special benefits for war veterans, including low mortgage rates and educational grants. People whose lives had been disrupted by the Great Depression and the war could now turn their attentions to work and raising families.
As in the 1920s, products for consumers, such as automobiles, refrigerators, washing machines, and televisions, helped stimulate economic growth. Eisenhower signed the Interstate Highway Act (1956), which created a system of federal highways. Americans were not just producing for themselves, but also for the rest of the world, which was still recovering from wartime destruction. Because of the Cold War, defense spending remained high. One result of this increased spending was a wave of prosperity and the growth of the middle class.
Housing Boom. This was a time of high birth rates, known as the "baby boom." This boom and the 6.1. Bill (Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944) helping veterans led developers to build cheaper, mass-produced housing. Home ownership increased by 50%. The movement of middle-income families to the suburbs led to a declining urban tax base and decaying inner cities.
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE EISENHOWER PRESIDENCY
Economic Prosperity. The demand for consumer goods reached all-time highs. Millions of autos and TV sets were sold. The use of refrigerators and other appliances became widespread. The gross domestic product doubled between 1945 and 1960. America dominated world trade.
Conformity. In the 1950s, there was a greater emphasis on conformity. Unusualideas were regarded with suspicion. Fear of Communism strengthened the dislike of non-conformist attitudes.

CHAPTER 13: America in the Cold War and Civil Rights Years 273

At the end of the Civil War, the United States had held out the promise of equality to Americans of all races, but this promise was cut short in the aftermath of Reconstruction. Many Americans felt that the treatment received by African Americans was inconsistent with the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Indeed, it seemed ironic for America to pose as the defender of freedom and democracy around the world, while denying equality to many of its citizens at home.
THE TRUMAN YEARS,
1945-1953 In 1947, Jackie Robinson became the first African-American baseball player to cross the “color line” and join the major leagues. The same year, the Truman administration issued a report, To Secure These Rights, calling for civil rights laws. The following year, Truman proposed civil rights legislation to Congress that did not pass. When he was re-elected, Truman demanded his inauguration be integrated. In 1948, he also issued executive orders to desegregate the armed forces and end discriminatory hiring practices in the federal government. These orders set precedents for later civil rights legislation.
Jackie Robinson
Civil rights were won in large part through litigation — resolving disputes in court. The Supreme Court’s decision in Brown r. Board ofEducaton was central to the success of the Civil Rights Movement.
BACKGROUND
After Reconstruction, Southern states passed laws requiring the segregation of races in public places, including public schools. In Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), the U.S. Supreme Court had upheld the constitutionality of these state segregation laws. The Court had ruled that the “separate-but-equal” standard was constitutional. States could provide segregated facilities to different races, so long as they were equal in quality. Although schools were supposed to be equal, most schools in the South were greatly inferior to white ones. Starting in the 1930s, NAACP lawyers began challenging this “separate-but-equal” doctrine through the American court system.
In Sweatt v. Painter (1950), the NAACP won a case involving the right of Herman Sweatt, an African American, to attend the Law School at the University of Texas at Austin. Texas argued that its constitution prohibited integrated education. Texas even created a separate law school for African Americans, just to keep Sweatt out. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that this separate school failed to qualify as “separate but equal” since differences in its facilities, such as the isolation of its students from future lawyers being trained in Austin, with whom its students would later interact.
Name__________________________________________________
CHAPTER 13: America in the Cold War and Civil Rights Years 275
In a subsequent ruling, the Court held that desegregation in public schools should be conducted “with all deliberate speed.” Enforcement of the decision was left to the lower federal courts, which were to oversee that local school districts complied with the order. Because the phrase “with all deliberate speed” was vague, many states were able to delay the Court’s order to desegregate their schools. It would take many more years before the Brown decision was fully implemented.
The Supreme Court had overturned legal racial segregation in the public schools, but this still left other segregation laws — known as “Jim Crow” laws —In place throughout the South. These laws prevented African Americans from sharing beaches, theaters, restaurants, water fountains, or public buses with whites.
THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT,
1955-1956 In December 1955, Rosa Parks, an African-American seamstress and local NAACP member, refused to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger in Montgomery, Alabama. When Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat, local African-American leaders began a boycott of the city’s public buses. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
(1929-1968), a pastor in Montgomery, was the leader of the boycott. The boycott lasted 13 months and brought Rosa Parks, Dr. King, and their cause before the attention of the world. King rallied the boycotters at meetings In his church. They car-pooled to take each other to work. King himself
was arrested and his home was bombed, but the boycott lasted and the case was eventually taken to federal court. The court ruled that segregation on the buses operated by the city of Montgomery violated the “equal protection” clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The boycott had shown that African Americans could unite successfully to oppose segregation.
Rosa Parks rides in the front of the bus in defiance of segregation laws.
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF
1957 In 1957, the Eisenhower administration passed the Civil Rights Act to increase African-American voting in the South. The act created the Civil Rights Commission and established a Civil Rights Division in the U.S. Justice Department. The law gave federal courts the power to register African-American voters. Registration procedures were so complex the act proved ineffective, but it helped set the pattern for later civil rights legislation.
LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS,
1957 Most Southern states delayed putting the Brown decision into effect. Governor Orval Faubus of Arkansas was a World War II veteran and a liberal Democrat, who favored segregation.

CONGRESSIONAL BLOC OF SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Southern Democrats in Congress banded together to obstruct attempts to pass federal civil rights legislation. Many of these Southern legislators held important committee chairmanships, which gave them the power to prevent such legislation from even coming to the floor of Congress for a vote.
SIT-INS AND FREEDOM RIDES IN THE SOUTH,
1960-1961 In 1960, African-American students held a sit-in at a “Whites Only” lunch counter in North Carolina. The tactic was soon copied by other students throughout the South. In 1961, interracial groups rode buses in Freedom Rides in the South. As a result of these protests, downtown stores finally agreed to desegregate lunch coun-
ters and hire African-American workers. The African-American college students sitting down Freedom Riders sought to overturn racial seg-	at the “whites only” lunch counter.
regation on public transportation. They created
confrontations so that the federal government would be forced to intervene. These riders often faced the risk of violence and even death from those who opposed integration.
KING'S LETTER FROM A BIRMINGHAM JAIL,
1963 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. emerged in the late 1950s as the leader of the Civil Rights Movement. Like Thoreau and Gandhi before him, King believed in non-violence — that passive resistance to unjust laws could change the attitudes of oppressors. During the 1950s and 1960s, King achieved international fame for carrying out resistance to injustice through civil disobedience. King believed that if the government passed an unjust law, people should oppose it with non-violent tactics such as peaceful marches, boycotts, picketing, and demonstrations.
When Dr. Martin Luther King led a march in Birmingham, Alabama, he was arrested. Television then revealed to the nation the brutal tactics often used by the police to break up peaceful demonstrations. Dr. King wrote a “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” explaining the reasons why African Americans could no longer patiently wait for their constitutional rights. His critics felt that the fight against racial segregation should take place in the courts and not in the street. King argued that civil disobedience was justified not only because it
was effective, but because “everyone has a moral	Dr. King in the Birmingham City jail.
responsibility to disobey unjust laws.”

CHAPTER 13: America in the Cold War and Civil Rights Years 279
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF
1964 On the plane ride back to Washington, D.C., Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was immediately sworn in as President. A Texan, Johnson had been the Democratic leader in the Senate in 1957, and had helped to steer the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through Congress. With the lobbying efforts of Civil Rights supporters, President Johnson was now able to push an even more important bill through Congress. The Southern Democratic bloc tried to stop the bill with ceaseless speeches, but they were prevented by a vote of two-thirds of the Senate.
The resulting Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, or ethnic origin in hotels, restaurants, and all places of employment doing business with the federal government or engaged in interstate commerce. The act cut off federal aid to school districts with segregated schools. Finally, the act gave the federal government the power to register voters and to establish the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to enforce the act’s provisions. What this meant was that all businesses involved in interstate commerce could no longer discriminate.
THE STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE VOTING RIGHTS
After passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Civil Rights leaders turned their energies to registering African-American voters and encouraging them to vote.
Twenty-Fourth Amendment (1964) eliminated poll taxes in federal elections.

Selma Marches. In 1965, Dr. King went to Selma, Alabama, to organize a march demanding the vote for African Americans. When demonstrators were attacked, President Johnson reacted by introducing a voting rights bill.			Voting Rights Act of 1965. This act ended poll taxes, suspended literacy tests where they were used to prevent African Americans from voting, and led to a substantial increase in the number of African-American voters.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION,
1965 In 1965, President Johnson signed an Executive Order requiring employers with federal contracts to take positive steps to raise the number of their minority employees to correct past imbalances. Later, women were added. This went beyond not discriminating: companies and institutions were now required to actively recruit minority candidates.
Affirmative action programs increased minority representation in colleges, the professions, and many businesses. The act had some unintended consequences. Some critics challenged these programs as a form of reverse discrimination. In Regents of University of California v. Bakke, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld affirmative action, but not the use of racial quotas. Many affirmative action programs have been phased out over time as America has become a more pluralistic society.

Mexican Americans also struggled for equal rights. Chicano Wall murals celebrated their culture. Organizers like Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta fought for the rights of migrant farm workers, most of whom were Mexican Americans. Hector Perez Garcia fought discrimination against Mexican Americans. H. A
series of various court cases ended the segregation of Mexican-American children in public schools and the exclusion of Mexican Americans from juries. I.
American Indians organized the American Indian Movement, or AIM. J.
Young people in the sixties sought greater personal freedom. The right to vote to all citizens over 18 years old was given by the Twenty-sixth Amendment. K.
In 1954, Vietnam in Southeast Asia was divided in two: North Vietnam came under Communist control, while South Vietnam had the support of the West. When South Vietnamese leaders decided to oppose elections to re-unify the country, the Vietcong launched a guerilla war to win control of the country. L.
After Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (1964), President Johnson sent in thousands of U.S. ground troops. Even so, the Vietcong were able to launch attacks on South Vietnamese cities during the Tet Offensive (1968). M.
In the U.S., the war became very divisive. The Anti-war Movement staged demonstrations throughout the country. President Richard Nixon, elected in 1968, escalated the war. He bombed the North and began a policy of Vietnamization to give the South Vietnamese a larger stake in the war. The U.S. signed an agreement with North Vietnam, withdrawing its forces from Vietnam. Fighting continued until the fall of Saigon in 1975, when Vietnam was re-united under Communist rule. N.
In the 1960s, American youths challenged the conforming behavior of their parents. The Beat poets and writers, like Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, were forerunners of this new counter-culture.

Space exploration has led to advances in technology that have improved the quality of our lives. For example, as a result of space exploration we now have satellites with improved television and radio signals. These satellites help us communicate faster, predict the weather, and forecast impending tsunamis, cyclones, hurricanes and tornadoes. They also allow us to make telephone calls overseas and to use GPS (global positioning systems).
The space program also has led to the invention of high-performance solar cells, new lubricants, infrared ear thermometers, enriched baby food, cordless power tools, and tempur-pedic foam for mattresses and pillows
Like Truman and Eisenhower, President Kennedy staunchly opposed Communism and pledged to contain it. One of the greatest challenges Kennedy faced was in Cuba, only 90 miles from Florida. In 1959, while Eisenhower was President, Fidel Castro led an uprising to overthrow the brutal Cuban dictator General Batista. At first, Americans looked at Castro’s revolution as an attempt to introduce democracy into Cuba. However, shortly after taking power, Castro made new agreements with the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower reduced the amount of sugar Cuba could sell to the United States, and Castro nationalized American businesses in Cuba. Then he announced his plans to make Cuba a pro-Soviet Communist nation. Land-holding was limited and opponents were thrown in jail.
Fidel Castro
BAY OF PIGS INVASION
(1961) President Eisenhower approved a plan to overthrow Castro. This included secretly training a group of Cuban exiles in the United States and Guatemala to invade the island. When Kennedy became President, he let the plan continue, but he refused to provide air power, which would openly tie the invasion to the United States. The exiles landed in Cuba three months after Kennedy took office, but were quickly defeated by the Cuban military. This was an embarrassing foreign policy failure for President Kennedy.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
On October 22, 1962, President Kennedy spoke to the nation:
“This secret and extraordinary buildup of Communist missiles — in an area known to have a special relationship to the United States and the nations of the Western Hemisphere, in violation of Soviet
assurances, and in defiance of American and hemispheric policy — this decision to station weapons for the first time outside of Soviet soil — is an unjustified change in the status quo which cannot be accepted by this country ....”
In your opinion, did President Kennedy choose the right course of action during the • Cuban Missile Crisis? Explain your answer.
President Kennedy reiterated his commitment to resisting Communism when he visited West Berlin in 1963. He told its citizens “Ich bin ein Berliner" (I am a Berliner), reassuring West Germans of the U.S. commitment to their safety and freedom.
The nation was shocked when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22,1963. Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson became the next President.
THE GREAT SOCIETY
Soon after becoming President, Johnson proposed the most far-ranging program of social legislation since the New Deal. Johnson proposed federal legislation designed to transform American society. Johnson’s goal was to turn the nation into a Great Society by opening up opportunities and improving the quality of life for all Americans. His Great Society programs included equality of opportunity, enrichment of urban life, restoration of natural beauty, expansion of education, ending poverty, health care for the elderly, and greater racial equality.
Civil Rights. As you Learned in Chapter 13, Johnson pushed through a broad program of Civil Rights legislation, including the Civil Rights Art (1964) and the Voting Rights Art (1965). He also introduced affirmative action.		War on Poverty. Johnson called for a "war on poverty." The Economic Opportunity Act (1964) created a new government office to administer programs established by the act. These included the Job Corps, to train underprivileged youths, and a domestic "Peace Corps" to help in depressed areas.

ACTING AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In her book, Friedan challenged the belief that all women were content leading lives as mothers and housewives:
“Each suburban wife struggles with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, [and] lay beside her husband at night — she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question — ‘Is this all?’”
Some criticized Betty Friedan for limiting her focus to middle-class, educated women. They claimed she ignored other women’s voices. Do you think this was a valid criticism? Explain your answer.
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE
WOMEN'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT
Feminist goals were far-reaching. Women sought greater freedom and a fuller social and economic life.
Education. As a result of affirmative action, universities receiving federal support could no longer discriminate on the basis of sex in their admissions policy. Most colleges became co-educational and hired women professors. In fact, they had to hire more women faculty quickly because most professors were males. Greater gender equality was also achieved in admissions to military academies, law schools, and medical schools.
Employment. Feminists sought to end discrimination in hiring, to establish equal job opportunities for women, and to place women in positions of greater responsibility. In 1963, Congress passed the Equal Pay Act, requiring companies to pay women the same wages as men for the same work.
New Attitudes. Feminists objected to beauty contests and introduced the title “Ms” to replace “Miss” and “Mrs.” They opposed sexist language (“policeman” and “fireman”), the use of women as sex objects in advertising, or the idea that men cannot do housework. Women’s leaders opposed sexual discrimination in textbooks that ignored women’s contributions. They lobbied for more funds to research women’s diseases, like breast cancer.

THE GHETTOS ERUPT,
1968 In the North, African Americans often faced segregation based on residential living patterns rather than on state laws. Homeowners in middle class white communities often refused to sell their homes to African Americans. Many African Americans were confined to ethnic communities, known as ghettos, in decaying inner cities. Landlords often failed to maintain their buildings and city officials cut back on inspections. African-American frustration erupted in a series of riots that shook Northern cities three summers in a row.
In April 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated by a white supremacist in Memphis, Tennessee. King’s assassination led to an outpouring of anger among young African Americans, as well as a period of national mourning. King’s death sparked race riots across the nation that cost dozens of lives, destroyed property, and led to hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. Rioters smashed windows, overturned cars, and started fires.
A commission investigating the causes of the unrest found that the lack of job opportunities for African Americans, urban poverty, and
Cities like Detroit erupted in riots following the assassination of Dr. King.
white racism were the chief factors behind the riots. The riots showed that there was still work to be done to eliminate racism and introduce equality of opportunity in America.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
Research the views of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and leaders of the Black Panthers such as Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. Then make your own chart comparing and contrasting these divergent points of view.
Psychologists have given various explanations for the political violence that followed King’s assassination. They have pointed to rising expectations (African Americans had expected more rapid change), economic deprivation, and general frustration. Do you think any of these reasons can explain the violence? If not, what do you think were the main causes of the rioting?
Like African Americans, Mexican Americans, also known as Chicanos, had often faced discrimination, racism and exploitation in the United States. In the 1960s, a Chicano Movement emerged: its main focus was on such issues as farm workers’ voting and political rights.

CHAPTER 14: The Sixties: A Decade of Protest and Change
Murals soon became an important artistic medium to support identity and justice in Mexican-American communities. Wall murals provided a visual presence to people who often lacked representation in public life, with few voices on city councils or school boards. In El Paso alone, more than a hundred Chicano wall murals were completed. These murals show Taiano legends and heroes like Cesar Chavez.
305
An example of a wall mural in El Paso, Texas.
American Indians also grew restless in the 1960s.
Back in 1953, the federal government had transferred its responsibility for those American Indians still living on reservations to state governments.
Lacking sufficient funds, many states were unable to provide the same level of services previously provided by the federal government. The new policy turned out to be largely a failure.
In 1963, the federal government reversed its policy and began encouraging tribal life on the reservations. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination against Native Americans. In 1970,
President Nixon announced the federal government would honor its treaty obligations. Nevertheless, many American Indians still felt they were being mistreated. Under the slogan “Red Power,” they formed the American Indian Movement to mobilize public opinion in their favor. American Indians
sought greater respect for their heritage. They introduced the term “Native American” and protested against textbooks, television shows and movies that showed anti-American Indian bias. They dramatized the plight of American Indians by temporarily occupying government monuments on Alcatraz Island and at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.

A,
Not only legislation (the passage of new laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964) but also litigation (disputes settled by courts) has played a key role in the expansion of civil rights for minority groups in the United States. This is clear not only from the Supreme Courts decision in Brown v. Board of Education (you can see this case in the last chapter), but also from a series of cases in which courts ruled on Mexican-American rights.
HOW DOES A COURT RULE ON A CASE?
It is important to recall just how courts in the United States work. A case involving a federal law or right can be brought before a federal district court. The court listens to the witnesses and arguments for each side. Then it applies the law to the facts of the case. The "law" consists of any laws passed by the state legislature or Congress, prior court precedents and requirements of the U.S. Constitution.
The room where cases are heard before the Supreme Court.
APPEALING A DECISION
The losing side may appeal the decision to a U.S. Court of Appeals. The twelve Courts of Appeal are organized by region, and each region is known as a "circuit." Finally, the side that loses in the U.S. Court of Appeals can appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a typical year, approximately 10,000 cases are appealed to the Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court only accepts about 100 cases each year. The cases the Supreme Court decides to hear usually involve important questions about the U.S. Constitution or federal law.
f T- ■ T If	/	A
MENDEZ V. WESTMINSTER SCHOOL DISTRICT
(1947) In 1945, some places in California sent Mexican-American children to separate public schools. Several Mexican-American parents challenged this practice in U.S. district court. The district court ruled that this practice violated the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees citizens the right to the “equal protection” of the laws. Westminster School District appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The latter concluded that the case did not involve a constitutional question. California law at the time required the segregation of Chinese or Japanese children, but did not “include segregation of school children because of their Mexican blood.” The court held that separation within a race was not permitted if not required by a specific state law. The court thus did not need to rule on the Fourteenth Amendment. Later that year, California repealed its school segregation laws.

At the same time, South Vietnam was far from a democracy. Its President was a dictator who was opposed by Vietnam’s Buddhists. In 1963, he was overthrown and murdered in a coup.

President Elsenhower had suggested that the fall of French Indochina might create a “domino” effect. According to this Domino Theory, if South Vietnam fell to Communism, neighboring Southeast Asian countries would also fall to Communism like a row of dominos. After taking Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, Communists would threaten Thailand to the west and the Strait of Malacca to the south. Resisting the Communists in Vietnam might prevent this collapse.
The Domino Theory greatly affected President Kennedy’s thinking. Responding to requests from the South Vietnamese government for help, Kennedy sent aid and U.S. military advisers to assist South Vietnam in fighting the Vietcong. Kennedy also felt that a successful democracy in South Vietnam might serve as a model for other developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Under President Johnson, the United States became even more deeply involved in Vietnam.
GULF OF TONKIN RESOLUTION
(1964) In 1964, Johnson announced that the North Vietnamese had attacked U.S. ships in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin. Congress voted to give Johnson full military powers to stop North Vietnam’s aggression. Years later, it was revealed that the U.S. ships had actually been in North Vietnamese waters in cooperation with South Vietnamese warships that were bombing North Vietnam.
JOHNSON ESCALATES THE WAR
Although Congress had not officially declared war, President Johnson used the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution to escalate (increase) the war.

313
THE DIFFICULTIES OF GUERILLA WARFARE
Most American soldiers were unfamiliar with the Vietnamese language, people, or physical environment. American forces were unable to tell who was friendly and who was the enemy. The jungles of Vietnam provided an ideal cover for guerilla warfare and secret enemy movements. Vietnam’s location made it easy for Communists to send a steady flow of supplies through neighboring countries.
GROWING DISCONTENT: THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT
The media (newspapers, radio, television) had a great influence in shaping public opinion. It was the first time American audiences could watch the destructiveness of the war on their television sets while sitting at home. President Johnson told Americans they were winning the war, but journalists reported otherwise. This created a “credibility gap”: many Americans lost faith in their government’s reliability.
Nowhere was this discontent more evident than among young Americans who objected to the country’s involvement in
Protesters burn their draft cards to show their opposition to the war.
Vietnam. Mass anti-war movements occurred throughout the country from 1965 onwards. Young people burned their draft cards, marched on the Pentagon, held rallies, and staged demonstrations. By 1968, millions of young people were actively protesting the war.
The anti-war movement greatly influenced U.S. military policy. American “doves” wanted the United States to withdraw, since they saw the contest as a civil war between the North and South Vietnamese. They believed American leaders were acting immorally by bombing civilians and burning villages. The “hawks” supported the war, which they saw as an attempt to defend free Vietnamese from Communist repression.
Division among Democrats over the war, the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy (younger brother of President Kennedy), and violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968 led to the election of Republican Richard Nixon as President. During the campaign, Nixon, a staunch anti-Communist, promised Americans “peace with honor” in Vietnam. However, the war dragged on for five more years under Nixon.
During these years, Nixon, aided by Henry Kissinger, adopted a complex approach in Vietnam consisting of “Vietnamization,” increased bombing, and diplomacy.

By 1975, what remained of the South Vietnamese Army was incapable of preventing the advance of the North Vietnamese. In April 1975, Saigon finally fell to North Vietnamese forces. The fall of Saigon (today called Ho Chi Minh City) marked the end of the Vietnam War. South Vietnamese government officials, military officers, and soldiers who had supported the American presence in Vietnam were sent to Communist “re-education camps,” where they faced torture, disease and malnutrition.
LEARNED

Have your class stage a debate — Resolved: Americas leaders made a mistake in engaging in the war in Vietnam. Appoint teams for and against the resolution. Or pretend to be having a debate between Hawks and Doves in 1969.
The War in Vietnam had many Important effects:
Death and Destruction. Over 58,000 Americans died, and many others suffered physical and psychological injuries. Over a million Vietnamese were killed, while many more were left homeless.
Impact of the War on the U.S. and Abroad. Wartime expenses led to the end of some Great Society programs and brought rising Inflation. The war demonstrated that government actions can be greatly affected by public opinion. It also led to a crisis of American self-confidence. Next to the Civil War, the Vietnam War was the most divisive war in U.S. history. As a result, Americans became more aware of the limits of U.S. power and cautious about where they should act abroad.
Limits on Presidential Power. In both Korea and Vietnam, Presidents had sent American troops into extended combat without first obtaining a declaration of war from Congress. In 1973, Congress attempted to re-claim its constitutional powers by passing over Nixon’s veto, the War Powers Resolution. This set limits on Presidential power in a conflict without a formal declaration of war by Congress. The act requires the President to inform Congress within 48 hours of sending troops to fight overseas. If within 60 days the Congress does not approve of the use of these overseas forces, the President must withdraw them.

CHAPTER 14: The Sixties: A Decade of Protest and Change

American literature has been marked by movements of varying styles and directions. Some of the best writing just after World War II dealt with the war experience itself, including such works as Norman Mailer’s The Naked and the Dead (1948), describing the capture of an island from the Japanese, and James Jones’ From Here to Eternity (1951), showing army life in Hawaii up to the Pearl Harbor attack.
Allen Ginsberg
In the 1950s, the Beat Generation rebelled against the conformity of their era. This movement began with a small and tightly connected group of young writers who were college students together in New York City and later most moved to San Francisco. They showed a care-free, often reckless and fresh approach to literature.
Two of the founders of the movement, Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, began giving public readings of their works in the mid-1950s.
They became even more well-known after Gins-
berg’s best known poem, Howl (1955), was seized for obscenity. The Beats opposed the conventions of the 1950s and saw the solution to the lifeless materialism of the fifties in the heightened sense of freedom and spirituality in their own works. Kerouac’s novel, On the Road, tells the story of the narrator’s adventures crossing the country in a car several times with a character named Dean Moriarty. Kerouac’s theme was the experience of life itself.
The Beats experimented with both sexuality and drugs. From the name “beat,” a newspaper columnist coined the term “beatnik,” which became associated with artistic lifestyles in the 1950s, in which young men wore beards, berets, and sandals, while young women dressed in leotards. They recited poetry and discussed European philosophy. The beatniks represented an early form of what would later become known as the counter-culture.
By the 1960s, the counter-culture was in full swing. Two late World War II novels, Joseph Heller’s Catch 22 (1961) and Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five (1969), challenged mainstream thinking by exposing the absurdity of armed conflict. Mailer became a critic of the Vietnam War, as shown in his novel, Why Are We in Vietnam? (1967), and also wrote books on anti-war protests, such as Armies of the Night (1968).
In the 1960s, literature also became much more open in its treatment of human consciousness and sexuality, as demonstrated by the novels and short stories of Philip Roth, including Goodbye Columbus (1959) and Portnoy’s Complaint (1969). In a much later work, American Pastoral (1997), Roth dealt with coming to terms with the middle class radicalism of the 1960s.

IMPORTANT IDEAS
(continued) J.
With the Reagan Doctrine, President Reagan announced he would not just contain Communism but try to roll it back. He sent U.S. forces to Grenada, and provided anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua and Afghanistan with funds. K.
Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars), a research program to protect America from nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. L.
Iran-Contra Affair: Officials sold weapons to Iran to free hostages; the proceeds helped to supply Contras in Nicaragua, despite a Congressional ban. M.
President George H.W. Bush continued Reagan’s policies. The Cold War ended during his Presidency. Bush sent troops into Panama, Kuwait and Somalia. N.
President Bill Clinton attempted to enact a comprehensive health care reform but failed to do so. Reduced defense spending after the Cold War coupled with a rise in the computer industry made the 1990s a time of general prosperity. ’ O.
Impeachment charges were brought against President Clinton for lying about an affair he had with a White House intern. Attempts to convict him of these charges failed in the Senate. Clinton was able to successfully push NAFTA through Congress and saw the creation of the World Trade Organization. P. A
talented and hard working group of diverse entrepreneurs — including Bill Gates, Sam Walton, Estee Lauder, Robert Johnson, and Lionel Sosa — helped the American economy.

CHAPTER 15: Crisis and Resurgence, 1969-2000	331
First Amendment Rights. During Nixon’s Presidency, the Supreme Court continued to protect First Amendment rights. In Tinker r Des Moines (1969), John Tinker and his sister were suspended from school for wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. The Supreme Court ruled that this violated the students’ First Amendment rights, and that students have the right to wear armbands to protest the war. In Wisconsin r Yoder (1972), the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Wisconsin state law that required Amish children to attend school beyond Grade 8. The Court found that this state law violated the parents’ freedom of religion since the state’s secondary education conflicted with Amish values and beliefs and was contrary to their way of life.
Inflation. The 1970s saw rising prices, a new trade deficit, and rising unemployment. To combat inflation, Nixon cut spending on social programs, and took America off the gold standard. When these measures did not work, he imposed the first peacetime wage and price controls. All of these attempts to control inflation proved unsuccessful.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)
President Nixon signed a law that created the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to protect the environment. The EPA sets air and water pollution standards for cities, and engages in monitoring and enforcement activities. New construction projects must pass through detailed environmental impact reviews before being approved. Private citizens can file lawsuits against polluters under the EPA.
Nixon also signed the Endangered Species Act (1973). This law requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to list species of plants and animals that are threatened with extinction, and then to take further steps to protect them.
THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT (ERA)
In 1923, Alice Paul, a suffragist leader and founder of the National Woman’s Party, proposed the Equal Rights Amendment: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” For almost fifty years, the amendment was introduced in each session of Congress, but it failed to pass.
In 1972, the amendment was finally approved by Congress and sent to the states with a seven-year time limit for ratification. The deadline was extended to 1982, but the amendments still fell three states short of the support needed for ratification. It has been reintroduced into every Congress since that time.
One outspoken critic of the Women’s Liberation Movement was Phyllis Schlafly. Her book attacking liberal Republicans was used by Goldwater supporters in his 1964 Presidential campaign.
Schlafly also campaigned against the Equal Rights Amendment, which she believed would reduce the rights of wives and harm family life. Schlafly further claimed it would deprive women of the “right” to be “supported and protected” by men. For example,
Schlafly believed the amendment might lead to unisex restrooms and require women to serve in combat roles.

CHAPTER 15: Crisis and Resurgence, 1969-2000	333

Meanwhile, in 1972 a group of former CIA agents, working for Nixon’s re-election as President, were caught breaking into Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. This would soon lead to an even greater scandal than Agnew’s resignation.
THE COVER-UP
President Nixon tried to cover up an investigation of the Watergate break-in on the grounds that it involved national security. Two investigative reporters were the first to report possible links between the break-in and the White House. The Senate appointed a committee to investigate the incident. The Attorney General also appointed a Special Prosecutor to examine possible wrongdoing.
THE WATERGATE TAPES
In the Senate hearings, a Presidential aide stated that Nixon had participated in the cover-up. Next, it was revealed that Nixon had secretly recorded all of his own White House conversations.
When the Senate Committee asked to listen to the tapes, Nixon refused, claiming executive privilege. Nixon asserted that Congress had no authority to question members of the executive branch about internal communications advising the President without Presidential approval. In the case of United States v. Nixon (1974), Nixon
further contended that if he obeyed the district court order to turn over the tape-recordings, it would lead to judicial control of the Presidency, violating the separation of powers in the Constitution. When the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, it ruled that Nixon must turn over the tapes, reaffirming the principle that no one is above the law.
Woodward (r) and Bernstein won a Pulitzer for their investigative reporting in the case.
Instead of the tapes, Nixon offered up transcripts of the conversations.
NIXON RESIGNS
When the tapes were made public, they revealed that Nixon had in fact lied when he said he was not involved in the cover-up. Based on this and other allegations, the House of Representatives moved to impeach Nixon. Fearing removal from office by the U.S. Senate, Nixon became the first President to resign.
Nixon leaves the White House for the last time.
CHAPTER 15: Crisis and Resurgence, 1969-2000	335
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
Ford later said he intended to spare Mr. Nixon and the nation from further turmoil as a result of the Watergate scandals. In his Autobiography he wrote:
“I simply was not convinced that the country wanted to see an
ex-President behind bars. We are not a vengeful people; forgiveness is one of the roots of the American tradition. And Nixon, in my opinion, had already suffered enormously .... But I wasn’t motivated by concern over the state of his health. It was the state of the country’s health at home and around the world that worried me .... ”
Do you think President Ford was truthful when said he was more concerned with the health of the country than that of Nixon? Explain your answer.
Do you think President Ford, in pardoning Nixon, did the right thing? Explain your answer.
CONTINUING STAGFLATION
Once in office, Ford’s main worries were economic ones. Economists had always believed that Inflation (rising prices) accompanied economic growth and full employment, not recession: this was because when most workers had jobs, they would ask to raise their wages; when consumers were actively buying goods, manufacturers would tend to raise their prices.
But now, Americans suffered from stagflation — high unemployment combined with inflation.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had been formed by oil-producing countries in 1960. Most OPEC members were Arab countries. In 1973, the Arab nations of OPEC used oil as a political weapon by imposing an oil embargo on the United States and Western European for siding with Israel in the 1973 war. Overnight, the price of oil shot up. Even when the war ended, the members of OPEC continued to push oil prices higher to enrich their own economies. The higher cost of energy had a significant impact on the American economy — from the cost of heating a home to the prices of food, electricity and gasoline.

Many banks excluded people in low-income neighborhoods from loans and other financial services. This practice was sometimes known as “redlining” because it was possible to draw a red line on a map clearly delineating these neighborhoods. The practice especially affected minorities. Carter pushed through Congress the Community Reinvestment Act (1977), which required banks to make credit available in poor communities, preventing the decay of low-income neighborhoods in inner cities.
FOREIGN POLICY
In foreign policy, Carter wanted the United States to set a moral example for other nations. Carter made human rights a high priority: he condemned apartheid in South Africa, pressured the Soviet Union to allow its Jews to emigrate, and cut aid to dictatorships that violated human rights.
THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY,
1977 Carter wanted to set an example by having the United States act fairly in its dealings with Panama. He signed a treaty returning control of all of the Canal Zone, except for the canal itself, to Panama. The United States further agreed to turn over the canal to Panama by the end of the century.
CAMP DAVID ACCORDS,
1977 Israel had been established as a homeland for the Jewish people by the United Nations in 1948 in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Many Jews had already been living in the area, but there were also many Palestinian Arabs. Truman had strongly supported the creation of Israel, and ever since 1948, U.S. policy had been generally supportive of Israel, a pro-Western democracy in the Middle East. U.S.-Israeli relations were also influenced by the strong support of American Jews for Israel. Israel relied on U.S. economic and military aid for its survival.
Egypt and Israel had fought one another in a series of wars ever since the creation of Israel back in 1948. In 1977, President Carter invited Anwar Sadat, the President of Egypt, and Menachem Begin, the Prime Minister of Israel, to the Presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland. After face-to-face negotiations, an agreement between the two leaders was reached. Under the Camp David Accords, Israel agreed to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, which Israel had taken in the Six-Day War in 1967. In exchange, Egypt offered a peace treaty and the establishment of normal diplomatic relations with Israel — ending thirty years of warfare.

Reagan supporter Charlton Heston later became President of the NRA.
After the problems faced by recent Presidents, conservative beliefs suddenly enjoyed an unexpected resurgence in the United States in the 1980s. In Great Britain, Margaret Thatcher had come into office in 1979 with similar ideas — combating unions, reducing taxes, cutting government spending, and reducing the amount of government regulations. In the 1980 Presidential election, Ronald Reagan received the support of a number of leading American conservative groups:
NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION
The NRA was begun to promote rifle shooting and marksmanship skills. After the assassinations of President Kennedy, his brother Robert, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Congress enacted the Gun Control Act of 1968. The NRA had traditionally steered clear of politics, but now it became more political. Most of its members tended to be politically conservative. In the 1980 election, the NRA endorsed Ronald Reagan, marking the first time in its history the NRA supported a Presidential candidate.
Jerry Falwell
THE MORAL MAJORITY
Another highly influential conservative group that helped elect Reagan was the Moral Majority, mainly composed of Fundamentalist Christians. Begun in 1979 by evangelist Rev. Jerry Falwell, the Moral Majority favored a strict interpretation of the Bible, and an agenda that was socially conservative and anti-Communist. The group also opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. The Moral Majority made telephone calls and held rallies to help get Ronald Reagan elected as President. The group was dissolved in 1989 when Falwell announced that "our mission is accomplished." HERITAGE FOUNDATION
Many of Reagan's policies were strongly influenced by the Heritage Foundation, a "think-tank" based in Washington, D.C. The Heritage Foundation seeks to promote conservative policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, values, and a strong national defense. It provides an example of a non-profit lobbying group that attempts to influence legislators on various bills.

Immigration Policy. President Reagan introduced new changes to our immigration laws. To deal with the problem of illegal immigration, the Mazzoli-Simpson Act (1986) “legalized” illegal aliens who had lived continuously in the United States since 1981.
Sandra Day O'Connor. In 1981, President Reagan nominated Sandra Day O’Connor as the first woman Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Bom in El Paso, Texas, she studied in California before moving to Arizona. O’Connor had served as Arizona’s Assistant Attorney General, State Senator, and a Superior Court Judge. During her early years on the U.S. Supreme Court she was a conservative who preferred “judicial restraint.” She emerged in the late 1990s as a swing vote between the conservative and liberal groups on the Court.
Projected Population Changes, 1980-2000
Until the 1970s, most Americans lived in the Northeast and Midwest, with its hot summers and cold winters. The Southeast was considered too hot and humid in summers, while the West was too dry and remote.
A number of technological developments altered this situation.
Government-built dams
made more water available to Western cities. With rising oil prices, more Americans preferred mild winters over frigid and snowy ones. Lastly, air conditioning and hydro-electric power made it possible to keep homes, offices, and factories cool in the summer.
HI POPULATION DECLINE
GROWTH OF 0-5% GROWTH OF
J® GROWTH OF 28%-50% @ GROWTH OVER 50%
As a result, the West and South, known as the "Sun Belt," saw a sharp rise in their populations. Since the 1960s, when air conditioning first came in wider use, the Northeast and Midwest have increased in population just 27%, while the South and West have grown more than four times as much. California and Texas have become the nation's largest states, while urban regions like Atlanta and Las Vegas are the nation's fastest growing urban centers. As the population density of cities in the Sun Belt grew, the environment of the area changed. Shopping malls and factories sprang up in place of grasslands, mountains, and deserts. Cities demanded more scarce supplies of water and energy, which sometimes had to be brought from great distances, placing a greater burden on the environment.

CHAPTER 15: Crisis and Resurgence, 1969-2000	345
THE IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR
The Iran-Contra Affair arose out of a secret foreign policy operation by officials in the Reagan White House. In 1986, officials in the Reagan Administration acted against the policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists by secretly selling arms to Iran as part of a deal in exchange for the release of American hostages in Lebanon. Profits from the sales of the arms to Iran were then diverted to support the anti-Communist “Contra” rebels fighting the Communist government of Nicaragua. This was done even though Congress had specifically prohibited any U.S. aid to the Contras.
When the affair was revealed, it shocked the nation since the Reagan administration had denounced Iran as a supporter of global terrorism. An investigation cleared the President of any direct wrong-doing, although he had failed to monitor the actions of some of his top officials. Several officials were convicted of lying to Congress and sent to prison.
The Iran-Contra Affair greatly tarnished America’s credibility in the world. After the Watergate Scandal, it led many citizens to seriously question their trust in their government officials. Nevertheless, President Reagan continued to enjoy strong support among many members of the American public.
Reagan’s second term witnessed the triumph of democracy in many parts of the world. In the Philippines and Latin America, dictatorships and military governments were suddenly replaced by democratically-elected civilian governments.
The final years of the Reagan Presidency saw the beginnings of the end of the Cold War. Early in his Presidency, Reagan had called the Soviet Union an “Evil Empire.” Mikhail Gorbachev became head of the Soviet Communist Party in 1985. The failure of the Soviet economic and political system forced Gorbachev to introduce reforms inside the Soviet Union. Gorbachev also agreed to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan and to allow peaceful changes to take place in Eastern Europe. Reagan and Gorbachev then held a series of conferences, and even signed an agreement dismantling thousands of nuclear missiles.
Historians hold conflicting views on Reagan’s role in winding down the Cold War. His critics contend that Reagan was an accidental beneficiary of Gorbachev’s reforms, and that he does not deserve credit for winning the Cold War. Reagan’s supporters believe he played an essential role in this process. They point to Reagan’s forthright defense of freedom and democracy, his policy of “roll-back,” and the threat of the Star Wars program, all of which placed so much economic and military pressure on Soviet leaders that they felt compelled to reform their system.
Reagan speaks at the Berlin Wall in Germany.
CHAPTER 15: Crisis and Resurgence, 1969-2000	347
The next President, George H.W. Bush, had served two terms as Reagan’s Vice President. Bush promised to continue Reagan’s policies, but with greater compassion in dealing with the homeless and the poor. He also promised to improve education and fight drug use.

Bush’s previous experience had mainly been in foreign policy, but he faced several important challenges at home. His greatest domestic challenge was to reduce the growing budget deficit.
Events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union permitted cuts in military spending. In late 1990, Bush agreed to increase income taxes on the wealthy, but he was never able to make a significant reduction in the budget deficit.
The Impact of Defense Spending on the U.S. Economy. Experts disagree on the impact that military spending can have on a country’s economy. It can provide a shortterm stimulus, pushing the nation through the business cycle from recession to prosperity. For example, military expenditures in World War II helped achieve full employment after the Great Depression. On the other hand, military spending can divert, or “crowd out,” resources from other more productive uses, and may thus slow long-term economic growth. Heavy military spending can mean less investment in peacetime projects, higher budget deficits, and more borrowing or higher taxes. Less money will be available, for example, for education. When President Johnson increased American involvement in Vietnam, he thus had to cut back on many Great Society programs.
Supreme Court Appointments. President Bush made several appointments to the Supreme Court, leading to a conservative majority on the Court. The new Supreme Court toughened the rules for criminal defendants, reduced the scope of abortion rights, and introduced other important changes.
The Recession. The United States gradually moved back into a recession by 1990. Economists blamed the economic downturn on reduced spending by consumers, corporations, and federal and state governments. In addition, greater foreign competition led to less demand for some American products. This resulted in lay-offs in several key industries.
While the 1970s and 1980s witnessed increases in population in the Sunbelt, the opposite was true of the “Rust Belt” — areas of the Northeast and Midwest with coal and iron resources, which had once been the center of American industry. With the collapse of the U.S. steel industry, cities such as Gary (Indiana), Detroit (Michigan), and Milwaukee (Wisconsin) have suffered a steady loss of manufacturing jobs to Mexico and overseas.

President Bush declared a cease-fire but refused to go further by removing Saddam Hussein from power. The crisis was significant as the first major challenge to world order after the end of the Cold War. American prestige in the Middle East was greatly enhanced by its success in the war. Bush used America’s new stature to initiate peace talks between Israel and Its Arab neighbors in late 1991.
Somalia. In 1992, President Bush began a humanitarian airlift of food and supplies to war-tom Somalia In northeast Africa, where millions of people faced starvation. When local warlords and bandits continued to steal and threaten food shipments, Bush sent in U.S. troops in the final month of his Presidency.
Select one incident or aspect of the domestic or foreign policy of President George H.W. Bush and create a graphic organizer describing it in greater detail.
Bill Clinton came from a poor Arkansas background. He studied as a Rhodes scholar in England and attended Yale Law School, where he met his wife Hillary Clinton. After law school, Clinton entered politics. He was elected Governor of Arkansas. The Presidential election of 1992 saw Clinton successfully unite different groups within the Democratic Party as well as attract independent voters. Many Americans believed Bush was not doing enough to fight the recession. The criticisms of a third-party candidate, Ross Perot, further weakened Bush’s authority. Perot received about 20% of the total vote, making him one of the most successful third-party candidates in history.
President Clinton addresses Congress.
Clinton promised Americans an ambitious agenda of reform. However, like many Presidents, he found difficulty in obtaining Congressional support for many of his proposals. Although Democrats controlled Congress during the first two years of his Presidency, Clinton had difficulty passing his early budgets. His first budget limited federal spending, increased income taxes to 40% on the richest Americans, cut taxes for low-income Americans, and introduced a federal gasoline tax.

ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
The first Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives in 40 years, Newt Gingrich wrote about the Contract with America, that “there is no comparable Congressional document in our two-hundred-year history.”
“We intend to restore accountability to Congress. On the first meeting of Congress, the new Republican majority will immediately pass the following reforms, aimed at restoring the trust of the American people in their government: First, require all laws that apply to the country also apply equally to Congress; Second, select an independent auditing firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Congress for waste, fraud or abuse;
Third, cut the number of House committees, and cut committee staff by one-third; Fourth, limit the terms of all committee chairmen;
Fifth, require committee meetings to be open to the public.
Sixth, require a three-fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase;

A ticket to the Clinton impeachment trial.
1


President Clinton became the subject of a major scandal in his second term of office In 1999, for the second time in history, the Senate conducted an impeachment trial of a President.
An independent prosecutor had uncovered a sexual affair between Clinton and a White House intern. After finding that Clinton had lied about the affair under oath, the prosecutor recommended impeachment. Removing the
President from office requires a formal accusation, or impeachment, by the House of Representatives, and a trial and conviction by the Senate. Impeachment requires a majority vote of the House; conviction is more difficult, requiring a two-thirds vote in the Senate. Voting along party lines, the Republican House of Representatives impeached the President. In the Senate, the Republicans fell short of the required two-thirds votes needed to remove the President. Once again, Americans felt they could not trust their elected leaders.
Unlike Bush, Clinton came to the White House with little experience in foreign affairs. Nevertheless, some of his greatest successes were in foreign policy.

Participation in international organizations may place voluntary limits on a nation's own sovereignty.
International organizations in-volve the United States in problems around the world.
International organizations cost the United States billions of dollars to support.
China. At first, President Clinton tried to protect human rights in China by proposing to link U.S. trade with China to the promotion of democracy and human rights. He abandoned this policy when it appeared to have no effect on China except hurting U.S. economic interests. Although Clinton continued to press China for human rights reform, he separated this demand from trade issues.
In 1999, U.S. missiles accidentally hit the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia. Chinese nationalists, suspicious that this incident was no accident, marched on the U.S. embassy in Beijing, throwing rocks and chanting anti-U.S. slogans. U.S.-Chinese relations suffered a setback, but there was no attempt to halt U.S.-Chinese trade. By the end of the year, U.S. officials even helped China join the World Trade Organization, further cementing economic ties.

Russia. Both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton followed a policy of maintaining friendly relations with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.		Israel.TheClinton Administration followed Bush's lead in working towards peace between Israel and its earlier opponents, the PLO and Jordan.				Somalia. American and United Nations forces were unable to end the fighting between rival war lords in Somalia. President Clinton withdrew U.S. troops when no further progress was in sight.
						
Haiti. Haitian military leaders threw out Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a priest who had won U.N.-supervised free elections in 1990. Clinton sent U.S. troops to Haiti, resulting in the return of Aristide to power in 1994.				Iraq. Clinton airlifted U.S. troops to the Middle East to pressure dictator Saddam Hussein to withdraw Iraqi troops from along the Kuwait border. Later he took steps to force Hussein to allow U.N. inspectors to enter Iraq to continue their inspections for nuclear and biological weapons.

Under President Obama’s leadership, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, pumping more federal money into the economy. Obama also gave financial relief to the leading automobile manufacturers to prevent them from going bankrupt. J.
President Obama pushed health care reform and the reform of banks and credit card lenders through Congress. He also appointed Sonia Sotomayor as the first Hispanic to the U.S. Supreme Court. K.
President Obama began to withdraw forces from Iraq and added troops to the war in Afghanistan. In 2011, U.S. forces apprehended and killed Osama bin Laden, who had been found hiding in Pakistan. In Spring 2011, local populations in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya overthrew their dictators. President Obama encouraged local Arab leaders not to use force against the demonstrators. L.
Scientific discoveries and technological innovations drive the American economy today. The free enterprise system, with its profit motive and system of copyrights and patents, helps drive innovation forward. Often, scientists and engineers make innovations to address specific needs. M.
The United States is now part of a global economy. The use of energy and protection of the environment are important aspects of this economy. N.

A
Florida official closely examines a ballot for accuracy. Gore appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which demanded a statewide recount. Bush appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court ruled, by a narrow 5 to 4 vote, to order an end to the recount. The Florida Supreme Court had instructed those making the recount to evaluate the voter’s intent in cases where the ballot was not correctly punched in. The U.S. Supreme Court majority objected to this, saying there were no consistent standards for reviewing the ballots. Critics felt that the U.S. Supreme Court had voted along partylines — 5 conservative Justices vs. 4 liberal ones. Some thought the Court, with a majority of Justices appointed
by Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Bush, was acting against the will of the people, as expressed in the popular vote, to put a minority candidate whom they favored into office.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
With the election results and balloting practices being debated in the courts, the nation faced a constitutional crisis. The U.S. Supreme Court said the following in delivering its majority decision:
“None are more conscious of the vital limits on judicial authority
than are the members of this Court, and none stand more in admiration of the Constitution’s design to leave the selection of the President to the people, through their legislatures, and to the political sphere. When contending parties invoke the process of the courts, however, it becomes our unsought responsibility to resolve the federal and constitutional issues the judicial system has been forced to confront. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is reversed.”
Do you think the U.S. Supreme Court was correct to halt the recount and to declare Bush as the winner, even though Gore had won the popular vote? Explain your answer.
The Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education was unanimous. In Bush v. Gore, the vote was 5 to 4. What did this show?
DOMESTIC POLICY UNDER BUSH
As President, George W. Bush pushed through a tax cut in an attempt to revitalize the economy. The Federal Reserve Board also dropped interest rates to their lowest levels in decades. The tax cuts revived the economy, but also brought a return to high federal budget deficits. The cuts also mainly favored the wealthy. Bush claimed that the cuts were needed to get the economy growing again.
As Governor of Texas, Bush had been active in promoting educational reform. As President, he introduced the No Child Left Behind Act, requiring states to test all students in English and mathematics each year from the third to the eighth grade.
CHAPTER 16: America in the New Millennium 369
President Bush also took steps to curb terrorism at home. A new federal agency, the Transportation Security Agency (TSA), took over security at U.S. airports, and all passengers and luggage were subjected to a thorough screening.
In 2003, President Bush created a new Cabinet post, the Department of Homeland Security. Its mission was to keep the United States secure from all threats. Its activities range from nuclear detection and intelligence coordination to the protection of high-level government officials.
Bush also sponsored the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which greatly expanded the government’s law enforcement powers. The September 11th terrorists had been organized into four teams. Some had trained as pilots in America. They had cell phones and computers to communicate, and bank accounts funded by international terrorist groups. The new act allowed law enforcement officials and intelligence agencies the power to conduct sweeping searches and surveillance, detain immigrants and monitor bank accounts. President Bush authorized the National Security Agency (NSA) to wiretap suspected callers without first obtaining a warrant. Some felt that the USA PATRIOT Act gave the executive branch too much power, threatening individual liberties. Its “warrantless” wiretaps were later held to be unconstitutional.
President Bush signs the USA PATRIOT Act into law.
President Bush also imprisoned suspected terrorists, captured in Afghanistan at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, where the rights required by the U.S. Constitution did not have to be given to the accused. Prisoners who went on a hunger strike were force-fed. The Department of Justice believed that limited torture techniques, such as “water-boarding” — pouring water on the face of a prisoner to create the sensation of drowning — were justified to obtain information from the suspects about future attacks, which might save thousands of
lives. Critics felt torture is rarely successful or necessary for obtaining accurate information. They claimed prisoners were treated inhumanely, even though some of them might be innocent. They wished to see Guantamamo Bay closed.

CHAPTER 16: America in the New Millennium 371
President Bush next turned his attention to Iraq. Bush and his top advisors feared that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein might provide biological, chemical, or even nuclear weapons to Islamic terrorists like Osama bin Laden.
A FAILED ULTIMATUM LEADS TO AN INVASION
Hussein had used chemical weapons against the Kurds in the 1980s. Although Hussein denied that he possessed “weapons of mass destruction” (WMDs), he at first refused to allow U.N. inspectors to search in Iraq. Later,
U.N. inspectors found no WMDs, but some questioned whether their inspection was thorough enough. The United States, Britain, and Spain warned Iraq to surrender its WMDs or face invasion. France, Germany, and Russia favored a more cautious approach, calling for
additional inspections. American leaders feared Hussein would use any delay to hide his weapons. In March 2003, President Bush gave Hussein 48 hours to leave Iraq or face invasion. When Hussein rejected the ultimatum, coalition forces took military action.
Some of the 5,000 Kurdish victims killed by chemical gas attacks in Iraq in 1988.
ACTING- AS AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN
In March 2003, President Bush informed Americans that the United States and several of its allies were attacking Iraq:
“Our nation enters this conflict reluctantly. The United States and our allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that
threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder. We will meet that threat now, with our [military], so that we do not have to meet it later with armies of fire fighters and police on the streets of our cities. Now that conflict has come, the only way to limit its duration is to apply decisive force. I assure you, this will not be a campaign of half measures. We will accept no outcome but victory.”
In this speech, President Bush gave Americans his reasoning for the war in Iraq. Explain his justification in your own words.
President Bush said the United States was going to go to war sooner rather than later so that Americans would not face “armies of firefighters and police on the streets of our cities.” Compare this viewpoint with the earlier Domino Theory.
The United States began its campaign with a series of air strikes. In early April, U.S. forces entered Baghdad. Hussein’s dictatorship quickly collapsed. Later, Hussein himself was captured, tried for crimes against Iraqi citizens during his long reign, and executed by Iraqis in 2006.

CHAPTER 16: America in the New Millennium 373
Hurricane Katrina was also the costliest hurricane on record. Much of the damage occurred when the levees in New Orleans failed to hold back the storm water. More than 1,800 people lost their lives in the flooding, making Katrina one the deadliest natural disasters in American history. It caused devastation as far as 100 miles from the storm’s center. Rescue efforts were so delayed that many citizens found themselves stranded for days on rooftops and in attics. Almost 20,000 people were trapped in New Orleans’ Superdome, crammed together In sweltering heat and unsanitary conditions.
Immediately following Hurricane Katrina, ABC television interviewed people in New Orleans affected by the storm. They asked: “Do you harbor any anger toward President Bush because of the slow federal response?” Some Americans blamed the Bush Administration for its slow reaction. Many respondents also claimed the City of New Orleans and Louisiana state government should have been more active, even before the federal government was called in. Who do you think was to blame for the loss of lives? Explain your answer. You may wish to conduct research on the Internet for more information.
The end of Bush’s second term coincided with the worst financial crisis in the United States since the Great Depression. For decades, the federal government and Federal Reserve had followed policies to reduce swings in the economy. These efforts, combined with the growth of globalization, now contributed to an unexpected collapse.
ROOTS OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS
When the stock market dropped sharply back in 2000, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to stimulate the economy. Many took advantage of these lower interest rates to buy new homes. Some banks lent money to borrowers who could not really afford their homes. Increasing homeowner-ship caused house prices to rise, leading to speculation in housing. Later, these mortgages were bundled with other Investments and sold to other banks or investors.
The housing crisis threatened the economy.
By 2007, overbuilding led to falling house prices. Some people had special mortgages that adjusted to higher interest rates. When interest rates began to rise, some homeowners found they could not afford their mortgages. This led to a rising number of home foreclosures (when a homeowner cannot pay the mortgage, and the bank takes back the house to sell it}. Meanwhile, the federal government gave rebates to taxpayers and businesses in February 2008 to stimulate the economy.
CHAPTER 16: America in the New Millennium 375
His election was also significant for a number of other reasons. Obama campaigned on a promise of change that powered him through the longest, most costly Presidential campaign in U.S. history. His election was remarkable for his rapid rise in American politics from a position of obscurity just a few years before. Obama used the Internet to gather supporters and to raise campaign contributions. With a stunning grassroots movement, he won the Presidency.
Obama is sworn in as the first African-American President.
ACTING AS AN AMATEUR. HISTORIAN
In January 2009 President Obama delivered this Inaugural Address to the nation:
“For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift. And we will act, not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We’ll restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology’s wonders to raise health care’s quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. All this we will do.”
Based on his Inaugural Address, how did President Obama intend to deal with some of the nation’s economic difficulties? Explain your answer.
OBAMA RESPONDS TO THE CRISIS
President Obama sought to prevent a depression like the 1930s. His objective was to simulate the economy by creating jobs, rebuilding roads, schools, bridges and tunnels. Obama also proposed important changes to the nation’s health care system and system of education.
In April 2009, Obama and Congressional leaders agreed to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, to jumpstart the American economy. More than $700 billion was to be spent by the federal government in a bailout package designed to create new jobs, save existing ones, spur economic activity, and invest in long-term infrastructure development. Part of the money would be spent directly by the federal government. Other funds were to be supplied to state governments.
The Obama Administration further responded to the financial crisis by passing legislation to regulate credit cards, lending and other banking practices. He also took steps to save the U.S. auto industry. After much controversy, a health care reform act was passed, which sought to make health care available to more Americans.

FREE ENTERPRISE AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
The free enterprise system allows people to use their own economic resources to produce goods and services for sale to others. Copyright and patent laws give writers and inventors exclusive rights to their own creations and inventions. In a free enterprise system, scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs have a powerful incentive to pay attention to the needs of consumers. Since they can profit by meeting consumer needs, they continually strive to improve established products and to create new ones. Both the producers and the consumers benefit.
By allowing people to pursue their own interests, free enterprise can drive technological innovation
and achieve extraordinary results. Running shoes, personal computers, gel toothpaste, cellular phones, BlackBerrys, iPhones, and global positioning system products are just some of the products created as a result of innovation by our free enterprise system.
The free enterprise system drives the creation of new businesses.
INNOVATIONS ADDRESSING SPECIFIC NEEDS
Attempts to address specific needs often lead to scientific discoveries and technological innovation. For example, in the 1950s, Dr. Jonas Salk specifically developed a vaccine to cure polio. In the 1980s, a new disease appeared known as AIDS. Those who contracted the disease had no immunity to other illnesses. Scientists set about discovering what caused AIDS and finding a cure. They discovered it was caused by the HIV virus, which attacks the human immune system. The virus can be transmitted during sexual contact or blood transfusions. Scientists were able to develop a number of specific drugs that slow down the reproduction of the HIV virus and help restore the immune system. Scientists are now attempting to find a vaccine to prevent AIDS.
Scientists have also developed new drugs to reduce the levels of cholesterol, lowering the risk of heart attacks, and they are working on a cure for Alzheimer’s, a disease that attacks an older person’s memory and mental abilities. Scientists have also developed more insect-resistant foods with greater nutritional value, making it possible to support the world’s growing population.
Both the U.S. military and space program have used teams of scientists and engineers to design solutions to specific problems. These solutions often have more general applications: the jet engine, for example, is now used by commercial airlines to power their airplanes, and the Internet, developed for scientists, is now used to communicate by everyone.
THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION
Much of the increased productivity of the American economy in the last few decades has been due to advances in information technology (IT). Computers are machines that use a binary system to store and manipulate information.

THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
Multinationals like McDonald’s operate in every corner of the world.
In the 1950s, American manufacturers mainly sold to consumers in the U.S. market. Today, our economy is integrated into the global economy. A multinational corporation is a corporation that has set up local companies, or subsidiaries, in several countries. Today, multinationals make and sell their products in every comer of the world. At the start of the twenty-first century, multinationals controlled more than half of the industrial assets of the United States and employed millions of workers
For example, McDonalds is a franchise with over 30,000 restaurants in 113 countries.
Starbucks sells coffee in 40 overseas markets, operating 12,000 stores. Nike has stores on six continents. Wal-Mart has 2,700 global retail units employing 500,000. Exxon-Mobil and Chevron have subsidiaries in several countries.
Globalization. The emergence of multinational corporations has contributed to globalization. This has had a serious impact on government policies. For example, when a government bans its factories from dumping toxic waste into rivers and harming the environment,
a national company must comply by changing its procedures. However, a multinational company can decide to simply move its production abroad to a more friendly country rather than comply. Multinationals can move their production to countries where labor is less expensive, environmental regulations are more lax, and taxes are lower or non-existent. This freedom of movement penalizes those governments that seek to maintain higher standards of social welfare, environmental regulation or tax policies. Competition among multinational corporations is now intensifying. For example, American automobile manufacturers now face stiff competition from multinational corporations originating in Japan, Germany, Britain, and Korea.
ENERGY
Population growth and rising living standards have led to a greater demand for energy, at home and abroad. It was once thought that nuclear power plants might meet most of our energy needs without pollution. The Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011 have raised fears that nuclear power might impose more dangers than first thought.

Water Pollution. As cities have become more crowded, their ability to handle increased sewage and waste is strained. This can lead to the dumping of raw sewage into surrounding waters, contaminating drinking water, killing wildlife, and threatening the health of everyone in society.
THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
There is a growing belief among Americans that protection of the environment is a governmental responsibility. This is based on the realization that we all need
to breathe clean air and drink safe water. Only the government is capable of managing these resources and
preventing pollution since it has the ability to punish violators. Government decisions, however, are often linked to the costs involved: how much are Americans willing to sacrifice to protect their environment? This question makes protection of the environment especially challenging.
Creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of the Endangered Species Act gave the federal government special powers for protecting the environment. States also have their own laws and agencies for environmental protection. Both the federal and state governments also directly own some forest, desert, and mountain areas. Governments are responsible for meeting the costs of floods, droughts, and other environmental disasters. Governments undertake the construction of dams, roads, bridges. Both the federal and state governments have their own programs related to environmental protection, environmental awareness, and pollution control. Lastly, private groups and voluntary organizations play an increasing role in promoting public awareness and protecting the environment, such as the Sierra Club, founded in California by conservationist John Muir in 1892.

CHAPTER 16: America in the New Millennium 385
First, the size of the total U.S. population has more than doubled since the end of World War II:
Year	Population	Year	Population
1950	151,325,798	1990	248,709,873
1960	179,323,175	2000	281,421,906
1970	203,211,926	2010	308,745,538
1980	226,545,805	2020	—
In fact, the United States is the third largest nation in terms of population, after China and India.
Secondly, the center of population of the United States has shifted away from the Northeast and Midwest and towards the Sun Belt. The map below shows an ever westward shift of the population. California had 10.5 million in 1950 and 37 million in 2010. Texas’ population grew from 7.7 million in 1950 to 25 million in 2010, while Florida had only 2.8 million people in 1950, it has grown to 18.8 million today.
MEAN CENTER OF POPULATION FOR
Thirdly, much of the recent population growth of the United States has been due to immigration. About 13% of the population living in the United States today are immigrants. The United States has both legal immigrants — those who apply for and receive visas for permanent residence, known as green cards — and millions of illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants are people who cross America’s borders with Mexico or Canada, or who land on American shores, without officially entering the country.
