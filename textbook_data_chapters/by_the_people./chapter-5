By 1754, another war erupted, known in Europe as the Seven Years’ War and in British North America as the French and Indian War. Unlike the previous wars, the British would be decisively victorious at the end of the French and Indian War in 1763 (see Chapter 5). However, the consequences of expanding the British Empire in North America would be significant.
The many wars between 1689 and 1763 (see Table 4-2) disrupted life in North America. Colonial militias were called up. Colonial shipping was attacked. Settlements of colonists and Indians were damaged or ruined. Indian alliances shifted. Various tribes were either decimated or fled their homelands. Many colonists and Indians died, and for many of those who survived, life was far from secure.
The Unifying Effects of the Wars on British Colonies
During the many wars that took place in the 1700s, many English colonists developed a deep sense of patriotism to the British cause, often linked to an equally strong dislike of all things French and of the Indian nations allied with France. At the same

time, they came to realize that the British army was sometimes far away when it was most needed and that they needed to develop their own militias to protect themselves. The British monarchs were distracted by these wars and were inclined to neglect the colonies in the intervening years. As a result, colonial governments grew stronger and more independent through the early decades of the 1700s.
For most of his life, Benjamin Franklin was a loyal subject of the British Empire. In 1754, Franklin wrote that his greatest desire was for the people of Great Britain and the people of Britain’s American colonies to “learn to consider themselves, not as belonging to different Communities with different Interests, but to one Community with one Interest.” In 1754 many colonists agreed with Franklin.
By the early 1750s, it was clear to many who were living in British North America that the tension between England and France, which was playing out on both sides of the Atlantic, would soon lead to another war. In the early summer of 1754, several of the North American colonial governments appointed commissioners to meet in Albany, New York, to negotiate stronger mutual defense treaties with the Six Nations of the Iroquois and to discuss the common defense of the British colonies. Benjamin Franklin, who was chosen as one of Pennsylvania’s four commissioners, wanted far more. He arrived in Albany with a plan for “one general government [that] may be formed in America, including all the said colonies.” The particulars of the Albany Plan of Union, as it came to be known, included a provision that each colony would retain its own government, but that the new united colonies would be led by a council of representatives from the 13 colonies and a single “president general” appointed by the Crown. The unified government would have authority to raise soldiers, build forts, and regulate trade with the Indians. It would help the 13 colonies realize Franklin’s

Albany Plan of Union
Plan put forward in 1754 by Massachusetts governor William Shirley, Benjamin Franklin, and other colonial leaders, calling for an intercolonial union to manage defense and Indian affairs.
Even as late as 1774 Benjamin Franklin, shown here with members of Parliament, considered himself a loyal

dream of being “one community with one interest” in relation to each other as well as to Great Britain. Franklin could not understand why the colonists couldn’t borrow an idea from the Six Nations of the Iroquois with whom they were negotiating. As Franklin said, if the Iroquois “should be capable of forming a Scheme for such an Union” he could not understand why “a like Union should be impracticable for ten or a Dozen English Colonies ”
In fact, Franklins proposed plan, though supported by the commissioners who met in June and July of 1754, was defeated resoundingly by the colonies. Every colonial legislature rejected the plan, fearing it meant giving up too much control to other colonies and especially to the Crown, who would appoint the leader. At the same time, officials in London rejected the plan because they saw it giving too much power to the colonies. They preferred to have each colony accountable separately to London. Nevertheless, quite a few colonial leaders met each other for the first time at the Albany gathering, and the possibility of union had been mentioned and considered.
Tensions continued to grow between Britain and France and between Britain’s Iroquois allies and the tribes allied with the French forces. As the British colonies saw the world moving toward a war between Great Britain and France—a war they knew would be fought in large part on the border between British North America and New France—colonial legislatures sought to raise taxes to provide for their defense. This need was especially urgent in Pennsylvania where Indians, allied with France, had defeated several western settlements and were within a day’s distance of Philadelphia itself.
Even in this desperate situation, however, the Penn family, which still controlled the colony, refused to allow their own lands to be taxed. Although William Penn had founded the colony as a refuge for persecuted Quakers, his son Thomas saw it mostly as a source of income. By 1757, the Pennsylvania legislature decided to send a delegation to England to negotiate directly with Thomas Penn to get him to pay his fair share of the funds to protect his colony or, if that failed, to request the English government to give them a royal governor rather than one appointed by the Penn family. The obvious representative for Pennsylvania to send was Benjamin Franklin. The 51-year-old Franklin sailed for England that summer and, except for brief trips home, lived there until 1775. He did not get the funds from Penn but enjoyed London and, for many years, remained a very loyal British subject, even attending the coronation of King George III in 1760. However, beginning in the early 1760s, the pressure of war as well as issues of politics, trade, and taxes began to drive Britain and the colonists apart.

CONCLUSION

Partll Settlements Old
The Glorious Revolution of 1689 changed the balance of power in England’s government. Although kings and queens were much more than figureheads, Parliament assumed greater control over the nation and its overseas territories. In 1707 England united with Scotland to become Great Britain and, with its colonies in North America and elsewhere around the world, became a true empire. The wars Britain conducted on the European mainland over the course of the 1700s with its old enemies France and Spain would lead to parallel conflicts between the North American colonies of these empires, conflicts that also involved Native American tribes allied with each one of them. Great Britain also exerted its economic control over the British colonies by enforcing mercantilism, a closed economic system that allowed for trade only between the colonies and the mother country. This system was designed to ensure the colonies supplied Great Britain with raw materials; in return, the colonies did not manufacture
their own goods or buy them on a world market but, rather, purchased manufactured and New, 1607-1754
goods only from Great Britain. Nevertheless, Britain’s American colonies grew and prospered with thriving port cities and an emerging colonial elite who sometimes became quite good at evading the British governments regulations.
The social and economic life of the American colonists also changed after the 1680s. In response to the revolt of slaves, indentured servants, and poor white farmers in Bacon’s Rebellion, a trend among the wealthy elite to use more slaves and fewer indentured servants led to deeper divisions along racial lines in Virginia. The southern colonies, where the greatest growth of the slave population was taking place, enacted laws that created a slave society in which African slaves could expect a lifetime of servitude. The slave trade of the notorious Middle Passage brought increased numbers of slaves to support a growing slave-plantation economy.
In addition, underlying tensions connected to Indian attacks were growing. This tension, along with long-standing tensions about the role of women in society and beliefs across European cultures about the active role of witches in society, led to the Salem witch trials that involved an entire community in hysterical accusations, legal actions, and 20 executions.
Women’s roles were largely relegated to the private realm—raising children and working in the home. Rural women often led lonely lives with few opportunities to connect with other women. Helping other women through childbirth was an important way rural women connected. Urban women had more options to socialize, particularly in the trade of household necessities such as preserved foods, soap, and candles. Some women joined their husbands as part of the privileged social and economic elite of the colonies.
From the first settlement in British North America onward, colonists maintained a sense that somehow their new land was a divinely planned opportunity to begin the world again and make it right. Cotton Mather, a well-known minister in Boston, confirmed this sense in his writings. By the early 1700s, however, the sense of being on a divine mission had declined among many colonists, and tolerance for religious diversity was growing. Those in Europe and in the colonies who began to look more to science and human reason than to faith in trying to understand their world, called this time the Age of Enlightenment. Some in this period rejected all religious teachings while others simply emphasized reason over faith. Many ministers worried about a religious decline in the colonies, and some sought ways to release religious energy, spawning the First Great Awakening. Yet other colonists came to a growing regard for other forms of self-improvement and interest, like those championed by Benjamin Franklin in his Poor Richards Almanack. Increasingly, in spite of philosophical differences, colonists came to regard themselves more and more as Americans and less and less as simply British subjects living on a different side of the Atlantic Ocean.
