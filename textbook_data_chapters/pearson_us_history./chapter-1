Every year, you and. your classmates participate in Celebrate Freedom Week activities. These activities are designed to remind you about some of the important ideas that make our country so special. In your school, you may have school-wide displays or an assembly. Maybe speakers come to share their thoughts or students write essays or make posters or develop presentations. Whatever happens in your school, you will likely take some time to think about America’s founding documents, such as the Declaration of independence.
The Declaration of Independence states some of America's most important ideas about society and government. It has played a key role in shaping America’s constitutional republic. As you recite the words, think about why students in Texas join in Celebrate Freedom Week.

The Bill of Rights
One of the chief ways early American leaders tried to protect individual rights was by adding the first ten Amendments to the Constitution. This section is known as the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights guarantees certain legal rights, and it limits the power of the government to interfere with others.
Constructing an Argument Write an essay discussing one of the rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights.
1.	Review the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution in the Reference Center. Notice that the Constitution has Commentary on the side of the actual document. This Commentary helps explain the language in the Constitution and can give you some background about each provision. Use the Commentary to help you review the first ten Amendments, or Bill of Rights.
2.	Choose one basic right as the focus of your essay. Note that several of the Amendments—including the First, Fifth, and Sixth—are divided into different parts, each dealing with a specific right. You may choose to focus on one part of one of these Amendments rather than the entire Amendment.
3.	Research a recent event or situation where the right you have chosen was protected or threatened. This might be an event or situation in your local community or a nearby community, in the state of Texas, or somewhere else in the nation. Be sure to use more than one source and to use reliable sources.
4.	Begin your essay by naming the Amendment you have chosen, and restating in your own words what the right protects or guarantees.
5.	Explain why you believe that right is important to guarantee liberty today.
» The First Amendment protects the right to petition.
6.	Describe what you think might happen if that right were not protected by the Constitution.
7.	Support your opinion with facts you have learned from your research.
8.	Don’t forget to check and revise your essay, as needed. Be sure to use proper grammar, spelling, and sentence structure.
9.	After you write your essay, your teacher may ask you and your classmates to share your views with the class. If so, remember to speak clearly and to present your views using the evidence you gathered for your essay. When listening to others, listen closely and be respectful of their views.

The First Americans
According to geologists, the Earth has gone through several ice ages. The last ice age occurred between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago. During that time, thick sheets of ice, called glaciers, covered almost one third of the Earth. In North America, glaciers stretched across Canada and reached as far south as present-day Kentucky.
Populations Spread Glaciers locked up water from the oceans, causing sea levels to fall and uncovering land that had been under water. In the far north, a land bridge joined Siberia in northeastern Asia to present-day Alaska in North America.
Most scientists think that bands of hunters reached North America across this land bridge. These hunters tracked herds of grazing animals. Other scientists disagree. They think that the first Americans crossed the icy arctic waters by boat, reaching North America by sea.
Once these early hunters reached the Americas, they had to keep moving in search of food. Slowly, over thousands of years, they spread across North America, Central America, and South America. The physical environments where they settled varied widely. Native Americans adapted to the physical environments of mountain plateaus, dry deserts, fertile plains, lush woodlands, and thick rain forests. In adapting to these very different environments, Native American groups developed many different customs.

Adapting to and Modifying Environments
About 12,000 years ago, the last ice age ended. As temperatures rose, the glaciers melted. The land bridge between Siberia and Alaska disappeared under the Bering Strait.
About the same time, some kinds of large animals died out. This forced hunting bands to adapt to new conditions. Smaller animals, wild berries, nuts, grains, and fish became a larger part of their diets.
About 5,000 years ago, people in the Americas learned to grow crops such as corn, beans, and squash. Farming modified the environment and brought great changes to those who practiced it. Farmers no longer had to keep moving to find food. Instead, they stayed in one place and began to build permanent settlements, or small communities. As farming methods improved, people produced more food, which in turn allowed the population to grow.
B CHECK UNDERSTANDING
How did farming affect communities in Central America?
Olmecs Develop a
Civilization
Farming was a key advance for early societies in the Americas. In time, some farming communities in the Americas grew enough surplus, or extra, food to support large populations, and the first cities emerged.
Cities marked the rise of the first civilization in the Americas. A civilization is a society—or a people sharing a language, territory, and economy—that has certain basic features. Among these are cities, an organized government, different social classes, a complex religion, and some method of record keeping.
The earliest known civilization in the Americas was that of the Olmecs in present-day Mexico. The Olmecs lived in the lowlands along the Gulf of Mexico about 3,500 years ago. Scientists have found huge stone heads carved by the Olmecs. Some were ten feet tall and weighed several tons. Smaller figures showed creatures that were part human and part animal.
Olmec farmers supplied nearby cities with food. There, powerful leaders built stone temples. The Olmecs left few written records, but they did make many advances. They studied the stars and developed

What features of Olmec society indicate that it was a civilization?
Mayan Civilization
The Olmecs influenced many later peoples, including the Mayas. The early Mayas lived in the rain forests of what are today Honduras, Belize, Guatemala, and southern Mexico. About 3,000 years ago, they began clearing the rain forest and draining swamps to create farmland.
Maya farmers were able to produce great harvests of corn, enough to feed large cities. As the Maya population grew, city-states began to spring up from Central America to southern Mexico. A city-state is a political unit that controls a city and its surrounding land. Trade flowed along a network of roads that linked inland city-states and the coast. City-states often waged war on one another for land, riches, and access to trade routes.
Mayan Social Classes Nobles also held great power in Maya society. The most powerful nobles were the kings, who also served as high priests. Other nobles
» Farming techniques developed in ancient times by the Mayas are still used by Maya farmers today.
also became priests. Priests held great power in Maya society. Only priests, the Mayas believed, could perform the ceremonies needed to bring good harvests or victory in battle. Priests conducted these ceremonies in temples built on top of huge stone pyramids.
Still other nobles served as warriors and government officials. Near the bottom of Maya society were laborers and farmers, who grew corn, squash, and many other crops. Below them were slaves, most of whom were prisoners of war or criminals.
Achievements in Mathematics and Astronomy
Maya priests had to know exactly when to honor the many gods who were thought to control the natural world. Every day, priests anxiously studied the sun, moon, and stars. They learned much about the movement of these bodies.
Based on their observations, priests made great advances in astronomy and mathematics. They learned to predict eclipses and created a relatively accurate, 365-day calendar. They also developed a system of numbers that included the new concept of zero.
Then, around A.D. 900, the Mayas abandoned their cities. Historians are not sure why. Perhaps they did so because of warfare, a drought—or both. The ram forests swallowed up the great Maya temples and palaces. Although Maya cities decayed, the Maya people survived. Today, more than 2 million people in Guatemala and southern Mexico speak Mayan languages.
RECALL
What sort of scientific advances did the Mayas achieve?
Aztec Civilization
Long after the Maya cities were abandoned, a new civilization arose to the northwest. Its builders were the Aztecs. The early Aztecs were nomads, people who moved from place to place in search of food. In the 1300s, the Aztecs settled around Lake Texcoco (tays KOH koh) in central Mexico. From there, they built a powerful empire.
Tenochtitlan On an island in the middle of the lake, the Aztecs built their capital, Tenochtitlan (tay nawch tee tlahn). They constructed a system of causeways, or raised roads made of packed earth. The causeways linked the capital to the mainland.
The Aztecs learned to farm the shallow swamps of Lake Texcoco. In some places, they dug canals, using the mud they removed to fill in parts of the lake. In other places, they attached floating reed mats to the lake
» Aztecs adapted to life on an island in the middle of a lake with limited land area by using chinampas for agriculture, even planting trees to better anchor them to the lake bed.
bottom with long stakes. Then, they piled mud onto the mats to create farmland. Aztec farmers harvested several crops a year on these chinampas, or floating gardens.
With riches from trade and conquest, Tenochtitlan prospered. Its markets offered a wide variety of goods. "There are daily more than 60,000 people bartering and selling,” wrote a Spanish visitor in the 1500s.
Religion Like the Mayas, Aztec priests studied the heavens and developed complex calendars. Such calendars gave them the ability to tell their people when to plant or harvest. Priests also performed rituals designed to please the many Aztec gods.
The Aztecs paid special attention to the god who controlled the sun. They believed that each day the sun battled its way across the heavens. They compared the sun’s battle to their own, calling themselves “warriors of the sun.” They believed that the sun required human sacrifices in order to rise each day. The Aztecs therefore killed thousands of captives each year to please this powerful god.
A
Powerful Empire By 1500, the Aztecs ruled a huge empire. It stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean and included millions of people. The Aztecs took great pride in their empire and their capital. "Who could conquer Tenochtitlan?” boasted an Aztec poet. “Who could shake the foundation of heaven?”
The Aztec world was far from peaceful, however. Heavy taxes and the sacrifice of huge numbers of prisoners of war sparked many revolts. The Aztecs waged war in part to capture more prisoners for sacrifice. Across the empire, people conquered by the Aztecs were eager for revenge. Enemies of the Aztecs would eventually help outsiders from distant lands destroy the Aztec empire.

What is a physical characteristic of Lake Texcoco, and how did the Aztecs adapt to it to live there?
Inca Civilization
Far to the south of the Aztecs, the Incas built one of the largest empires in the Americas. By 1500, their empire stretched for almost 2,500 miles along the west coast of South America.
An Impressive Capital The center of the Inca empire was the magnificent capital at Cuzco (KOOS koh), located high in the Andes in present-day Peru. Cuzco was a holy city to the Incas. All nobles in the empire tried to visit it at least once in their lifetimes. The city had massive palaces and temples made of stone and
'he Early Americas and European Exploration 8	1.1 The Early Americas
1.1 The Early Americas
decorated with gold ornaments. At the center was the palace of the emperor, who was known as the Sapa Inca. The emperor was regarded as a god who was descended from the sun god.
From Cuzco, the emperor ruled more than 10 million people. They lived in varied environments, from coastal deserts to lowland jungles to the highlands of the Andes. The Incas conquered this land by waging war against surrounding peoples.
The Inca empire was very well organized. The emperor was kept well informed about affairs in all parts of his empire. He sent high officials out to act as governors of his domain. The governors made sure that every person worked at least part of the time on projects for the state, such as road building, mining, farming, and pottery making.
Inca Achievements To unite their empire, the Incas maintained a system of roads that covered more than 10,000 miles. Builders carved roads in rock cliffs and stretched rope bridges across deep gorges. Teams of runners quickly spread royal orders across the empire using these roads.
The runners carried with them a device known as a quipu (kee poo). This was a cord or string with knots that stood for numbers or categories. The numbers

might be bags of grain, numbers of soldiers, or other amounts of goods that the government ordered from different parts of the empire. The quipu was also used by government officials to keep records.
The Incas were skilled engineers. They built massive stone temples and forts. With only human labor, ropes, and wooden rollers, they moved stones weighing up to 200 tons. They used all their engineering skills to farm the dry, rugged mountain lands. They became experts at creating terraces—or wide, flat steps of land out of the steep mountainsides. Sturdy stone walls kept rain from washing away the soil.
Id IDENTIFY CENTRAL IDEAS Why was a system of
roads so important to the Incas?
Early North American Societies
Scholars have found evidence of complex societies among some groups of people farther north. Traders and migrating people carried foods, goods, arts, and beliefs from Central America and Mexico to early peoples of North America. These peoples developed many distinct cultures in North America. A culture is the entire way of life of a people. It includes their homes, clothing, economy, arts, and government.
Land and People of the Southwest At least 3,000 years ago, knowledge of farming spread northward. Gradually, farming societies emerged in what is today the American Southwest. Much of this region is desert, with little rainfall and hot summers. The early societies in this region included the Hohokams (hoh HOH kahmz) and Anasazis (ah nuh SAH zeez).
The Hohokams lived in present-day southern Arizona. About 2,000 years ago, they dug networks of irrigation ditches so that they could farm the desert land. The ditches carried water from the Salt and Gila (hee luh) rivers to fields, where farmers produced corn, squash, and beans.
The Anasazis lived in the Four Corners region, where Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona meet today. Like the Hohokams, the Anasazis irrigated the desert in order to farm. They also created a network of roads to link dozens of towns. Traders traveled these roads, carrying cotton, sandals, and blankets woven from turkey feathers.
Anasazi Houses The Anasazis built large buildings with walls of stone and adobe, or sundried brick. When the Spanish later saw similar buildings in the early 1500s, they called them pueblos (pwehb lohz),
the Spanish word for “villages.” (They also called the descendants of the Anasazis the Pueblo Indians.) About 1,000 years ago, some Anasazi villages faced attacks from warlike neighbors. To escape that threat, they built new homes along steep cliffs. Toeholds cut into the rock let people climb the cliff walls. Farmers planted their crops on land above the cliffs
Mound Builders Far to the east, other farming cultures flourished in North America. Among them were the Mound Builders, various cultures that built large earth mounds beginning about 3,000 years ago. Thousands of these mounds dot the landscape from the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi Valley and from Wisconsin to Florida. What is now the eastern half of the United States had a wetter climate than the Southwest, and the Mound Builders were able to farm without irrigation.
The first mounds were used for burials. Later mounds were used for religious ceremonies. They were similar in function to the pyramid temples of the Mayas.
The best-known groups of Mound Builders were the Hopewells and the Mississippians. The Mississippians took advantage of their moist climate to grow enough crops to feed large towns. BetweenA.D. 700 and 1500, the Mississippians built a city at Cahokia (kah HOH kee ah) in present-day Illinois. As many as 30,000 people may have lived there at one time.

Culture and the Physical Characteristics of North America
Native Americans did not belong to just one group. Instead, Native Americans included many different people with many distinct cultures. In North America alone, there were hundreds of Native American languages spoken. Native American cultures, too, varied greatly, much like the cultures of the people of Europe.
Native American cultures were adapted to the many different physical environments of North America.The physical characteristics of the environment in each

region, as you will see below, influenced population distribution and settlement patterns, or where Native Americans lived, right up to modern times.
A culture region is a region in which people share a similar way of life. Most culture regions shared similar physical environments. Each culture region was home to many different tribes. A tribe is a community of people who share common customs, language, and rituals. Members of a tribe saw themselves as a distinct people who shared a common origin. Tribal leaders often made decisions for the group.
Hunting, Gathering, and Fishing Native Americans developed a variety of ways to meet their basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter. In some culture regions, tribes hunted animals and gathered nuts, fruits, and vegetables that grew in the wild. Other tribes depended on the sea for food. They made boats out of animal skins or carved canoes out of trees. From their boats and canoes, they speared or netted fish or hunted marine animals such as seals, walrus, and whales.
Farming Other tribes lived mostly by farming, planting corn, beans, and squash. Native American tribes farmed in many parts of North America, from the American Southwest to the Eastern Woodlands. Over time, farmers improved their crops. For example, more
than 5,000 years ago, wild corn was tiny, about the size of a human finger. Indian farmers developed dozens of varieties of corn including ones with larger ears.
Trade Indian tribes traded with one another for goods not found within their own region. Trade networks linked people across large distances. Goods sometimes traveled more than 1,000 miles from where they were made.
In the Northwest, traders met near the Dalles on the Columbia River. Local Indians caught and dried salmon, which they exchanged for goods and produce from other places. More than goods traveled from Indian group to group. New ideas and skills also spread.
This process of spreading ideas from one culture to another is known as diffusion. Through diffusion, skills such as farming spread from one Native American group to another.
Adapting to and Modifying Environments
Native American cultures adapted to the physical characteristics of environments in different regions. These characteristics influenced the kinds of food people raised, collected, or caught. Climate determined people’s needs for clothing and shelter. Resources provided the materials they were able to use.

Climate and resources also affected tribal organization. Where climates were harsh and resources limited, people struggled to find enough food and shelter. In such regions, people were often nomadic. They lived in small hunting bands. Each band included a number of families. In regions with more favorable climates and plentiful resources, people tended to live in larger groups and stay in one place for longer periods.
Cultures of the Arctic and Subarctic Regions
Frozen seas and icy, treeless plains made up the world of the Inuits, who lived in the Arctic region. The Inuits used all the limited resources of their environment. In the short summer season, they collected driftwood along the ocean shore, using it for tools and shelters. For most of the year, the Inuits lived in pit houses, houses dug into the ground and covered with wood and skins. Lamps filled with seal oil kept their homes warm even in the bitter cold. Women made warm clothing out of furs and waterproof boots out of sealskins.
The Subarctic culture region consisted of a belt of forest stretching across North America south of the Arctic. This forest is made up mainly of conifers, or cone-bearing trees such as hemlock and spruce. People in the Subarctic lived where they could find food. Groups like the Chipewyan (chip uh WY un) were nomads, following large game like caribou. Physical characteristics of the environment influenced their settlement patterns. The Carrier, for example, settled
near salmon streams, although they sometimes moved to other hunting sites.
Cultures of the California, Great Basin, and Plateau Regions The California region offered more forgiving climates, with mainly hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The physical features included mountains, coastal lowland, and interior valleys and deserts.
Over 200 different tribes called this region home. Along the Colorado River, land was irrigated to grow corn, pumpkin, and beans. In the northwest, the Yoruk (YAWR uk) used redwood trees to build houses and canoes and caught the plentiful fish of that region. In central California, salmon and acorns were plentiful. People there hunted and gathered plant products instead of farming. With enough food nearby, people could spend time producing crafts. The Porno wove watertight baskets out of grasses and reeds.
The Great Basin culture region consisted of mountains and valleys with a dry climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Many of the bands that lived here, like the Bannock, were small and nomadic. They traveled to find seeds, nuts, roots, and bulbs. The Northern Paiute (PY yoot) lived near lakes and marshes. Hunting, fishing, and farming often provided enough food for them to stay in one place.
The Plateau region, centered on the Columbia Plateau, has a cool and dry environment, but
1.1 The Early Americas

winter snows fed rivers flowing through the region. Surprisingly, numbers of hardy plants and animals thrive in the region. Among the people of the Plateau region were the Utes (yootz) and Shoshones (shah SHOH neez). The Native Americans of the region had few possessions beyond digging sticks, baskets, and tools and weapons needed for hunting.
Cultures of the Northwest Coastal Region
Elsewhere in North America the climate was kinder, which helped more complex cultures emerge. The people of the mountainous Northwest Coast enjoyed milder temperatures and abundant rainfall and food supplies. They gathered rich harvests of fish from the sea.
From nearby forests, they cut down tall cedar trees and split the trunks into planks for houses and canoes. With plenty of food, the people of the Pacific Northwest stayed in one place. They built permanent villages and prospered from trade with nearby groups.
Within a village, a family gained status according to how much it owned and could give away. Families sometimes competed with one another. To improve its standing, a family might hold a potlatch, or ceremonial dinner, to show off its wealth. The potlatch could last for many days. The family invited many guests and gave

everyone gifts. The more goods a family gave away, the i more respect it earned. However, people who received ; gifts at a potlatch were then expected to hold their own potlatches and give gifts.
Cultures of the Southwest Region The Southwest is a hot and dry region consisting of deserts, the southern Rocky Mountains, and the Colorado Plateau. People could survive only if they found water.
The Pueblo people used irrigation methods such as building dams and tanks to store water. They were able to grow corn and cotton on small farms. However, > it wasn’t all work in the desert. The Hohokams played games on ballcourts and made beautiful art with acid-etchings on shells.
Cultures of the Southeast Region Many tribes inhabited the southeastern region of North America, I which consisted of coastal plains, the southern j Appalachian Mountains, and interior rolling hills and valleys. The region had hot summers, mild winters, and plenty of rainfall. Among the people of this region were the Natchez (NACH ihz). They benefited from the region’s warm, moist climate. They hunted, fished, and farmed in the fertile Mississippi Valley.
The Natchez calendar divided the year into 13 months. Each month was named after a food or an animal that the Natchez harvested or hunted. Their months included Strawberry, Little Corn, Mulberry, Deer, Turkey, and Bear.
The ruler of the Natchez was known as the Great Sun and was worshipped as a god. The Great Sun’s feet never touched the ground. Either he was carried on a litter or he walked on mats. Below the Great Sun were members of his family, called Little Suns. Next came Nobles, then Honored People, and finally Stinkards, or commoners, who made up the majority of the people.
Marriage laws ensured that membership in each class kept changing. By law, Nobles had to marry Stinkards. Even the Great Sun chose a Stinkard as a wife. In this way, no one family could hold the position of Great Sun forever. In time, even descendants of a Great Sun became Stinkards.
Cultures of the Great Plains Region The Great Plains were dry, open grasslands in the center of North America with very few trees, hot summers, and cold winters. Tribes like the Sioux (SOO) hunted wild animals to survive. The Sioux were nomads who followed the buffalo. They ate buffalo meat and used the hide to build tents. These tents were easy to carry when they were on the move. No part of the buffalo was wasted. They made spoons and cups out of the horns and weapons from the bones.
Cultures of the Eastern Woodlands Region Like the peoples of the Southwest and Southeast, the peoples of the Eastern Woodlands were not nomads. Their culture region spanned what is today much of the Midwest and Northeast. This region includes coastal plains, the northern Appalachian Mountains, the Great Lakes region, and interior rolling hills and plains. The region receives plenty of rainfall, with warm summers and snowy winters.
The Iroquois (IHR uh kwoi) lived near lakes and streams. They cleared land for farming, which was mostly done by women. Their diet was based on the “Three Sisters : corn, squash, and beans. Algonquian (al GAHN kwee un) tribes lived near the ocean and along the Great Lakes. Many of them farmed as well. In some places it was too poor to farm. Instead, they built boats for fishing. Like the Iroquois, they also used trees from the forests to make houses and tools.

Religion
The many Native American groups had a wide variety of beliefs. Yet, they shared some basic ideas.
Close Ties to Nature Whether hunting, fishing, farming, or gathering wild plants, many Native Americans felt a close connection to the physical environment. Their prayers and ceremonies were designed to maintain a balance between people and the forces of nature. They believed that they must adapt their ways to the natural world in order to survive and prosper.
Many Native Americans believed that the world was full of powerful, unseen forces and spirits. They honored those spirits, which were thought to act and feel like humans.
In the Pacific Northwest, many tribes relied on fishing. One such group was the Kwakiutls (kwah kee 00T ulz). Each year when they caught their first fish of the season, they chanted this prayer:
We have come to meet alive,
Swimmer, do not feel wrong about what I have done to you, friend Swimmer, for that is the reason why you came, that I may spear you, that I may eat you, Supernatural One, you,
» Native Americans, such as the Kwakiutls, used nets to fish for salmon, an important food source.
» Clay soil is abundant in the Southeast, and Southeastern native peoples used it to produce earthen pottery like the example shown here.

—Kwakiutl Prayer of Thanks
Special Ceremonies In farming regions, tribes held special ceremonies to ensure good rainfall. At midsummer, Pueblo villages in the Southwest rang with cries of: “The kachinas are coming!” Kachinas were spirits, who were represented by masked Native American dancers. The Pueblos believed that the kachinas had the power to bring good harvests.
At Pueblo festivals, the kachinas danced. Religious leaders prayed to the spirits and gave them gifts. Only if the spirits were treated well would they return each year with rain for the Pueblos' crops. In the Southwest and the Southeast, many tribes held a Green Corn Ceremony when the corn ripened in the fall.
The ceremony lasted for several days. It marked the end of the old year and the beginning of a new one. On the last day, a sacred fire was lighted. Dancers circled the flames, and the people enjoyed a great feast. Women then used coals from the sacred fire to make new fires in their own houses.

The Iroquois League
The Iroquois (iHR uh kwoi) people of present-day New York State called themselves "The People of the Long House.” They took great pride in their sturdy dwellings, called long houses. A typical long house was about 150 feet long and 20 feet wide. Twelve or more families lived in a long house.
Women had a special place in Iroquois society. They owned all the household property and were in charge of planting and harvesting. When a man married, he moved in with his wife’s family.
Women also had political power. They chose clan leaders. A clan was a group of related families. If a clan leader did not do his job well, the women could remove him from his position.
The Iroquois included five nations that spoke similar languages: the Mohawk, Seneca, Onondaga (ahn un DAW guh), Oneida (oh NY duh), and Cayuga (kay YOO guh). Each nation had its own ruling council. Until the 1500s, the five nations were frequently at war with one another.
Then, in the 1500s, the five Iroquois nations formed an alliance to end the fighting. According to legend, a religious leader named Dekanawida (deh kan ah WEE

dah) inspired Hiawatha (hy ah wah thah) to organize the alliance. It became known as the Iroquois League.
A council of 50 specially chosen tribal leaders, called sachems, met once a year. The council made decisions for the League. Here, too, women had a political role because they chose the sachems and watched over their actions.
The Iroquois alliance did not end the fighting. The Iroquois spoke a different language from the Algonquian tribes, their neighbors to the east and west. The two groups fought many wars over land and trade.

Europe in the Middle Ages
Feudalism A new kind of government evolved during the Middle Ages. Kings and queens divided their lands among warrior nobles. In return, nobles promised to fight for the ruler when asked. This system of rule by lords who ruled their lands but owed loyalty and military service to a monarch is called feudalism (fyood ul iz um).
At the top of feudal society stood the king and the most powerful lords. Next came the lesser nobles. Most people in feudal society were peasants who farmed the lord’s lands and could not leave the land without the lord’s permission.
Daily Life in Feudal Society Feudal life revolved around the manor, which included the lord’s castle and the lands around it. Manor lands might include several villages. Each manor was self-sufficient. That is, people made almost everything they needed. Life for peasants was hard. Peasants were farmers who worked mostly by hand on small plots. They struggled to produce enough food just to survive.
By about A.D 900, life began to change. Peasants used new methods of farming to produce more food. Warfare declined and trade

began to grow. Slowly, people began to look beyond their isolated villages.
Religion The most powerful force in medieval western Europe was the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church was the main branch of Christianity in western Europe. Like other branches of Christianity, it was based on the teachings of Jesus, who lived centuries earlier. During ancient and early medieval times, the religion spread across Europe.
The Church ruled more than religious life. The Church owned large amounts of land and offered the only source of education. The clergy were often the only people who could read and write. Because of their efforts, much of the learning from the ancient world was preserved.
While Christianity was the main religion in western Europe, the region also had a strong Jewish community. Their religion was Judaism, a religion centuries older than Christianity. It, too, had spread across Europe in ancient and early medieval times. While Jewish people played an important role in medieval Europe, they often faced discrimination and persecution, or attacks because of their beliefs.
The Crusades The pace of change in Europe increased between 1100 and 1300 in part because of the Crusades. The Crusades were a series of wars
fought by Christians to control the region then known as the Holy Land or Palestine, much of which is now Israel. This region included Jerusalem and the other places where Jesus had lived and taught. Muslims had controlled this region for centuries.
During the Crusades, tens of thousands of Christians journeyed to the Middle East. Fighting between Christians and Muslims continued for almost 200 years. Christians won some victories, and they ruled kingdoms in the region for more than 100 years. But in the end, they failed to keep control of the Holy Land.
Growing Trade The Crusades had important effects on Europe, however. Crusaders traveled beyond their villages and came into contact with other civilizations. In the Middle East, they tasted new foods, such as rice, oranges, dates, and new spices. They saw beautiful silks and woven rugs.
Europe had traded with the Middle East for many years before the Crusades. However, returning Crusaders demanded more Asian foods, spices, silks, and rugs. Italian merchants realized that people would pay high prices for such goods. They outfitted ships and increased trade with the Muslim world.
Technological Innovations in Navigation Trade brought new knowledge and with it, new technological

innovations, or new methods and practical ideas. From the Muslim world, Europeans acquired sailing skills and the magnetic compass. Muslims had earlier adopted the magnetic compass from the Chinese. The magnetic needle of the compass always pointed north, which helped ships stay on course.
Another useful instrument was the astrolabe (as troh layb), which helped sailors determine their latitude while at sea. These new instruments let Europeans sail far out to sea, beyond sight of land. By 1500, Portugal had taken the lead in this new overseas travel.
B IDENTIFY MAIN IDEAS
How did the Crusades affect trade in the Middle Ages? The Middle East
Middle Eastern merchants played a large role in this growing trade. Linking Europe, Africa, and Asia, the Middle East was a major crossroads of the world.
Muslim Conquests and Inventions The growth of trade was also linked to the spread of a new religion. In the early 600s, a new religion, Islam, emerged in Arabia. A people called the Arabs lived in Arabia, in the southern Middle East.
Islam won many followers among the Arabs. Beginning in the 600s, Islam spread rapidly. Devout

followers conquered North Africa and much of Spain. They conquered lands to the east, too, from Persia to India and beyond. Eventually, the Muslim world spread from South Asia to what is now Portugal and Spain. In many countries ruled by Muslims, however, there were also communities of Christians and Jewish people.
Islam expanded through trade and conquest by sword. While some remained faithful to Christianity, Judaism, and other religions, many people in conquered lands chose to convert to the new religion. Others were converted by force, or under the threat of crippling taxes. Elsewhere, Muslim merchants carried the new faith to people living along the trade routes of Asia and Africa.
Islam united Muslims from many lands and fostered the growth of trade. Muslims had a basic duty to make a pilgrimage, or journey, to the holy city of Mecca at least once in their lives. Every year, people from across the Muslim world traveled to Mecca. Muslims from North Africa, Persia, Afghanistan, India, Spain, and West Africa crowded Mecca’s dusty streets. They prayed in Arabic, the language of Islam. This regular travel encouraged trade among the Muslim lands.
People in the mainly Muslim Middle East developed many of the technologies we use today. Experiments with how light enters the eye led 10th century Muslim mathematician Ibn al-Haitham to invent the first pin-hole camera. A Muslim engineer invented the

Navigating the Seas Middle Eastern merchants traded across a vast area. They sailed to ports around the Indian Ocean. Their ships used large, triangular sails that allowed captains to sail close to the direction the wind was blowing from.
Middle Eastern sailors had knowledge of wind and weather conditions in the Indian Ocean. As a result, merchants in ports around the region knew when the trading ships had to sail and when they would return. Middle Easterners made important technological innovations in the astrolabe, which, as you have learned, helped sailors find their way far from shore.
Middle Eastern merchants sold porcelains, perfumes, and fabrics from China. Jade and tea were popular, too. The Spice Islands of Indonesia offered nutmeg, clove, and mace. Cloth, indigo, and sugar came from East Africa, as well as spices, salt, and slaves. Goods like textiles and spices traveled well. They quickly spread across the globe.
Silk Road Some Middle Eastern traders traveled the overland routes that crossed the grasslands, mountains, and deserts of Central Asia and linked China and the
Middle East. These routes had become known as the Silk Road because prized Chinese silks had been carried westward along them for more than 1,000 years.
Travel on the Silk Road was dangerous. Desert storms, hunger, and bandits were a constant threat. Traders formed caravans, or groups of people who traveled together for safety. Despite the dangers, trade along the Silk Road prospered.
By the 1400s, trade goods were flowing across a huge area. More than just silk was traded on the Silk Road. Everything from horses to spices and gems traveled along the route.

Trade routes played a large role in Africa, too. Longdistance trade routes crossed the vast Sahara, the desert linking West Africa and North Africa.
A peaceful afternoon in a West African village might be pierced by sounds of a horn. Children would shout, “Batafo! Batafo!” Traders! Soon, a long line of porters and camels arrived. Villagers watched as the tired travelers unloaded sacks of salt or dried fish.

Gold, fabrics, jewelry, and slaves were also part of the caravan.
Sea traders also spread navigation technologies throughout Africa and eventually to Europe. The lateen sail, believed to have been invented first in Egypt, was a triangular sail that allowed ships to travel toward the wind. Although historians cannot be certain, it is likely that North Africans adapted the astrolabe for sea travel, too. It was used by African, Arab, and Indian sailors and then adopted by Europeans.
City-States of East Africa Trade had long flowed up and down the coast of East Africa. Small villages that had good natural harbors grew into busy trading centers.
Gold from Zimbabwe (zim BAH bweh), a powerful inland state, was carried to coastal cities such as Kilwa and Sofala. From there, ships carried the gold, and prized goods such as hardwoods and ivory, across the Indian Ocean to Arabia, India, and China.
Wealth from trade helped local East African rulers build strong city-states. East African city-states gained wealth and power by trading people as well as goods. They traded enslaved people from the interior of East Africa to Arabs and other groups across the Indian Ocean.
Many rulers of these city-states became Muslims. In time, Muslim culture influenced East African traditions. The blend of cultures led to the rise of a new

Trading Kingdoms of West Africa A region of grasslands, called the savanna, covers much of West ' Africa. Several rich trading kingdoms emerged there. Among the best known were Mali and Songhai (sawng hy). The city of Timbuktu was the major trading center > for both kingdoms. These West African empires gained ‘ power through warfare.

Ways of Life in Africa Ways of life varied greatly across the huge continent of Africa. While powerful trading states flourished in some regions, most people lived outside these kingdoms. Many lived in small villages. They made a living by herding, fishing, or farming.
Family relationships were important in African cultures. Although family patterns varied across Africa, many people lived within an extended family.
In an extended family, several generations live in one household. An extended family usually included grandparents, parents, children, and sometimes aunts, uncles, and cousins. The grandparents, or elders, received special respect for their wisdom and knowledge.
Ties of kinship, or sharing a common ancestor, linked families. People related by kinship owed loyalty to one another. Kinship ties encouraged a strong sense of community and cooperation.
Religious beliefs varied widely across Africa. Yet, African beliefs reflected some common threads. Links among family members lasted even after a person died. In their rituals and ceremonies, many Africans honored the spirits of their ancestors as well as the forces of nature. Powerful spirits, they believed, could harm or could help the living.

Chinese Trade and
Technology
Africa had many different cultures and kingdoms. By contrast, in China, power was centered on one emperor. Chinese rulers were often suspicious of outsiders. China was the most isolated civilization of the ancient world. Long distances and physical barriers separated it from Egypt, the Middle East, and India. This isolation contributed to the Chinese belief that China was the center of the Earth and the sole source of civilization. The ancient Chinese looked down on outsiders who did not speak Chinese or follow Chinese ways.

China Uses Technology to Increase Trade
Chinese inventions changed shipbuilding around the globe. The Chinese invented the rudder, which made it easier to steer large ships. They created watertight compartments that went in the ship's hull to reduce the risk of sinking. They also probably invented the magnetic compass, which decreased the likelihood of getting lost on the open seas.
A young emperor who came to power in 1402 was eager to use these new technologies to increase trade. He ordered a huge fleet to be built and named Zheng He (JUNG HUH) to command it. Zheng He’s fleet numbered more than 300 ships. It carried tons of trade goods. The largest ships were more than 400 feet long.
Between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He made seven long voyages. His fleet traded at ports in Southeast Asia, India, Arabia, and East Africa. At every port, Chinese traders carried on a brisk business. They expanded Chinese trade and influence across a wide region.
The Voyages End Zheng He’s great fleet returned home with exotic goods and animals, such as giraffes, that the Chinese had never seen. However, China’s overseas voyages soon ended. A new emperor decided that China had nothing to learn from the outside world. He outlawed most foreign trade. However, traders

like Zheng He had spread Chinese technological innovations around the world.
The Chinese first invented paper in A.D. 105. They also developed a printing press with movable type. The Chinese made advancements in timekeeping, developing several different kinds of clocks. They also invented gunpowder. Europeans later used gunpowder in handguns and cannons, which were based on Chinese designs.

Increased trade and travel made Europeans eager to learn more about the wider world. Scholars looked in monastery libraries for manuscripts of ancient Greek and Roman works. Some traveled to the Middle East, where many ancient works had been preserved.
As scholars studied ancient learning, they began to make their own discoveries. They produced new books on art, medicine, astronomy, and chemistry. This great burst of learning and technological innovation was called the Renaissance (ren uh sahns), a French word

» During the Renaissance, printing presses with movable type, as shown here, allowed printers to mass-produce books, helping to spread new learning.
meaning rebirth. It lasted from the late 1300s until the 1600s.
The Chinese had invented the printing press and movable type, or metal letters that could be used to print paper. However, the Chinese language required thousands of different letters, and movable type had little impact.
During the 1430s, a German printer named Johannes Gutenberg (GOOT un burg) is believed to have invented movable type without knowing that it had existed in China. Movable type was much more k useful for printing in European languages, which ’ used only 26 letters. Together, movable type and the printing press helped to spread Renaissance learning. Before movable type and the printing press, books were scarce and costly because each was copied by hand. With these technological innovations, large numbers of books could be produced quickly and at a low cost. Soon more people began to read, and learning spread ' more quickly.
Europeans Search for New Trade Routes During the Renaissance, trade brought new prosperity. European rulers began to increase their power. In England and France, kings and queens worked to bring powerful feudal lords under their control. In Spam and Portugal, Christian monarchs drove out Muslim rulers, who had governed there for centuries.
Rulers in England, France, Spain, and Portugal were eager to increase their wealth. They saw the great profits that could be made through trade. However, Middle Eastern and Italian merchants controlled the trade routes across the Mediterranean Sea. So, Western Europe’s leaders began hunting for other routes to Asia. European rulers also looked to Africa as a source of riches. Tales of Mansa Musa’s wealth had created a stir in Europe, but no one knew the source of African gold.
Portuguese Voyages Portugal was an early leader in the search for a new trade route to Asia and for the source of African gold. In the early 1400s, Prince Henry, known as Henry the Navigator, encouraged sea captains to sail south along the coast of West Africa. Realizing that Portugal needed better navigators to accomplish the task, he set up an informal school to teach sailors techniques of navigation and the art of shipbuilding.
Under Henry’s guidance, the Portuguese designed a new type of ship, the caravel (kar uh vel). With triangular sails and a steering rudder, caravels could be sailed closer to the direction the wind was blowing from. Portuguese caravels stopped at many places along the coast of West Africa. They traded cloth, silver, textiles, and grain for gold and ivory. They also

Further Exploration Slowly, Portuguese explorers ventured farther south, hoping to find a sea route around Africa to the rich spice trade of Asia. In 1488, Bartolomeu Dias reached the southern tip of Africa.
Nine years later, in 1497, Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. He then sailed up the coast of East Africa and across the Indian Ocean to India. The Portuguese pushed on to the East Indies, the islands of Southeast Asia and the source of valuable spices.

Early Contact With the Americas
Unlike other possible early voyagers to the Americas, the Vikings left behind a detailed record of their voyages. In 1001,Viking sailors led by Leif Ericson reached the eastern tip of North America. Archaeologists have found evidence of the Viking settlement of Vinland in present-day Newfoundland, Canada. The Vikings did not stay in Vinland long and no one is sure why they left. However, Viking stories describe fierce battles with Skraelings, the Viking name for the Inuits.
Evidence suggests that Asians continued to cross the Bering Sea into North America after the last ice age ended. Some scholars believe that ancient seafarers from Polynesia may have traveled to the Americas using their knowledge of the stars and winds. Modern Polynesians have sailed canoes thousands of miles in this way. Still others think that fishing boats from China and Japan blew off course and landed on the western coast of North or South America.

Perhaps such voyages occurred. If so, they were long forgotten. Before 1492, the peoples of Asia and Europe had no knowledge of the Americas and their remarkable civilizations.
Ki RECALL Why aren’t we certain whether early
people from Europe or Asia other than the Vikings sailed to America?
The Voyages of Columbus
Portuguese sailors had pioneered new routes around Africa toward Asia in the late 1400s. Spain, too, wanted a share of the riches. King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella hoped to keep their rival, Portugal, from controlling trade with India, China, and Japan. They therefore agreed to finance a voyage of exploration by Christopher Columbus. Columbus, an Italian sea captain, planned to reach the East Indies by sailing west across the Atlantic. Finding a sea route straight to Asia would give the Spanish direct access to the silks, spices, and precious metals of Asia. The spice trade was a major cause for European exploration and a reason the Spanish rulers supported Columbus’s voyage. However, it was not the only reason. They hoped for wealth from any source. “Get gold,” King Ferdinand said to Columbus. “Humanely if possible, but at all hazards—get gold.”
Sailing Across the Atlantic In August 1492, Columbus set out with three ships and a crew of about 90 sailors. As captain, he commanded the largest vessel, the Santa Maria. The other ships were the Nina and the Pinta.
After a brief stop at the Canary Islands, the little fleet continued west into unknown seas. Fair winds sped them along, but a month passed without the sight of land. Some sailors began to grumble. They had never been away from land for so long and feared being lost at sea. Still, Columbus sailed on.
On October 7, sailors saw flocks of birds flying southwest. Columbus changed course to follow the birds. A few days later, crew members spotted tree branches and flowers floating in the water. At 2 A.M. on October 12, the lookout on the Pinta spotted white cliffs shining in the moonlight. “Tierra! Tierra!” he shouted. "Land! Land!”
At dawn, Columbus rowed ashore and planted the banner of Spain on the beach. He was convinced that he had reached the East Indies in Asia. He called the people he found there “Indians.” In fact, he had reached islands off the coasts of North America and South America in the Caribbean Sea. These islands later became known as the West Indies.
For three months, Columbus explored the West Indies. To his delight, he found signs of gold on the islands. Eager to report his success, he returned to Spain.
Spain Seeks Colonies In Spain, Columbus presented Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand with gifts of pink pearls and brilliantly colored parrots. The royal couple listened intently as Columbus brought with him several of many things that Europeans had never seen before: tobacco, pineapples, and hammocks used for sleeping. Columbus also described the “Indians” he had met, the Tainos (ty nohz). The Tainos, he promised, could easily be converted to Christianity and could also be used as slaves.
The Spanish monarchs were impressed. They gave Columbus the title Admiral of the Ocean Sea. They also agreed to finance future voyages. The promise of great wealth, and the chance to spread Christianity, gave them a reason to explore further.
Columbus made three more voyages across the Atlantic. In 1493, he founded the first Spanish colony in the Americas, Santo Domingo, on an island he called Hispaniola (present-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic). A colony is an area settled and ruled by the government of a distant land. Columbus also explored
» This illustration shows Columbus meeting the Taino people of the West Indies. His voyages benefited Spain but brought much misery to the world of the Taino.
The Early Americas and European Exploration 27	13 European Exploration in the Americas
present-day Cuba and Jamaica and sailed along the coasts of Central America and northern South America. He claimed all of these lands for Spain.
Columbus proved to be a better explorer than governor. During his third expedition, settlers on Hispaniola complained of his harsh rule. Queen Isabella appointed an investigator, who sent Columbus back to Spain in chains. In the end, the queen pardoned Columbus, but he never regained the honors he had won earlier. He died in 1506, still convinced that he had reached Asia.
The Impact of Columbus’s Voyages Columbus has long been honored as the bold sea captain who “discovered America.” Today, we recognize that Native Americans had discovered and settled these lands long before 1492. Still, in at least one sense, Columbus deserves the honors history has given him. Europeans knew nothing of the Americas until Columbus told them about this “new world.” His daring voyages marked the beginning of lasting contact among the peoples of Europe, Africa, and the Americas.
For a great many Native Americans, contact had tragic results. Columbus and those who followed were convinced that European culture was superior to that of the Indians. The Spanish claimed Taino lands and forced Tainos to work in gold mines, on ranches, or in Spanish households. Many Tainos died from harsh conditions or European diseases. Within 100 years of Columbus’s arrival, the Taino population was virtually wiped out.

H IDENTIFY MAIN IDEAS
What reasons did Spain have for sending Columbus on his voyages?
Other Spanish Exploration ,
After the voyages of Columbus, the Spanish explored and settled other Caribbean islands. They wanted to take advantage of the land Columbus had found, seeking gold, crops, slaves, and converts to Christianity for the Spanish crown. By 1511, they had conquered Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and Cuba. They also explored the eastern coasts of North America and South America in i search of a western route to Asia.
In 1513, Vasco Nunez de Balboa (bal BOH uh) plunged into the jungles of the Isthmus of Panama. Native Americans had told him that a large body of water lay to the west. With a party of Spanish soldiers and Indians, Balboa reached the Pacific Ocean after about 25 days. He stood in the crashing surf and claimed the ocean for Spain.
The Spanish had no idea how wide the Pacific was until a sea captain named Ferdinand Magellan (muh JEL un) sailed across it. The expedition—made up of five ships and about 250 crew members—left Spain in 1519. Fifteen months later, it rounded Cape Horn, the stormy southern tip of South America and entered the
Pacific Ocean. Crossing the vast Pacific, the sailors ran out of food.
We remained 3 months and 20 days without taking in provisions or other refreshments and ate only old biscuit reduced to powder, full of grubs and stinking from the dirt which rats had made on it. We drank water that was yellow and stinking.
—Antonio Pigafetta, The Diary of Antonio Pigafetta
Magellan himself was killed in a battle with the local people of the Philippine Islands off the coast of Asia.
In 1522, only one ship and 18 sailors returned to Spain. They were the first people to circumnavigate, or sail completely around, the world. In doing so, they had found an all-water western route to Asia. Their voyage made Europeans aware of the true size of the Earth.

The Columbian Exchange
The encounter between the peoples of the Eastern and Western hemispheres sparked a global exchange of goods and ideas. Because it started with the voyages of Columbus, this transfer is known as the Columbian Exchange. The Columbian Exchange refers to a biological and cultural exchange of animals, plants, human populations, diseases, food, government, technology, the arts, and languages.
The exchange went in both directions. Europeans learned much from Native Americans.
At the same time, Europeans contributed in many ways to the culture of the Americas. This exchange also brought about many modifications, or changes, to the physical environment of the Americas, with both positive and negative results.
Modifying Environments Europeans introduced domestic animals such as chickens from Europe and Africa. European pigs, cattle, and horses often escaped into the wild and multiplied rapidly. Forests and grasslands were converted to pastures. As horses spread through what would become the United States, Indians learned to ride them and used them to carry heavy loads.

1.3 European Exploration in the Americas
Plants from Europe and Africa changed the way Native Americans lived. The first bananas came from the Canary Islands. By 1520, one Spaniard reported that banana trees had spread “so greatly that it is marvelous to see the great abundance of them.” Oranges, lemons, and figs were also new to the Americas. In North America, explorers also brought such plants as bluegrass, the daisy, and the dandelion. These plants spread quickly in American soil and modified American grasslands.
Tragically, Europeans also brought new diseases, such as smallpox and influenza. Native Americans had no resistance to these diseases. Historians estimate that within 75 years, diseases from Europe had killed almost 90 percent of the people in the Caribbean islands and in Mexico.
Native American influences on Europe, Africa, and Asia For their part, Native Americans introduced Europeans, Africans, and Asians to new foods, customs, and ideas. After 1492, elements of Native American ways of life gradually spread around the world. Sadly, disease also spread from the Americas to Europe and other parts of the world.
Native Americans introduced Europeans to valuable food crops such as corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans, tomatoes, manioc, squash, peanuts, pineapples, and blueberries. Today, almost half the world’s food
crops come from plants that were first grown in the Americas.
Europeans carried the new foods with them as they sailed around the world. Everywhere, people’s diets changed and populations increased. In South Asia, people used American hot peppers and chilis to spice stews. Chinese peasants began growing corn and sweet potatoes. Italians made sauces from tomatoes. People in West Africa grew manioc and corn.
European settlers often adopted Native American skills. In the North, Indians showed Europeans how to use snowshoes and trap beavers and other fur-bearing animals. European explorers learned how to paddle Indian canoes. Some leaders studied Native American political structures. In the 1700s, Benjamin Franklin admired the Iroquois League and urged American colonists to unite in a similar way.
Positive and Negative Consequences Through the Columbian Exchange, Europeans and Native Americans modified their environments and gamed new resources and skills. At the same time, warfare and disease killed many on both sides. Europeans viewed expansion positively. They gained great wealth, explored trade routes, and spread Christianity. Yet their farming, mining, and diseases took a toll on the physical environment and left many Native Americans dead. Despite these negatives, the Columbian
Exchange shaped the modern world, including what would become the United States.

“What a troublesome thing it is to discover new lands. The risks we took, it is hardly possible to exaggerate.” Thus spoke Bernal Diaz del Castillo, one of the many Spanish conquistadors (kahn KEES tuh dorz), or conquerors, who marched into the Americas in the 1500s. When asked why they traveled to the Americas, Diaz responded, “We came here to serve God and the king and also to get rich.”

Conquistadors Arrive in the Americas
In their search for glory and gold, the conquistadors made Spam one of the richest nations in Europe. Spanish colonists followed the conquistadors and created a vast new empire in the Americas.
The rulers of Spain gave conquistadors permission to establish settlements in the Americas. In return, conquistadors agreed to give Spain one fifth of any gold or treasure they captured.
Like other conquistadors, Hernando Cortes was eager to win riches and glory. He had heard rumors of a fabulously wealthy Native American empire in Mexico. With only about 600 soldiers and 16 horses, Cortes set sail for Mexico in 1519 in search of gold.
The Spanish Destroy an Empire Moctezuma (mokt uh zoo muh), the Aztec emperor who ruled over much of Mexico, heard disturbing reports of a large house floating on the sea. It was filled with white men with long, thick beards. Aztec sacred writings predicted that a powerful white-skinned god would come from the east to rule the Aztecs. The strangers were approaching Tenochtitlan (tay nawch teet

LAHN), the Aztec capital, which is now Mexico City. Moctezuma decided to welcome them as his guests.
Cortes took advantage of Moctezuma’s invitation. Shrewdly, Cortes had already begun to win the support of other Indians who resented Aztec rule.
One of his trusted advisers was an Indian woman the Spanish called Dona Marina. She gave Cortes valuable information about the Aztecs and acted as a translator and negotiator. On November 8,1519, Cortes marched into Tenochtitlan. The city was much larger than any Spanish city at that time. Thousands upon thousands of Aztecs turned out to see the astonishing newcomers riding horses. Diaz recalled:
Who could count the multitude of
men, women and children which had
come out on the roofs, in their boats on
the canals, or in the streets, to see us?
—Bernal Diaz del Castillo, True History of the Conquest of New Spain
At first, Cortes was friendly to Moctezuma. Soon, however, he made the emperor a prisoner in his own city. Tensions mounted in Tenochtitlan over the next half year.
Finally, the Aztecs drove out the Spanish. Their victory, however, was brief. Aided by people whom the Aztecs had conquered, Cortes recaptured the city. In the end, the Spanish destroyed Tenochtitlan, and Moctezuma was killed. The Aztec empire had fallen.
The Inca Empire Falls Another conquistador, Francisco Pizarro (pee SAHR oh), set his sights on the Incan empire. Pizarro sailed down the Pacific coast of South America with fewer than 200 Spanish soldiers. In 1532, he captured the Incan emperor Atahualpa (ah tuh WAHL puh) and later executed him. Without the leadership of Atahualpa, Incan resistance collapsed. By 1535, Pizarro controlled much of the Incan empire.
Why the Spanish Won How were the Spanish able to conquer two great empires with only a handful of soldiers? First, the Spanish had superior military equipment. They were protected by steel armor and had guns. The Aztecs and Incas relied on clubs, bows and arrows, and spears. Also, the Native Americans had never seen horses. They were frightened by mounted Spanish soldiers.
In addition, the Native Americans did not fight as hard as they might have. The Aztecs hesitated to attack at first because they thought the Spanish might be gods.

Finally, many Indians died from European diseases, such as smallpox, measles, and influenza. Some historians believe that disease alone would have ensured Spanish victory over the Indians.
From the Spanish perspective, their interaction with the Aztecs and the Incas resulted in great victories that brought wealth and power. The Spanish also saw the conquests as further proof of their natural superiority. The Aztecs and Incas, of course, had a much different view of the same events. From their perspectives, the Spanish conquests were disasters that devastated their civilizations.

The Spanish search for treasure reached beyond the lands of the Aztecs and Incas. Moving north, conquistadors explored the Spanish borderlands. The
borderlands spanned the present-day southern United States from Florida to California.

Narvaez and many others were lost at sea. The rest landed on an island in present-day Texas. Indians captured the few survivors and held them prisoner. Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca (kah VAY suh day VAH kuh) assumed leadership of the small group.

The Colonization of New Spain
The conquistadors set up colonies in many parts of the Americas. Spain had many causes for colonization, or setting up colonies. One was the search for wealth: settlements provided bases from which expeditions could set out in search of gold. Settlements could
also created wealth through farming and trade. A second important cause of settlement was to spread Christianity by converting native peoples. A third cause was to satisfy a thirst for adventure and exploration. Sometimes, historians summarize the Spanish exploration and settlement of the Americas as motivated by “Gold, God, and Glory.” Thousands of Spanish immigrants moved to Spanish settlements looking for opportunities the colonies offered, especially farming.
At first, Spain let the conquistadors govern the lands they conquered. When the conquistadors proved to be poor rulers, the Spanish king took away their authority He then set up a strong system of government to rule his growing empire. In 1535, he divided his American lands into New Spain and Peru. The northern borderlands were part of New Spain. The king put a viceroy in charge of each region to rule in his name.
A set of laws called the Laws of the Indies stated how the colonies should be organized and ruled. The laws provided for three kinds of settlements in New Spain: pueblos, presidios (prih SID ee ohz), and missions. Some large communities included all three.

» Mission San Francisco de la Espada in San Antonio, Texas, was one of Spain’s many religious settlements in the Americas dedicated to the conversion of the Indians to Christianity.
pueblos, or towns, were centers of farming and trade. In the middle of the town was a plaza, or public square.
Here, townspeople and farmers came to do business or worship at the church. Shops and homes lined the four sides of the plaza.
The Spanish took control of Indian pueblos and built new towns as well. In 1598, Juan de Onate (oh NYAH tay) founded the colony of New Mexico among the adobe villages of the Pueblo Indians. He used brutal force to conquer the Native Americans of the region. Don Pedro de Peralta later founded Santa Fe as the Spanish capital of New Mexico.
Presidios were forts where soldiers lived. Inside the high, thick walls were shops, stables, and storehouses for food. Soldiers protected the farmers who settled nearby. The first presidio in the borderlands was built in 1565 at St. Augustine, Florida. St. Augustine was the first permanent European settlement in what would become the United States. Its founding marked the beginning of the era of colonization in the future territory of the United States, which would continue until the United States declared independence in 1776.
The Legacy of Missions Like other Europeans in the Americas, the Spanish believed they had a duty to convert Indians to Christianity. They set up missions, settlements run by Catholic priests and friars whose goal was to convert Indians to Christianity. They often forced Indians to live and work on the missions. In New Mexico, the Spanish tried to destroy any trace of traditional Pueblo Indians’ religious practices and subjected them to severe punishments. This resulted in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. The Pueblo Indians rose up against Spanish rule. They killed about 400 Spaniards and drove the others out of the region. The Spanish recaptured the region in the mid-1690s.
Missions gradually spread across the Spanish borderlands. The first mission in Texas was founded in 1659 at El Paso.
In 1691, Father Eusebio Francisco Kino (kee noh) crossed into present-day Arizona. He eventually set up 24 missions in the area. The missions were a direct result of early Spanish colonization efforts. Over time, they had a significant impact in the Americas. By the late 1700s, a string of missions dotted the California coast from San Diego to San Francisco, and Spanish language and culture gradually spread with them.
Ed RECALL What reasons did Spanish colonists have
for coming to New Spain?
The Social Order in New Spain
The Laws of the Indies also set up a strict social system. People in Spanish colonies were divided into four social classes: peninsulares (puh NIN suh LAH rayz), creoles (KREE ohlz), mestizos (mes TEE sohz), and Indians.
Different Social Classes At the top of the social scale were the peninsulares. Born in Spain, peninsulares held the highest jobs in government and the Church. They also owned large tracts of land as well as rich gold and silver mines.
Below the peninsulares were the creoles, people born in the Americas to parents of Spanish origin. Many creoles were wealthy and well educated. They owned farms and ranches, taught at universities, and practiced law. However, they could not hold the jobs that were reserved for peninsulares.
Below the creoles were people of mixed Spanish and Indian background, known as mestizos. Mestizos worked on farms and ranches owned by peninsulares and creoles. In the cities, they worked as carpenters, shoemakers, tailors, and bakers. Over the course of Spanish colonization, mestizos came to be the largest class of people.
The lowest class in the colonies was the Indians. In the early years of Spanish colonization, Indians were the largest class. The Spanish treated them as a conquered people. Under New Spain’s strict social system, Indians were kept in poverty for hundreds of years.
A
Blend of Spanish and Indian Cultures The effects of colonization can be seen in the new way of life in New Spain that blended Spanish and Indian ways. Spanish settlers brought their own culture to the colonies. They introduced their language, laws, religion, and learning. In 1551, the Spanish founded the University of Mexico. Native Americans also influenced the culture of New Spain. Colonists adopted Indian foods, such as corn, tomatoes, potatoes, and squash. Indian workers used materials they knew well, such as adobe bricks, to build fine libraries, theaters, and churches. Sometimes, Indian artists decorated church walls with paintings of local traditions.
Harsh Treatment of Native Americans Spanish colonists needed workers for their ranches, farms, and mines. To help them, the Spanish government gave settlers encomiendas (en koh mee EN dahz), land grants that included the right to demand labor or taxes from Native Americans.
Mines in Mexico, Peru, and other parts of the Americas made Spain rich. Treasure ships laden with

thousands of tons of gold and silver sailed regularly across the Atlantic.
The Spanish forced Native Americans to work in the gold and silver mines. In flickering light, Indians hacked out rich ores in narrow, dark tunnels. Many died when tunnels caved in.
These harsh conditions led one priest, Bartolome de Las Casas (day lahs KAH sahs), to seek reform. Traveling through New Spain, Las Casas witnessed firsthand the deaths of Indians due to hunger, disease, and mistreatment. What he saw horrified him:
The Indians were totally deprived of their freedom. , . . Even beasts enjoy more freedom when they are allowed to graze in the field.
—Bartolome de Las Casas, Tears of the Indians
Many Spanish in New Spain did not share Las Casas’ view or his values. So, he journeyed to Europe and asked the king of Spain to protect the Indians’ civil rights. In the 1540s, the royal government passed laws prohibiting the enslavement of Native Americans. The laws also allowed Indians to own cattle and grow crops. However, few officials in New Spain enforced the

new laws or took the time to think about Indians’ basic human needs.
B IDENTIFY SUPPORTING DETAILS
What were some ways in which peninsulares were powerful? The Transatlantic Slave Trade
The death toll among Native Americans continued to rise. Faced with a severe shortage of workers, Spanish colonists looked across the Atlantic Ocean for a new source of labor.
Reasons for the Slave Trade Still seeking to protect Native Americans, Bartolome de Las Casas made a suggestion that had a lasting, tragic impact. His idea was that Africans be brought as slaves to replace forced Indian laborers. Las Casas argued that Africans were less likely to die from European diseases. He also claimed that Africans would suffer less because they were used to doing hard farm work in their homelands.
Las Casas’s arguments encouraged the Atlantic slave trade, or the trade of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic to the Americas. In many parts of Africa, slavery had existed for centuries. Often, war prisoners
were enslaved. Eventually, these enslaved people or their children might gain freedom. After the Americas were colonized, though, some Africans began to capture and enslave people and sell them to European traders. The traders then shipped the enslaved men, women, and children to the Americas. Most Africans who settled in the Americas did so against their will.
By the time he died, Las Casas had come to regret his suggestion. He saw that enslaved Africans suffered as much as the Indians. By that time, however, it was too late to undo the damage. Slavery had become a key part of the colonial economy.
Slave Trade Expansion The European demand for African labor grew rapidly, mainly in Spain’s colonies in the West Indies, including what are now Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico, and in other parts of the Americas. Enslaved Africans were especially valued on sugar plantations in the West Indies and in the Portuguese colony of Brazil. A plantation is a large estate farmed by many workers. Sugar could not be grown on small estates because it reguired too much land and labor. Enslaved Africans often worked all through the night cutting sugar, which was then sold in Europe for a large profit.

Religious Difference Leads to Rivalries As
Europeans settled in the Americas, they brought their religious conflicts with them. Queen Elizabeth encouraged English adventurers to raid Spanish colonies and capture Spanish treasure fleets. Protestant England also competed with Catholic France for lands in North America.
Not all rivalries were religious. Both the Netherlands and England were Protestant. Still, they competed for control of land in North America and for economic markets all over the world, including Asia.
Reasons for the Exploration of North America
Like Columbus, Europeans continued during the 1500s to look for new ways to reach the riches of Asia. Magellan’s route around South America seemed long and difficult. Europeans wanted to discover a shorter northwest passage, or waterway through or around North America.
Giovanni Caboto, an Italian sea captain who the English called John Cabot, set out to find a northwest passage for the English. He was confident he had found such a passage, but he was mistaken. The "newfound land” that he thought he had found off the Asian coast in fact lay off the coast of North America. Today, Newfoundland is part of the easternmost province of Canada.
French Exploration The French sent another Italian captain, Giovanni da Verrazano (vehr rah TSAH noh), in search of a northwest passage. Verrazano journeyed along the North American coast from the present-day Carolinas to Canada. During the 1530s, Jacques Cartier (kar tee yay), also sailing for the French, traveled more than halfway up the St. Lawrence River.
Explorations of Henry Hudson In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson sailed for the Dutch. His ship, the Half Moon, entered present-day New York harbor. Hudson continued to sail some 150 miles up the river that now bears his name.
The following year, Hudson made a voyage into the far north—this time for the English. After spending a harsh winter in what is now called Hudson Bay, his crew rebelled. They set Hudson, his son, and seven loyal sailors adrift in a small boat. The boat and its crew were never seen again.
Mapping New Regions None of these explorers found a northwest passage to Asia. However, they did map and explore many parts of North America. The rulers

European Rivalries
Religious Reform In 1517, a German monk named Martin Luther publicly challenged many practices of the Catholic Church. Soon after, he split with the Church entirely. Luther believed that the Church had become too worldly. He opposed the power of popes. He also objected to the Catholic teaching that believers could gain eternal lrfe by performing good works. Luther argued that people could be saved only by faith in God.
Because of their protests against the Church, Luther’s supporters became known as Protestants. The Protestant Reformation, as the new movement was known, divided Europe. Soon, the Protestants themselves split, forming many different churches.
By the late 1500s, religion divided the states of Western Europe. Roman Catholic monarchs ruled Spain and France. A Protestant queen, Elizabeth I, ruled England. In the Netherlands, the Dutch people were mostly Protestant.

Q CHECK UNDERSTANDING
What factors contributed to rivalries between English and Spanish explorers?
New France Is Colonized
Samuel de Champlain (sham PLAYN) founded Port Royal, the first permanent French settlement in North America, in 1605. Three years later, he led another group of settlers along the route Cartier had pioneered. On a rocky cliff high above the St. Lawrence River, Champlain built a trading post known as Quebec (kwih BEK). The opportunity to create wealth through trade was one of the main reasons for French colonization in America. The French also wanted to surpass their rivals, the English. Many French settlers were looking for adventure and hoped to find their fortune in the New World.
Economic Activity in New France Unlike Spain’s American empire, New France had little gold or silver.
» Native Americans board a European trading ship to display their selection of furs. They will exchange the furs for the goods displayed at the feet of the seated European trader.
Instead, the French profited from fishing, trapping, and trading.
French colonists who lived and worked in Native f American lands beyond the French settlements [ became known as coureurs de bois (koo RUHR duh bwah), or “runners of the woods.” The French brought knives, kettles, cloth, and other items for trade with Native Americans. In return, the Indians gave them , beaver skins and other furs that sold for high prices in j Europe.	;
Coureurs de bois established friendly relations | with Native American groups. Unlike the Spanish, the ■ French did not attempt to conquer the Indians. Also, because coureurs de bois did not establish farms, they i did not interfere with Indian lands. Indians taught the i French trapping and survival skills, such as how to ; make snowshoes and canoes. Many coureurs married Indian women.	(
Missionary Work Continues Catholic missionaries often traveled with fur traders. A missionary is a person who goes to another land to win converts for a religion. French missionaries tried to convert Native Americans to Christianity. They also drew maps and wrote about the lands they explored.
Life was difficult, especially in winter. One French priest recalled traveling on foot through deep snow:
If a thaw came, dear Lord, what pain! ... I was marching on an icy path that broke with every step I took; as the snow softened . . . we often sunk [sank] in it up to our . . . waist.
—Paul Le Jeune, quoted in < - ;:/• < //: ,'d	:
(Parkman)
Colonization Along the Mississippi River French trappers followed the St. Lawrence deep into the heart of North America. Led by Indian guides, they reached the Great Lakes. Here, Indians spoke of a mighty river, which they called Mississippi, or “Father of the Waters.”
A
French missionary, Father Jacques Marquette (mar ket), and a fur trader, Louis Joliet (joh lee et), set out to reach the Mississippi in 1673. Led by Indian guides, they followed the river for more than 700 miles before turning back. Nine years later, Robert de La Salle completed the journey to the Gulf of Mexico. La Salle named the region Louisiana in honor of the French king, Louis XIV. To keep Spain and England out of Louisiana, the French built forts in the north along the Great Lakes. Among them was Fort Detroit, built by Antoine Cadillac
near Lake Erie. The French also built New Orleans, a fort near the mouth of the river. New Orleans grew into a busy trading center. French control of the network of waterways at the heart of North America gave the French a strategic advantage over the Spanish and the English.
French colonists imported thousands of Africans to work as slaves on plantations around New Orleans. Some enslaved Africans, however, joined with the Natchez Indians in a revolt against the French. The French put down the Natchez Revolt in 1729. Some enslaved Africans who fought on the side of the French received their freedom. In Louisiana, free and enslaved Africans together made up the majority of settlers.
Government in New France New France was governed much like New Spain. The French king controlled the government directly, and people had little freedom. A council appointed by the king made all decisions.
Louis XIV worried that too few French were moving to New France. In the 1660s, therefore, he sent about a thousand people to the colony, including many young women. Despite the king’s efforts to increase the population, New France grew slowly. Winters were harsh, and the short growing season made farming difficult. Only about 10,000 settlers lived in the colony by 1680. Of those, one third lived on farms along the St. Lawrence. Others chose to become coureurs de bois, living largely free of government control.

The Dutch Establish New Netherland
Like the French, the Dutch hoped to profit from their discoveries in the Americas by colonizing. In 1626, Peter Minuit (min yoo wit) led a group of Dutch settlers to the mouth of the Hudson River. Other Dutch colonists had already settled on Manhattan Island and farther up the Hudson River. Minuit bought Manhattan Island from local Indians. Minuit called his settlement New Amsterdam. The entire colony was known as New Netherland (now known as New York).
New Netherland was privately funded by the Dutch West India Company. Many colonists immigrated to New Netherland hoping to profit from the region’s active fur trade.
From a tiny group of 30 houses, New Amsterdam grew into a busy port. The Dutch welcomed people of many nations, ethnic groups, and religions to their

colony. A Roman Catholic priest who visited New Netherland in 1643 reported:
On the island of Manhattan, and in its environs, there may well be four or five hundred men of different sects and nations: the Director General told me that there were men of eighteen different languages; they are scattered here and there on the river, above and below, as the beauty and convenience of the spot has invited each to settle.
—Father Isaac Jogues, quoted in Narratives of New
Netherland, 1609-1664 (Jameson)
The Dutch also built trading posts along the Hudson River. The most important one was Fort Orange, today known as Albany. Dutch merchants became known for their good business sense.
The Dutch enlarged New Netherland in 1655 by taking over the colony of New Sweden. The Swedes had established New Sweden along the Delaware River some 15 years earlier.
Trade Rivalries in the Region Dutch traders sent furs to the Netherlands. The packing list for the first

shipment included “the skins of 7,246 beaver, 853 otter,
81 mink, 36 cat lynx, and 34 small rats.”
The Dutch and French became rivals in the fur trade. Both sought alliances with Native Americans. An alliance is an agreement between nations to aid and protect one another. The Dutch made friends with the Iroquois. The Hurons (HYOO rahnz) helped the French. Fighting raged for years among the Europeans and their Native American allies.
Dutch Culture Comes to North America The
Dutch brought many of their customs from Europe to New Netherland. They liked to ice-skate, and in winter, the frozen rivers and ponds filled with skaters. Every year on Saint Nicholas’s birthday, Dutch children put out their shoes to be filled with all sorts of presents. Known in Dutch as “Sinterklaas,” Saint Nicholas came to be called Santa Claus.
Some Dutch words entered the English language.
A
Dutch master was a boss. The people of New Amsterdam sailed in yachts. Dutch children munched on cookies and rode through the snow on sleighs. Interaction With Native Americans and the Environment Dutch and French settlement on the . east coast of North America brought major changes to Native Americans and the environment. As in New Spain, European diseases killed thousands of Indians, and rivalry over the fur trade increased between different European countries’ Native American allies. The scramble for furs also led to overtrapping. By 1640, trappers had almost wiped out the beavers on Iroquois lands in upstate New York.
The arrival of Europeans affected Native Americans in other ways. Missionaries tried to convert Indians to Christianity. Indians eagerly adopted European trade goods, such as copper kettles and knives. They also bought muskets and gunpowder for hunting and warfare. Alcohol sold by European traders had a harsh effect on Native American life.
Europeans all waged warfare to seize Indian lands. As Indians were forced off their lands, they moved westward onto lands of other Indians, which sometimes led to violence between Native American groups. The conflict between Native Americans and Europeans would continue for many years.
b IDENTIFY What was one reason why the New
Netherland colony was founded?
Roanoke and Jamestown
England watched with envy as other European countries gained riches from their colonies in the Americas. Several ambitious English gentlemen proposed that England settle the Americas as well. With Queen Elizabeth’s permission, Sir Walter Raleigh raised money to outfit a colony in North America. In 1585, about 100 men set sail across the Atlantic. The colonists landed on Roanoke (ROH uh nohk), an island off the coast of present-day North Carolina. Within a year, however, the colonists had run short of food and were quarreling with neighboring Indians. When an English ship stopped in the harbor, the weary settlers sailed home.
The Lost Colony of Roanoke In 1587, Raleigh sent John White, one of the original colonists, back to Roanoke with a new group of settlers that included women and children. When supplies ran low, White returned to England, leaving behind 117 colonists. He planned to return in a few months. When he got back to England, however, he found the country was then preparing for war with Spain. It was three years before he was able to sail back to Roanoke.
When White arrived, he found the settlement strangely quiet. Houses stood empty. Vines twined through the windows and pumpkins sprouted from the earthen floors. On a tree, someone had carved the word CROATOAN, the name of a nearby island. No other trace of the colonists remained. White was eager to investigate, but a storm was blowing up and his crew refused to make the trip. To this day, the fate of the “Lost Colony” remains a mystery.
The Founding of Jamestown After the failure of Roanoke, nearly 20 years passed before England again tried to establish a colony in North America. In 1606, the Virginia Company of London, a private company, received a charter from King James I. A charter is a legal document giving certain rights to a person or company.
The royal charter gave the Virginia Company the right to settle lands along the east coast of North America. The charter also guaranteed that colonists of this land, called Virginia, would have the same rights as English citizens.
In the spring of 1607, a group of 105 colonists, funded by the Virginia Company, arrived in Virginia. They sailed into Chesapeake Bay and began building houses along the James River. They named their tiny outpost Jamestown after their king. Jamestown was the first permanent English settlement in what is now the United States.

Reasons for Colonization The settlers of Jamestown hoped to make a profit by finding gold or other riches. They also hoped to discover a water route to Asia. Furthermore, they wanted to claim the region for England.
The colonists soon discovered that Jamestown was located in a swampy area. The water was unhealthy, and mosquitoes spread malaria. Many settlers suffered or died from disease. Historians have long debated the reason why the settlers chose the location they did. One of the main reasons was security: they located their settlement in a place where Spanish ships would be unlikely to find them. If the Spanish did discover Jamestown, its location would make it more easily defensible against Spanish ships.
Governing the colony also proved difficult. The Virginia Company had chosen a council of 13 men to rule the settlement.
Members of the council quarreled with one another and did little to plan for the colony's future. By the summer of 1608, the colony was near failure.
The Colonists Face Further Difficulties Another major problem the Jamestown colonists faced was starvation. Their physical environment offered plenty of resources: fish to catch, plants to gather, and animals
» Jamestown colonists constructed buildings such as thisjn the first permanent English settlement in what is ^United States.
an Colonization of North America 58
to hunt. However, many colonists were not used to living in the wilderness and did not know how to take advantage of these resources. Furthermore, the colonists did not spend enough time producing food. Captain John Smith, a young soldier and explorer, f observed that the colonists were not planting enough : crops. He complained that people wanted only to | “dig gold, wash gold, refine gold, load gold. As they searched in vain for gold, the colony ran out of food.
Smith helped to save the colony. He set up stern rules that forced colonists to work if they wished to eat. ,
He also visited nearby Indian villages. Powhatan (pow uh tan), the most powerful chief in the area, agreed to supply corn to the English.
Peaceful relations with Native Americans did not last, however. Whenever the Indians refused to supply food, the colonists used force to seize what they needed. Once, Smith aimed a gun at Powhatan's brother until the Indians provided corn to buy his freedom. Such incidents led to frequent and bloody warfare. Peace was restored briefly when the colonist John Rolfe married Pocahontas, daughter of Powhatan.
However, problems arose soon after John Smith returned to England in 1609. Desperate settlers cooked “dogs, cats, snakes, [and] toadstools” to survive. To , keep warm, they broke up houses to burn as firewood. The colonists gradually learned to use the sources available in their environment to survive.
Tobacco Crops Help Jamestown’s economy finally improved after 1612, when colonists began growing tobacco. Europeans had learned about tobacco from Native Americans.
King James called pipe smoking “a vile custom.” Still, the new fad caught on quickly. By 1620, England was importing more than 30,000 pounds of tobacco a year. At last, Virginians had found a way to make their colony succeed.
English immigrants to Virginia interacted with their environment by cutting down forests and planting the land with tobacco. Their interaction with the environment was different from that of other groups of immigrants to North America, such as the Dutch and the French, whose trading activity led to the near elimination of beaver populations in some areas.

An Improved Form of Government
For a time, the governors sent by the Virginia Company ran the colony like a military outpost. Each morning, a drumbeat summoned settlers to work at assigned tasks. Harsh laws imposed the death penalty even for small offenses, like stealing an ear of corn. Such conditions were unlikely to attract new colonists. As John Smith commented after his return to England, “No Man will go ... to have less freedom there than here.”
The House of Burgesses To attract more settlers, the Virginia Company took steps to establish a more stable government. In 1619, it sent a new governor with orders to consult settlers on all important matters. Male settlers were allowed to elect burgesses, or representatives to the government.
The burgesses met in an assembly called the House of Burgesses. Together with the governor and his council, they made laws for the colony. The first session met in the Jamestown church in July and August 1619. In steamy weather, the burgesses sat in the church pews, while the governor and council took their places in the choir stalls.
The House of Burgesses marked the beginning of representative government in the English colonies. In a representative government, voters elect representatives to make laws for them.
Political Rights and Responsibilties The idea that people had political rights was deeply rooted in English history. In 1215, English nobles had forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, or Great Charter. This document said that the king could not raise taxes without first consulting a Great Council of nobles and church leaders. Over time, the rights won by nobles were extended to other people.
The Great Council grew into a representative assembly, called Parliament. Parliament was divided into the House of Lords, made up of nobles, and an elected House of Commons. Only rich men had the right to vote. Still, the English had established the principle that even monarchs had to obey the law.
Some Virginia Settlers Can Vote At first, free Virginians had even greater rights than citizens in England. They did not have to own property in order to vote. In 1670, however, the colony restricted the vote to free, white, male property owners.
Despite these limits, representative government remained important. The idea took root that settlers should have a say in the affairs of the colony. Colonists

Why was the House of Burgesses created in Virginia?
The Jamestown Colony Grows
During the early years of the Jamestown Colony, only a few women chose to make the journey from England. Nor did enough workers come to raise tobacco and other crops.
Women in Jamestown The colony’s first women arrived in 1608—a “Mistress Forrest” and her maid, Anne Burras. Few others followed until 1619, when the Virginia Company sent about 100 women to help “make the men more settled.” This shipload of women quickly found husbands. The Virginia Company profited from the marriages because it charged each man who found a wife 150 pounds of tobacco.
Life for women was a daily struggle. Women had to make everything from scratch—food, clothing,
even medicines. Many died young from hard work or childbirth. By 1624, there were still fewer than 300 women in the Jamestown colony, compared to more than 1,000 men.
Africans Arrive in Virginia Enslaved Africans were brought to Virginia early on. Recently discovered records show that at least 15 black men and 17 black women were already living there by 1619. That same year, a Dutch ship arrived with about 20 Africans. The Dutch sold the Africans to Virginians who needed laborers to grow tobacco. The colonists valued the agricultural skills that the Africans brought with them. From their perspective, the arrival of Africans meant the arrival of a labor force. From the enslaved Africans’ perspective, this was a journey into a brutal life of forced labor.
About 300 Africans lived in Virginia by 1644. Some were slaves for life.
Others worked as indentured servants, or people who were pledged to work for a master for a period until they paid off the cost of their voyage, and expected one day to own their own farms. Some Africans did become free planters. Anthony Johnson owned 250 acres of land and employed five servants to help him work it. For a time, free Africans in Virginia also had the right to vote. These newcomers from Africa helped

to transform the environment of Virginia by cutting down forests and planting tobacco fields.
Bacon’s Rebellion Meanwhile, English settlers [ continued to arrive in Virginia, attracted by the f promise of profits from tobacco. Wealthy planters, however, controlled the best lands near the coast. Many newcomers were indentured servants. When they finished their period of service, they looked for ; farmland. Because the best lands along the coast were ; taken, these and other newcomers had to push farther j inland, onto Indian lands.	J
As in New England, conflicts over land led to fighting between some white settlers and Indians. After several bloody clashes, settlers called on the governor to take action against Native Americans. The governor refused. He was unwilling to act, in part because he profited from his own fur trade with Indians. Frontier , settlers were furious.
Finally, in 1676, Nathaniel Bacon, an ambitious young planter, organized angry men and women on the frontier, including both black and white indentured servants. He raided Native American villages, regardless of whether the Indians there had been friendly to the colonists or not. Then, he led his followers to Jamestown and burned the capital.

The uprising, known as Bacon’s Rebellion, lasted only a short time. When Bacon died suddenly, the revolt fell apart. The governor hanged 23 of Bacon’s followers. Still, he could not stop English settlers from moving onto Indian lands along the frontier, or the edge of the settlement.
Wealthy Virginians generally supported Governor Berkeley. They were alarmed that black and white indentured servants had joined together in a rebellion. In response, Virginia set up a system of laws replacing indentured servitude for Africans with a condition of lifelong slavery that would be passed on to enslaved Africans’ children. As slavery expanded, free African Americans also lost rights. By the early 1700s, free African American property owners could no longer vote.

Seeking Religious Freedom
One of the voyagers. William Bradford, vividly remembered the situation:
Being thus passed the vast ocean . . . they had now no friends to welcome them nor inns to entertain or refresh their weatherbeaten bodies; no houses or much less towns to repair to . . . And for the season it was winter, and they that know the winters of that country know them to be sharp and violent.
—William. Bradford, Of Plymouth PldwMou
Unlike the Jamestown colonists or the Spanish, these newcomers sought neither gold nor silver nor great riches. What they wanted most was to practice their religion freely. Years later, the founders of Plymouth became known to history as the Pilgrims.

Religion in Europe It was not easy for people to practice religion freely in Europe during the 1500s. As you have read, after the Protestant Reformation, Christians in western Europe were divided into Protestants and Roman Catholics. This division led to fierce religious wars. In France, for example, Protestants and Catholics fought each other for nearly 40 years. Thousands upon thousands of people were killed because of their religious beliefs.
Most European rulers believed that they could not maintain order unless everyone followed the ruler’s religion. The religion chosen by the ruler was known as the established church. In England, for example, the established church was the Anglican church, or Church of England. In the 1530s, Parliament passed laws making the English monarch the head of the Church of England.
In England and other nations, people who did not follow the established religion were often persecuted. Persecution is the mistreatment or punishment of certain people because of their beliefs. Sometimes, members of persecuted groups had to worship secretly. If they were discovered, they might be imprisoned or even executed by being burned at the stake.
The Pilgrims One religious group in England that faced persecution were the people we now call the Pilgrims. At the time, they were known as Separatists. They were called that because, although they were Protestant, they wanted to separate from the Church of England.
The English government bitterly opposed the Separatists. William Bradford remembered what some Separatists had suffered.
They . . . were hunted and persecuted on every side. , . . For some were taken and clapped up in prison, others had their houses beset and watched night and day . . . and the most were [glad] to flee and leave their houses.
—William Bradford, Of Plymouin Plantanon
In the early 1600s, a group of Separatists left England for Leyden, a city in the Netherlands. The Dutch allowed the newcomers to worship freely. Still, the Pilgrims missed their English way of life. They were also worried that their children were growing up more Dutch than English.

Plymouth Colony
A group of Separatists decided to return to England. Along with some other English people who were not Separatists, they won a charter to set up a colony in the northern part of Virginia. Like the colonists who followed them, the Pilgrims’ enterprise was started and funded privately in the hopes that it would earn a profit. In September 1620, more than 100 men, women, and children set sail aboard a small ship called the Mayflower. The journey was long and difficult.
At last, in November 1620, the Mayflower landed on the cold, bleak shore of Cape Cod, in present-day Massachusetts. The passengers had planned to settle farther south along the Hudson River, but the difficult sea voyage exhausted them. The colonists decided to travel no farther. They called their new settlement Plimoth, or Plymouth, because the Mayflower had sailed from the port of Plymouth, England.
A
New Pledge to Govern the Colony Before going ashore, the Pilgrims realized that they would not be settling within the boundaries of Virginia. As a result, the terms of their charter would not apply to their new colony. In that case, who would govern them? The question was important because not all colonists on the Mayflower were Pilgrims. Some of these "strangers,” as » In November 1620, English Separatists on the Mayflower, shown here, arrived at present-day Massachusetts to start new lives free of religious oersecution.
>pean Colonization of North America
the Pilgrims called them, said they were not bound to obey the Pilgrims, “for none had power to command them.”
In response, the Pilgrims joined together to write _ a framework for governing their colony On November * 11, 1620, the 41 adult male passengers—both Pilgrims j and non-Pilgrims—signed the Mayflower Compact. They pledged themselves to unite into a “civil body politic,” or government. They agreed to make and abide by laws that insured “the general Good of the Colony.”
The Mayflower Compact established an important , tradition. When the Pilgrims found themselves without a government, they banded together themselves to make laws. In time, they set up a government in which adult male colonists elected a governor and council. Thus, like Virginia’s Great Charter, the Mayflower Compact strengthened the English tradition of governing through elected representatives. These representatives were in turn expected to show the religious virtues that the Pilgrims valued and to make decisions for the common good. The colony at Plymouth thought that this type of representative government, rather than the monarchy • that they knew in England, would best protect their > religious freedom.
Religious Motivation and Religious Freedom The i
Pilgrims were the first of many immigrants who came to North America in order to worship as they pleased. That did not mean that religious freedom spread quickly through England’s colonies. Many settlers who wished to worship as they pleased still believed that only their own religious beliefs should be observed. Most of the English colonies set up their own established churches. 1
Still, the Pilgrims’ desire to worship freely set an important precedent, or example for others to follow in the future. In time, the idea of religious freedom for all would become a cornerstone of American democracy. 0 DESCRIBE What was the Mayflower Compact?

Overcoming Hardships in Plymouth
The Pilgrims built their settlement on the site of a Native American village that had been abandoned because of disease. The colonists even found baskets filled with corn that they were able to eat.

A
Cold Winter in Plymouth However, the corn was not enough to get the Pilgrims through their first winter. The Pilgrims had failed to bring enough food with them, and it was too late in the season to plant new crops. The harsh season was also difficult to survive because the Pilgrims had not had enough time to build proper shelters. During the winter, the men worked to build houses onshore, while most spent nights aboard the Mayflower. Nearly half the settlers had perished of disease or starvation by spring.
Among those who died that winter was the colony’s first governor. William Bradford was chosen to take his place. Bradford’s able leadership helped the colony survive. Reelected many times, he would lead Plymouth for most of the next 36 years.
Despite the great suffering of that winter, the Pilgrims’ religious faith remained strong. They believed that it was God’s will for them to remain in Plymouth. “What could now sustain them,” wrote Bradford, “but the Spirit of God and His grace?”
Native Americans Offer Assistance In the spring, the Pilgrims began to clear land and plant crops. They also received help from neighboring Native Americans. A Pemaquid Indian, Samoset, had learned English from earlier explorers sailing along the coast. He introduced the Pilgrims to Massasoit (mas uh soit), chief of the local Wampanoag (wahm puh NOH ahg) Indians.
The Wampanoag who helped the Pilgrims most was named Squanto. As a young man, Squanto had been captured by an English expedition led by John Smith. Squanto lived for a time in England, where he learned to speak the language. As a result, he could communicate easily with the Pilgrims.
Squanto brought the Pilgrims seeds of native plants—corn, beans, and pumpkins—and showed them how to plant them. He also taught the settlers how to catch eels from nearby rivers. By treading water, he stirred up eels from the mud at the river bottom and then snatched them up with his hands. The grateful Pilgrims called Squanto “a special instrument sent of God.”
In the fall, the Pilgrims had a very good harvest. Because they believed that God had given them this harvest, they set aside a day for giving thanks.
In later years, the Pilgrims celebrated after each harvest season with a day of thanksgiving. Americans today celebrate Thanksgiving as a national holiday.

Forming Massachusetts Bay Colony
The migration to Massachusetts Bay during the 1630s was led by a religious group known as the Puritans. Unlike the Pilgrims, the Puritans did not want to separate entirely from the Church of England. Instead, they hoped to reform the church by introducing simpler forms of worship. They wanted to do away with many practices inherited from the Roman Catholic Church, such as organ music, finely decorated houses of worship, and special clothing for priests.
Reasons for Immigration to Massachusetts The
Puritans were a powerful group in England. Although some were small farmers, many were well-educated and successful merchants or landowners.
Charles I, who became king in 1625, disapproved of the Puritans and their ideas. He canceled Puritan business charters and even had a few Puritans jailed.
By 1629, some Puritan leaders were convinced that England had fallen on “evil and declining times.” They persuaded royal officials to grant them a charter to form the Massachusetts Bay Company. The company’s bold plan was to build a new society based on biblical laws and teachings. John Winthrop, a lawyer and a devout
2.3	The New England Colonies
Puritan, believed that the new colony would set an example to the world.
Some settlers joined the Massachusetts colonists for economic rather than religious reasons. In wealthy English families, the oldest son usually inherited his father's estate. With little hope of owning land, younger sons sought opportunity elsewhere. They were attracted to Massachusetts Bay because it offered cheap land or a chance to start a business.
A
Greater Say in Government In 1629, the Puritans sent a small advance party to North America. John Winthrop and a party of more than 1,000 arrived the following year. Winthrop was chosen as the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Once ashore, Winthrop set an example for others. Although he was governor, he worked hard to build a home, clear land, and plant crops. There was discontent among some colonists, though. Under the charter, only stockholders who had invested money in the Massachusetts Bay Company had the right to vote. Most settlers, however, were not stockholders. They resented taxes and laws passed by a government in which they had no say.
Winthrop and other stockholders saw that the colony would run more smoothly if a greater number of settlers could take part. At the same time, Puritan leaders

wished to keep non-Puritans out of the government. As a result, they granted the right to vote for governor to all men who were church members. Later, male church members also elected representatives to an assembly called the General Court.
Under the leadership of Winthrop and other Puritans, the Massachusetts Bay Colony prospered. Between 1629 and 1640, some 15,000 men, women, and children journeyed from England to Massachusetts. This movement of people is known as the Great Migration. Many of the newcomers settled in Boston, which grew into the colony’s largest town.	j

Religious Differences
The Puritan leaders did not like anyone to question their religious beliefs or the way the colony was governed. Usually, discontented colonists were forced to leave. Some colonists who left Massachusetts founded other colonies in New England.
A
New Colony with Limited Government In May 1636, a Puritan minister named Thomas Hooker led about 100 settlers out of Massachusetts Bay. Pushing west, they drove their cattle, goats, and pigs along Indian trails that cut through the forests. When they reached the Connecticut River, they built a town, which they called Hartford.
Hooker left Massachusetts Bay because he believed that the governor and other officials had too much power. He wanted to set up a colony in Connecticut with strict limits on government.
The settlers wrote a plan of government called the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut in 1639 It created a government much like that of Massachusetts, which relied on the virtue of the people to obey the law and seek the common good. There were, however, two important differences. First, the Fundamental Orders gave the vote to all men who were property owners, including those who were not church members. Second, the Fundamental Orders limited the governor’s power. In this way, the Fundamental Orders expanded the idea of representative government in the English colonies.
Connecticut became a separate colony in 1662, with a new charter granted by the king of England. By then, 15 towns were thriving along the Connecticut River.
A
New Relationship Between Religion and Government Another Puritan who challenged the leaders of Massachusetts Bay was Roger Williams. A young minister in the village of Salem, Williams was gentle and good-natured. William Bradford described him as “zealous but very unsettled in judgment.” Some Puritan leaders probably agreed with this. Most people, including Governor Winthrop, liked him. Williams’s ideas, however, alarmed Puritan leaders. Williams believed that the Puritan church in Massachusetts had too much power. In Williams’s view, the business of church and state should be completely separate since concern with political affairs would corrupt the church. The role of the state, said Williams, was to maintain order and peace. It should not support a particular church. Finally, Williams did not believe that the Puritan leaders had the right to force people to attend religious services. Because of these political reasons, Williams sought to establish a new colony.
Williams also believed in religious tolerance. Religious tolerance means a willingness to let others practice their own beliefs. In Puritan Massachusetts, non-Puritans were not allowed to worship freely.
Puritan leaders viewed Williams as a dangerous troublemaker. In 1635, the General Court ordered him to leave Massachusetts. Fearing that the court

would send him back to England, Williams fled to Narragansett Bay, where he spent the winter with Indians. In the spring of 1636, the Indians sold him land for a settlement. After a few years, the settlement became the English colony of Rhode Island.
In Rhode Island, Williams put into practice his ideas about tolerance. He allowed complete freedom of religion for all Protestants, Jews, and Catholics. He did not set up a state church or require settlers to attend church services. He also gave all white men the right to vote. Before long, settlers who disliked the strict Puritan rule of Massachusetts flocked to Providence and other towns in Rhode Island. The creation of a colony with freedom of religion thus offered a way to resolve conflicts between people from different religious groups.
A
Woman’s Voice Calls for Religious Freedom Among those who fled to Rhode Island was Anne Hutchinson. A devout Puritan, Hutchinson regularly attended church services in Boston, where she first lived. After church, she and her friends gathered at her home to discuss the minister’s sermon. Often, she seemed to question some of the minister’s teachings. Hutchinson was very persuasive and neighbors flocked to hear her.

Puritan leaders grew angry. They believed that Hutchinson’s opinions were full of religious errors. Even worse, they said, a woman did not have the right to explain God’s law. In November 1637, Hutchinson was ordered to appear before the Massachusetts General Court.
At her trial, Hutchinson answered the questions put to her by Governor Winthrop and other members of the court. Each time, her answers revealed weaknesses in their arguments. They could not prove that she had broken any Puritan laws or that she had disobeyed any religious teachings.
Then, after two long days of hostile questioning, Hutchinson made a serious mistake. She told the court that God spoke directly to her, “By the voice of His own spirit to my soul.” Members of the court were shocked. Puritans believed that God spoke only through the Bible, not directly to individuals. The court ordered her out of the colony.
In 1638, Hutchinson, along with her family and some friends, went to Rhode Island. The Puritan leaders had won their case. For later Americans,

however, Hutchinson became an important symbol of the struggle for religious freedom.

From Massachusetts Bay, settlers fanned out across New England. Some built trading and fishing villages along the coast north of Boston. Port towns with good harbors were ideal for the fishing industry and also lured trading ships, building the area’s economy. In 1680, the king would make some of these coastal settlements into a separate colony called New Hampshire.

As more colonists settled in New England, they began to take over more Native American lands. By 1670, nearly 45,000 English settlers were living in the towns in New England. Land was a resource, but as more people lived in the region, it became increasingly scarce. Fighting soon broke out between white settlers and Indian nations of the region.
King Phillip’s War The largest conflict came in 1675. Metacom, also known by his English name, King Phillip, was chief of the Wampanoag Indians. He watched for years as English towns were built on Wampanoag lands. “I am resolved not to see the day when I have no i country,” he told an English friend. Metacom’s people attacked villages throughout New England.
Other Indian groups, from Rhode Island to Maine, soon allied themselves with the Wampanoags. They were determined to drive the English settlers off their land. Metacom and his allies destroyed 12 towns and killed more than 600 European settlers.
After more than a year of fighting, however, Metacom was captured and killed. The English sold his family and about 1,000 other Indians into slavery in the West Indies. Other Indians were forced from their homelands.

The Towns of New
England
Puritans believed that people should worship and tend to local matters as a community. As a result, New England became a land of tightly knit towns.
At the center of many towns was the common, an open field where cattle grazed. Nearby stood the meetinghouse, where Puritans worshiped and held town meetings.
Religious Practice The Puritans took their Sabbath, or holy day of religious observance and rest, very seriously. On Sundays, no one was allowed to play games or visit taverns to joke, talk, and drink. The law required all citizens to attend Sunday church services, which would last all day.
During the 1600s, women sat on one side of the church and men on the other. Blacks and Indians stood in a balcony at the back. Children had separate pews, where an adult watched over them.

The Importance of Local Government At town meetings, which were normally held in meeting houses where the settlers worshipped, settlers discussed and voted on many issues. What roads should be built? How much should the schoolmaster be paid? Town meetings gave New Englanders a chance to speak their minds.
Puritan congregations also discussed and voted on church issues. They chose their own ministers and members and answered to no other authority.
These early experiences encouraged the growth of democratic ideas in New England. Values such as self-government, individual choice, and the common good took root and thrived.
Still, Puritan laws were strict. About 15 crimes carried the death penalty. One crime punishable by death was witchcraft. In 1692, Puritans in Salem Village executed 20 innocent men and women as witches.
The Environment Influences Economic Activity
New England was a difficult land for colonists. The rocky soil was poor for farming and required much labor. After a time, however, Native Americans taught English settlers how to grow many crops, such as Indian corn, pumpkins, squash, and beans. Still, some communities relocated to take advantage of better lands. In the mid-1630s, cattle and dairy farmers who had settled in Dorchester, Massachusetts, moved to the Connecticut River Valley.

oil for lamps and other products. In the 1700s and 1800s, whaling grew into a big business.
Puritan communities and their governments often supported the development of important industries such as shipbuilding and ironworking. They found ways to work together for long-term goals that might benefit the general population. For example, sometimes they limited the sale of wood to make more available to shipbuilders.
The Puritans Leave a Lasting Legacy During the 1700s, the Puritan tradition declined. Fewer families left England for religious reasons. Ministers had less influence on the way colonies were governed. Nevertheless, the Puritans had stamped New England with their distinctive customs and their ideal of a religious society. The ideas of Pilgrims and Puritans, their virtues of hard work and thrift, their high regard for education, and their contributions to democratic thought still influence American values and American identity today.

By 1700, England had four colonies in the region just south of New England. These colonies became known as the Middle Colonies because they were located between New England and the Southern Colonies. The Middle Colonies had a greater mix of people than either New England or the Southern Colonies.

Windsor, Connecticut, provided lush meadows and pastures better suited to their cattle than the sandy soils and rocky hills of Dorchester.
Although much of the soil was poor, the forests were full of riches. Settlers hunted wild turkey and deer. Settlers also cut down trees, floating them down rivers to sawmills near seaports such as Boston, Massachusetts, or Portsmouth, New Hampshire. With miles of coastline and nearby raw materials, these and other New England towns grew into major shipbuilding centers.

Dutch Colony Becomes English Each of the colonies along the Atlantic coast had been established by different people for different purposes. Sometimes colonies were formed to escape political oppression or social tensions back home in Europe. The New England Colonies served as a refuge for people who faced religious persecution. Many were also created to profit a European company across the ocean, as many colonies to the south were. In the case of New Netherland, however, the conditions back home for the Dutch were stable and fairly prosperous. New Netherland was founded simply to take advantage of economic opportunities in North America.
New Amsterdam The Dutch set up the colony of New Netherland along the Hudson River. They developed the fur trade and built settlements where fur-bearing animals were abundant. In the colony’s early years, settlers traded with Indians and built the settlement of New Amsterdam into a thriving port. Located near good farmland and with a safe harbor for ships, New Amsterdam quickly became a center for commerce and trading valuable beaver skins.
Although less interested in farming, Dutch officials did promote agriculture by granting some large parcels of land to a few rich families. A single land grant could stretch for miles. Indeed, one grant was as big as Rhode Island! Owners of these huge estates were

called patroons. In return for the grant, each patroon promised to settle at least 50 European farm families on the land. Few farmers wanted to work for the patroons, however. Patroons had great power and could charge whatever rents they pleased.
England Gains Control Many settlers lived in the trading center of New Amsterdam, which by 1664 had a population of about 1,500 people. They came from all over Europe. Most of them came for the economic opportunities, working as merchants or farmers, or in trades and crafts. Many were also attracted by the chance to practice their religion freely. African slaves were in demand as well. In the early years they made up more than a quarter of the population of the town.
Dutch colonists were mainly Protestants who belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church. Still, they permitted members of other religions and ethnic groups—including Roman Catholics, French Protestants, and Jews—to buy land. "People do not seem concerned what religion their neighbor is” wrote a shocked visitor from Virginia. “Indeed, they do not seem to care if he has any religion at all.”
In fact, Peter Stuyvesant (STY vuh sunt), the governor of New Netherland, had been ordered not to interfere with other religions as long as they did not disturb the peace or restrict commerce.
» Ample farmland and fertile soil form the backdrop to the first Quaker meetinghouse built in Burlington, New Jersey, in 1683.
The relationship between the English and the Dutch was complicated by their common interest in creating new colonies and expanding trade. In North America, the Dutch wanted to continue benefiting from New Amsterdam’s economic growth. However, the English r wanted New Amsterdam for themselves.
By 1664, the rivalry between England and the Netherlands for trade and colonies was at its height.
In August of that year, English warships entered New Amsterdam’s harbor. Governor Stuyvesant swore to defend the city. However, he had few weapons and . little gunpowder. Also, Stuyvesant had made himself J so unpopular with his harsh rule and heavy taxes that the colonists refused to help him. In the end, he surrendered without firing a shot.
King Charles II of England then gave New Netherland to his brother, the Duke of York. He renamed the colony New York in the duke’s honor.
U DESCRIBE
Why did many people come to New Amsterdam? New Jersey Forms Out of New York
At the time of the English takeover, New York stretched as far south as the Delaware River. The Duke of York decided that the colony was too big to govern easily. He gave some of the land to friends, Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. They set up a proprietary (proh PRY uh tehr ee) colony, which they called New Jersey, in 1664.
A
Proprietary Colony and Free Enterprise In setting up a proprietary colony, the king gave land to one or more people in return for a yearly payment. These proprietors were free to divide the land and rent it to others. They made laws for the colony but had to respect the rights of colonists under English law. This new system of colonization was different from most that had come before. Proprietary colonies placed vast lands and power in the hands of a few men loyal to the monarch. Earlier colonies had been financed by stock companies made up of a number of investors. Like New York, New Jersey had fertile farmland and a wealth of other resources that attracted people from many lands. Thousands of European settlers immigrated to New Jersey as a haven from war and poverty. Settlers came from Finland, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, and Sweden. There were also English and Dutch settlers who moved there from the colony of New York. In addition, some New England colonists, hoping to find better farmland, chose to relocate to New Jersey.
The proprietors of the New Jersey encouraged the free enterprise system, which meant that government played a limited role in the economy. The free enterprise system benefited colonists. They could farm or run businesses without much control by the local government. Facing financial losses themselves, however, the proprietors eventually returned the colony of New Jersey to the English crown.
A
Royal Colony In 1702, New Jersey became a royal colony, which is a colony under the direct control of the English king or queen. The colony’s royal charter protected religious freedom and the rights of an assembly that voted on local matters. This charter could be viewed as a legal agreement between the monarch and settlers, binding to both. It was a step toward a more democratic form of government. Despite these improvements, direct English rule tended to be harsh toward colonists. New Jersey’s independent-minded settlers struggled to gain more influence over decisions that affected them. H DEFINE
What was a proprietary colony? Pennsylvania Becomes a Colony
West of New Jersey, William Penn founded the colony of Pennsylvania in 1681. Penn came from a wealthy English family and was a personal friend of King Charles II. At age 22, however, Penn shocked family and friends by joining the Quakers, one of the most despised religious groups in England.
The Quakers Seek Religious Freedom Like Pilgrims and Puritans, Quakers were Protestant reformers. Their reforms went further than those of other groups, however.
Quakers believed that all people—men and women, nobles and commoners—were equal in God’s sight. They allowed women to preach in public and refused to bow or remove their hats in the presence of nobles. Quakers spoke out against all war and refused to serve in the army.
To most English people, Quaker beliefs seemed wicked. In both England and New England, Quakers were arrested, fined, or even hanged for their ideas. Penn became convinced that the Quakers must leave England. He took steps to found a new colony. Together with others, Penn purchased parts of New Jersey from their proprietors. Then he turned to the king for help.
Charles II issued a royal charter naming Penn proprietor of a large tract of land in North America. The
European Colonization of North America 73
king named the new colony Pennsylvania, or Penn’s woodlands. During his time as proprietor, Penn took steps that aided the development of self-government in Pennsylvania. He proposed a constitution and a General Assembly. Later, he agreed to changes in the constitution and greater powers for the colonial assembly.
Showing Fairness to All Penn thought of his colony as a “holy experiment.” He wanted it to be a model of religious freedom, peace, and Christian living. Protestants, Catholics, and Jews went to Pennsylvania to escape persecution. Later, English officials forced Penn to turn away Catholic and Jewish settlers.
Penn’s Quaker beliefs led him to speak out for fair treatment of Native Americans. Penn believed that the land in North America belonged to the Indians. He insisted that settlers should pay for the land. Native Americans respected him for this policy. As a result, Pennsylvania colonists enjoyed many years of peace with their Indian neighbors. One settler remarked, “as Penn treated the Indians with extraordinary humanity, they became civil and loving to us.”
Pennsylvania Expands Penn sent pamphlets describing his colony all over Europe. Soon, settlers from England, Scotland, Wales, the Netherlands,

France, and Germany began to cross the Atlantic Ocean to Pennsylvania.
Among the new arrivals were large numbers of German-speaking Protestants. They became known as Pennsylvania Dutch because people could not pronounce the word Deutsch (doich), which means German. Many Pennsylvania Dutch had faced religious persecution in Europe, including the Amish and Mennonites. Because of their experiences in Europe, these German-speaking people were naturally attracted to the ideals of Penn’s colony, in which people of different ethnicities and religions could live peaceably together. The ethnic diversity of Pennsylvania contributed to a developing American identity based on ethnic diversity.
Pennsylvania, like most other colonies, was created for a mix of political, economic, religious, and social reasons. Pennsylvania was like the New England colonies in the religious reasons for its creation.
Like New York, its political roots lay in a proprietor’s ties to the king. Pennsylvania’s social goals of harmony among different groups were similar to those of Rhode Island. Like most proprietors, Penn hoped to profit from his colony.

of all new arrivals between 1730 and 1750. Enslaved Africans were present in New York, New Jersey, and the New England Colonies as well, but in smaller numbers than in the Southern Colonies. Because of Philadelphia's location along the Delaware River, many worked as laborers in manufacturing and shipbuilding.

Daily Life in the Middle Colonies
The majority of colonists made their living by farming. Farmers found more favorable conditions in the Middle Colonies than in New England. The broad Hudson and Delaware river valleys were rich and fertile. Winters were milder than in New England, and the growing season lasted longer.
A
Thriving Economy On such promising land, farmers in the eastern counties of the Middle Colonies cleared their fields. They mostly chose to raise wheat, barley, and rye as a way to earn money. Wheat, barley, and rye were cash crops, or crops that were sold for money on the market and not consumed by the farmer’s family In fact, the Middle Colonies exported so much grain that they became known as the Breadbasket Colonies. The Pennsylvania Dutch tended to settle the fertile interior lands. They altered the environment by clearing land and starting farms, turning these regions into rich fields that are still productive today.
Farmers of the Middle Colonies also raised herds of cattle and pigs. Every year, they sent tons of beef, pork, and butter to the ports of New York and Philadelphia. From there, the goods went by ship to New England and the South or to the West Indies, England, and other parts of Europe.
Farms in the Middle Colonies were generally larger than those in New England. Landowners hired workers to help with the planting, harvesting, and other tasks. Enslaved African Americans worked on a few large farms. However, most workers were farmhands who worked alongside the families that owned the land.
Aside from farmers, there were also skilled artisans in the Middle Colonies. Encouraged by William Penn, skilled German crafts workers set up shop in

Pennsylvania. In time, the colony became a center of manufacturing and crafts. One visitor reported that workshops turned out “hardware, clocks, watches, locks, guns, flints, glass, stoneware, nails, [and] paper.”
Settlers in the Delaware River valley profited from the region’s rich deposits of iron ore. Heating the ore in furnaces, they purified it and then hammered it into nails, tools, and parts for guns.
Home Life Because houses tended to be far apart in the Middle Colonies, towns were less important than in New England. Counties, rather than villages, became centers of local government.
The different groups who settled the Middle Colonies had their own favorite ways of building. Swedish settlers introduced log cabins to the Americas. The Dutch used red bricks to build narrow, high-walled houses. German settlers developed a wood-burning stove that heated a home better than a fireplace, which sent heat up the chimney and pulled cold air in through cracks in the walls.
Everyone in a household had a job to do. Households were largely self sufficient, which meant that most things needed for survival—food, clothing, soap, candles, and many other goods—were made at home. As one farmer said, “Nothing to wear, eat, or drink was purchased, as my farm provided all.”
Expanding Beyond Philadelphia In the 1700s, thousands of German and Scotch-Irish settlers arrived in Philadelphia. From there, many traveled west into the backcountry the area of land along the eastern slopes of the Appalachian Mountains. Settlers followed an old Indian trail that became known as the Great Wagon Road.
Although settlers planned to follow farming methods they had used in Europe, they found the challenge of farming the backcountry more difficult than they had thought it would be. To farm the backcountry, settlers had to clear thick forests. From Indians, settlers learned how to use knots from pine trees as candles to light their homes. They made wooden dishes from logs, gathered honey from hollows in trees, and hunted wild animals for food. German gunsmiths developed a lightweight rifle for use in forests. Sharpshooters boasted that the “Pennsylvania rifle” could hit a rattlesnake between the eyes at 100 yards.
Many of the settlers who arrived in the backcountry moved onto Indian lands. “The Indians . . . are alarmed at the swarm of strangers,” one Pennsylvania official reported. “We are afraid of a [fight] between them for the [colonists] are very rough to them.” However, officials did not step in to protect Indian rights.

He named the colony Maryland in honor of Queen Henrietta Maria, the king’s wife. Calvert died before his colony could get underway. His son Cecil, Lord Baltimore, pushed on with the project.
Settlers Come to Maryland In the spring of 1634, about 200 colonists landed along the upper Chesapeake Bay, across the Potomac River from England’s first southern colony, Virginia. Maryland was truly a land of plenty. Chesapeake Bay was full of fish, oysters, and crabs. Across the bay, Virginians were already growing tobacco for profit.
Maryland’s new settlers hoped to do the same. Remembering the early problems at Jamestown, the newcomers avoided the swampy lowlands. They built their first town, St. Mary’s, in a drier location.
As proprietor of the colony, Lord Baltimore owned Maryland. It was his responsibility, not that of a company, to start the colony. He used private funds to do it. He appointed a governor and a council of advisers. He gave colonists a role in government by creating an elected assembly. At first, settlers had to pay rent to Lord Baltimore.

land. Eager to attract settlers, Lord Baltimore decided to make generous land grants to anyone who brought over servants, women, and children. Later he offered smaller farms, as well as great estates, to attract more settlers.
A few women took advantage of Lord Baltimore s offer of land. Two sisters, Margaret and Mary Brent, arrived in Maryland in 1638 with nine male servants. In time, they set up two plantations of about 1,000 acres each. Later, Margaret Brent helped prevent a rebellion among the governor’s soldiers. The Maryland assembly praised her efforts, saying that “the colony’s safety at any time [was better] in her hands than in any man’s.”
Acceptance of Other Religions To make sure Maryland continued to grow, Lord Baltimore welcomed Protestants as well as Catholics to the colony. Later, Lord Baltimore came to fear that Protestants might try to deprive Catholics of their right to worship freely. In 1649, he asked the assembly to pass an Act of Toleration. The law provided religious freedom for all Christians. As in many colonies, this freedom did not extend to Jews.

Settlement in the
Carolinas and Georgia
South of Virginia and Maryland, English colonists settled in a region that they called the Carolinas. In 1663, a group of eight English nobles received a grant of land from King Charles II. Settlement took place in two separate areas, one in the north and the other in the south.
The Carolinas Develop Differently In the northern i part of the Carolinas, settlers were mostly poor tobacco farmers who had spread south from Virginia. They tended to have small farms. Eventually, in 1712, the colony became known as North Carolina. Farther south, the group of eight English nobles set up a larger colony.
The largest settlement, Charles Town, sprang up where the Ashley and Cooper rivers met the Atlantic Ocean. Later, Charles Town’s name was shortened ' to Charleston. This colony became known as South Carolina in 1719.
Most early settlers in Charleston were English people who had been living in Barbados, a British colony in the Caribbean. Later, other immigrants arrived, including Germans, Swiss, French Protestants, and Spanish Jews.
Around 1685, a few planters discovered that rice grew well in the swampy lowlands along the coast. However, they were unable to grow rich crops until Africans from rice-growing areas of Africa arrived in the colony. Before long, Carolina rice was a profitable crop traded around the world. Settlers farther inland in South Carolina later learned to raise indigo, a plant used to make a valuable blue dye.
Georgia Offers a Second Chance The last of England’s Southern Colonies was carved out of the southern part of South Carolina. James Oglethorpe, a respected English soldier and energetic social reformer, helped to found Georgia in 1732. He and the other trustees started and funded the colony privately. They hoped it would solve an English social problem as well as defend the English colonies to the north from Spanish Florida to the south. Oglethorpe wanted the new colony to be a place where debtors, or people who owed money they could not pay back, could make a fresh start. Penn had established Pennsylvania as a refuge for people of different religions. Similarly, Oglethorpe established Georgia mainly for social reasons, as a refuge for debtors.
Under English law, the government could imprison debtors until they paid what they owed. If they ever got out of jail, debtors often had no money and no place to live. Oglethorpe offered to pay for debtors and other
poor people to travel to Georgia. “In America,” he said, “there are enough fertile lands to feed all the poor of England.”
In 1733, Oglethorpe and 120 colonists built the colony’s first settlement at Savannah, along the Savannah River. Oglethorpe set strict rules for the colony. Farms could be no bigger than 500 acres, and slavery was forbidden.
At first, Georgia grew slowly. Later, however, Oglethorpe changed the rules to allow large plantations and slave labor. After that, the colony grew more quickly.
H CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why did South Carolina’s economy come to depend on rice crops?
Two Regions Develop Differently
The plantation system developed in the Southern Colonies because of the headright. The headright was a grant of land for each settler who came to a colony, or for the person who paid to bring a settler. Wealthy settlers saw a chance to gain even more wealth by paying for farm workers and thus gaining ownership of large amounts of fertile, coastal farmland.
Although the plantation system developed first in Virginia, South Carolina planters turned to it as well. They wanted large numbers of workers for rice plantations. Few white settlers were willing to work in rice paddies. As in Virginia, planters turned to Africa for slave labor.
By 1700, most people coming to Charleston were African men and women brought against their will. Each time a planter bought an enslaved African, the planter gained more land. This system led to the expansion of slavery across the South.
Tidewater Plantations on the Coast The Southern Colonies enjoyed warmer weather and a longer growing season than the colonies to the north. Parts of Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina near the coast all became major tobacco-growing areas. Settlers in lowland South Carolina and Georgia raised rice, indigo, and cotton. In these regions, physical characteristics of the environment, such as flat landscapes and fertile soils, resulted in a relatively dense population during the 1600s and 1700s.
Colonists soon found that it was most profitable to raise tobacco and rice on large plantations. As you recall, a plantation is a large estate farmed by many workers. The earliest planters settled along rivers and creeks of the coastal plain. Because these rivers and

creeks rose and fell with ocean tides, the region was known as the Tidewater. The Tidewater’s gentle slopes and rivers offered rich farmland for plantations.
Farther inland, planters settled along rivers. Rivers provided an easy way to move goods to market. Planters loaded crops onto ships bound for the West Indies and Europe. On the return trip, the ships carried English manufactured goods and other luxuries for planters and their families.
Most Tidewater plantations had their own docks along the river, and merchant ships picked up crops and delivered goods directly to them. For this reason, few large seaport cities developed in the Southern Colonies.
Large Tidewater plantations often consisted of brick or framed mansions with nearby storehouses and quarters for enslaved workers. The mansions overlooked fields or paddies, and often, the nearest river. On these southern plantations, anywhere from 20 to 100 enslaved Africans and African Americans did most of the work. Most of these enslaved workers worked in the fields. Others were skilled workers, such as carpenters, barrel makers, or blacksmiths. Still other enslaved Africans and African Americans worked in the main house as cooks, servants, or housekeepers.
Only a small percentage of white southerners owned large plantations. Yet, planters set the style of southern

living. Life centered around the planter’s house, or the Great House. There, the planter’s family lived in elegant quarters, including a parlor for visitors, a dining room, and guest bedrooms.
During the growing season, planters decided which fields to plant, what crops to grow, and when to harvest the crops. Planters’ wives kept the household running smoothly. They directed enslaved cooks, maids, and butlers in the house and made sure daily tasks were done, such as milking cows.
In contrast to the lives of the planters, enslaved workers faced daily hardship. They were impoverished and denied basic rights. Their diets were often inadequate for the work they did. Their dwellings were rough and open to the weather. They faced diseases and other dangers.
Yet enslaved Africans played a crucial role on plantations. They used farming skills they had brought from West Africa. With their help, English settlers learned how to grow rice. Africans also knew how to use wild plants unfamiliar to the English. They made water buckets out of gourds, and they used palmetto leaves to make fans, brooms, and baskets.
The Backcountry Farther Inland West of the Tidewater, life, and the local economy, was very

different. Here, at the base of the Appalachians, rolling hills and thick forests covered the land. These physical characteristics of the environment would in turn influence population distribution, settlement patterns, and economic activity in the region during the 1600s and 1700s. As in the Middle Colonies, this inland area was called the backcountry. Attracted by rich soil, settlers followed the Great Wagon Road into the backcountry of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas.
Among the settlers who moved into the backcountry were Scotch-Irish and Germans, including German Moravians. The Scotch-Irish tended to be Presbyterian farmers and craftspeople. Many were escaping famine and harsh treatment under English rule in Northern Ireland, or were the children of such immigrants.
They built churches and started schools in their backcountry settlements. These immigrant groups transformed the environment by clearing the forests and creating fields where they grew crops such as wheat and fields and pens where they raised cattle and pigs.
The German immigrants to the backcountry, mostly Lutherans, sought good land at low cost. They often settled together in the same areas, speaking German and retaining German culture. The German Moravians were members of a Protestant group that sought to convert Indians to Christianity. They allowed women to preach and were pacifists. The Moravians kept careful records of backcountry life—including everything from the weather to fashions—that historians still use today.
The backcountry was more democratic than the Tidewater. Settlers there were more likely to treat one another as equals. Men tended smaller fields of tobacco or garden crops such as beans, corn, or peas. They also hunted game.
The distance of the backcountry from the coastline made trade difficult and prevented the development of a plantation economy. Instead, backcountry farmers had to be mostly self-sufficient. Surplus goods were sold at local markets. Women cooked meals and fashioned simple, rugged clothing out of wool or deerskins. Another major difference between the backcountry and the Tidewater was slavery. Farms were smaller in the backcountry in part because of the hills and thick forests. Fewer enslaved Africans worked on these smaller farms, and most people were of European descent.
The hardships of backcountry life brought settlers closer together. Families gathered to husk corn or help one another build barns. Clustered in fertile valleys along the edge of the Appalachians, these hardy settlers felled trees and grew crops. By changing the

Read the section titled Tidewater Plantations on the Coast. Describe the plantations to a partner using as much detail as possible. The Slave Trade Expands
In the early years, Africans in the English colonies included free people and indentured servants as well as enslaved persons. During the 1600s, even Africans who were enslaved enjoyed some privileges. The first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia in 1619. For the next fifty years, since the African population was small, the status of Africans in the colony was not clearly established. Some enslaved Africans purchased their freedom. Several Africans during the 1600s, such as Anthony Johnson, became successful property owners. In South Carolina some enslaved Africans worked without supervision as cowboys, herding cattle to market.
By 1700, plantations in the Southern Colonies had come to rely heavily on slave labor. Eventually, enslaved Africans made up the majority of the population in South Carolina and Georgia. They cleared the land, worked the crops, and tended the livestock. In order to maintain the supply of enslaved Africans, southern planters relied on a system of slave trading that stretched halfway across the globe.
Africans Are Enslaved In Africa, as you have learned, as elsewhere around the world, slavery had been part of the social and economic system since ancient times. Usually, slaves were people who had been captured in war. Muslim merchants sometimes brought enslaved Africans into Europe and the Middle East.
Over a period of about 300 years, as the transatlantic slave trade grew, millions of Africans were enslaved. Slave traders from European nations set up posts along the West African coast. They offered guns and other goods in exchange for enslaved Africans.
As the demand for cheap labor increased, Africans who lived along the coast made raids into the interior, seeking captives to sell to the Europeans. They marched their captives to the coast. There, the Africans were loaded aboard European ships headed for forced immigration to the Americas.
» Planters in the Southern Colonies relied on the slave trade to maintain a supply of plantation labor. Summarize How does this poster present enslaved Africans?
Sailing Across the Middle Passage In the 1700s, English sailors began referring to the passage of slave-trading ships west across the Atlantic Ocean as the Middle Passage. Below the decks of these ships, enslaved Africans were often crammed tightly together on shelves. One observer noted that they were “chained to each other hand and foot, and stowed so close, that they were not allowed above a foot and a half for each in breadth.” The captives were allowed above deck to eat and exercise in the fresh air only once or twice a day.
Many enslaved Africans resisted, but only a few escaped. Some fought for their freedom during the trip. They would stage a mutiny or revolt. The slave traders lived in fear of this and were heavily armed. Other slaves resisted by refusing to eat or by committing suicide by jumping overboard to avoid a life of enslavement.
Records of slave-trading ships show that about 10 percent of Africans loaded aboard a ship for passage to the Americas died during the voyage. Many died of illnesses that spread rapidly in the filthy, crowded conditions inside a ship's hold. Others died of mistreatment. This slave trade lasted about 300 years. During that time, it may have caused the deaths of as many as 2 to 3 million Africans.

For the most part, colonists enjoyed more social equality than people in England, where a person’s opportunities in life were largely determined by birth. Still, class differences existed. Like Europeans, colonial Americans thought it was only natural that some people rank more highly than others. A person’s birth and wealth still determined his or her social status.

Human Rights Are Often Ignored As the importance of slavery increased during the 1600s, and particularly after Bacon’s Rebellion in Virginia, greater limits were placed on the rights of enslaved Africans and African Americans. Colonists passed laws that set out rules for slaves’ behavior and denied enslaved people basic human rights. These slave codes treated enslaved Africans and African Americans not as human beings but as property.
Most English colonists did not question the justice of owning enslaved Africans. They believed that black Africans, as a racial group, were inferior to white Europeans. The belief that one race is superior to another is called racism. Some colonists believed that they were helping enslaved Africans by teaching them Christianity.
A handful of colonists spoke out against the evils of slavery. In 1688, Quakers in Germantown, Pennsylvania, became the first group of colonists to call for an end to slavery.

Colonial Society
Society in Colonial Times
The Upper and Middle Social Classes At the top of society stood the gentry. The gentry included wealthy planters, merchants, ministers, successful lawyers, and royal officials. They could afford to dress in the latest fashions from London.
Below the gentry were the middle class. The middle class included farmers who worked their own land, skilled craft workers, and some tradespeople. Nearly three quarters of all white colonists belonged to the middle class. They prospered because land in the colonies was plentiful and easy to buy and because skilled work was in high demand and paid relatively well.
The Lower Social Classes The lowest social class included hired farmhands, indentured servants, and enslaved Africans and African Americans. Indentured servants signed contracts to work without wages for a period of four to seven years for anyone who would pay their ocean passage to the Americas. When their term of service was completed, indentured servants received “freedom dues : a set of clothes, tools, and 50 acres of land. Because there were so few European women in the colonies, female indentured servants often shortened their terms of service by marrying.

Thousands of men, women, and children came to North America as indentured servants. After completing their terms, some became successful and rose into the middle class.	I
Working Life in the Countryside From New Hampshire to Georgia, most colonists survived by farming. Men worked long hours planting crops, tending the fields, and raising livestock pigs, cows, and other farm animals. Anything beyond what the family needed to live was taken to markets to sell. Families also traded crops and livestock with their neighbors for additional goods.
While men typically did much of the agricultural work, women often worked within the home. They worked hard taking care of the household and the family. By the kitchen fire, they cooked the family s meals. They milked cows, tended chickens and a vegetable garden, watched the children, cleaned, did laundry by hand, and made candles, cheese, and i clothes.	;
Life was different in the backcountry, out beyond more settled lands. Life was difficult, and wives and husbands often worked side by side in the fields at harvest time. With so much to be done, no one worried whether harvesting was proper “woman’s work.” One , surprised visitor described a backcountry woman's activities: “She will carry a gunn in the woods and kill deer, turkeys &c., shoot down wild cattle, catch and tye hoggs, knock down [cattle] with an ax, and perform the most manfull Exercises as well as most men.”
Working Life in Cities In cities, women sometimes worked outside the home. A young single woman from a poorer family might work for one of the gentry as a maid, a cook, or a nurse. Other women were midwives, who delivered babies. Still others sewed fine hats or dresses to be sold to women who could afford them. Learning such skills often required years of training.
Some women learned trades from their fathers, brothers, or husbands. They worked as butchers, shoemakers, or silversmiths. Quite a few women became printers. A woman might take over her husband’s business when he died.
Men often worked in trades, for example as coopers (who made and repaired wooden barrels), blacksmiths, and silversmiths. Most large towns in the colonies were seaports, where merchants and traders brought goods to and from Europe. As this trade grew, more men also took on jobs as bankers, lawyers, and businessmen.
Some educated men in the colonies became politicians. Others were pamphleteers, who wrote and distributed small booklets informing people on a subject. There were many doctors in the colonies,
where illness was common. However, medical training varied. A surgeon might be a barber with little real medical training.
African Influences in the Colonies By the mid-
1700s, the culture of Africans and African Americans in the colonies varied greatly. On rice plantations in South Carolina, enslaved Africans used methods from West Africa for growing and harvesting rice. For example, flat baskets holding the grains were shaken in the wind to separate the grains from leaves and other particles. Then a wooden mortar and pestle were used to clean the grains.
Language is another area where African influences were strong. In some coastal areas, enslaved Africans spoke a distinctive combination of English and West African languages known as Gullah (gull uh). Parents often chose African names for their children, such as Quosh or Juba or Cuff.
In Charleston and other South Carolina port towns, some Africans worked along the dock, making rope or barrels or helping to build ships. Skilled crafts workers made fine wooden cabinets or silver plates and utensils. Many of their designs reflected African artistic styles. Although most Africans in these towns were enslaved, many opened their own shops or stalls in the market. Some used their earnings to buy their own and their family’s freedom.
In the Middle Colonies and New England, the African and African American population increased during the 1700s. Africans and African Americans in the northern colonies included both free and enslaved people. Their numbers were much lower than in the Southern Colonies. However, they were still an important part of the population.
In some of the Middle Colonies, such as New York, there were even plantations that relied on slave labor. Often, these plantations produced grains and meat for sale to feed enslaved workers in the Southern Colonies or the West Indies.

What was an indentured servant? Colonial Art, Literature, and Music
Colonists brought with them the artistic traditions of their homelands. New artistic styles also developed that reflected colonial society. Wealthy gentry decorated their homes with paintings of landscapes and religious art. Furniture, houses, and clothing were often decorated with intricate carvings or designs.
» Enslaved African-Amercians introduced new methods of harvesting and preparing different grains.
Art Reflects Colonial Society Paintings that celebrated important people of the time were especially popular works of art. Those who could afford it hired artists to paint portraits of their family members. These portraits showed off the family’s importance and provided a valuable keepsake to be passed on for generations to come. Portraits also honored famous individuals and key events. One of the oldest surviving colonial portraits is of New Netherland Governor Peter Stuyvesant, painted in the 1660s.
Prints were also popular in colonial families. These were small engravings scratched into metal or carved into wood. Printmakers used the metal or wood with ink, paper, and a press to make a picture that could be easily reproduced. Many people had prints of famous figures, such as politicians or clergymen.
Many artists were self-taught. Few became wealthy from their work. They often traveled from town to town in search of people who wanted portraits done. The paintings they left behind are like time capsules. Much like photographs do today, they show how people dressed, what their tastes were like, and how their families lived.
American Literature Emerges Literature also developed in the colonies. The first colonial printing press was built in Massachusetts in 1640. It printed

religious books and books for Harvard College. With the spread of printing, more colonists began to read.
Colonists read reprints of European books and books by American writers. One of the most popular— and particularly American—types of stories was the captivity tale. In these stories, a white settler was captured by Native Americans and had to overcome hardships in order to escape.
Colonial Music Music was another popular art form in the colonies. Colonists brought popular folk music from Europe. They sang and danced at weddings and other celebrations. Enslaved Africans brought musical traditions with them from Africa. These traditions combined with European traditions in musical forms such as work songs and spirituals, or religious songs.
Music was closely tied to religious life for many colonists. New organs appeared in churches. The hymns people sang grew especially popular during the Great Awakening.

What clues can we find about colonial lives in artwork such as paintings?
» With his fiery sermons, Jonathan Edwards, a New England preacher, helped spark the religious movement known as the Great Awakening.
A
New Religious Movement
In the 1730s and 1740s, a religious revival, or movement, known as the Great Awakening swept through the colonies. It is sometimes also known as the First Great Awakening to distinguish it from later religious revivals. Its drama and emotion touched women and men of all races, ethnic backgrounds, and classes.
Enthusiastic Preachers A New England preacher, Jonathan Edwards, helped set off the Great Awakening. In powerful sermons, Edwards called on colonists, especially young people, to examine their lives.
He preached of the sweetness and beauty of God. At the same time, he warned listeners to heed the Bible’s teachings. Otherwise, they would be “sinners in the hands of an angry God,” headed for the fiery torments of hell. The powerful sermons of preachers such as Edwards were one of the main causes of the Great Awakening.
In 1739, when an English minister named George Whitefield arrived in the colonies, the movement spread like wildfire. Whitefield drew huge crowds to outdoor meetings. An enthusiastic and energetic preacher, his voice would ring with feeling as he called on sinners to repent. After hearing Whitefield speak, Jonathan Edwards’s wife reported, “I have seen upwards of a thousand people hang on his words with breathless silence, broken only by an occasional half-suppressed sob.”
The Great Awakening’s Impact The colonies were made up of many different religious groups. There were Quakers, Puritans, Catholics, Presbyterians, and more. Each group had its own ideas about the proper relationship with God.
Some groups, like the Anglicans, disagreed strongly with Whitefield. Others, like the Baptists and Methodists, found new opportunities to expand during the Great Awakening as people revisited their faith.
The Great Awakening aroused bitter debate. People who supported the movement often split away from their old churches to form new ones. Opponents warned that the movement was too emotional. Still, the growth of so many new churches forced colonists to become more tolerant of people with different beliefs. Also, because the Great Awakening appealed to people in all of the colonies, from different classes and ethnic backgrounds, it brought colonists together for the first time. Ties formed during the Great Awakening helped form the groundwork for future bonds among the colonies.
In the colonies, members of most churches controlled their parishes. The role parishes played in local communities made people think about the importance of self-rule a key factor in the development of American democracy.
The Great Awakening contributed in another way to the spread of democratic feelings in the colonies. Many of the new preachers were not as well educated as most ministers. They argued that formal training was less important than a heart filled with the holy spirit. Such teachings encouraged a spirit of independence. Many believers felt more free to challenge authority when their liberties were at stake. People began to think differently about their political rights and their governments. They felt if they could figure out how to worship on their own and how to run their own churches, then they could govern themselves with those same virtues. Eventually, many of these colonists would challenge the authority of colonial governors and the English king.

How did the Great Awakening change how people thought about themselves and their political rights?
Colonial Schools and
Colleges
Among the colonists, New Englanders were the most concerned about education. Puritans taught that all people had a duty to study the Bible. If colonists did not learn to read, how would they fulfill this duty?
Public Schools in New England In 1642, the Massachusetts assembly passed a law ordering all parents to teach their children “to read and understand the principles of religion.” They also required all towns with 50 or more families to hire a schoolteacher. Towns with 100 or more families also had to set up a grammar school to prepare boys for college.
In this way, Massachusetts set up the first public schools, or schools supported by taxes. Public schools allowed both rich and poor children to receive an education.
The first New England schools had only one room for students of all ages. Parents paid the schoolteacher with corn, peas, or other foods. Each child was expected to bring a share of wood to burn in the stove. Students who forgot would find themselves seated in the coldest corner of the room!

private schools. Because pupils paid to attend, only wealthy families could afford to educate their children.
In the Southern Colonies, people often lived too far from one another to bring children together in one school building. Some planters hired tutors, or ? private teachers. The wealthiest planters sent their sons to school in England. As a rule, enslaved African Americans were denied education of any kind.
Apprenticeships and Dame Schools Boys whose parents wished them to learn a trade or craft served as apprentices (uh pren tis ez). An apprentice worked for a master to learn a trade or a craft.
For example, when a boy reached the age of 12 or 13, his parents might apprentice him to a master glassmaker. The young apprentice lived in the glassmaker’s home for six or seven years while learning the craft. The glassmaker gave the boy food and clothing. He was also supposed to teach his apprentice how to read and write and provide him with religions training.
In return, the apprentice worked without pay in the glassmaker’s shop and learned the skills he needed to set up his own shop. Boys were apprenticed in many trades, including papermaking, printing, and tanning (making leather).
In New England, most schools accepted only boys. However, some girls attended dame schools, or private schools run by women in their own homes. Other girls, though, usually learned skills from their mothers, who taught them to cook, make soap and candles, spin wool, weave, sew, and embroider. A few learned to read and write.
The Growth of Colleges In 1633, Puritan John Eliot spoke of the need for Massachusetts to establish an official college. Institutions of higher learning were held up as a way to promote European culture in the Americas. As Eliot cautioned, "if we no[u]rish not L[e] arning both church & common wealth will sinke.”
Harvard College opened in 1638 with 10 students. The goal of the college was to educate future ministers.
It was modeled after English schools, where students studied six days a week in Latin and Greek. It was open only to men.
By the late 1600s, however, Harvard graduates were moving away from the ministry. Some became physicians, public servants, or teachers. The College of William and Mary opened in Virginia to prepare men for the Anglican ministry. Yale College in Connecticut aimed to educate clergymen. Gradually, however, nine colleges opened over the following century and
expanded their areas of study. Students could learn other subjects, such as medicine and law.

New World of Ideas During the 1600s, European scientists began to use reason and logic instead of superstition to understand the world. They developed theories, and then performed experiments to test them. In doing so, they discovered many of the laws of nature. The English scientist Isaac Newton, for example, explained the law of gravity.
The Ideas of the Enlightenment European thinkers of the late 1600s and 1700s believed that reason and scientific methods could be applied to the study of society. They tried to discover the natural laws that governed human behavior. Because these thinkers believed in the light of human reason, the movement that they started is known as the Enlightenment. John Locke, an English philosopher, wrote works that were widely read in the colonies. He said people could gain knowledge of the world by observing and by experimenting.
In the English colonies, the Enlightenment spread among better educated colonists. They included wealthy merchants, lawyers, ministers, and others who had the leisure to read the latest books from Europe. Urban craftsmen also heard and discussed these ideas.
Benjamin Franklin Influences Daily Life The best example of the Enlightenment spirit in the English colonies was Benjamin Franklin. Franklin was born in 1706, the son of a poor Boston soap and candle maker. Although he had only two years of formal schooling, he used his spare time to study literature, mathematics, and foreign languages.
At age 17, Franklin made his way to Philadelphia. There, he built up a successful printing business. His most popular publication was Poor Richard's Almanack. Published yearly, it contained useful information and clever quotes, such as "Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.”
Like other Enlightenment thinkers, Franklin wanted to use reason to improve the world around him. He invented practical devices that helped improve daily life. For example, Franklin suffered from poor eyesight, so he invented bifocal glasses to help himself—and countless others—see better. Franklin also invented a new kind of iron stove. It was set in the middle of a room instead of in a wall, and it kept houses warmer without filling them with smoke. Another one of Franklins

dwellers found entertainment at singing societies, traveling circuses, carnivals, and horse races.
In 1704, John Campbell founded the Boston News-Letter, the first regular weekly newspaper in the English colonies. Within 50 years, each of the colonies, except New Jersey and Delaware, had at least one weekly paper.
John Peter Zenger’s Libel Trial The growth of colonial newspapers led to a dispute over freedom of the press. John Peter Zenger published the Weekly Journal in New York City. In 1734, he was arrested for publishing stories that criticized the governor. Zenger was put on trial for libel—the act of publishing a statement that may unjustly damage a person’s reputation. Zenger’s lawyer argued that, since the stories were true, his client had not committed libel. The jury agreed and freed Zenger. At the time, the case did not attract a great deal of attention. However, freedom of the press would become recognized as a basic American right.

The Influence of Colonial Cities and Towns While most colonists lived on farms, towns and cities strongly influenced colonial life. Through the great ports of Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and Charleston, merchants shipped products overseas.

Colonial Trade and Government
Mercantilism and the English Colonies
According to this theory, a nation could become strong by keeping strict control over its trade. As one English gentleman put it, “Whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world.”
Imports and Exports Mercantilists thought that a country should export more than it imported. Exports are goods sent to markets outside a country.
Imports are goods brought into a country. If England sold more goods than it bought abroad, gold would flow into the home country as payment for those exports.
The Navigation Acts Affect the Colonies Beginning in the 1650s, the English Parliament passed a series of Navigation Acts that regulated trade between England and its colonies. The purpose of these laws was to ensure that only England benefited from trade with its colonies.
Under the new laws, only colonial or English ships could carry goods to and from the colonies. Colonists were banned from trading directly

with other European nations or their colonies. All trade had to go through England. The Navigation Acts also listed certain products, such as tobacco and cotton, that colonial merchants could ship only to England. In this way, Parliament created jobs for English workers who cut and rolled tobacco or spun cotton into cloth.
The Navigation Acts helped the colonies as well as England. For example, the law encouraged colonists to build ships for their own use and for sale to England. As a result, New England became a prosperous shipbuilding center. Also, because of the acts, colonial merchants did not have to compete with foreign merchants because they were sure of having a market for their goods in England.
Still, many colonists resented the Navigation Acts. In their view, the laws favored English merchants. Colonial merchants often ignored the Navigation Acts or found ways to get around them.

Why did England pass the Navigation Acts?
Trading Across the
Atlantic
The colonies produced a wide variety of goods, and merchant ships sailed up and down the Atlantic coast. Merchants from New England dominated colonial trade.
They were known as Yankees, a nickname that implied they were clever and hardworking. Yankee traders earned a reputation for profiting from any deal.
The Triangular Trade Colonial merchants developed many trade routes. One route was known as the triangular trade because the three legs of the route formed a triangle. On the first leg, ships from New England carried rum, guns, gunpowder, cloth, and tools from New England to West Africa. In Africa, Yankee merchants traded these goods for slaves.
On the second leg of the journey, ships carried enslaved Africans to the West Indies. It was because enslaved Africans traveled on the second leg of a three-leg voyage that this leg was known as the Middle Passage. With the profits from selling the enslaved Africans, Yankee traders bought molasses—a dark-brown syrup made from sugar cane—and sugar.

and Government
Merchants Disregard the Navigation Acts Many New England merchants grew wealthy from the triangular trade. In doing so, they often disobeyed the Navigation Acts. Traders were supposed to buy sugar and molasses only from English colonies in the West Indies. However, the demand for molasses was so high that New Englanders smuggled in cargoes from the Dutch, French, and Spanish West Indies, too. Bribes made customs officials look the other way.
B CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why did many traders ignore the Navigation Acts and buy sugar and molasses from non-English colonies in the West Indies?
The Foundations
of Representative
Government
Although each colony developed its own government, the governments had much in common. A governor directed the colony’s affairs and enforced the laws. Most governors were appointed, either by the king or by the colony’s proprietor. In Rhode Island and Connecticut, however, colonists elected their own governors. Representative government and institutions spread in the colonies for several reasons.
Elected Assemblies As you learned, the Virginia Company decided to establish an elected assembly to attract more settlers. For this reason, and inspired by the English tradition of representative government outlined in the Magna Carta, all of the colonies gained a legislature soon after they were founded.
A legislature is a group of people, usually elected, who have the power to make laws. In most colonies, the legislature had an upper house and a lower house. The upper house was made up of advisers appointed by the governor.
The lower house was an elected assembly. It approved laws and protected the rights of citizens. Just as important, it had the right to approve or reject any taxes or budget items the governor asked for. This “power of the purse,” or right to raise or spend money, was an important check on the governor’s power. Any governor who ignored the assembly risked losing his salary.
As colonial settlers spread inland and founded new cities and towns, representative government and institutions grew. Most colonial cities and towns had their own city and town councils.
» John Archdale, a governor of the early Carolina colony, addresses the Carolina Assembly in 1696. Each colony gained its own legislature, or group of lawmakers.
Interactive Chart
The Right to Vote Each colony had its own rules about who could vote. By the 1720s, however, all of the colonies had laws that restricted the right to vote to white Christian men over the age of 21.
In some colonies, only Protestants or members of a particular church could vote. All colonies restricted the vote to men who owned a certain amount of property. Colonial leaders believed that only property owners knew what was best for a colony.
William Blackstone and Common Law The
colonies followed English common law. Under common law, laws develop from the past rulings of judges. In applying laws, courts followed the principle that "like cases should be tried alike.”
Colonists brought the tradition of common law with them from England. In the 1760s, William Blackstone published a four-volume book, Commentaries on the Laws of England. In it, Blackstone reviewed the entire history of English law. As a member of Parliament and a judge in England, he believed common law was the highest and best form of law.
Blackstone supported Parliament and opposed colonists' moves toward self-rule. However, his ideas about common law took hold in the colonies. Common

» This illustration shows a colonial woman in court. While unmarried women and widows had some legal rights, married women were legally dependent on their husbands.
law was a body of laws that was valid independent of Parliament’s acts. As such, it provided a basis for self-rule and an independent legal system once the colonies began to move toward independence.
The English Bill of Rights Supports Freedoms
Colonists took great pride in their elected assemblies. They also valued the rights that the Magna Carta gave them as English subjects.
Colonists won still more rights as a result of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Parliament removed King James II from the throne and asked William and Mary of the Netherlands to rule. In return for Parliament’s support, William and Mary signed the English Bill of Rights in 1689. A bill of rights is a written list of freedoms the government promises to protect.
The English Bill of Rights protected the rights of individuals and gave anyone accused of a crime the right to a trial by jury. Just as important, the English Bill of Rights said that a ruler could not raise taxes or an army without the approval of Parliament. The Bill of
Rights also strengthened the position of representative government and institutions in the colonies.
Liberties are Restricted English colonists in the Americas often enjoyed more freedoms than did the f English themselves. However, the rights of English citizens did not extend to all colonists. Women had more rights in the colonies than in England but far fewer rights than did free, white males. A woman's father or husband was supposed to protect her. A married woman could not start her own business or sign a contract unless her husband approved it.	}
In most colonies, unmarried women and widows had more rights than married women. They could make contracts and sue in court. In Maryland and the Carolinas, women settlers who headed families could buy land on the same terms as men.
African Americans and Native Americans in the colonies had almost no rights. While so many colonists * enjoyed English liberties, most African Americans were bound in slavery. The conflict between liberty and slavery would not be resolved until the 1860s.

The French and Indian War
Europeans Fight Over North American Land
The most serious threat came from France. It claimed a vast area that circled the English colonies from the St. Lawrence River west to the Great Lakes and south to the Gulf of Mexico. To protect their land claims, the French built an extensive system of forts. These forts blocked the British colonies from expanding to the west.
The Importance of the Ohio River Valley At first, most settlers in the British colonies were content to remain along the Atlantic coast. By the 1740s, however, traders were crossing the Appalachian Mountains in search of furs. Pushing into the forests of the Ohio Valley, which supported an abundance of wildlife, settlers tried to take over the profitable French trade with the Indians.
France was determined to stop the British from expanding westward. The Ohio River was especially important to the French because it provided a vital link between their claims along the Great Lakes and their settlements along the Mississippi River.

Ohio Valley Native Americans Choose Allies
Native Americans had hunted animals and grown crops in the Ohio Valley for centuries. They did not want to give up the land to European settlers, French or British. One Native American protested to a British trader, “You and the French are like the two edges of a pair of shears. And we are the cloth which is to be cut to pieces between them.”
Still, the growing conflict between Britain and France was too dangerous to ignore. Some Native Americans decided that the only way to protect their way of life was to take sides in the struggle.
The French expected the Indians to side with them. Most French in North America were trappers and traders. Generally, they did not destroy Indian hunting grounds by clearing forests for farms. Also, many French trappers married Native American women and adopted their ways. As a result, France had built strong alliances with such Native American groups as the Algonquins and the Hurons.
Many British settlers were farmers. These settlers usually ignored Indian rights by felling trees and clearing land for crops. However, an English trader and official, William Johnson, helped gain Iroquois support for Britain. The Iroquois respected Johnson. He was one of the few British settlers who had an Indian wife, Molly Brant. She was the sister of the Mohawk chief

Thayendanegea, known to the British as Joseph Brant. Both Joseph and Molly Brant became valuable allies for the British. The British also won Native American allies in the Ohio Valley by charging lower prices than the French for trade goods.
In the end, Britain managed to convince the powerful Iroquois nations to join with them. The British alliance was attractive to the Iroquois because they were old enemies of the Algonquin and the Huron peoples. The war reignited old conflicts in the Ohio Valley between the Iroquois and the Algonquins and Hurons. Some tribes, like the Shawnees, Delawares, and Mingos, formed alliances to push Europeans off their lands. More often, however, the alliances Native Americans formed with the British and the French pitted tribes against each other in the fighting to come.

Surprise Attacks in the Forests Braddock's men moved slowly and noisily through the forests. Although warned of danger by Washington and by Indian scouts, Braddock pushed ahead.
As the British neared Fort Duquesne, the French and their Indian allies launched a surprise attack. Sharpshooters hid in the forest and picked off British soldiers, whose bright red uniforms made easy targets.
Braddock himself had five horses shot out from under him before he fell, fatally wounded. Almost half the British were killed or wounded. Washington, too, was nearly killed.
British Setbacks at Lake Ontario and Lake George During the next two years, the war continued to go badly for the British. British attacks against several French forts failed. Meanwhile, the French won important victories, capturing Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario and Fort William Henry on Lake George. (Both forts occupied land that is now part of New York state.) All these defeats put a serious strain on the alliances with the Iroquois who had been counting on the British to protect them from the French. The Iroquois faced

increasing danger from enemy tribes, who fought them for prisoners and goods.

Quebec and New France Fall
In 1757, William Pitt became prime minister, meaning he was the new head of the British government. Pitt made it his first job to win the war in North America. Once that goal was achieved, he argued, the British would be free to focus on victory in other parts of the world. So Pitt sent Britain's best generals to North America. To encourage the colonists to support the war, he promised large payments for military services and supplies.
Under Pitt’s leadership, the tide of battle turned.
In 1758, Major General Jeffrey Amherst captured Louisbourg, the most important fort in French Canada. That year, the British also seized Fort Duquesne, which they renamed Fort Pitt after the British leader. The city of Pittsburgh later grew up on the site of Fort Pitt.
The War Turns in Favor of the British The British enjoyed even greater success in 1759. By summer, they had pushed the French from Fort Niagara, Crown Point, and Fort Ticonderoga (ty kahn duh ROH guh). Next, Pitt sent General James Wolfe to take Quebec, capital of New France.

Climbing Cliffs to Attack Quebec Quebec was vital to the defense of New France. Without Quebec, the French could not supply their forts farther up the St. Lawrence River. Quebec was well defended, though. ! The city sat on the edge of the Plains of Abraham, ; on top of a steep cliff high above the St. Lawrence. An , able French general, the Marquis de Montcalm, was / prepared to fight off any British attack.
General Wolfe devised a bold plan to capture Quebec. He knew that Montcalm had only a few soldiers guarding the cliff because the French thought that it was too steep to climb. Late at night, Wolfe ordered British troops to row quietly in small boats to , the foot of the cliff. In the dark, the soldiers swarmed ashore, climbed up the cliff, and assembled at the top.
The next morning, Montcalm awakened to a surprise. A force of 4,000 British troops was drawn up and ready for battle on the Plains of Abraham.
Quickly, Montcalm marched his own troops out to join in battle. By the time the fierce fighting was over, both Montcalm and Wolfe lay dead. Moments before

Wolfe died, a soldier gave him the news that the British had won. Wolfe is said to have whispered, "Now, God be praised, I will die in peace.” On September 18, 1759, Quebec surrendered to the British.
British Make Huge Gains The fall of Quebec sealed the fate of New France, though fighting dragged on in Europe for several more years. Finally, in 1763, Britain and France signed the Treaty of Paris, bringing the long conflict to an end.
The Treaty of Paris marked the end of French power in North America. By its terms, Britain gained Canada and all French lands east of the Mississippi River except New Orleans. France was allowed to keep only two islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and its prosperous sugar-growing islands in the West Indies. Spain, which had entered the war on the French side in 1762, gave up Florida to Britain.
In return, Spain received all French land west of the Mississippi. In addition, Spain gained the vital port city of New Orleans. Spain retained control of its vast empire in Central America and South America.

3.1 The French and Indian War
By 1760, the British and their Indian allies had driven France from the Ohio Valley. Their troubles in the region were not over, however. For many years, fur traders had sent back glowing reports of the land beyond the Appalachian Mountains. The dense forests of the Ohio Valley offered new resources that were in short supply in the East, and with the French gone, British colonists wanted to head west to claim the lands for themselves.
The British Secure the Frontier Later that year, Pontiac led an attack on British troops at Fort Detroit. A number of other Indian nations joined him. In a few short months, they captured most British forts in the Ohio country. British and colonial troops then struck back and regained much of what they had lost.
Pontiac’s War, as it came to be called, did not last long. In October 1763, the French told Pontiac that they had signed the Treaty of Paris. Because the treaty marked the end of French power in North America, the Indians could no longer hope for French aid against the British. One by one, the Indian nations stopped fighting and returned home.

Conflict Over Land
Conflicts in the Ohio Valley Many Native American nations lived * in the Ohio Valley. They included the Senecas, Delawares, Shawnees, Ottawas, Miamis, and Hurons. As British settlers moved into the valley, they often clashed with these Native Americans.
In 1760, the British made Lord Jeffrey Amherst military commander and governor general of its North American colonies. The British sent Amherst to the frontier to keep order. French traders had always treated > Native Americans as friends, holding feasts for them and giving them presents. Amherst refused to do this. Instead, he raised the price of goods traded to Indians. Also, unlike the French, Amherst allowed settlers to build farms and forts on Indian lands.
Angry Native Americans found a leader in Pontiac, an Ottawa chief who had fought on the French side during the French and Indian War. l> An English trader remarked that Pontiac “commands more respect ' amongst these nations than any Indian I ever saw.” In April 1763, Pontiac spoke out against the British, calling them “dogs dressed in red, who have come to rob [us] of [our] hunting grounds and drive away the game.” Pontiac led violent raids against British forts. Hundreds of British were tortured and killed, leading some officials to fear for the safety of colonists near Native American land.	\
Causes of the American Revolution—The Proclamation of 1763
Pontiac’s violent raids against British troops convinced officials that they should prevent British subjects from settling beyond the western frontier for their own safety. To do this, the government issued the Proclamation of 1763. The proclamation drew an imaginary line along the crest of the Appalachian Mountains. Colonists were forbidden to settle west of the line. All settlers already west of the line were “to remove themselves” at once.
The Purposes of the Proclamation The proclamation was meant to protect Indians in the western lands. To enforce it, Britain sent 10,000 troops to the colonies. Few troops went to the frontier, however. Most stayed in cities along the Atlantic coast.
The proclamation also created four new places where colonists could settle. French Canada became part of the province of Quebec. Florida, once a Spanish colony, was divided into East and West Florida. British territories in the Caribbean became the province of Granada.

Indian War, many colonists felt they had rights to the land.
Also, colonists now had to pay for the additional British troops that had been sent to enforce the proclamation. In the end, many settlers simply ignored the proclamation and moved west anyway. The proclamation remained most controversial in the west, where colonists clashed with Native Americans. Some colonies, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, claimed lands in the west. The Proclamation would continue to cause problems up to the American Revolution from the tension it caused between the colonists and Britain.
One colonist who defied the Proclamation of 1763 was Daniel Boone. In 1767, Boone visited Kentucky, west of the Appalachians. In 1769, he began what became a two-year journey of exploration through Kentucky. He traveled as far as the Falls of the Ohio, the site of the present-day city of Louisville. Later, he led settlers through the Cumberland Gap along an old Indian path. During his travels, Boone fought a number of battles against the Indians and was taken captive for a short period.

The Revolutionary Era 115	3.2 Tensions with Britain
Causes of the American Revolution—Mercantilism and Taxation
The Seven Years’ War, which included the French and Indian War, plunged Britain deeply into debt. As a result, the taxes paid by citizens in Britain rose sharply. The British prime minister, George Grenville, decided that colonists in North America should help share the burden. In a mercantilist system, colonies were expected to serve the colonial power. Grenville reasoned that the colonists would not oppose small tax increases. The colonists, however, strongly resented these taxes. They argued that mercantilism was unfair because it limited trade and made goods more expensive. Many colonists also objected that the power to raise these new taxes was not granted by the English constitution. Grenville’s policy led to the political and economic conflicts that would divide the colonies and England.
The Sugar Act Taxes the Colonies In 1764, Grenville asked Parliament to approve the Sugar Act, which put a new tax on molasses. The Sugar Act replaced an earlier tax, which had been so high that any merchant who paid it would have been driven out of business. As a

result, most colonial merchants simply avoided the tax by smuggling molasses into the colonies. Often, they bribed tax collectors to look the other way.
The Sugar Act of 1764 lowered the tax. At the same time, the law made it easier for British officials to bring colonial smugglers to trial. Grenville made it clear that he expected the new tax to be paid.

What arguments did the colonists have against more British taxes?
Causes of the American Revolution—The Stamp Act
Grenville also persuaded Parliament to pass the Stamp Act of 1765. The act placed new duties (taxes) on legal documents such as wills, diplomas, and marriage papers. It also taxed newspapers, almanacs, playing cards, and even dice.
All items named in the law had to carry a stamp showing that the tax had been paid. Stamp taxes were used in Britain and other countries to raise money. However, Britain had never required American colonists to pay such a tax.
Resistance to the Stamp Act When British officials tried to enforce the Stamp Act, they met with stormy protests from colonists. Lieutenant Governor Hutchinson’s house in Massachusetts was looted by a mob. He was not the only official to feel the mob’s anger. Some colonists threw rocks at agents trying to collect the unpopular tax.
In addition to riots in Boston, other disturbances broke out in New York City, Newport, and Charleston. In New York City, rioters destroyed the home of a British official who had said he would “cram the stamps down American throats” at the point of his sword.
The fury of the colonists shocked the British. After all, Britain had spent a great deal of money to protect the colonies against the French. The British at home were paying much higher taxes than the colonists. Why, British officials asked, were colonists so angry about the Stamp Act? As one English letter-writer commented,
Our Colonies must be the biggest Beggars in the World, if such small Duties appear to be intolerable Burdens in their Eyes.
—“Pacificus,” Maryland Gazette, March 20, 1766
3.2 Tensions with Britain
The Revolutionary Era H6
Lack of Representation in Parliament Colonists replied that the Stamp Act taxes were unjust and unnecessary. No taxation without representation!” they cried. That principle was rooted in English traditions dating back to the Magna Carta.
Colonists insisted that only they or their elected representatives had the right to pass taxes. Since the colonists did not elect representatives to Parliament, Parliament had no right to tax them. The colonists were willing to pay taxes—but only if the taxes were passed by their own colonial legislatures. They also felt that mercantilist policies like the Navigation Acts were unfair because they restricted their trade, which negatively affected colonists’ income.
Peaceful Protests Lead Toward Revolution The
Stamp Act crisis united colonists from New Hampshire to Georgia. Critics of the law called for delegates from every colony to meet in New York City. There, a congress would form to consider actions against the hated Stamp Act.
In October 1765, nine colonies sent delegates to what became known as the Stamp Act Congress. The delegates drew up petitions to King George III and to Parliament. A petition is a formal written request to someone in authority, signed by a group of people. In these petitions, the delegates rejected the Stamp Act and asserted that Parliament had no right to tax the colonies. Parliament paid little attention.
The colonists took other steps to change the law. They joined together to boycott British goods. To boycott means to refuse to buy certain goods and services. The boycott of British goods took its toll. Trade fell off by 14 percent. British merchants complained that they were facing ruin. So, too, did British workers who made goods for the colonies.
The colonists wanted the government to have less of a say over businesses and trade. They wanted a free-enterprise system, in which the market, rather than the government, determines what goods and services cost. British taxes, the colonists argued, unfairly restricted economic growth.
Finally, in 1766, Parliament repealed, or canceled, the Stamp Act. At the same time, however, it passed a law asserting that Parliament had the right to raise taxes in “all cases whatsoever.”

Causes of the American Revolution—Townshend Acts
In May 1767, Parliament reopened the debate over taxing the colonies. In a fierce exchange, George Grenville, now a member of Parliament, clashed with Charles Townshend, the official in charge of the British treasury.
“You are cowards, you are afraid of the Americans, you dare not tax America!” Grenville shouted.
"Fear? Cowards?” Townshend snapped back. “I dare tax America!”
The next month, Parliament passed the Townshend Acts, which taxed goods such as glass, paper, paint, lead, and tea. The taxes were low, but colonists still objected. The principle was the same: Parliament did not have the right to tax them without their consent.
Searches Without Reason Cause Unrest The
Townshend Acts also set up new ways to collect taxes. Customs officials were sent to American ports with orders to stop smuggling. Using legal documents known as writs of assistance, the officers would

be allowed to inspect a ship’s cargo without giving a reason.
Colonists protested that the writs of assistance violated their rights as British citizens. Under British law, a government official could not search a person’s property without a good reason for suspecting that the person had committed a crime. Yet the writs of assistance allowed persons and their property to be searched and even seized without reason in the colonies. Colonists angrily cited the words of James Otis of Massachusetts. Arguing against a British attempt to impose writs of assistance six years earlier, he had said:
Now, one of the most essential branches of English liberty is the freedom of one’s house. A man’s house is his castle; and while he is quiet, he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle. This writ, if it should be declared legal, would totally destroy this privilege. Customhouse officers may enter our houses when they	,

■—James Otis, Febiuaiy 24, 1761	;
Colonists Rebel Against British Economic Policies Colonists responded swiftly and strongly to ) the Townshend Acts. From north to south, colonial merchants and planters signed agreements promising to stop importing goods taxed by the Townshend Acts. The colonists hoped that the new boycott would win repeal of the Townshend Acts.
To protest British policies, some angry colonists formed the Sons of Liberty. From Boston to Charleston, | Sons of Liberty staged mock hangings of cloth or straw effigies, or likenesses, dressed as British officials. The hangings were meant to show tax collectors what might happen to them if they tried to collect the unpopular taxes.
Some women joined the Daughters of Liberty. They paraded, signed petitions, and organized a boycott of fine British cloth. They urged colonial women to raise more sheep, prepare more wool, and spin and weave their own cloth. A slogan of the Daughters of Liberty declared, “It is better to wear a Homespun coat than to lose our Liberty.”
Some Sons and Daughters of Liberty also used other methods to support their cause. They visited merchants
and urged them to boycott British imports. A few even threatened people who continued to buy British goods.

Significant Individuals Provide Colonial Leadership
As the struggle over taxes continued, new leaders emerged in all the colonies. Men and women in New England and Virginia were especially active in the colonial cause.
Massachusetts Citizens Fight for Their Beliefs Samuel Adams of Boston stood firmly against Britain. Sam Adams seemed an unlikely leader. He was a failure in business and a poor public speaker. Often, he wore a red suit and a cheap gray wig for which people poked fun at him. Still, Adams loved politics. He always attended Boston town meetings and Sons of Liberty rallies. Adams’s real talent was organizing people. He worked behind the scenes, arranging protests and stirrrng public support.
Sam's cousin John was another important Massachusetts leader. John Adams had been a schoolteacher before becoming a skilled lawyer. Adams longed for fame and could often be difficult. Still, he was more cautious than his cousin Sam. He weighed evidence carefully before taking any actions. His knowledge of British law earned him much respect.
Mercy Otis Warren also aided the colonial cause. Warren wrote plays that made fun of British officials. The plays were published in newspapers and widely read in the colonies. Warren formed a close friendship with Abigail Adams, the wife of John Adams. The two women used their pens to spur the colonists to action. They also called for greater rights for women in the colonies.
Virginians Join the Cause Virginia contributed many leaders to the struggle against taxes. In the House of Burgesses, George Washington joined other Virginians to protest the Townshend Acts.
A young lawyer, Patrick Henry, became well known as a vocal critic of British policies. His speeches in the House of Burgesses moved listeners to both tears and anger. Once, Henry attacked Britain with such fury that some listeners cried out, “Treason!” Henry boldly replied, "If this be treason, make the most of it! ’ Henry s

How did some colonists show leadership? The Boston Massacre
Port cities such as Boston and New York were centers of protest. In New York, a dispute arose over the Quartering Act. Under that law, colonists had to provide housing, candles, bedding, and beverages to soldiers stationed in the colonies. The colonists did not want to house the soldiers. Many, including Sam Adams, did not think the soldiers should be stationed in the colonies at all during peacetime. When the New York assembly refused to obey the Quartering Act, Britain dismissed the assembly in 1767.
Britain also sent two regiments to Boston to protect customs officers from local citizens. To many Bostonians, the soldiers were a daily reminder that Britain was trying to bully them into paying unjust taxes. When British soldiers walked along the streets of Boston, they risked insults or even beatings. A serious clash was not long in coming.

Crowd Challenges British Soldiers On the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd gathered outside the Boston customs house. Colonists shouted insults at the “lobsterbacks,” as they called the red-coated British who guarded the building. Then the Boston crowd began to throw snowballs, oyster shells, and chunks of ice at the soldiers.
The crowd grew larger and rowdier. Suddenly, the soldiers panicked. They fired into the crowd. When the smoke from the musket volley cleared, five people lay dead or dying. Among the first to die were Samuel Maverick, a 17-year-old white youth, and Crispus Attucks, a free black sailor.
Colonists were quick to protest the incident, which they called the Boston Massacre. A Boston silversmith named Paul Revere fanned anti-British feeling with an engraving that showed British soldiers firing on unarmed colonists. Sam Adams wrote letters to other colonists to build outrage about the shooting.
The soldiers were arrested and tried in court. John Adams agreed to defend them, saying that they deserved a fair trial. He wanted to show the world that the colonists believed in justice, even if the British government did not. At the trial, Adams argued that the crowd had provoked the soldiers. His arguments convinced the jury. In the end, the heaviest punishment any soldier received was a branding on the hand.
Samuel Adams later expanded on the idea of a letter-writing campaign by forming a committee of correspondence. Members of the committee regularly wrote letters and pamphlets reporting to other colonies on events in Massachusetts. Within three months, there were 80 committees organized in Massachusetts. Before long, committees of correspondence became a major tool of protest in every colony.
The King Repeals Most Colonial Taxes By
chance, on the very day of the Boston Massacre, a bill was introduced into Parliament to repeal most of the Townshend Acts. British merchants, harmed by the American boycott of British goods, had again pressured Parliament to end the taxes. The Quartering Act was repealed and most of the taxes that had angered the Americans were ended. However, King George III asked Parliament to retain the tax on tea. “There must always be one tax to keep up the right [to tax],” he argued. Parliament agreed.
News of the repeal delighted the colonists. Most people dismissed the remaining tax on tea as unimportant and ended their boycott of British goods. For a few years, calm returned. Yet the basic issue—Britain’s power to tax the colonies—remained unsettled. The debate over taxes had forced the

The calm between the colonies and England did not last long. Economic and political disputes continued, this time over a simple drink. Tea was tremendously popular in the colonies.

The Boston Tea Party
Mercantilist Policies Lead to the Tea Act Since the 1720s Parliament had given the British East India Company exclusive rights to sell tea to the American colonies. Parliament protected this by mandating that tea sold to the colonies had to be shipped to England first so taxes could be paid. Then the tea was shipped to colonial tea merchants for sale in the American colonies.
This system met resistance due to the taxation of tea in the American colonies. Remember, to maintain its authority over the colonies, Parliament had kept a tax on tea when repealing the Townshend Acts. The tax was a small one, but colonists resented it. As a result, many colonists refused to buy British tea. Also, the colonists were able to get cheaper tea directly from Dutch and French traders who smuggled it to American merchants.
In the 1770s, the British East India Company found itself in deep financial trouble, due in part to dwindling tea sales in the American colonies. As a result, more than 15 million pounds of tea sat unsold in British warehouses.
Parliament tried to help the British East India Company by passing the Tea Act of 1773. The act let the company bypass colonial tea merchants and sell directly to colonists.
The Tea Act also gave the British E ast India Company a rebate on tea taxes. Although colonists would still have to pay the tea tax, they would not have to pay the higher price charged by colonial tea merchants. As a result, the tea itself would cost less than ever before. Parliament hoped this would encourage Americans to buy more British tea.
To the surprise of Parliament, colonists protested the Tea Act. Many colonists were opposed to British mercantilist policies that were supposed to generate wealth for England by taxing the colonies. However, American tea merchants were especially angry because they had been cut out of the tea trade. They believed that allowing the government-sponsored British East India Company to sell tea to Americans violated their right to conduct free enterprise.
Even tea drinkers, who would have benefited from the law, scorned the Tea Act. They believed that it was a British trick to make them accept Parliament’s right to tax the colonies.
A
Boycott Against Tea Once again, colonists responded to the new law with a boycott. A Philadelphia poet, Hannah Griffitts, urged American women to: Stand firmly resolved and bid
Grenville to see That rather than freedom we part with our tea, And well as we love the dear drink when a-dry, As American patriots our taste we deny.
■.Hannah Griffitts in Milcah Martha Moore’s
Daughters of Liberty and women like Griffitts led the boycott. They served coffee or made “liberty tea” from raspberry leaves. At some ports, Sons of Liberty enforced the boycott by keeping the British East India Company from unloading cargoes of tea.
An Act of Civil Disobedience Three ships loaded with tea reached Boston Harbor in late November 1773. The colonial governor of Massachusetts, Thomas Hutchinson, insisted that they unload their cargo as usual.
Sam Adams and the Sons of Liberty had other plans. On the night of December 16, they met in Old South Meeting House. They sent a message to the governor, demanding that the ships leave the harbor. When the governor rejected the demand, Adams stood up and declared, “This meeting can do nothing further to save the country.”

Adams’s words seemed to be a signal. As if on cue, a group of men in Indian disguises burst into the meetinghouse. From the gallery above, voices cried, “Boston harbor a teapot tonight! The Mohawks are come!”
The disguised colonists left the meetinghouse and headed for the harbor. Others joined them along the way. Under a nearly full moon, the men boarded the ships, split open the tea chests, and dumped the tea into the harbor.
By 10 P.M., the Boston Tea Party, as it was later called, was over. The contents of 342 chests of tea floated in Boston Harbor. The next day John Adams wrote about the event in his diary.
This destruction of the tea is so bold, so daring, so firm ... it must have such important and lasting results that I can’t help considering it a turning point in history.

The Boston Tea Party was an important act of civil disobedience. Civil disobedience is the nonviolent refusal to obey laws that one considers unjust. The colonists had many reasons for this act of civil

disobedience. They wanted to voice their discontent to the British without hurting anyone. They also wanted to stop the tea from entering Boston. The impact of their civil disobedience was perhaps greater than they had expected. Harsh punishment would come from Britain.

Why were many colonists dissatisfied with the Tea Act? King George III Strikes Back at Boston
Colonists had mixed reactions to the Boston Tea Party. Some cheered it as a firm protest against unfair British laws. Others worried that it would encourage lawlessness in the colonies. Even those who condemned the Boston Tea Party, though, were shocked at Britain’s harsh response to it. The unrest in Boston and the British reaction to the Tea Party would be yet another cause of the Revolution.

lawless behavior. In 1774, Parliament, encouraged by King George III, acted to punish Massachusetts.
Colonists called the four laws they passed the Intolerable Acts because they were so harsh. These Acts pushed the colonists closer to revolution.
First, Parliament shut down the port of Boston. No ship could enter or leave the harbor—not even a small boat. The harbor would remain closed until the colonists paid for the tea they had destroyed in the Boston Tea Party and repaid British officials, such as Thomas Hutchinson, for damage to personal property. Boston’s harbor was central to the life of the city. With the closing of the port, merchants could not sell their goods and the colony’s economy suffered.
Second, Parliament forbade Massachusetts colonists to hold town meetings more than once a year without the governor’s permission. In the past, colonists had called town meetings whenever they wished. Public officials would now be selected by the king's governor rather than be elected by citizens.
Third, Parliament allowed customs officers and other officials who might be charged with major crimes to be tried in Britain or Canada instead of in Massachusetts. Colonists protested. They argued that a dishonest official could break the law in the colonies and avoid punishment by being tried before a sympathetic jury.
Fourth, Parliament passed a new Quartering Act. No longer would redcoats camp in tents on Boston Common. Instead, colonists would have to house British soldiers in their homes when no other housing was available. Colonists viewed this act as yet another tax, because they had to house and feed the soldiers. Many objected to having the British army stationed in the colonies at all.
The Quebec Act Redraws North American Borders About the same time, Parliament also passed the Quebec Act. It set up a government for Canada and gave complete religious freedom to French Catholics. The Quebec Act also extended the borders of Quebec to include the land between the Ohio and Missouri rivers. The act pleased French Canadians. The American colonists were angry, however, because some of the colonies claimed ownership of these lands.
The Intolerable Acts Draw Other Colonies into the Struggle The committees of correspondence spread news of the Intolerable Acts to other colonies. They warned that the people of Boston faced hunger while their port was closed. People from other colonies responded quickly. Carts rolled into the city with rice from South Carolina, corn from Virginia, and flour from Pennsylvania.

3.3 Taking Up Arms
In the Virginia assembly, Thomas Jefferson suggested that a day be set aside to mark the shame of the Intolerable Acts. The royal governor of Virginia rejected the idea. The colonists went ahead anyway. On June 1, 1774, church bells tolled slowly. Merchants closed their shops. Many colonists prayed and fasted all day.
In September 1774, colonial leaders called a meeting in Philadelphia. Delegates from 12 colonies gathered in what became known as the First Continental Congress. Only Georgia did not send delegates.
After much debate, the delegates passed a resolution backing Massachusetts in its struggle. They agreed to boycott all British goods and to stop exporting goods to Britain until the Intolerable Acts were repealed. The delegates also urged each colony to set up and train its own militia (mih LISH uh). A militia is an army of citizens who serve as soldiers during an emergency.
Before leaving Philadelphia, the delegates agreed to meet again in May 1775. Little did they suspect that before then, an incident in Massachusetts would change the fate of the colonies forever.

The Battles of Lexington and Concord
In Massachusetts, colonists were already preparing to resist. Newspapers called on citizens to prevent what they called “the Massacre of American Liberty.” Volunteers known as minutemen trained regularly. Minutemen got their name because they kept their muskets at hand and were prepared to fight at a minute’s notice. In towns near Boston, minutemen collected weapons and gunpowder. Meanwhile, Britain built up its forces. More troops arrived in Boston, bringing the total number of British soldiers in that city to 4,000.
Early in 1775, General Thomas Gage, the British commander, sent scouts to towns near Boston. They reported that minutemen had a large store of arms in Concord, a village about 18 miles from Boston. Gage planned a surprise march to Concord to seize the arms.
The Redcoats Cross the Charles River On April 18, about 700 British troops quietly left Boston in the darkness. Their goal was to seize the colonial arms. The Sons of Liberty were watching. As soon as the British set out, the Americans hung two lamps from the Old North Church in Boston. This signal meant that the redcoats were crossing the Charles River. The British
had decided to cross the river rather than take a much longer route toward Concord by land.
Colonists who were waiting across the Charles River saw the signal. Messengers mounted their horses and galloped through the night toward Concord. One midnight rider was Paul Revere. “The redcoats are coming! The redcoats are coming!” shouted Revere as he passed through each sleepy village along the way.
Fighting in Lexington and Concord At daybreak on April 19, the redcoats reached Lexington, a town near Concord. On the village green, some 70 minutemen were waiting, commanded by Captain John Parker. The British ordered the minutemen to go home. Outnumbered, the colonists began to leave.
Suddenly, a shot rang out through the chill morning air. No one knows who fired it. In the brief struggle that followed, eight colonists were killed.
The British pushed on to Concord. Finding no arms in the village, they turned back to Boston. On a bridge outside Concord, they met approximately 300 minutemen. Again, fighting broke out. This time, the British were forced to retreat because the minutemen used the geography of the region to their advantage. As the redcoats withdrew, colonial sharpshooters took deadly aim at them from the woods and fields and then took cover there, making it difficult for the British
The Revolutionary Era 125	3.3 Taking Up Arms
soldiers to fire back. Local women also fired at the British from the windows of their homes. By the time they reached Boston, the redcoats had lost 73 men. Another 200 British soldiers were wounded or missing.
News of the battles of Lexington and Concord spread swiftly. To many colonists, the fighting ended all hope of a peaceful settlement. Only war would decide the future of the 13 colonies.
More than 60 years after the battles of Lexington and Concord, a well-known New England writer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, wrote a poem honoring the minutemen. Emerson’s “Concord Hymn” created a vivid picture of the clash at Concord. It begins:
By the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood, And fired the shot heard round the world.
—Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Concord Hymn,” 1837
The “embattled farmers” would have years of difficult fighting in front of them. Lexington and Concord marked the beginning of the Revolutionary War.
The war and disagreements between the American colonists and the British prior to the war represent
the era called the American Revolution, the period of struggle to achieve independence from Britain.
Q CHECK UNDERSTANDING
How were the minutemen able to beat the British at Concord? The Fighting Continues
Just a few weeks after the battles at Lexington and Concord, on May 10, 1775, colonial delegates met at the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. The delegates represented the 13 British colonies from New Hampshire to Georgia. Most of the delegates still hoped to avoid a final break with Britain. However, while they were meeting, the fighting spread.
King George III Rejects Peace After much debate, the delegates sent a petition to King George. In the Olive Branch Petition, they declared their loyalty to the king and asked him to repeal the Intolerable Acts.
George III was furious when he heard about the petition. The colonists, he raged, were trying to begin a war “for the purpose of establishing an independent empire!” The king vowed to bring the rebels to justice. He ordered 20,000 more troops to the colonies to crush the revolt.
Congress did not learn of the king’s response until months later. But even before the petition was sent,

leaders like John and Sam Adams were convinced that war could not be avoided.
Vermont Rebels Gain a Route to Canada Ethan Allen, a Vermont blacksmith, did not wait for Congress to act. Allen decided to lead a band of Vermonters, known as the Green Mountain Boys, in a surprise attack on Fort Ticonderoga, located at the southern tip of Lake Champlain. Allen knew that the fort held cannons that the colonists could use, and its strategic location would help colonists control the region.
In early May, the Green Mountain Boys crept quietly through the morning mists to Fort Ticonderoga. They quickly overpowered the guard on duty and entered the fort. Allen rushed to the room where the British commander slept. “Come out, you old rat!” he shouted. The commander demanded to know by whose authority Allen acted. “In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!” Allen replied.
The British commander surrendered Ticonderoga. With the fort, the Green Mountain Boys won a valuable supply of cannons and gunpowder. Allen’s success also gave Americans control of a key route into Canada.
George Washington Takes Command In the
meantime, the Second Continental Congress had to decide what to do about the makeshift army gathering around Boston. In June, delegates took the bold step of setting up the Continental Army. They appointed George Washington of Virginia as commander.
Washington knew that he would be fighting against one of the world’s toughest armies. Still, he was willing to do his best. He set off at once to take charge of the forces around Boston.

Ticonderoga important to the colonists?
Opposing Sides at War
The colonists who favored war against Britain called themselves Patriots. They thought British rule was harsh and unjust. About one third of the colonists were Patriots, one third sided with the British, and one third did not take sides.
Washington Leads the Patriots The Patriots entered the war with many disadvantages. Colonial forces were poorly organized and untrained. They had few cannons, little gunpowder, and no navy. Also, few colonists were willing to enlist in the Continental Army for long terms of service. They preferred to fight near home, as part of o local militia.

The Revolutionary Era 127	3.3 Taking Up Arms
Yet, the Patriots also had advantages. Many Patriots owned rifles and were good shots. Their leader, George Washington, had experience and developed into an able commander. Furthermore, Patriots were determined to fight to defend their homes and property. Reuben Stebbins of Massachusetts was typical of many patriotic farmers. When the British approached, he rode off to battle. "We'll see who’s going t’own this farm!” he cried.
British Advantages and Disadvantages The
British were a powerful foe. They had highly trained, experienced troops. Their navy was the best in the world. In addition, many colonists supported the British.
Still, Britain faced problems. Its armies were 3,000 miles from home. News and supplies took months to travel from Britain to North America. Also, British soldiers risked attacks by colonists once they marched out of the cities into the countryside.
Loyalists Favor the King American colonists who remained loyal to Britain were known as Loyalists. They included wealthy merchants and former officials of the royal government. However, some farmers and crafts workers were also Loyalists. There were more

B IDENTIFY
What positions did colonists take in regards to the war as it began? The War Comes to Boston
During the first year of conflict, much of the fighting centered around Boston. About 6,000 British troops were stationed there. Colonial militia surrounded the city and prevented the British from marching out.
War Breaks Out Near Boston Harbor Even before Washington reached Boston, the Patriots took action. On June 16, 1775, Colonel William Prescott led 1,200 minutemen up Bunker Hill, across the Charles River from Boston. From there, they could fire on British ships in Boston Harbor. Prescott, however, noticed that nearby Breed’s Hill was an even better place to use the local geography to his advantage. A hilltop would be easier to defend, so he ordered his men to move there.
At sunrise, the British general, William Howe, spotted the Americans. He ferried about 2,400 redcoats across the river to attack the rebels’ position. As the British approached, the Patriots held their fire.
When the Americans finally fired, the British were forced to retreat. A second British attack was also turned back. On the third try, the British pushed over the top. They took both Bunker Hill and Breed’s Hill, but they paid a high price for their victory. More than 1,000 redcoats lay dead or wounded. American losses numbered only about 400.
The Battle of Bunker Hill was the first major battle of the Revolution. It proved that the Americans could fight bravely. It also showed that the British would not be easy to defeat. Furthermore, it hinted that one effect of the Revolution would be continued bloodshed from a long and bitter war.
Washington Forces the British out of Boston
When Washington reached Boston a few weeks after the Battle of Bunker Hill, he found about 16,000 troops camped in huts and tents around the city.
General Washington quickly began to turn raw recruits into a trained army. His job was especially difficult because soldiers from different colonies mistrusted one another. “Connecticut wants no

Massachusetts men in her corps,” he wrote. And “Massachusetts thinks there is no necessity for a Rhode Islander to be introduced into her [ranks].” However, Washington won the loyalty of his troops. They, in turn, learned to take orders and work together.
In January 1776, Washington had a stroke of good fortune. The cannons that the Green Mountain Boys had captured at Fort Ticonderoga arrived in Boston. Soldiers had dragged them across the mountains from Fort Ticonderoga. Washington had the cannons placed in a strategic location on Dorchester Heights, overlooking the harbor.
Once General Howe saw the American cannons in place, he knew that he could not hold Boston. In March 1776, he and his troops sailed from Boston to Halifax, Canada. About 1,000 American Loyalists went with them.
Although the British left New England, they did not give up. King George III ordered a blockade of all colonial ports. A blockade is the shutting of a port to keep people or supplies from moving in or out. The king also used mercenaries, or troops for hire, from Germany to help fight the colonists.

By 1776, many colonists had come to believe that Parliament did not have the right to make laws for the 13 colonies. After all, they argued, the colonists had their own elected legislatures. Some thought it was time for the colonies to become independent from Britain. At the same time, however, most colonists still felt a bond of loyalty to Britain. They especially felt that they owed allegiance to the king.

Thomas Paine's Common Sense
Thomas Paine was a British writer and editor who moved to Philadelphia in 1774. After Lexington and Concord, Paine wrote the pamphlet Common Sense, in which he set out to change the colonists' attitudes toward Britain and the king. Colonists, he said, did not owe loyalty to George III or any other monarch. The very idea of having kings and queens was wrong, he said.
In England a King hath little more to do than to make war and give away [jobs]; which in plain terms, is to impoverish the nation. ... Of more worth is one honest man to society and in the sight of God, than all the crowned ruffians that ever lived.
—Thomas Paine, Common Sonoe, 1776
The colonists did not owe anything to Britain, either, Paine went on. If the British had helped the colonists, they had done so for their own profit. It could only hurt the colonists to remain under British

rule. “Everything that is right or reasonable pleads for separation,” he concluded." ’Tis time to part.” Common Sense was a great success, selling over 500,000 copies in six months. Paine’s writing played an important role in moving toward revolution.
IDENTIFY CENTRAL IDEAS
What was the central idea of Common Sense?
Choosing Independence
Common Sense caused many colonial leaders to move toward declaring independence from Britain. It also deeply impressed many members of the Continental Congress. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia wrote to Washington, “I am now convinced ... of the necessity for separation." In June 1776, Lee rose to his feet in Congress to introduce a resolution in favor of independence:
Resolved, That these United Colonies are and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.
-.Richard Henry Lee, Resolution at the Second
Continental Congress, June 7, 1776
Drafting the Declaration of Independence The
delegates faced a difficult decision. There could be no turning back once they declared independence. If they fell into British hands, they would be hanged as traitors. A traitor is a person who betrays his or her country.
After long debate, the Congress took a fateful step. They appointed a committee to draft a formal declaration of independence. The committee included John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Robert Livingston, and Roger Sherman. Their job was to tell the world why the colonies were breaking away from Britain.
The committee asked Thomas Jefferson to write the document. Jefferson was one of the youngest delegates. He was a quiet man who spoke little at formal meetings.
Among friends, however, he liked to sprawl in a chair with his long legs stretched out and talk for hours.
» Thomas Paine’s criticism of British rule in Common Sense prompted many colonists to consider the option of declaring full independence from Britain.

His ability to write clearly and gracefully had earned him great respect.
Adopting the Declaration of Independence In
late June, Jefferson completed the declaration, and it was read to the Congress. On July 2, the Continental Congress voted that the 13 colonies were “free and independent States.” After polishing Jefferson’s language, the delegates adopted the document on the night of July 4,1776. They then ordered the Declaration of Independence to be printed.
John Hancock, president of the Continental Congress, signed the Declaration first. He penned his signature boldly, in large, clear letters. “There,” he said, “I guess King George will be able to read that.”
Copies of the Declaration were distributed throughout the colonies. Patriots greeted the news of independence with joyous—and sometimes rowdy— celebrations.
In New York, colonists tore down a statue of King George III. In Boston, the sound of cannons could be heard for hours.
fid IDENTIFY What were the potential consequences
for the delegates who chose to declare independence?
» The Declaration of Independence lists grievances against King George III, including the presence of British troops in the colonies during times of peace without the consent of colonial legislatures.
The Declaration of
Independence
The Declaration of Independence consists of a preamble, or introduction, followed by three main parts.
Unalienable Rights The first section of the Declaration stresses the idea of natural rights, or rights that belong to all people from birth. In bold, ringing words, Jefferson wrote:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
—The Declaration of Independence
According to the Declaration of Independence, people form governments in order to protect their natural rights and liberties.
These unalienable rights—including the rights to be free and to choose how to live—cannot be taken away by governments, for governments can exist only if they have the “consent of the governed.” If a government fails to protect the rights of its citizens, then it is the people’s “right [and] duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.” Ideas such as unalienable rights, adopted by the Founding Fathers (men such as George Washington, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson), are good examples of the civic virtues that have since become the cornerstone of American government. These values continue to ensure that human rights are protected and human needs are met in our nation.
Colonial Grievances The second part of the Declaration lists the wrongs, or grievances, that led the Americans to break away from Britain. Jefferson condemned King George III for disbanding colonial legislatures and for sending troops to the colonies in peacetime. He complained about limits on trade and about taxes imposed without the consent of the people.
Jefferson listed many other grievances to show why the colonists had the right to rebel. He also pointed out that the colonies had petitioned the king to correct these injustices. Yet, the injustices remained. A ruler who treated his subjects in this manner, he boldly concluded, is a tyrant and not fit to rule:
The Revolutionary Era 132	3.4 Declaring Independence
In every state of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
—The Declaration of Independence
Independence The last part of the Declaration announces that the colonies are the United States of America. All political ties with Britain have been cut.
As a free and independent nation, the United States has the full power to “levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do.”
The signers closed the declaration with a solemn pledge:
And, for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

On Christmas night, 1776, Washington and his troops crossed the icy Delaware River to attack British forces at Trenton. Despite enduring the harshest conditions, Washington’s forces were victorious.
Through an odd coincidence, the British began landing troops in New York in the same month that the Continental Congress voted for independence, July 1776. General George Washington, expecting the attack, had led his forces south from Boston to New York City. His army, however, was no match for the British under the command of General Howe. Howe had about 34,000 troops and 10,000 sailors. He also had ships to ferry them ashore. Washington had fewer than 20,000 poorly trained troops, which he spread in various locations to defend New York. Worse, he had no navy.

Early Challenges for the
Continental Army
In August, Howe’s army landed on Long Island. In the Battle of Long Island, more than 1,400 Americans were killed, wounded, or captured. The rest retreated to Manhattan. The British pursued. To , avoid capture, Washington hurried north.	1
Throughout the autumn, Washington fought a series of battles with Howe’s army. In November, he crossed the Hudson River into New Jersey. Chased by the British, the Americans retreated across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania.
During the campaign for New York, Washington needed information about Howe’s forces. Nathan Hale, a young Connecticut officer, j volunteered to go behind British lines. On his way back with the information, Hale was seized by the British and searched. Hidden in the soles of his shoes was information about British troop movements.
There was no trial. Howe ordered Hale to be hanged the next morning. As Hale walked to the gallows, he is said to have declared: "I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.”
Even as Washington’s army retreated and the British took New ) York City, many people there remained as loyal to the American cause
as Hale. Haym Salomon (HY urn SAL uh mun), a Jewish immigrant from Poland, was arrested by the British in September of 1776 and thrown into prison. Salomon had supported the American cause from the start, helping the new government get loans. Salomon even gave his own money to soldiers and military units for equipment. He managed to escape to Philadelphia and continued to aid the fight for independence.
A
Surprise Attack Leads to an American Victory Months of hard campaigning took a toll on the Continental Army. In December 1776, Washington described his troops as sick, dirty, and “so thinly clad as to be unfit for service.” Every day, soldiers deserted. Washington wrote to his brother: “I am wearied to death. I think the game is pretty near up.”
Washington decided on a bold move: a surprise attack on Trenton, New Jersey. The Delaware River separated the British in Trenton and the Americans, and the soldiers guarding Trenton would not expect American troops to cross it. On Christmas night, Washington secretly led his troops across the icy river. Soldiers shivered as spray from the river froze on their faces. Once ashore, they marched through swirling snow. Some had no shoes. They tied rags around their feet. “Soldiers, keep by your officers,” Washington urged.
Early on December 26, the Americans surprised the Hessian troops guarding Trenton and took most of them prisoner. The Hessians were soldiers from Germany. An American summed up the Battle of Trenton:
“Hessian population of Trenton at 8 A.M.—1,408 men and 39 officers; Hessian population at 9 A.M.—0.”
British General Charles Cornwallis set out at once to retake Trenton and to capture Washington. Late on January 2, 1777, he saw the lights of Washington’s campfires. “At last we have run down the old fox,” he said, “and we will bag him in the morning.”
Washington fooled Cornwallis. He left the fires burning and slipped behind British lines to attack a British force that was marching toward Princeton. There, the Continental Army won another victory. From Princeton, Washington moved to Morristown, where the army would spend the winter. The victories at Trenton and Princeton gave the Americans new hope.

The Tide Turns for the Americans
In London, British officials were dismayed by the army’s failure to crush the rebels. Early in 1777, General John Burgoyne (bur GOIN) presented a new plan for victory. If British troops cut off New England from the other colonies, he argued, the war would soon be over.

different directions. They would crush American forces there. Once they controlled the Hudson River, the British could stop the flow of soldiers and supplies from New England to Washington’s army.
Burgoyne’s plan called for General Howe to march on Albany from New York City. George III, however, wanted Howe to capture Philadelphia first.
In July 1777, Howe sailed from New York to the Chesapeake Bay, where he began his march on Philadelphia. Howe captured Philadelphia, defeating the Americans at the battles of Brandywine and Germantown. But instead of moving toward Albany to meet Burgoyne as planned, he retired to comfortable quarters in Philadelphia for the winter. For his part, Washington retreated to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.
Meanwhile, British armies under Burgoyne and Barry St. Leger (lay ZHAIR) marched from Canada toward Albany. St. Leger tried to take Fort Stanwix. However, a strong American army, led by Benedict Arnold, drove him back.
American Troops Prevail at Saratoga Only Burgoyne was left to march on Albany. His army moved slowly because it had many heavy baggage carts to drag through the woods. To slow Burgoyne further, Patriots cut down trees and dammed up streams to block the route.
Despite these obstacles, Burgoyne recaptured Fort Ticonderoga, shocking Americans. However, he delayed at the fort, giving American forces time to regroup. He also sent troops into Vermont to find food and horses. There, Patriots attacked the redcoats. At the Battle of Bennington, they wounded or captured nearly 1,000 British.
Burgoyne’s troubles grew. The Green Mountain Boys hurried into New York to help American forces there. At the village of Saratoga, the Americans surrounded the British. When Burgoyne tried to break free, the Americans beat him back. Realizing that he was trapped, Burgoyne surrendered his entire army to the Americans on October 17, 1777.
The American victory at the Battle of Saratoga was a major turning point in the war. It ended the British threat to New England.
It boosted American spirits at a time when Washington’s army was suffering defeats. Most importantly, it convinced France to become an ally of the United States. Nations that are allies work together to achieve a common goal.
Europeans Aid the American Cause The
Continental Congress had long hoped for French aid. In 1776, the Congress had sent Benjamin Franklin to Paris to persuade Louis XVI, the French king, to give the Americans weapons and other badly needed supplies.

In addition, the Congress wanted France to declare war on Britain.
The French were eager to defeat Britain, but they were also cautious. France was still angry about its defeat at British hands in the French and Indian War. However, Louis XVI did not want to help the Americans openly unless he was sure that they could win. The American victory at Saratoga convinced France that the United States could stand up to Britain.
In February 1778, France became the first nation to sign a treaty with the United States. It recognized the new nation and agreed to provide military aid. Later, the Netherlands and Spain also joined in the war against Britain. France, the Netherlands, and Spain all provided loans to the United States.
Even before European nations agreed to help the United States, individual volunteers had been coming from Europe to join the American cause. Some became leading officers in the American army.
The Marquis de Lafayette (mar KEE dah lah fay ET), a young French noble, convinced France to send several thousand trained soldiers to help the Patriot cause. Lafayette, who fought at Brandywine, became one of Washington’s most trusted friends.
From the German state of Prussia came Friedrich von Steuben (STOO bun), who helped train Washington’s troops to march and drill. Von Steuben had served in the Prussian army, which was considered the best in Europe.
Two Polish officers also joined the Americans. Thaddeus Kosciusko (kahs ee s koh), an engineer, helped build forts and other defenses. Casimir Pulaski trained cavalry, or troops on horseback.
B DESCRIBE
In what ways did Europeans help the American war effort?
Winter at Valley Forge
The victory at Saratoga and the promise of help from Europe boosted American morale. Washington’s Continental Army began preparing for the winter of 1777-1778 by building a makeshift camp at Valley Forge.
Conditions at Valley Forge were difficult, but the soldiers endured. About 2,000 huts were built as shelter. Several soldiers were improperly dressed, although many did have proper uniforms. As the winter wore on, soldiers also suffered from disease, a common problem in military camps. An army surgeon from Connecticut wrote about his hardships:
» General John Burgoyne surrenders to General Horatio Gates after the British defeat at the Battle of Saratoga. This American victory ended the British threat to New England.
» The Marquis de Lafayette (right), shown here with George Washington (left) at Valley Forge, commanded soldiers in support of the American cause.

The Revolutionary Era

Hampshire schoolmaster, Cheswell was an educated and free black man who was regularly elected to local and town positions.
Like Paul Revere, he rode all night from Boston to warn his community that the British were on the march. He later enlisted in the army to help fight at Saratoga.
Enslaved African Americans faced more difficult choices. If they joined the American army or continued to work on Patriot plantations, the British might capture and sell them. If they tried to flee to the British army to gain freedom, they risked being hanged by angry Patriots.
Belief in Freedom Yet, many slaves did flee their masters, especially those who lived near the coast, where the British navy patrolled. One British captain reported that “near 500” runaway slaves offered their services to him. Toward the end of the war, several thousand slaves sought freedom by following British troops through the Carolinas.
Black Patriots hoped that the Revolution would bring an end to slavery. After all, the Declaration of Independence proclaimed that “all men are created equal.” Some white leaders also hoped the war would end slavery.
James Otis wrote that “the colonists are by the law of nature free born, as indeed all men are, white or black.” Quakers in particular spoke out strongly against slavery.
By the 1770s, slavery was declining in the North, where a number of free African Americans lived. During the American Revolution, several states moved to make slavery illegal, including Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. Other states also began to debate the slavery issue.
fei IDENTIFY MAIN IDEAS What difficult consequences
did many slaves face when choosing sides in the American Revolution?
Native Americans and the Spanish Choose Sides
As the war spread to Indian lands in the West, the | Americans and British both tried to win the support of Indian tribes. In the end, the British were more successful. They convinced many Native Americans that a Patriot victory would mean more white settlers crossing the Appalachians and taking Indian lands.

Chickasaws. The British encouraged the Cherokees to attack dozens of settlements on the southern frontier. Only after hard fighting were Patriot militia able to drive the Cherokees back into the mountains.
Fighting was equally fierce on the northern frontier. In 1778, Iroquois forces led by the Mohawk leader Joseph Brant joined with Loyalists in raiding settlements in Pennsylvania and New York. The next year, Patriots struck back by destroying dozens of Iroquois villages.
Other Tribes Choose to Help the Patriots Farther west, in 1778, George Rogers Clark led Virginia frontier fighters against the British in the Ohio Valley. With help from Miami Indians, Clark captured the British forts at Kaskaskia and Cahokia near the Mississippi River.
Clark then plotted a surprise attack on the British fort at Vincennes. When Clark’s small force reached the fort, they spread out through the woods to make their numbers appear greater than they really were. The British commander thought it was useless to fight so many Americans. He surrendered Vincennes in February 1779.
Spanish Assistance On the southwestern frontier, Americans received help from New Spain. In the early years of the war, Spain was neutral. However, Bernardo de Galvez (bayr NARDO day GOLL vess),
governor of Spanish Louisiana, favored the Patriots. He secretly supplied medicine, cloth, muskets, and gunpowder to the Americans.
When Spain entered the war against Britain in 1779, Galvez took a more active role. He seized British forts along the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. He also drove the British out of West Florida. The city of Galveston, in Texas, is named after this courageous leader.
RECALL
Why were the British generally more successful at becoming allies with different Indian tribes? Fighting for Independence in the Southern Colonies and at Sea
At sea, the Americans could do little against the powerful British navy. British ships blockaded American ports, which were oftentimes important supply routes for Patriot troops and towns. From time to time, however, a bold American captain captured a British ship.
The greatest American sea victory took place in September 1779 in Britain’s backyard, on the North

Sea. After a hard-fought battle, Captain John Paul Jones captured the powerful British warship Serapis. Jones was one of many important military leaders who contributed to the American cause during the war.
Raids on the high seas and along the frontiers kept many Americans on the alert. However, the war between the Americans and Great Britain would be settled by battles in the South.
Battles in the South The South became the main battleground of the war in 1778. Sir Henry Clinton, the new British commander-in-chief, knew that many Loyalists lived in the southern backcountry. He hoped that if British troops marched through the South, Loyalists would join them.
At first, Clinton’s plan seemed to work. In short order, beginning in December 1778, the British seized Savannah in Georgia and Charleston and Camden in South Carolina. “I have almost ceased to hope,” wrote Washington when he learned of the defeats.
» Analyze Political Cartoons In this political cartoon, titled “The Horse America," what do the horse and rider symbolize? This cartoon was published in 1779. What was the cartoonist trying to convey about the Revolution?
Patriots and Loyalists Clash In the Carolina backcountry, Patriots and Loyalists launched violent raids against one another. Both sides burned farms, killed civilians, and sometimes even tortured prisoners.
After 1780, attacks by British troops and Loyalist militia became especially cruel. As a result, more settlers began to side with the Patriots. As one Loyalist admitted, “Great Britain has now a hundred enemies, where it had one before.”
Momentum Shifts Toward the Patriots After the victory at Kings Mountain, two able American generals helped turn the tide against the main British army, led by General Charles Cornwallis. They were Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island and Daniel Morgan of Virginia.
General Greene’s ability as a military leader was perhaps second only to Washington’s. In 1780, Greene took command of the Continental Army in the South. Using his knowledge of local geography, Greene > engaged the British only on ground that put them at a disadvantage. General Cornwallis wore out his soldiers trying to catch Greene’s army.
In January 1781, General Morgan won an important victory at Cowpens, South Carolina. Morgan used a clever tactic to defeat the British. He divided his | soldiers into a front line and a rear line. He ordered the front line to retreat after firing just two volleys. The British, thinking the Americans were retreating, charged forward—straight into the fire of Morgan’s second rank. In this way, the Americans won the Battle of Cowpens.
Greene and Morgan combined their armies when they fought Cornwallis at Guilford Courthouse, near
present-day Greensboro, North Carolina. The battle was one of the bloodiest of the war. Although the Americans retreated, the British sustained great losses.
Adapting Tactics to Geography Known as the Swamp Fox, Francis Marion of South Carolina added to British frustrations. He led a small band of militia, who often slept by day and traveled by night. His soldiers used guerrilla, or hit-and-run, tactics to harass the British.
Marion’s band took advantage of the region’s environment, appearing suddenly out of the swamps, attacking quickly, and retreating swiftly back into the swamps.

Decisive Win Brings the War to a Close Cornwallis abandoned his plan to take the Carolinas. In the spring of 1781, he moved his troops north into Virginia. He planned to conquer Virginia and cut off the Americans’ supply routes to the South.
Benedict Arnold’s Betrayal The British had achieved some success in Virginia, even before the arrival of Cornwallis. Benedict Arnold, formerly one of the Americans’ best generals, was now leading British troops. Arnold captured and burned the capital city of Richmond. His forces also raided and burned other towns.
Arnold had turned traitor to the American cause in September 1780, while commanding West Point, a key fort in New York. The ambitious general was angry because he felt that he had not received enough credit for his victories. He also needed money. Arnold secretly agreed to turn over West Point to the British. The plot was uncovered by a Patriot patrol, but Arnold escaped to join the British
Arnold’s treason and his raids on towns in Connecticut and Virginia enraged the Patriots. Thomas Jefferson, governor of Virginia, offered a sizable reward for his capture. Washington ordered Arnold to be hanged. However, he was never captured.
The British Are Trapped at Yorktown Cornwallis hoped to meet with the same kind of success in Virginia that Arnold had achieved. At first, things went well. Cornwallis sent Loyalist troops to attack Charlottesville, where the Virginia legislature was

meeting. Governor Thomas Jefferson and other officials had to flee.
American troops under Lafayette fought back by staging raids against the British. Lafayette did not have enough troops to fight a major battle. Still, his strategy kept Cornwallis at bay.
Then, Cornwallis made a mistake. He disregarded an order from Sir Henry Clinton to send part of his army to New York. Instead, he retreated to Yorktown peninsula, a strip of land jutting into the Chesapeake Bay. He felt confident that British ships could supply his army from the sea.
Washington saw an opportunity to trap Cornwallis on the Yorktown peninsula. He marched his Continental troops south from New York. With the Americans were French soldiers under the Comte de Rochambeau (roh shahm BOH). The combined army rushed to join Lafayette in Virginia.
Meanwhile, a French fleet under Admiral de Grasse was also heading toward Virginia. Once in Chesapeake Bay, de Grasse’s fleet closed the trap. Cornwallis was cut off. He could not get supplies. He could not escape by land or by sea.
The Revolutionary Era 143	3.5 Winning Independence
The War Is Won By the end of September, more than 16,000 American and French troops laid siege to Cornwallis’s army of fewer than 8,000. A siege occurs when an army surrounds and blockades an enemy position in an attempt to capture it. Day after day, American and French artillery pounded the British.
For several weeks, Cornwallis held out. Finally, with casualties mounting and his supplies running low, the general decided that the situation was hopeless. The British had lost the Battle of Yorktown.
On October 19, 1781, the British surrendered their weapons. The French and the Americans lined up in two facing columns. As the defeated redcoats marched between the victorious troops, a British army band played the tune “The World Turned Upside Down.”
The talks began in Paris in 1782. Congress sent Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, along with John Jay of New York and Henry Laurens of South Carolina, to work out a treaty. Because Britain was eager to end the war, the Americans got most of what they wanted.
Under the Treaty of Paris, the British recognized the United States as an independent nation. It extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. The northern border of the United States stopped at the Great Lakes. The southern border stopped at Florida, which was returned to Spain.
» American soldiers hoist the 13-star flag, a proud symbol of everything they fought for during the War for Independence.
For their part, the Americans agreed to ask the state legislatures to pay Loyalists for property they had lost in the war. In the end, however, most states ignored Loyalist claims.
On April 15, 1783, Congress ratified, or approved, the Treaty of Paris. It was almost eight years to the day since the battles of Lexington and Concord.

What were the results of the Treaty of Paris?
Explaining the American Victory
Geography played an important role in the American victory. The British had to send soldiers and supplies to a war that was several thousand miles from home. They also had to fight an enemy that was spread over a wide area. For their part, the Americans were familiar with the local geography. They chose geographic features, like hilltops, that would provide an advantage in battle.
Assistance from Allies Help from other nations was crucial to the American cause. Spanish forces attacked the British along the Gulf of Mexico and in the Mississippi Valley. French money helped pay for supplies, and French military aid provided vital support to American troops. Without French soldiers and warships, for example, the Americans might not have won the Battle of Yorktown.
A
Growing National Identity and Patriotism Throughout their struggles with Britain, the colonists benefited from their ability to unify for a shared American cause. The American Revolution inspired people of many different racial and minority groups as well as social classes to fight for the same American ideals of freedom and rights. Debates about equality would continue long after independence was earned, but the ideals from the Revolution would further define a developing American identity.
Patriotism was another important factor in the American victory. Soldiers were fighting for their homes and their beliefs. Despite early setbacks, the Patriots continued to fight for their cause.
Gradually, Washington’s inexperienced troops learned how to drill, how to march, and how to fight the British. Perhaps most important was Washington himself. By the end of the war, the general’s leadership and military skills were respected by Americans and British alike.

Washington Leaves the Army in December 1783, General Washington, before resigning, bid farewell to his officers at Fraunces Tavern in New York City. Colonel Benjamin Tallmadge recalled the event:
Such a scene of sorrow and weeping
I	had never before witnessed. . . . We were then about to part from the man who had conducted us through a long and bloody war, and under whose conduct the glory and independence of our country had been achieved.
—Benjamin Tallmadge, Memoir
All along Washington’s route home to Virginia, crowds cheered for their hero. The new nation faced difficult days ahead. In time, Americans would call on Washington to lead them once again.

State governments vary from state to state. In forming a government, most states wrote constitutions. A constitutionis a document that sets out the basic laws, principles, organization, and processes of a government. States wrote constitutions for two reasons. First, a written constitution would spell out the rights of all citizens. Second, it would limit the power of government.

Each State Creates a Constitution
People valued the rights that state governments protected. Virginia's constitution included a bill of rights, or list of freedoms that the government promises to protect. Virginia's bill of rights guaranteed trial by jury, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press. Several other states followed Virginia’s lead. For example, the Massachusetts J state constitution guaranteed people:	;

However, the Articles of Confederation had weaknesses as well. Compared to the states, Congress had very limited powers. Congress could pass laws, but nine states had to approve a law before it could go into effect. Even then it was up to the states to enforce the laws passed by Congress. The Articles included no president to execute laws.
Congress could not regulate trade between states or between states and foreign countries. Nor did it have the power to tax. To raise money, Congress had to ask the states for funds or borrow them. No state could be forced to contribute funds. There was also no system of courts to settle conflicts between states.
Debates Over Western Lands One major dispute arose before the Articles of Confederation went into effect. Maryland refused to ratify the Articles unless Virginia and other states ceded, or gave up, their claims to lands west of the Appalachian Mountains. Like other small states, Maryland feared that “landed” states would become too powerful.
One by one, the states agreed to cede their western claims to Congress. Finally, only Virginia held out. However, Thomas Jefferson and other leading Virginians recognized the great need to form a central government. They persuaded state lawmakers to give up Virginia’s claims in the West.
The new state governments were somewhat similar to the colonial governments in structure. The states divided power between an executive and a legislature. The legislature was elected by the voters to pass laws. Every state but Pennsylvania had a governor to execute, or carry out, the laws.
Under the state constitutions, more people had the right to vote than in colonial times. To vote, a citizen had to be white, male, and over age 21. He had to own a certain amount of property or pay a certain amount of taxes. For a time, some women in Hew Jersey could vote. In a few states, free African American men who owned property could vote.

What sort of freedoms did many states agree to protect?
The Articles of
Confederation
As citizens formed state governments, the Continental Congress was drafting a plan for the nation as a whole. Delegates believed that the colonies needed to be united by a national government in order to win independence.
It was hard to write a constitution that all states would approve. They were reluctant to give up power to a central government. Few Americans saw themselves as citizens of one nation. Instead, they felt loyal to their own states. Also, people feared replacing the “tyranny” of British rule with another strong government.
After much debate, the Continental Congress approved the first American constitution in 1777. The Articles of Confederation created a very loose alliance of 13 independent states.
Strengths and Weaknesses Under the Articles of Confederation, the United States became a union of states with a weak central government. In a sense, the Articles simply put into law the existing reality of government in the colonies—a Congress with delegates acting on behalf of states that retained most of the power. The new nation was still at war, its revolution not yet won. It was not the time to discuss the political relationship between the states and Congress. The Articles of Confederation represented an effective compromise during a difficult time.
As apian of government, the Articles of Confederation had strengths. It left states free to make decisions for themselves. It prevented the federal government from gaming too much power.
Under the Articles, each state sent one delegate to Congress. Thus each state, no matter its size or population, had one vote. Congress did have the power to declare war. It could appoint military officers, coin money, and operate post offices. It was also responsible for foreign affairs and could sign treaties.
» The Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation in 1777. The Articles spelled out the first constitution of American government.

Weaknesses of the
Confederation
By 1783, the United States had won its independence. Yet, the end of the American Revolution did not solve the confederation’s troubles. Americans had reason to doubt whether “these United States” could survive.
Many States Have Disagreements Disputes continued to arise among states. For example, both New Hampshire and New York claimed Vermont. The

» The currency issued by the Continental Congress lost value throughout the war. After the war, the United States owed millions of dollars to individuals and foreign nations.
Articles did not give the central government power to resolve such conflicts. Noah Webster, a teacher from New England, saw the problem clearly:
So long as any individual state has power to defeat the measures of the other twelve, our pretended union is but a name, and our confederation, a cobweb.
—Noah Webster, Sketches of Ainericen Policy
Concerns Over Debt and Currency After the Revolution, the United States owed millions of dollars to individuals and foreign nations. Without the power to tax, Congress had no way to repay these debts. It asked the states for money, but the states often refused.
During the Revolution, the Continental Congress had solved the problem of raising funds by printing paper currency, or money. However, the Continental dollar had little value because it was not backed by gold or silver. Before long, Americans began to describe any useless thing as “not worth a Continental.”
As Continental dollars became nearly worthless, states printed their own currency. This caused confusion. How much was a North Carolina dollar worth? Was a Virginia dollar as valuable as a Maryland dollar? Most states refused to accept the money of others. As a result, trade became very difficult.
Foreign Countries Promote Their Own Interests
Foreign countries took advantage of the confederation's weakness. Ignoring the Treaty of Paris, Britain refused to withdraw its troops from American territory on the Great Lakes. Spain closed its port in New Orleans to American shipping. This was a serious blow to western farmers, who depended on the port to ship their products to the East.
ti CHECK UNDERSTANDING Why did trade between
states become increasingly difficult?
An Orderly Expansion
Despite its troubles, Congress did pass important laws about how to govern the Northwest Territory. This was the U.S. territory west of Pennsylvania, north of the Ohio River, south of the Great Lakes, and east of the Mississippi. The laws established how territories would be governed and how they could become states.
The Land Ordinance of 1785 set up a system for settling the Northwest Territory. The law called for the territory to be surveyed and divided into townships.

» Analyze Information How did the Northwest Ordinance help to reduce conflict between the states as settlement expanded westward beyond traditional state boundaries?
©jbbsbseeeh
Each township would then be further divided into 36 sections of one square mile each (640 acres).
Congress planned to sell sections to settlers for a minimum of $640 apiece. One section in every township was set aside to support public schools. Selling the land provided income for the government, which was significant because Congress did not have the power to tax under the Articles of Confederation, yet the nation was in debt.
In 1787, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance. It set up a government for the Northwest Territory, guaranteed basic rights to settlers, and outlawed slavery there. It also provided for the vast region to be divided into separate territories in the future.
The Northwest Ordinance established the principle that new territories should not become part of existing states but should be admitted as new states. It provided a procedure, or process, to admit new states to the nation. Once a territory had a population of 60,000 free settlers, it could ask Congress to be admitted as a new state. Each new state would be “on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatsoever. In time, the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin were created from the Northwest Territory.
Despite the drawbacks of the Articles of Confederation, the laws Congress created relating to
the Northwest Territory proved to be a major success. These laws established principles defining the basic rights of settlers and served as a model for the rights citizens would expect to be protected. Trial by jury, freedom of religion, free use of waterways, fair treatment in the courts, and other rights were guaranteed. By providing that money from each township’s land sales be used for schools, these laws also established federal support for education.
fed RECALL What was the purpose of the Northwest
Ordinance?
Economic Problems Lead to Change
The Northwest Ordinance was the finest achievement of the national government under the Articles. Still, the government was unable to solve its economic problems. After the Revolution, the nation suffered an economic depression. A depression is a period when business activity slows, prices and wages fall, and unemployment rises.
Farmers Demand Fair Treatment The depression hit farmers hard. The war had created a high demand
A
Constitution for the United States A Weak Confederation
for farm products. Farmers borrowed money for land, seed, animals, and tools. However, when the Revolution ended, demand for farm goods went down. As prices fell, many farmers could not repay their loans.
In Massachusetts, matters worsened when the state raised taxes. The courts seized the farms of those who could not pay their taxes or loans. Angry farmers felt they were being treated unfairly.
Daniel Shays, a Massachusetts farmer who had fought at Bunker Hill and Saratoga, organized an uprising in 1786. More than 1,000 farmers took part in Shays’ Rebellion. They attacked courthouses and prevented the state from seizing farms when farmers could not pay their debts. Finally, the Massachusetts legislature sent the militia to drive them off.
A
Call For Revision Many Americans saw Shays’ Rebellion as a sign that the Articles of Confederation did not work. Warned George Washington, “I predict the worst consequences from a half starved, limping government, always moving upon crutches and tottering at every step.” To avert a crisis, leaders from several states called for a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation. They met in Philadelphia in May 1787. In the end,
however, this convention would create an entirely new framework of government.

Historic Convention American Leaders Come Together The convention’s 55 delegates were a remarkable group. Eight of them had signed the Declaration of Independence, including the oldest, Benjamin Franklin. At age 81, Franklin was wise in the ways of government and human nature. George Washington was a representative from Virginia. Washington was so well respected that the delegates at once elected him president of the Convention.
Still, most of the delegates represented a new generation of American leaders. Nearly half were young men in their thirties, including Alexander Hamilton of New York. During the Revolution, Hamilton had served for a time as Washington's private secretary. Hamilton despised the Articles of Confederation. “The nation,” he wrote, “is sick and wants powerful remedies.” The powerful remedy he prescribed was a strong central government.

Madison set a model of civic virtue when he arrived in Philadelphia with a case bulging with volumes of research.
Madison was quiet and rather shy. Still, his keen intelligence and his ideas about how to structure a democratic government strongly influenced the other delegates. Today, Madison is often called the “Father of the Constitution.”
Secret Conversations When the Convention began, the delegates decided to keep their talks secret. They wanted to speak their minds freely and be able to explore issues without pressures from outside.
The closed windows helped keep the debates secret, but they made the room very hot. New Englanders in their woolen suits suffered terribly in the summer heat. Southerners, with clothing more suited to warm temperatures, were less bothered.

Disagreements Over a New Government
Soon after the meeting began, the delegates realized they would have to do more than simply revise the Articles of Confederation. They chose instead to write an entirely new constitution for the nation. They disagreed, however, about what form the new national government should take.
Virginia Proposes a Plan Edmund Randolph and James Madison, both from Virginia, proposed a plan for the new government. This Virginia Plan called for a strong national government with three branches. The legislative branch would pass the laws.
The executive branch would carry out the laws. The judicial branch, or system of courts, would decide whether laws or the Constitution were violated.
According to the Virginia Plan, the legislature would consist of two houses. Seats would be awarded on the basis of population. Thus, in both houses, larger states would have more representatives than smaller ones. Under the Articles of Confederation, each state, regardless of population, only had one vote in Congress.
New Jersey Disagrees Small states opposed the Virginia Plan. They feared that the large states could easily outvote them in Congress. Supporters of the Virginia Plan replied that it was only fair for a state with more people to have more representatives.
After two weeks of debate, William Paterson of New Jersey presented a plan that had the support of the small states. Like the Virginia Plan, the New Jersey Plan called for three branches of government. However, it provided for a legislature that had only one house. Each state, regardless of its population, would have one vote in the legislature.
IDENTIFY MAIN IDEAS
What was the essential difference between the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan?
The Great Compromise
For a while, no agreement could be reached. With tempers flaring, it seemed that the Convention would fall apart without adopting any plan. Finally, Roger Sherman of Connecticut worked out a compromise that he hoped would satisfy both the large and small states. A compromise is a settlement, or peaceful solution, in which each side gives up some of its demands in order to reach an agreement.

Sherman’s compromise called for the creation of a two-house legislature. Members of the lower house, known as the House of Representatives, would be elected by popular vote. As the larger states wished, seats in the lower house would be awarded to each state according to its population.
Members of the upper house, called the Senate, would be chosen by state legislatures. Each state, no matter what its size, would have two senators. This part of Sherman’s compromise appealed to the smaller states.
On July 16, the delegates narrowly approved Sherman's plan. It became known as the Great Compromise. Each side, in an admirable show of civic virtue, gave up some demands to achieve unity. With a margin of just one vote, the delegates had found a peaceful resolution to a problem that had threatened to bring the convention to a halt.
IDENTIFY SUPPORTING DETAILS
How did the Great Compromise address the concerns of small and large states?
The Three-Fifths
Compromise
Just as there were disagreements between large states and small states, there were also disagreements between northern states and southern states. The most serious disagreements concerned the issue of slavery. Would enslaved people be counted as part of a state’s population? Would the slave trade continue to bring enslaved Africans into the United States?
The States Reach an Agreement Southerners wanted to include enslaved African Americans in the population count even though they would not let those people vote. If enslaved African Americans were counted, southern states would have more representatives in the House of Representatives. Northerners objected. They argued that, since enslaved African Americans could not vote, they should not be counted when assigning representatives.
Once again, the delegates compromised. They agreed that three fifths of the enslaved people in any state would be counted.
In other words, if a state had 5,000 enslaved residents, 3,000 of them would be included in the state’s population count. This agreement became known as
the Three-Fifths Compromise.
The fraction in the Three-Fifths Compromise had come from a rule in the Articles of Confederation. That
A
Constitution for the United States 165 4.2 Drafting a Constitution rule tied taxes to population and counted only three fifths of enslaved residents when a state was being taxed. The new compromise balanced the concerns of Northerners and Southerners by using the three-fifths rule—which had already been agreed upon—as an acceptable way to assign both representatives and taxes to each state.
Further Disagreement Over Slavery There was another disagreement over slavery. By 1787, some northern states had banned the slave trade within their borders. Delegates from these states urged that the slave trade be banned in the entire nation. Southerners argued that such a ban would ruin their economy.
In the end, northern and southern states compromised once more. Northerners agreed that Congress could not outlaw the slave trade for at least 20 years. After that, Congress could regulate the slave trade if it wished. Northerners also agreed that no state could stop a person fleeing slavery from being returned to an owner.
B IDENTIFY CENTRAL IDEAS
Why did many of the northern states object to including enslaved people in population counts?
» Despite the fact some delegates from northern states urged that slavery be banned throughout the nation, the Constitutional Convention did not succeed in ending the slave trade.
The Convention Comes to a Conclusion
As the long, hot summer drew to a close, the weary delegates struggled with one difficult question after another. How many years should the President, head of the executive branch, serve? How should the system of federal courts be organized? Would members of Congress be paid?
Finally, on September 17, 1787, the Constitution was ready to be signed. Its opening lines, or Preamble, expressed the goals of the framers: “We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union
Gathering for the last time, delegates listened quietly as Benjamin Franklin rose to speak. He pleaded that the document be accepted:
I doubt . . . whether any other
Convention . . . may be able to make a better Constitution. ... I cannot help expressing a wish, that every member of the Convention who may still have objections to it, would with me, on this occasion, doubt a little of his own infallibility, and . . . put his name to this instrument.
—Benjamin Franklin, Iduvidu < >( t.tit ? /u ?, 1< 'i, d (fmv >■ of. V7S7
One by one, delegates came forward to sign the document. All but three of the delegates remaining in Philadelphia did so. Edmund Randolph and George Mason of Virginia, along with Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, refused to sign. They feared that the new Constitution gave too much power to the national government.
The main effect of the Constitution's creation was to set in motion a process in which states had to decide whether to approve the Constitution. The Constitution called upon each state to hold a convention to approve or reject the plan for the new government. Once nine states endorsed it, the Constitution would become the law of the land.

Let us . . . search into the spirit of the British constitution; read the histories of ancient ages; contemplate the great examples of Greece and Rome; [and] set before us the conduct of our own British ancestors. . . .
—John Adams. 1 w , ,, ,	/ ‘ n , a ,, . / , ,
The delegates to the Constitutional Convention followed this advice. They wanted to create a republic, a government in which citizens rule themselves through elected representatives. Few republics in the history of the world survived very long. In order to create one that would last, American leaders looked first to the ancient examples of Greece and, especially, Rome.
168
The Virtues of a Republic Americans greatly admired the Roman Republic. General Charles Lee, one of George Washington’s commanders, commented, “I used to regret not being thrown into the World in the glorious [era] of the Romans.”
Independence and public service were virtues that the Founding Fathers saw in the citizens of Rome. Roman citizens were willing to serve in public office, not for money, but because they were devoted to their republic. The founders wrote the Constitution with these same civic virtues in mind and hoped Americans would live by the same principles.
Many American colonists admired Rome so much that when they debated politics in the newspapers, they often signed their opinions with Roman names such as Cincinnatus or Cicero.
A
Belief in Independent Citizens At the same time, the Founding Fathers saw the collapse of Rome’s republic as a warning to the United States. No republic could survive unless its citizens remained independent and devoted to public service without the desire for personal or financial gains. Under the ruler Caesar Augustus, Rome eventually became a dictatorship, a government in which one person or a small group holds complete authority. The leaders of the American Revolution believed that Romans stumbled once they allowed corruption to take over. Historians today admit that the Founding Fathers somewhat exaggerated the virtues of Rome’s republic. Yet, the lessons they learned still have force. Republics do not always die because they are invaded from outside. Without educated and dedicated citizens who put the nation’s needs above their own, republics can decay from within due to corruption.
El LIST What qualities of citizens in the Roman Republic did many early colonists admire?
English Influences
Greece and Rome were not the only examples of democratic government. Despite their quarrel with Britain, leaders of the Revolution valued British traditions of freedom.
The Magna Carta King John of England signed the Magna Carta in 1215. The Magna Carta contained two basic ideas that helped to shape both British and American government. First, it made it clear that English monarchs themselves had to obey the law.

officials. Eventually, the Great Council grew into the British Parliament.
Just as important, the Magna Carta stated that English nobles had certain rights—rights that were later extended to other classes of people as well. These included rights to trial by jury and the right to private property. The idea of private property rights strongly influenced the beliefs of early Americans, which partly explains the development of a free-enterprise system throughout the nation.
The English Bill of Rights In 1689, the English Bill of Rights went further in protecting the rights of citizens. The document said that parliamentary elections should be held regularly.
It upheld the right to a trial by jury and allowed citizens to bear arms. It also affirmed the right of habeas corpus, the idea that no person could be held in prison without first being charged with a specific crime.

America Draws on Its Own Traditions
Americans enjoyed a long tradition of representative government. The Virginia colonists set up the House of Burgesses. Eventually, each colony elected its own legislature.
Self-Government Americans were also used to relying on written documents that clearly identified the powers and limits of government. The Mayflower Compact, written in 1620, was the first document of self-government in North America. Each of the 13 colonies had a written charter granted by the monarch or by Parliament.
Answerable to the People The framers of the Constitution also drew on their own experiences. The Founding Fathers bitterly remembered their grievances against the English king. In writing the Constitution, they sought to prevent such abuses.
For example, the Declaration of Independence accused the king of placing military power above civilian authority. The Constitution made the elected President “Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy . . . and of the militia of the several states.” The Declaration protested that the king had made judges “dependent on his will alone.” The Constitution set up a court system independent of the President and legislature.
The framers were very familiar with the workings of the Second Continental Congress, the Articles of Confederation, and their own state governments. Much that went into the Constitution came either from the Articles or from the state constitutions.
The Influence of the Enlightenment The
Constitution was also based on the ideas of the European Enlightenment. Enlightenment thinkers believed that people could improve society through the use of reason. Many of the Constitution's framers had read the works of Enlightenment thinkers.
John Locke The English writer John Locke published Wo Treatises of Government in 1690. In it, he stated two important ideas. First, Locke declared that all people had natural rights to life, liberty, and property.
Second, he suggested that government is an agreement between the ruler and the ruled. The ruler
A
Constitution for the United States 170	4.3 Ideas That Influenced the Constitution
must enforce the laws and protect the people. If a ruler violates the people’s natural rights, the people have a right to rebel.
Locke’s ideas were popular among Americans. The framers of the Constitution wanted to protect people’s natural rights and limit the power of government. They saw the Constitution as a contract between the people and their government.
Locke’s principle of a natural right to property was established in the Constitution. Certain guarantees in the Constitution protect the rights of people to own private property, enforce contracts, and engage freely in business activities. These freedoms are essential to free enterprise. Article I of the Constitution also gave Congress the power to regulate commerce and encourage the free flow of goods between states, creating an environment in which business could thrive.
Baron de Montesquieu The French Enlightenment thinker Baron de Montesquieu (mahn tus kyoo) influenced American ideas of how a government should be constructed. In his 1748 book The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu stressed the importance of the rule of law. The powers of government, he said, should be clearly defined and divided up. He suggested that three separate branches be created: the legislative, executive, and judicial. This idea, known as the separation of powers, was designed to keep any person or group from gaining too much power.
A
New Tradition Emerges from Others The Founding Fathers drew on many traditions. In the end, though, the new system of government was not quite like anything that came before it.
When John Adams received the news from Philadelphia while serving as an ambassador to Great Britain, he wrote, ‘As we say at sea, huzza for the new world and farewell to the old one!” He called the Constitution “the greatest single effort of national deliberation that the world has ever seen.”

of people. Besides, they said, the Constitution protected citizens well enough as it was.
Antifederalists responded that a bill of rights was needed to protect such basic liberties as freedom of speech and religion. Unless these rights were spelled out, they could be too easily ignored or denied by the government. Americans, after all, had just fought a revolution to protect their freedoms against a too-powerful government. Violations of those freedoms were the main grievances cited in the Declaration of Independence. Antifederalists argued that a bill of rights was needed to address those grievances. Under the new Constitution, the President would have veto power over Congress—the people’s representatives. Surely placing so much power in one man’s hands, the Antifederalists argued, likewise demanded the protection of a bill of rights.
One of the strongest supporters of a bill of rights was George Mason of Virginia. In 1776, Mason had written the bill of rights for Virginia’s constitution. After the Constitutional Convention refused to include a bill of rights, Mason joined the Antifederalists. Mason wrote a pamphlet opposing the ratification of the Constitution. The pamphlet was titled, simply, “Objections to This

The Federalists and the
Antifederalists
The framers had set up a process for the states to approve, or ratify, J the new government. The Constitution would go into effect when at least 9 of the 13 states had ratified it. In 1787 and 1788, voters in each state elected delegates to special state conventions. These delegates would decide whether or not to ratify the Constitution.
For Ratification: The Arguments of the Federalists In every state, heated debates took place. Supporters of the Constitution ' called themselves Federalists because they favored a strong federal, or national, government. They called people who opposed the Constitution Antifederalists.
Federalists argued that the Articles of Confederation left too much power with the individual states. This imbalance produced a dangerously weak central government. Disputes among the states, Federalists said, made it too difficult for the government to function.
Federalists believed that the Constitution gave the national government the authority it needed to function effectively. At the same time, they said, the Constitution still protected the rights and powers of the individual states.
Federalists James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay wrote a series of essays, known today as the Federalist Papers. Their purpose was to explain and defend the Constitution. They used pen names, but most people knew who they were. Today, the Federalist Fapersremain among the best discussions of the political theory behind the American system of government.
Courts still refer to the Federalist Papers in making decisions about the principles and role of government. In this way, they have had a lasting influence on the U.S. system of government.
Against Ratification: The Arguments of the Antifederalists Antifederalists felt that the Constitution made the national government too strong and left the states too weak. They also thought that the Constitution gave the President too much power. Patrick Henry of Virginia protested:
This Constitution is said to have beautiful features, but . . . they appear to me horribly frightful. . . . Your President may become king ... If your American chief be a man of ambition and abilities, how easy is it for him to render himself absolute!
—Patrick Henry, Speech to the Virginia Convention,
June '1788
Most people expected George Washington to be elected President. Antifederalists admired Washington, but they warned that future Presidents might lack Washington’s honor and skill. For this reason, they said, the office should not be too powerful.

The Ratification Process
One by one, the states voted. Delaware led the way, ratifying on December 7, 1787. Pennsylvania and New Jersey soon followed. In these states, as in the states that ratified later, the main cause behind ratification was that Federalists were able to convince a majority of delegates that the Constitution would bring an improved system of government.
The Debate in New England Massachusetts was the first key battleground. There, the old patriots Sam Adams and John Hancock held back their support. The delay seemed “very ominous,” wrote Madison. Finally, Adams and Hancock convinced the state convention to recommend adding a bill of rights to the Constitution.
Still the debate continued. “Some gentlemen say, don’t be in a hurry . . . don’t take a leap in the dark,” a Federalist farmer told his fellow delegates. “I say . . . gather fruit when it is ripe.” In February 1788, Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify.
In June, New Hampshire joined ranks as the ninth state. The new government could now go into effect. Still, the nation’s unity remained in doubt. New York and
Virginia, two of the largest states, had not yet ratified the plan. In both states, Federalists and Antifederalists were closely matched.
A
Vote to Ratify After Long Debates In Virginia, Patrick Henry, George Mason, and Governor Edmund Randolph led the opposition. Still a spellbinding speaker, Henry at one point spoke for seven hours. Soft-spoken, James Madison could not match Henry’s dramatic style. Yet his arguments in favor of the Constitution were always clear, patient, and to the point. The tide finally turned when Governor Randolph changed his mind. He gave his support only when the Federalists promised to support a bill of rights. Virginia voted to ratify in late June.
In New York, the struggle went on for another month. In July 1788, the state convention voted to ratify. North Carolina followed in November 1789. Only Rhode Island, which had refused to send delegates to the Constitutional Convention, remained. On May 29, 1790, Rhode Island became the last state to ratify the Constitution. The effect of ratification was to create a new system of government for the United States, the same basic system that remains in effect today.
Celebration of a New Constitution Throughout the land, Americans celebrated the news that the Constitution was ratified. The city of Philadelphia set its festival for July 4, 1788.

Benjamin Rush, a Philadelphia doctor and strong supporter of the Constitution, wrote to a friend, ‘“Tis done. We have become a nation.”
RECALL
What factor encouraged many states to vote for ratification?
New Amendments
Americans voted in the first election under the Constitution in January 1789. As expected, George Washington was elected President, while John Adams was chosen as Vice President.
The first Congress met in New York City, which was chosen as the nation's first capital. Congress quickly turned its attention to adding a bill of rights to the Constitution. Several states had agreed to ratify the Constitution only on the condition that a bill of rights be added.
Amending the Constitution The framers had establisheda way to amend, or change, the Constitution to modify the rules for the national government. They did not want people to make changes lightly, however. Thus, they made the process of amending the Constitution fairly difficult. In 1789, the first Congress proposed a set of 12 amendments, written by James Madison. As required by the Constitution, the amendments then went for ratification by the states, three fourths of which had to ratify an amendment for it to take effect. By December 1791, three fourths of the states had ratified 10 of the 12 amendments. These 10 amendments became known as the Bill of Rights.
The Bill of Rights James Madison insisted that the Bill of Rights does not give Americans any rights. The rights listed, he said, are natural rights that belong to all human beings. The Bill of Rights simply prevents the government from taking these rights away.
Some of the first 10 amendments were intended to prevent the kind of abuse Americans had suffered under English rule. For example, the Declaration of Independence had condemned the king for forcing colonists to quarter troops in their homes and for suspending trial by jury. The Third Amendment forbids the government to quarter troops in citizens homes without their consent. The Sixth and Seventh Amendments guarantee the right to trial by jury.
Other amendments protected individual rights as uiany states had already done. In 1786, the Virginia
» George Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States on April 30, 1789.
Statute of Religious Freedom stated that “No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship ... or otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief.” Religious freedom became the very first right listed in the First Amendment. The First Amendment also emphasized a key element of the republic: freedom of speech, or the ability to express different points of view.
At first, individual state governments were not considered subject to the Bill of Rights. It was only after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 and subsequent Supreme Court decisions that the Bill of Rights was applied to the states.
Still, with the Bill of Rights in place, the new framework of government was complete. Over time, the Constitution would grow and change along with the nation.

To Promote the General Welfare The Constitution set out to give the national government the means to promote the general welfare, or the well-being of all its citizens. For example, today the National Institutes of Health leads the fight against many diseases.
To Secure the Blessings of Liberty During the Revolution, the colonists fought and died for liberty, or freedom. It is no surprise that the framers made ! liberty a major goal of the Constitution. Over the years, amendments to the Constitution have extended the “blessings of liberty” to all Americans.
The Articles and the Amendments The main body of the Constitution is a short document, divided into seven sections called articles. Together, they establish the framework for our government.
Seven Articles The first three articles describe the three branches of the national government: legislative, executive, and judicial. Article I establishes the powers of and limits on Congress. Articles II and III do the same for the President and the courts.
Article IV deals with relations among the states. It requires states to honor one another’s laws and legal decisions. It also sets out a system for admitting new states. Article V provides a process to amend the Constitution.
Article VI states that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.” This means that states may
not make laws that violate the Constitution. If a state law conflicts with a federal law, the federal law prevails. The final article, Article VII, sets up a procedure for the states to ratify the Constitution.
Twenty-Seven Amendments In more than 200 years, only 27 formal changes have been made to the Constitution. The first 10 amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, were added in 1791.

ELPS
Seven Basic Principles
The Constitution reflects seven basic principles. They are popular sovereignty, limited government, separation of powers, checks and balances, federalism, republicanism, and individual rights.
Popular Sovereignty The framers of the Constitution lived at a time when monarchs claimed that their power came from God. The Preamble, with its phrase "We the people,” reflects a revolutionary new idea: that a government gets its authority from the people. This
principle, known as popular sovereignty, states that the people have the right to alter or abolish their government.
Limited Government The colonists had lived under a British government with nearly unlimited powers. To avoid giving too much power to their new government, the framers made limited government a principle of the Constitution. In a limited government, the government has only the powers that the Constitution gives it. Just as important, everyone from you to the President must obey the law.
Separation of Powers To further limit government power, the framers provided for separation of powers. The Constitution separates the government into three branches. Congress, or the legislative branch, makes the laws. The executive branch, headed by the President, carries out the laws. The judicial branch, composed of the courts, judges whether actions violate laws and whether laws violate the Constitution.
Checks and Balances A system of checks and balances safeguards against abuse of power. Each branch of government has the power to check, or limit, the actions of the other two. The separation of powers allows for this system of checks and balances.

4.5 Understanding
Federalism The Constitution also reflects the principle of federalism, or the division of power between the federal government and the states. Among the powers the Constitution gives the federal government are the power to coin money, declare war, and regulate trade between the states. States regulate trade within their own borders, make rules for state elections, and establish schools. Some powers are shared between the federal government and the states. Powers not clearly given to the federal government belong to the states.
Republicanism The Constitution provides for a republican form of government. Instead of taking part directly in government, citizens elect representatives to carry out their will. Once in office, representatives vote according to their own judgment. However, they must remain open to the opinions of the people they represent. For that reason, members of Congress maintain websites and offices in their home districts.
Individual Rights The final principle the U.S. Constitution reflects is individual rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to trial by jury. You will read more about the rights protected by the Constitution later.

The Legislative Branch— Congress
The first and longest article of the Constitution deals with the legislative, or lawmaking, branch. Article I sets up the Congress to make the nation’s laws. Congress is made up of two bodies: the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The House of Representatives The larger of the two bodies is the House of Representatives, which currently has 435 members. Representation in the House is based on population, with larger states having more representatives than smaller states. Every state has at least one representative.
Representatives are elected by the people of their district for two-year terms. As a result, the entire House is up for election every other year. Representatives may run for reelection as many times as they want.
the Constitution

The leader of the House is called the Speaker. The Speaker of the House is one of the most powerful people in the federal government. The Speaker regulates debates and controls the agenda. If the President dies or leaves office, the Speaker of the House is next in line after the Vice President to become President.
The Senate Unlike the House, the Senate is based on equal representation of the states, with two senators for each state. Senators are elected to six-year terms. Their terms overlap, however, so that one third of the members come up for election every two years. This way, there is always a majority of experienced senators.
Not all of the Founders trusted the judgment of the common people. As a result, they called for senators to be chosen by state legislatures. Over the years, the nation slowly became more democratic. The Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, provided that senators be directly elected by the people of each state, like members of the House.
The Vice President of the United States is president of the Senate. The Vice President presides over the Senate and casts a vote when there is a tie.
The Vice President cannot, however, take part in Senate debates. When the Vice President is absent, the Senate’s president pro tempore, or temporary president, presides.
Powers of Congress The most important power of Congress is the power to make the nation’s laws. All laws start as proposals called bills. A new bill may be introduced in either the House or the Senate. However, an appropriations bill, which is a bill that sets aside money for government programs or operations, must be introduced in the House. After a bill is introduced, it is debated. If both houses vote to approve the bill, it is then sent to the President. If the President signs the bill, it becomes a law.
The Constitution gives Congress many other powers besides lawmaking. Article I, Section 8, lists most of the powers of Congress. They include the power to levy, or require people to pay, taxes and to borrow money. Congress also has the power to coin money, to establish post offices, to fix standard weights and measures, and to declare war.
The Elastic Clause Not all the powers of Congress are specifically listed. Article I, Section 8, Clause 18, states that Congress can “make all laws which shall be necessary and proper” for carrying out its specific duties. This clause is known as the elastic clause because it enables Congress to stretch its powers to deal with the changing needs of the nation.
» United States senators sit for a formal portrait in the Senate chamber of the Capitol.
Americans have long debated the true meaning of the elastic clause. What did the framers mean by the words necessaryand proper?For example, early leaders debated whether the elastic clause gave Congress the right to set up a national bank, even though the Constitution does not specifically give Congress that power.
Today, political parties still have different points of view on how the elastic clause should be used. Some Americans continue to worry that Congress might use the elastic clause to abuse its powers. Sometimes, the terms strict constructionists and loose constructionists are used to refer to people with different views of the clause.
Strict constructionists think that Congress (and the courts that interpret laws) should strictly construe, or narrowly interpret, the elastic clause. They believe the elastic clause should be used to stretch the powers of government rarely, and only to a small degree. Partly because many members of the Republican Party today are strict constructionists, that party particularly believes in reducing or eliminating some government programs.
In contrast, loose constructionists think that Congress (and the courts that interpret laws) should loosely construe, or broadly interpret, the elastic clause. They think the elastic clause should be used to stretch
A
Constitution for the United States 181	4.5 Understanding the Constitution
the powers of government as often as needed, and to a greater degree. Many members of the Democratic Party today are loose constructionists. Because they believe that the role of the federal government can and should expand as needed, they may support government programs opposed by members of the Republican Party.
The Committee System The First Congress, meeting from 1789 to 1791, considered a total of 31 new bills. Today, more than 10,000 bills are introduced in Congress each year. Clearly, it would be impossible for every member of Congress to give each new bill careful study. To deal with this problem, Congress relies on committees.
Both the House and the Senate have permanent, or standing, committees. Each committee deals with a specific topic, such as agriculture, banking, business, defense, education, science, or transportation. Members who have served in Congress the longest are usually appointed to the most important committees.
Congress may sometimes create joint committees made up of both Senate and House members. One of the most important kinds of joint committees is the

Q IDENTIFY SUPPORTING DETAILS
How does a bill become a law? : The Executive Branch— The President
Article II of the Constitution sets up an executive branch to carry out the laws and run the affairs of the national government. The President is the head of the executive branch. Other members include the Vice President, and the executive departments. The heads of the executive departments, who advise the President, are called the Cabinet.
The Many Roles of the President You are probably more familiar with the President than with any other government leader. You see him on television climbing in and out of airplanes, greeting foreign leaders, or making speeches. Yet, many Americans do not know exactly what the President does.
The framers thought that Congress would be the , most important branch of government. Thus, while the Constitution is very specific about the role of the legislature, it offers fewer details about the powers of the President. Beginning with George Washington, Presidents have often taken those actions they thought necessary to carry out the job. In this way, they have ' shaped the job of President to meet the nation’s changing needs.	s
The President is our highest elected official and, along with the Vice President, the only one who represents all Americans. As head of the executive branch, the President has the duty to carry out the nation’s laws. The President directs foreign policy and has the power to make treaties with other nations and to appoint ambassadors.	’
The President is commander in chief of the armed forces. (Only Congress, however, has the power to declare war.) As the nation’s chief legislator, the President suggests new laws and works for their passage.
The President can grant pardons and call special sessions of Congress. The President is also the living symbol of the nation. Presidents welcome foreign leaders, make speeches to commemorate national holidays, and give medals to national heroes.

The framers set up a complex system for electing the President, known as the electoral college. When Americans vote for President, they do not vote directly for the candidate of their choice. Rather, they vote for a group of electors who are pledged to the candidate. The number of a state’s electors equals the number of its Senators and Representatives. No state has fewer than three electors.
A few weeks after Election Day, the electors meet in each state to cast their votes for President. In most states, the candidate with the majority of the popular vote in that state receives all that state's electoral votes. The candidate who receives a majority of the electoral votes nationwide becomes President.
Because of the “winner-take-aH” nature of the electoral college, a candidate can lose the popular vote nationwide but still be elected President. This has happened four times. Today, some people favor replacing the electoral college with a system that directly elects the President by popular vote. Others oppose any change, pointing out that the electoral
college has served the nation well for more than 200 years.

The Judicial Branch—The Supreme Court
Article III of the Constitution establishes a Supreme Court and authorizes Congress to establish any other courts that are needed. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress set up the system of federal courts that is still in place today.
Lower Courts Most federal cases begin in district courts. Evidence is presented during trials, and a jury or a judge decides the facts of the case. A party that disagrees with the decision of the judge or jury may appeal it, that is, ask that the decision be reviewed by a higher court. The next level of courts is the appellate courts, or courts of appeal.
Appellate court judges review decisions of district courts to decide whether the lower court judges interpreted and applied the law correctly.
A
Constitution for the United States 183 4.5 Understanding the Constitution Supreme Court At the top of the American judicial system is the Supreme Court. The Court is made up of a Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices. The President appoints the justices, but Congress must approve the appointments. Justices serve for life.
The main job of the Supreme Court is to serve as the nation's final court of appeals. It hears cases that have been tried and appealed in lower courts. Because its decisions are final, the Supreme Court is called “the court of last resort.”
The Supreme Court hears and decides fewer than 100 cases each year. Most of the cases are appeals from lower courts that involve federal laws. After hearing oral arguments, the justices vote. Decisions require a majority vote of at least five justices.
Early on, the Court asserted the right to declare whether acts of the President or laws passed by Congress are unconstitutional, that is, not allowed under the Constitution. This power is called judicial review. The need for judicial review was first discussed in the Federalist Papers, and the Supreme Court has argued that the power is implicit in the Constitution, but it was not established until the 1803 case Marbury v. Madison,which gave the Supreme Court the power of judicial review.
Although powerful, the Supreme Court is limited by the system of checks and balances. One check on its power is that Congress can, in certain circumstances, remove Supreme Court justices from office. Also, the
Supreme Court does not have the power to pass or enforce laws, it can only provide judicial review of laws.
H CHECK UNDERSTANDING
What was the significant about the Supreme Court decision in the case Marbury v. Madison (1803)?
Preventing Abuse of
Power
The framers hoped that the separation of powers among three branches would prevent the rise of an all-powerful leader who would rob the people of their liberty. But how could the framers prevent one of the branches from abusing its power? To answer this problem, they set up a system of checks and balances.
The system of checks and balances allows each of the three branches of government to check, or limit, the power of the other two. The President, for example, can check the actions of Congress by vetoing, or rejecting, bills that Congress has passed. Congress can check the President by overriding, or overruling, the veto, with a two-thirds vote in both houses. Congress must also approve presidential appointments and ratify treaties made by the President. The Supreme Court can check both the President and Congress by declaring laws unconstitutional through its power of judicial review.
Congress's most extreme check on the President is its power to remove the President from office. To do this, the House of Representatives must impeach, or bring

Constitution for the United States 184 4.5 Understanding the Constitution charges of serious wrongdoing against, the President. The Senate then conducts a trial. If two thirds of the senators vote to convict, the President must leave office. Throughout our history, only two Presidents—Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton have been impeached by the House. Neither was convicted by the Senate.
The principle of checks and balances is based on the principle of separation of powers. Because the powers of government are separated into three branches, each branch can check the power of the other two. Like many principles in the Constitution, separation of powers and the system of checks and balances came from European philosophers of the Enlightenment.
One of these philosophers was Baron de Montesquieu, who wrote The Spirit of Laws. Montesquieu argued that the powers of government should be split among three equal branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. This would prevent any branch of government from becoming too powerful and protect individuals’ rights. We can see many of Montesquieu’s ideas reflected in the Constitution today.

State Government
One principle of the Constitution is federalism, or the division of powers between the federal and state governments. The federal government deals with national issues. The states have the power to meet more local needs. There are also some powers that are shared. But state governments provide many basic services that Americans use each day.
The Question of States’ Rights Many Americans originally opposed the Constitution because they thought it gave too much power to the federal government at the expense of the state governments. The Tenth Amendment was written to help ensure that the states keep powers not granted the federal government:
The powers not delegated to the
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.
Tenth Amendment to the Constitution
Some Americans point to the Tenth Amendment as support for what is often called states rights, or the idea that the federal government should not infringe
IF
A
Constitution for the United States 1£ on states’ powers. A similar idea is that of state sovereignty, or the idea that, within a state, the state government is supreme.
The federal government has used the elastic clause to assume powers that some believe belong to the states. Thus, the debate over how power should be shared between the federal and state governments has been a matter of controversy through most of American history.
State Constitutions Each of the 50 states has a constitution that sets forth the principles and framework of its government. Although constitutions vary from state to state, they must all conform to the Constitution of the United States. If a conflict arises, the national Constitution—the “supreme law of the land”—prevails.
Most state constitutions resemble the national Constitution in form. They start with a preamble stating their goals and include a bill of rights guaranteeing individual liberties. State constitutions tend to be longer and more detailed than the national Constitution. Many include provisions on finance, education, and other matters.
State constitutions set up a government with three branches. The powers of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches on the state level are similar to those of the national government.

institution for the United States
Changing State Constitutions State constitutions can be changed in several ways. In the most common method, amendments are proposed by the state legislature and approved by the people in an election.
In almost one half of the states, citizens can act directly to change the constitution. In a process known as the constitutional initiative, sponsors of an amendment gather signatures on a petition. When the required number of signatures is attained, the petition goes to the legislature or to the voters for approval.
Finally, a state can rewrite its constitution. With the approval of the legislature or the people, the state may call a constitutional convention. The new constitution is then submitted to the people for official approval.
The States’ Obligations to Citizens State governments provide a wide range of services. They maintain law and order, enforce criminal law, protect property, and regulate business. They also supervise public education, provide public health and welfare programs, build and maintain highways, operate state parks and forests, and regulate use of state-owned land.
The states, not the federal government, have the main responsibility for public education in the United States. Most students attend schools paid for and overseen by the state. The state sets general standards for schools and establishes a recommended course of study. It also sets requirements for promotion and graduation.
Each state must build and maintain its own infrastructure, or system of transit lines, roads, bridges, and tunnels. State departments or agencies manage more than 6,000 state parks and recreation areas. To help maintain high standards, state governments license the professionals who serve you, such as doctors, lawyers, and teachers.
When you are old enough to drive, the state will test you and, if you pass, give you a license. State police keep highways safe and protect us against criminal acts.

The Responsibilities of Local Government
The Constitution defines the powers of the federal and state governments. But it does not mention local government, that is, government on the county parish, city, town, village, or district level. Local governments are created entirely by the states and
186	4.5 Understanding the Constitution
have only those powers and functions that states give them.
Local governments have perhaps the greatest impact on our daily lives. At the same time, it is on the local level that citizens have the greatest opportunity to influence government.
Public Education The service that local governments spend the most money on is education. While state governments set standards for schools, it is the cities, towns, or school districts that actually run them. Local school boards build schools and hire teachers and staff. They also have a strong say in which courses will be taught. However, school officials must make all decisions within the guidelines set by state law.
Education is one area of local government where citizens exert a great deal of control. Local residents may give up part of their time to serve on local school boards. In most communities, voters have the right to approve or turn down the annual school budget.
Many Other Services Local governments provide a variety of other services. They hire or support firefighters, police, and garbage collectors. Local governments provide sewers and water, maintain local roads and hospitals, and conduct safety inspections of buildings and restaurants. In many cases, water and sewage treatment plants are owned and run by local governments. Other communities hire private companies to supply local needs.
Over the years, Americans have looked to local government for more than basic services. Today, most local governments provide libraries and parks and other cultural and recreational facilities.
In larger cities, citizens expect their local governments to support airports, sports arenas, and civic centers. Public funding for such facilities is often the subject of debate in major cities.

Article V outlines two ways to propose an amendment. An amendment may be proposed by two thirds of both the House and the Senate, or by i a national convention called by Congress at the request of two thirds of the state legislatures. The second method has never been used.
An amendment may also be ratified in one of two ways. An amendment may be approved by the legislatures of three fourths of the states. Every amendment but the Twenty-first was ratified using this method. In the second method, an amendment may be approved by special conventions in three fourths of the states.
Not all amendments proposed by Congress have been ratified. In fact, Congress has proposed six amendments that the states refused to ratify.

The Bill of Rights
As one of its first acts, the new Congress drafted a series of amendments in 1789 and sent them to the states for approval. In 1791, the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments, became part of the Constitution.
Free Speech, Press, and Religious Freedom The First Amendment safeguards basic individual liberties. It protects freedom of religion, speech, and the press. It also guarantees the right to assemble peacefully and to petition the government to change its policies.
Because of the First Amendment, you cannot be arrested for criticizing a government official. You can attend the house of worship of your choice or none at all.
You can read newspapers that do not represent the views of an official political party. These freedoms are important in a constitutional republic because they allow citizens to make informed decisions and take part freely in political life. Still, there are limits on the First Amendment. For example, the government can limit free speech if there is “a clear and present danger,” such as in time of war.
The First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of religion has a long history. Many colonists came to America to escape religious persecution. They wanted
to be able to pray and worship freely. Today, Americans are allowed to practice religion as they please, without fear of government interference. The guarantee of freedom of religion has allowed the religious diversity that is part of the American way of life.
Protection Against Abuse of Power The Second Amendment states, “A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” Other amendments reflect the colonists’ experiences under British rule. The Third Amendment says that Congress may not force citizens to put up troops in their homes. The Fourth Amendment protects Americans from unlawful searches of home or property.
Since early times, Americans have debated the exact meaning of the Second Amendment. Some believe that it guarantees individuals a basic right to bear arms. Others argue that it simply guarantees the individual states the right to maintain militias. The question of limits to gun ownership is one of the most complex and controversial constitutional issues facing Americans today.

Citizens' Rights and Responsibilities
American Citizenship
To be a citizen of the United States, you must have fulfilled one of three requirements:
You were born in the United States, or at least one parent is a citizen of the United States.
You were naturalized, that is, you have completed the official legal process for becoming a citizen if you were born outside the United States.
You were 18 or younger when your parents were naturalized.
Becoming a Citizen Throughout American history, many millions of immigrants have become naturalized citizens. An immigrant is a person who enters another country in order to settle there.
To illustrate the naturalization process, we will look at one immigrant’s story.
At age 15, Carla Rojas came to the United States from Argentina. Her mother returned home two years later, but Rojas decided to remain. After submitting numerous documents and photographs and attending several interviews, she received permission to remain in the country as a resident alien, or noncitizen living in the country.
192
After a required five-year waiting period, Carla submitted an application for citizenship. She had to take a test to show that she was comfortable with the English language and that she was familiar with American history and government. She also had to show that she was of “good moral character.” Then, a naturalization examiner interviewed her about her reasons for becoming a citizen.
At last, Rojas stood before a judge and took the oath that confirmed her as an American citizen:
I hereby declare, on oath, that
... I will support and defend the
Constitution and laws of the United
States against all enemies . . . that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ... so help me God.
—Oath of Allegiance to the United States
A naturalized citizen enjoys every right of a natural-born citizen except one. Only natural-born citizens may serve as President or Vice President.
The Rights and Responsibilities of Citizens All
American citizens have equal rights under the law. Americans have the right to speak freely, to worship as they choose, to vote, and to serve on juries. These rights are not based on inherited wealth or family connections. They are the rights of American citizens.
Still, nothing is free. As you will see, if we want to enjoy the rights of citizenship, we must also accept its responsibilities.
These rights and responsibilities reflect America’s national identity—the common set of values that unites Americans. For example, citizens have both the right and the responsibility to vote. This reflects the principles of independence, liberty, and self-governance upheld in the Constitution and valued by the American people.

What is a citizen? The Importance of Civic Virtue
The Founding Fathers admired civic virtue, that is, the willingness to work for the good of the nation or community even at great sacrifice. They looked to Toman models such as Cincinnatus, who, it was said, gave up a peaceful life on his farm when called upon to load Rome. Again and again, leaders such as George
L
Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams put the common good ahead of their own wishes. These three presidents maintained that democracy requires virtuous behavior by citizens. Citizens must put the greater good ahead of their own desires when they follow the law, serve on juries, and make informed decisions about voting.
The leaders feared that without this responsible behavior, American liberty would be at risk. How can a democracy run if individuals do not think about what is best for society and not just for themselves?
You do not have to go to great lengths to be a good citizen. At home, at school, and in the community, you can work to develop the values that are the foundation of our democratic system. Among these basic values are honesty and compassion. Others include patriotism, respect, responsibility, and courage.
A key democratic value is patriotism, or a feeling of love and devotion toward one’s country. A sense of patriotism inspires Americans to serve their nation. It also encourages us to fulfill the ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.
As citizens, we must respect ourselves, our families, our neighbors, and the other members of our community. Respect may also involve objects or ideas.

Responsibility may be both personal and public. We must accept responsibility for ourselves and the consequences of our actions and behaviors. In a democracy, individuals are expected to look out for themselves and for one another. For example, parents have a duty to support their families and teach their children. This is important because children depend on parents and families depend on one another. As a student, you have a responsibility to learn.
Courage may be either physical or moral. Soldiers, police, or firefighters display physical courage when they risk their lives for the good of others. Moral courage enables us to do the right thing even when it is unpopular, difficult, or dangerous. Americans such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King, Jr., faced risks in order to defend democratic values.

Responsible Citizenship
As citizens, we must accept our own civic responsibilities. Only if government and citizens work together can we meet our needs as a democratic society.
Responsible Citizens Vote As citizens of a republic, we have the right to select the people who will represent us in government. But if that right is to have any meaning, then we must fulfill our responsibility to vote. A good citizen studies the candidates and the issues in order to make responsible choices.
Responsible Citizens Obey Laws and Rules In the
Constitution, “we the people” give the government the power to make laws for us. Thus, we have a duty to obey the nation’s laws. We have thousands of laws that keep us from hurting one another, regulate contracts, and protect citizens’ rights. No one can know them all, but you must know and obey the laws that affect your life and actions.
You also have a responsibility to obey rules. You already have rules at home and rules at school—even rules to games you play. These rules are not enforced by the government as laws are. Like laws, however, they keep us safe, help us live together, and teach us to be accountable for our behavior. By learning to obey rules such as not to hit or cheat when we are young, we learn about responsible citizenship.

Americans have the duty to help defend the nation against threats to its peace or security. At age 18, all men must register for the draft. In time of war, the government may call them to serve in the armed forces. Many young citizens feel the duty to enlist in the military without being called.
Responsible Citizens Serve on Juries The Bill of Rights guarantees the right to trial by jury. In turn, every citizen has the responsibility to serve on a jury when called. Jury duty is a serious matter. Jurors must take time out from their work and personal lives to decide the fate of others.
Responsible Citizens Participate in Their Communities Many Americans use their time and skills to improve their communities or to help others. As you read, David Levitt was in middle school when he started a program to help the needy in his Florida community. Many young people participate in walk-a-thons or bike-a-thons for charity. Others volunteer in hospitals or fire departments. When serious natural disasters damage cities and regions, millions of citizens aid in rescue efforts, donate blood, or contribute money and supplies.
Responsible Citizens Stay Informed on Public
Issues Thomas Jefferson observed, “If a nation expects to be ignorant and free ... it expects what never was and never will be.” You cannot protect your rights as a citizen unless you know what they are. You cannot choose elected officials who will make good decisions unless you know where they stand on the issues. It is your responsibility to be informed. You can watch television news programs and read newspapers, magazines, or government pamphlets. Your work in school will help you become educated about our history, our government, and the workings of our society.

Whensoever, therefore, the legislative [power] shall transgress [go beyond; break] this fundamental rule of society, and either by ambition, fear, folly, or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people, by this breach of trust they forfeit [give up] the power the people had put into their hands. . .

George Washington took the presidential oath of office on April 30, 1789. As the new nation’s first President, Washington shaped the presidency for those who took office after him.
George Washington was inaugurated in New York City on April 30, 1789. A presidential inauguration is the ceremony in which the President officially takes the oath of office. A witness reported that the new President looked “grave, almost to sadness.” Washington, no doubt, felt a great burden. He knew that Americans were looking to him to make the new government work.

The First American Presidency
Washington’s presidency marked the beginning of what historians call the early republic. This period, between 1789 and about 1825, began when the first U.S. government was formed under the Constitution. Decisions made during the early republic had a lasting impact on the institutions and culture of the United States. As the first President, Washington showed his leadership qualities and set an example for future generations.
Although the Constitution provided a framework for the new government, it did not explain how the President should govern from day to day. “There is scarcely any part of my conduct,” he said, “which may not hereafter be drawn into precedent.” A precedent (PRES uh dent) is an act or a decision that sets an example for others to follow.
Washington set an important precedent at the end of his second term. In 1796, he decided not to run for a third term. Not until 1940 did any President seek a third term.
Washington’s Cabinet The Constitution said little about how the executive branch should be organized. It was clear, however, that the President needed talented people to help him carry out his duties.

In 1789, the first Congress created five executive departments. They were the departments of State, Treasury, and War and the offices of Attorney General and Postmaster General. The heads of these departments made up the President’s Cabinet. Members of the Cabinet gave Washington advice and were responsible for directing their departments.
As a proven leader himself, Washington knew he needed to appoint others with similar qualities to his Cabinet. He needed effective leaders who had the ability to persuade others to adopt new proposals and ideas.
Washington set a precedent by choosing well-known leaders to serve in his Cabinet. The two most influential were the Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, and the Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton.
Setting Up the Court System The Constitution called for a Supreme Court. Congress, however, had to set up the federal court system. As one of its first actions, Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789. It called for the Supreme Court to consist of one Chief Justice and five Associate Justices. Today, the Supreme Court has eight Associate Justices because Congress later amended the Judiciary Act. Washington named John Jay the first Chief Justice of the United States.
The Judiciary Act also set up a system of district courts and circuit courts across the nation. Decisions
made in these lower courts could be appealed to the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land.
LIST
What positions were included in the first presidential Cabinet?
Alexander Hamilton and the National Debt
As Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton faced many problems. Among the most pressing was the large national debt. The national debt is the total amount of money that a government owes to others.
During the Revolution, both the national government and individual states had desperately needed money. They had borrowed heavily from foreign countries and ordinary citizens to pay soldiers and buy supplies. Then, as now, governments borrowed money by issuing bonds. A bond is a certificate that promises to repay the money loaned, plus interest, on a certain date. For example, if a person pays $100 for a bond, the government agrees to pay back $100 plus interest (an additional sum of money) by a certain time.
A
Plan to Reduce the Debt Hamilton wanted to pay off the government’s debts and create a stable economic system for the United States. The plan > Analyze Data Based on the information in the chart, ™^at can^rou conchide tout the economic situation of the federal government when Washington took

5.1 Washington’s Presidency
he proposed showed his leadership qualities as an appointed political leader.
Hamilton called for the government to repay both federal and state debts. One of his first acts in government was to ask Congress to pass a tariff, or tax on imports, to pay for the government. Congress passed this tariff in 1789. Hamilton wanted the government to buy up all the bonds issued by both the national and state governments before 1789. He then planned to issue new bonds to pay off the old debts. As the economy improved and income from the tariff increased, the government would then be able to pay off the new bonds. Many people, including bankers and investors, welcomed Hamilton’s plan. Others attacked it.
Arguments for and Against Hamilton’s Plan
James Madison led the opposition. Madison argued that Hamilton's plan would reward speculators. A speculator is someone who invests in a risky venture in the hope of making a large profit.
During the Revolution, the government had issued bonds to soldiers and citizens who supplied goods. Many of these bondholders needed cash to survive. So, they sold their bonds to speculators. Speculators bought bonds worth one dollar for only 10 or 15 cents. If the government paid off the old bonds in full, speculators stood to make fortunes. Madison thought that speculators did not deserve to make such profits.
Hamilton replied that the United States must repay its debts in full. Otherwise, he said, it risked losing the trust of investors in the future. The support of investors, he argued, was crucial to building the new nation's economy. After much debate, Congress approved full repayment of the national debt.
As a southerner, Madison also led the fight against the other part of Hamilton’s plan, the repaying of state debts. By 1789, most southern states had paid off their debts from the Revolution. They thought that other states should do the same. The New England states, for example, still owed a lot. Thus, some northern states stood to gain more than others from the plan. As a result, the southern states bitterly opposed Hamilton’s plan.
This fight over how to use scarce capital resources fairly was only one of many in the early republic, the period from Washington’s presidency until 1824.
A
Compromise Is Reached In the end, Hamilton proposed a compromise. Many southerners wanted the nation’s capital to be located in the South. Hamilton offered to support that goal if southerners agreed to his plan to repay state debts. Madison and others accepted the compromise. In July 1790, Congress voted to repay state debts and to build a new capital city. The new capital would not be part of any state. Instead, it would be built on land along the Potomac River on land given up by two

Meanwhile, the nation’s capital was moved from New York to Philadelphia.
BRECALL
Why were federal and state debts so high? Creating a Stable Economy
Hamilton’s next challenge was to strengthen the faltering national economy. His economic plan was designed to help both agriculture and industry.
Hamilton called on Congress to set up a national bank. In 1791, Congress created the first Bank of the United States. The government deposited money from taxes in the Bank. In turn, the Bank issued paper money to pay the government’s bills and to make loans to farmers and businesses. Through these loans, the Bank encouraged economic growth and the development of a free-enterprise economic system.
To help American manufacturers, Hamilton asked Congress to pass a new tariff, or tax, on foreign goods brought into the country. He wanted a high tariff, to make imported goods more expensive than American-made goods. A tariff meant to protect local industry from foreign competition is called a protective tariff.
Hamilton’s plan sparked arguments over taxation. In the North, where there were more and more factories, many people supported Hamilton’s plan. Southern farmers, however, bought many imported goods. They opposed a protective tariff that would make imports more expensive.
In the end, Congress did pass a tariff, but it was much lower than the protective tariff Hamilton wanted. The tariff was also lower than American manufacturers would have liked in order to protect them from foreign competition. However, the tariff did help to pay oil government debt, a central point in Hamilton’s economic plan. The government needed to find a form of taxation that allowed it to pay off lenders, because attracting lenders is key to financing government in a fee enterprise system.

Taxation Sparks the
Whiskey Rebellion
To help reduce the national debt, Congress approved a tax on all liquor made and sold in the United States. Hamilton wanted this tax to raise money for the Treasury. Instead, the new tax sparked a rebellion that tested the strength of the new government.
This tax was the first implemented by Congress under its new constitutional authority. Hamilton believed that reasonable taxes on alcohol would help to moderate consumption. He also hoped to gain a rich source of revenue for the federal government to pay its debts.
However, the new law varied the tax rate and often left smaller liquor manufacturers paying more than larger ones. Furthermore, the tax had to be paid in cash. This was often difficult for small distilleries. Large liquor enterprises in the East had less trouble with the tax than those on the frontier or in small towns.
Hamilton, though himself a man of humble origins, did not fully appreciate the economic concerns of Americans who lived on farms or in small towns. A large number of them opposed the new tax.

The Whiskey Rebellion Like many Americans, backcountry farmers grew corn. However, corn was bulky and expensive to haul long distances over rough roads. The cost of transport made western corn too expensive to sell in the East. Instead, farmers converted their corn into whiskey. Barrels of whiskey were worth much more and could be sold for a profit in the East despite the cost of transport.
Backcountry farmers hated the tax on whiskey because it sharply reduced their income. Many refused to pay it. They compared it to the taxes Britain had forced on the colonies.
In 1794, when officials in western Pennsylvania tried to collect the tax, farmers rebelled. During the Whiskey Rebellion, thousands marched in protest through the streets of Pittsburgh. They sang Revolutionary songs and tarred and feathered the tax collectors.
A
Show of Leadership President Washington responded quickly. He showed his leadership qualities as a military leader once again. He called up the militia and dispatched them to Pennsylvania. When the rebels heard that thousands of troops were marching against them, they fled back to their farms. Hamilton wanted the leaders of the rebellion executed, but Washington disagreed and pardoned them. He believed that the government had shown its strength to all. Now, it was time to show mercy. The Whiskey Rebellion tested the will of the new government. Washington’s quick response proved to Americans that their new government would act firmly in times of crisis. The President also showed those who disagreed with the government that violence would not be tolerated.

Americans React to the French Revolution
Late in 1789, French ships arrived in American ports with startling news. On July 14, an angry mob in Paris, France, had destroyed the Bastille (bahs TEEL), an ancient fort that was used as a prison. The attack on the Bastille was an early event in the French Revolution. Before long, the revolution would topple the monarch and lead to the execution of thousands ol ordinary French citizens.
The French Revolution broke out a few years after Americans had won their independence. Like Americans, the French fought for liberty and equality

As the French Revolution grew more violent, however, it deepened political divisions within the United States.
The French had many reasons to rebel against their king, Louis XVI. The peasants and the middle class paid heavy taxes, while nobles paid none. Reformers wanted a constitution to limit the king’s power and protect basic rights, as the American Constitution did.
Supporting Liberty in France At first, most Americans supported the French Revolution. Americans knew what it meant to struggle for liberty.

The Whiskey Rebellion Like many Americans backcountry farmers grew corn. However, corn was bulky and expensive to haul long distances over rough roads. The cost of transport made western corn too expensive to sell in the East. Instead, farmers converted their corn into whiskey. Barrels of whiskey were worth much more and could be sold for a profit in the East despite the cost of transport.
Backcountry farmers hated the tax on whiskey because it sharply reduced their income. Many refused to pay it. They compared it to the taxes Britain had forced on the colonies.
In 1794, when officials in western Pennsylvania tried to collect the tax, farmers rebelled. During the Whiskey Rebellion, thousands marched in protest through the streets of Pittsburgh. They sang Revolutionary songs and tarred and feathered the tax collectors.
A
Show of Leadership President Washington responded quickly. He showed his leadership qualities as a military leader once again. He called up the militia and dispatched them to Pennsylvania. When the rebels heard that thousands of troops were marching against them, they fled back to their farms. Hamilton wanted the leaders of the rebellion executed, but Washington disagreed and pardoned them. He believed that the government had shown its strength to all. Now, it was time to show mercy. * The Whiskey Rebellion tested the will of the new government. Washington’s quick response proved to Americans that their new government would act firmly in times of crisis. The President also showed those who disagreed with the government that violence would not be tolerated.

As the French Revolution grew more violent, however, it deepened political divisions within the United States.
The French had many reasons to rebel against their king, Louis XVI. The peasants and the middle class paid heavy taxes, while nobles paid none. Reformers wanted a constitution to limit the king’s power and protect basic rights, as the American Constitution did.
Supporting Liberty in France At first, most Americans supported the French Revolution. Americans knew what it meant to struggle for liberty. Also, during the American Revolution, France had been an important ally. Many Americans admired the Marquis de Lafayette, a leading French reformer who had fought with them in the American Revolution.
However, the French Revolution frightened most European rulers and nobles. They wanted to prevent revolutionary ideas from spreading to their lands. When two European countries, Austria and Prussia, appealed to other rulers to help the French king regain his throne in 1792, France declared war.

States, still recovering from the Revolutionary War, to new British attacks. However, Washington worried that the United States could not honor its treaty with France and still remain neutral in the European conflict. Neutral means not taking sides in a conflict.
Washington also hoped to protect the American economy from the conflict between Britain and France. Merchants and farmers in the United States depended on American ports to maintain overseas trade with Britain and other countries. The British navy ensured the safety of American trading ships. Still, many Americans favored France. Staying neutral appeared to be Washington’s best option.
Protecting American Interests The issue of the treaty deepened the divisions within Washington’s Cabinet. Hamilton pointed out that the United States had signed the treaty with Louis XVI. With the king dead, he argued, the treaty was no longer valid. Jefferson, a supporter of France, urged strict acceptance of the treaty.
After much debate, Washington issued the Neutrality Proclamation in April 1793. It stated that the United States would not support either side in the war. Further, it forbade Americans from aiding either Britain or France. The Neutrality Proclamation was a

Declaring neutrality was easier than enforcing it. Americans wanted to trade with both Britain and France. However, those warring nations seized American cargoes headed for each other’s ports.
Jay’s Treaty In 1793, the British captured more than 250 American ships trading in the French West Indies. Some Americans called for war. Washington, however, knew that the United States was too weak to fight. He sent Chief Justice John Jay to Britain for talks.
Jay negotiated an agreement that called for Britain to pay damages for the seized American ships. Britain also agreed to give up the forts it still held in the West. Meanwhile, Americans had to pay debts long owed to British merchants.
Jay’s Treaty sparked loud protests because it did nothing to protect the rights of neutral American ships. After furious debate, the Senate finally approved the treaty in 1795.
The Impact of Washington’s Farewell Address
After serving two terms as President, George Washington refused to serve a third. Before retiring in 1796, Washington published his Farewell Address. In it, he advised Americans against becoming involved in European affairs:
Tis our true policy to steer clear of permanent Alliances, with any portion of the foreign World. . . . The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations is ... to have with them as little political connection as possible. —George Washington, Farewell Address, 1796

Americans Divide Over Politics
Early on, though, political disagreements divided Americans. “Men who have been [friends] all their lives,” noted Jefferson, “cross streets to avoid meeting, and turn their heads another way, lest they should be obliged to touch their hats.” Before Washington left office in 1797, two rival political parties had emerged to compete for power.
Americans also saw political parties as a threat to national unity. They agreed with George Washington, who warned Americans that parties would lead to “jealousies and false alarms.”
Opposing Factions Grow in the Cabinet Despite the Presidents warning, factions grew up around two members of his Cabinet, Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. The two men differed in background and in politics. Born in the West Indies, Hamilton had worked his way up from poverty. Hamilton believed that the wealthy and educated should control the government. He believed that supporting business and trade was the best way to improve the nation’s economy. Hamilton also favored Britain over France.
Unlike Hamilton, Jefferson came from a wealthy family of Virginia planters. He owned large plantations and enslaved African
Americans. Despite his wealth, Jefferson believed that the government should represent ordinary white people, not just the wealthy and educated. Jefferson supported policies that favored small farmers rather than businessmen. Jefferson favored France over Britain.

Disagreements on
Important Issues
The disagreements between Hamilton and Jefferson were not just differences of opinion. Their quarrels were rooted in their different views about what was best for the new nation.
Foundations of the American Economy The
two leaders differed on economic policy. Hamilton wanted the United States to model itself on Britain. The government, he thought, should encourage manufacturing and trade. He also favored the growth of cities and the merchant class.
Jefferson thought that farmers, rather than merchants, were the backbone of the new nation. “Cultivators of the earth,” he wrote, “are the most valuable citizens.” He feared that a manufacturing economy would corrupt the United States by concentrating power in the hands of a small group of wealthy Americans.

Federalism Hamilton and Jefferson also disagreed about the power of the federal government. Hamilton wanted the federal government to have greater power than state governments. A strong federal government, he argued, was needed to increase commerce. It would also be able to restrain mob violence like that of the Whiskey Rebellion.
In contrast, Jefferson wanted as small a federal government as possible, in order to protect individual freedom. He feared that a strong federal government might take over powers that the Constitution gave to the states.
Interpreting the Constitution Jefferson and Hamilton also clashed over the Bank of the United States. Jefferson worried that a national bank would give too much power to the government and to wealthy investors who would help run the bank.
Jefferson opposed the law setting up the bank. He claimed that it was unconstitutional, or not permitted by the Constitution. Nowhere did the Constitution give Congress the power to create a Bank, he argued. For Jefferson, any power not specifically given to the federal government belonged to the states.
Hamilton did not agree with Jefferson’s strict interpretation of the Constitution. He preferred a looser interpretation. The Constitution gave Congress the power to make all laws “necessary and proper” to carry out its duties. Hamilton argued that the Bank was necessary for the government to collect taxes and pay its bills.

•	Wanted a strong central government
•	Sympathetic to England
•	Favored a national bank

The Origin of American Political Parties
At first, Hamilton and Jefferson clashed in private. Then Congress began to pass many of Hamilton’s programs. James Madison shared many of Jefferson’s views, and the two men decided to organize supporters of their views.
Jefferson and Madison moved cautiously at first. In 1791, they went to New York, telling people that they wanted to study its wildlife. In fact, Jefferson was interested in nature. Their main goal, though, was to meet with leading New York politicians such as Governor George Clinton and Aaron Burr, a fierce critic of Hamilton. Jefferson asked them to help defeat

Hamilton’s program by convincing New Yorkers to vote for Jefferson’s supporters.
Republicans and Federalists Soon, leaders in other states were organizing to support either Hamilton or Jefferson. Jefferson’s supporters called themselves Democratic Republicans, often shortened to Republicans. Today’s Republican Party is not related to Jefferson’s party. The Jeffersonian Republicans included small farmers, artisans, and some wealthy planters in the South.
Hamilton and his supporters were called Federalists because they wanted a strong federal government. Federalists drew support mainly from merchants and manufacturers in such cities as Boston and New York. They also had the backing of some southern planters.
Newspapers Influence Public Opinion In the late 1700s, the number of American newspapers more than doubled. This growth met a demand for information.
A
European visitor was surprised that so many Americans could read. “The common people ... all read and write, and understand arithmetic,” he reported, and “almost every little town now furnishes a circulating library.” As party rivalry grew, newspapers took sides. In the Gazette of the United States, publisher John Fenno backed Hamilton and the Federalists. Jefferson’s friend Philip Freneau (frih NOH) started a rival paper, the National Gazette, which supported Republicans.
Newspapers had great influence on public opinion. In stinging language, they raged against political opponents. Often, articles mixed rumor and opinion with facts. Emotional attacks and counterattacks fanned the flames of party rivalry.
Choosing Washington’s Successor Political parties played a large role in the election of George Washington's successor. In 1796, Democratic Republicans backed Thomas Jefferson for President and Aaron Burr for Vice President. Federalists supported John Adams for President and Thomas Pinckney for Vice President. The election had an unexpected outcome.
Under the Constitution, the person with the most electoral votes became President. The candidate with the next highest total was made Vice President. John Adams, a Federalist, won office as President. The leader of the Democratic Republicans, Thomas Jefferson, came in second and became Vice President.
Having the President and Vice President from opposing parties further increased political tensions. John Adams took office in March 1797 as the nation's

The XYZ Affair The French foreign minister, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, did not deal directly with the Americans. Instead, he sent three agents to offer the Americans a deal. Before Talleyrand would even begin talks, the agents said, he wanted $250,000 for himself and a $10 million loan to France. “Not a sixpence!” replied one of the Americans angrily. (A sixpence was a British coin worth six pennies.)
The diplomats informed Adams about the offer. He then told Congress. Adams did not reveal the names of the French agents, referring to them only as X, Y, and Z.
Many Americans were outraged when news reached them about the XYZ Affair in 1798. They took up the slogan, “Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute!” They were willing to spend money to defend their country, but they would not pay a bribe to another nation.

France. Like Washington, he wanted to keep the country out of European affairs. However, he could not ignore French attacks on American ships, so he strengthened the navy by building frigates, fast-sailing ships with many guns. That move helped convince France to stop attacking American ships.
Adams’s Foreign Policy Divides the Federalists
Led by Hamilton, many Federalists criticized Adams. They hoped a war would weaken the Democratic Republicans, who supported France. War would also force the nation to build its military forces.
A strong military would increase federal power, a key Federalist goal. Many Federalists also favored Britain in its war against France.
Although Adams was a Federalist, he resisted Hamilton’s pressure for war. Their disagreement created a split in the Federalist party.
Over Hamilton’s opposition, Adams again sent diplomats to France. When they arrived, they found an ambitious young army officer, Napoleon Bonaparte, in charge. Napoleon was planning for war against several European powers. Thus, he had no time for a war with the United States. He signed an agreement to stop seizing American ships.
Like Washington, Adams kept the nation out of war. His actions showed his leadership qualities as an elected leader. His success, however, cost him the support of many Federalists and weakened the party for the election of 1800.
CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why did many Federalists support a war with France?
The Alien and Sedition Acts
In 1798, during the crisis with France, Federalists pushed several laws through Congress. These laws were known as the Alien and Sedition Acts
Under the Alien Act, the President could expel any alien, or foreigner, thought to be dangerous to the country. Another law made it harder for immigrants to become citizens. Before 1798, white immigrants could become citizens after living in the United States for five years. The new law made immigrants wait 14 years. The Federalists passed this act because many recent immigrants supported Jefferson and the Democratic Republicans. The act would keep these immigrants from voting for years.
The Democratic Republicans grew even angrier when Congress passed the Sedition Act. Sedition mcans stirring up rebellion against a government.

The Early Republic 223
5.3 John Adams’s Presidency
Under this law, citizens could be fined or jailed if they criticized the government or its officials. In fact, several Democratic Republican newspaper editors, and even members of Congress, were fined and jailed for expressing their opinions.
Democratic Republicans protested that the Sedition Act violated the Constitution. The First Amendment, they argued, protected freedom of speech and of the press. Jefferson warned that the new laws threatened American liberties:
They have brought into the lower house a sedition bill, which . . . undertakes to make printing certain matters criminal . . . Indeed this bill & the alien bill both are so [against] the Constitution as to show they mean to pay no respect to it.
—The Writings of Thomas Jefferson, 1798
States Challenge the Federal Government Vice President Jefferson bitterly opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts. He could not ask the courts for help
because the Federalists controlled them. So, he urged the states to take strong action against the acts. He argued that the states had the right to nullify, or cancel, a law passed by the federal government. In this way, states could resist the power of the federal government.
With help from Jefferson and Madison, Kentucky and Virginia passed resolutions in 1798 and 1799. The Kentucky and Virginia resolutions claimed that each state “has an equal right to judge for itself" whether a law is constitutional. If a state decides a law is unconstitutional, said the resolutions, it has the power to nullify that law within its borders.
The Kentucky and Virginia resolutions raised the issue of states’ rights. Did the federal government have only those powers that were listed in the Constitution? If so, did the states possess all other powers—for example, the power to declare a federal law unconstitutional? Within a few years, the Alien and Sedition Acts were changed or dropped. Still, the issue of a state’s right to nullify federal laws would come up again.

An Important Presidential Election
By 1800, the war cry against France was fading. As the election neared, Democratic Republicans focused on two issues. First, they attacked the Federalists for raising taxes to prepare for war. Second, they opposed the unpopular Alien and Sedition Acts.
Democratic Republicans backed Thomas Jefferson for President and Aaron Burr for Vice President. Despite the bitter split in the Federalist party, John Adams was again named its candidate.
Political Power Goes to a Different Party In the
race for the presidency, Democratic Republicans won the popular vote. However, when the electoral college voted, Jefferson and Burr each received 73 votes. At the time, the electoral college did not vote separately for President and Vice President. Instead, the college voted for each candidate. The candidate winning the most votes became President, and the runner-up became Vice President. However, each Democratic Republican elector cast one vote for Jefferson and one vote for Burr, so there was no clear winner.
Under the Constitution, if no candidate wins the electoral vote, the House of Representatives decides the election. Only after four days and 36 votes was the tie

finally broken. The House chose Jefferson as President. Burr became Vice President. The election of 1800 set an important precedent. From then until today, power has passed peacefully from one party to another.
Soon after, Congress passed the Twelfth Amendment. It required electors to hold separate votes for President and Vice President. The states ratified the amendment in 1804.
The Federalist Era Comes to a Close After 1800, the Federalist party slowly declined. Federalists won fewer seats in Congress. In 1804, the party was greatly weakened after its leader, Alexander Hamilton, was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr. Despite its early decline, the Federalist party did help shape the new nation. Even Democratic Republican Presidents kept most of Hamilton’s economic programs.

When Thomas Jefferson took office as the third President, some Federalists were worried about his political beliefs. They knew that he supported the French Revolution and they feared that he might bring revolutionary change to the United States. They were also afraid that he might punish Federalists who had used the Alien and Sedition Acts to jail Democratic Republicans.
Jefferson’s
Presidency
Jefferson’s Leadership Redefines Government
In his inaugural address, Jefferson tried to calm Federalists’ fears. He promised that, although the Democratic Republicans were in the majority, he would not treat the Federalists harshly. “The minority possess their egual rights, which equal laws must protect,” he told the nation. He called for an end to the political disputes of the past few years. "We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists,” the President concluded.
Jefferson had no plan to punish Federalists. He did, however, want to change their policies. In his view, the Federalists had made the national government too large and too powerful.
Promoting a Free-Enterprise System One way Jefferson wanted to lessen government power was by reducing the federal budget. Such budget cuts would also keep the federal debt low. His Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin (gal uh tin), helped him achieve this goal. A financial wizard, Gallatin reduced government spending through careful management.
226
Jefferson believed in an economic idea known as laissez faire (les ay fayr), a French term meaning “let do,” meaning letting people do as they please. The idea of laissez faire was promoted by the Scottish economist Adam Smith.
In his book The Wealth of Nations, Smith argued in favor of a free-enterprise system where goods and services are exchanged with minimal government intrusion, or as little government interference as possible. Free competition, Smith said, would benefit everyone, not just the wealthy.
Laissez faire economists believed that government should play as small a role as possible in economic affairs. Laissez faire was very different from the Federalist idea of government. Alexander Hamilton, you recall, wanted government to promote trade and manufacturing.
Jefferson Minimizes Government Intrusion
Jefferson believed that the government should protect the rights of its citizens. Beyond that, he wanted the federal government to take a less active role in governing the nation. In addition to cutting the federal budget, he decreased the size of government departments. With the approval of Congress, he reduced the size of the army and navy. He also asked Congress to repeal the unpopular whiskey tax.
The Sedition Act expired the day before Jefferson took office. Jefferson hated the law, and he pardoned those who were in jail because of it. He also asked Congress to restore the law allowing foreign-born white
people to become citizens after only a five-year waiting period.
Some Federalist Economic Policies Remain
Jefferson did not discard all Federalist programs. On the advice of Albert Gallatin, he kept the Bank of the United States. The federal government also continued to pay off state debts, which it had taken over while Washington was President. In addition, Jefferson let many Federalists keep their government jobs.

The election of 1800 gave Democratic Republicans control of Congress. Federalists, however, remained powerful in the courts.
Several months passed between Jefferson’s election and his inauguration. In that time, Federalists in the old Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801, increasing the number of federal judges. President Adams then appointed Federalists to fill these new judicial positions. When Jefferson took office, Jeffersonians repealed this part of the act, firing 16 Federalist judges by abolishing their offices.

The Early Republic 227	5.4 Jefferson’s Presidency
One of the judges that Adams appointed was John Marshall, the Chief Justice of the United States. Like Jefferson, Marshall was a rich Virginia planter with a brilliant mind. Unlike Jefferson, however, Marshall was a staunch Federalist. He wanted to make the federal government stronger.
The framers of the Constitution expected the courts to balance the powers of the President and Congress. However, John Marshall found the courts to be much weaker than the other branches of government. In his view, it was not clear what powers the federal courts had.
The Issues Behind Marbury v. Madison In 1803, John Marshall showed his leadership qualities as an appointed leader by deciding a case that increased the power of the Supreme Court. The case involved William Marbury, one of the judges appointed by Adams. Adams made the appointment on his last night as President. The Republicans refused to accept this “midnight judge.” They accused Federalists of using unfair tactics to keep control of the courts. Jefferson ordered Secretary of State James Madison not to deliver the official papers confirming Marbury’s appointment.
Marbury sued Madison. According to the Judiciary Act of 1789, only the Supreme Court could decide a case

that was brought against a federal official. Therefore, the case of Marbury v. Madison was tried before the Supreme Court.
The Significance of the Marbury v. Madison Decision The Supreme Court ruled against Marbury. Chief Justice Marshall wrote the decision, stating that the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional. The Constitution, Marshall argued, did not give the Supreme Court the right to decide cases brought against federal officials. Therefore, Congress could not give the Court that power simply by passing the Judiciary Act.
As a result of Marbury v. Madison, Congress had to amend, or change, the Judiciary Act to respond to the Supreme Court’s objections. The part of the Judiciary Act of 1789 that the Supreme Court rejected could no longer be law.
The Supreme Court’s decision in Marbury v. Madison set an important precedent. It gave the Supreme Court the power to decide whether laws passed by Congress were constitutional and to reject laws that it considered to be unconstitutional. This power of the Court is called judicial review.
Presidential and Congressional Responses
Jefferson was displeased with the decision. True, Marshall had ruled against Marbury, the Federalist judge.
But Marshall’s decision gave more power to the Supreme Court, where Federalists were still strong. Jefferson also argued that the decision upset the balance of power among the three branches of government:
The opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are constitutional and what not, not only for themselves . . . but for the Legislature and Executive also . . . would make the Judiciary a [tyrannical] branch.
Thomas Jefferson, letter to Abigail Adams, 1804
Jefferson did not want the judiciary to gain power over the executive branch. He refused the Court’s order to testify at an important trial, saying it would upset the equality of the branches. He also used executive privilege to decide which government papers to show the Court and which to withhold.
In the end, the President and Congress accepted the right of the Court to overturn laws. Today, judicial

The Louisiana Purchase
The United States overcame a number of challenges in its early years, including creating a stable economic system, setting up the courts, and defining the authority of the central government. As the economy continued to grow, Americans needed to protect their economic interests. The Louisiana Territory became a key part of this effort.
Geography Shapes Domestic and Foreign Policy
A new development caused President Jefferson to pursue buying New Orleans in order to control this important port. By 1800, almost one million Americans lived between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. Most were farmers. With few roads west of the Appalachians, western farmers relied on the Mississippi River to ship their wheat and corn. First, they sent their produce down the river to the city of New Orleans. From there, oceangoing ships carried the produce across the Gulf of Mexico, around Florida, and up to ports along the Atlantic coast.
Spain, which controlled New Orleans, sometimes threatened to close the port to Americans. In 1795, President Washington sent Thomas Pinckney to find a way to keep the vital port open. In the Pinckney Treaty, Spain agreed to let Americans ship their goods down the Mississippi and store them in New Orleans.
For a time, Americans shipped their goods through New Orleans peacefully. In 1800, however, Spain signed a new treaty giving Louisiana back to the French. President Jefferson was alarmed. He knew that the French ruler, Napoleon Bonaparte, had already set out to conquer Europe. Would he now try to build an empire in North America?
Jefferson had reason to worry. Napoleon wanted to Siow food in Louisiana and ship it to French islands in the West Indies. However, events in Haiti, a French colony in the Caribbean, soon ruined Napoleon’s plan. Inspired by the French Revolution, enslaved Africans in Haiti decided to fight for their liberty. Toussaint L’Ouverture (too SAN loo vehr TYOOR) led the revolt. By Wtt, Toussaint and his followers had nearly forced the fench out of Haiti.
Napoleon sent troops to retake Haiti. Although
French captured Toussaint, they did not regain c°ntrol of the island. In 1804, Haitians declared their independence.

The Early Republic 229
5.4 Jefferson’s Presidency
Negotiations for Louisiana Jefferson sent Robert Livingston and James Monroe to buy New Orleans and West Florida from Napoleon. Jefferson said they could offer as much as $10 million. Livingston and Monroe negotiated with Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, the French foreign minister. At first, Talleyrand showed little interest in their offer. However, losing Haiti caused Napoleon to give up his plan for an empire in the Americas. He also needed money to pay for his costly wars in Europe. Suddenly, Talleyrand asked Livingston if the United States wanted to buy all of Louisiana, not just New Orleans.
The question surprised Livingston. He offered $4 million. “Too low,” replied Talleyrand. “Reflect and see me tomorrow.”
Livingston and Monroe carefully debated the matter. They had no authority to buy all of Louisiana. However, they knew that Jefferson wanted control of the Mississippi.
They agreed to pay the French $15 million for Louisiana. “This is the noblest work of our whole lives,” declared Livingston when he signed the treaty. “From this day the United States take their place among the powers of the first rank.”
The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 Jefferson hailed the news from France. Still, he was not sure whether the President had the power to purchase Louisiana. He
had always insisted that the federal government had only those powers spelled out in the Constitution. The document said nothing about a President having the power to buy land.
In the end, Jefferson decided that he did have the authority to buy Louisiana. The Constitution, he reasoned, allowed the President to make treaties, and buying the Louisiana territory was part of a treaty. Federalists opposed the purchase as unconstitutional and feared it would weaken the other states. But the Democratic Republicans supported it and the Senate approved the treaty. The Louisiana Purchase went into effect. In 1803, the United States took control of the vast lands west of the Mississippi. With one stroke, the size of the nation had almost doubled.

expedition, or long voyage of exploration. Lewis asked William Clark to go with him.
Jefferson asked Lewis and Clark to map a route to the Pacific Ocean. He also told them to study the geography of the territory, including:
. . . climate as characterized by the thermometer, by the proportion of rainy, cloudy, and clear days, by lightning, hail, snow, ice . . . the dates at which particular plants put forth or lose their flower, or leaf, times of appearance of particular birds, reptiles, or insects.
—Thomas Jefferson, letter to Meriwether Lewis, 1803
Jefferson also instructed Lewis and Clark to learn about the Native American nations who lived in the Louisiana Purchase. These Native Americans carried on a busy trade with English, French, and Spanish rnerchants. Jefferson hoped that the Indians might trade with American merchants instead. Therefore, he Wed Lewis and Clark to tell the Indians of “our wish to Le neighborly, friendly, and useful to them.”
The Expedition Begins Dozens of adventurous young men eagerly competed to join the expedition. Lewis and Clark judged volunteers on the basis of their character, strength, hunting skills, and ability to survive in the wilderness. In the end, about 50 men made up the “Corps of Discovery."
In May 1804, Lewis and Clark started up the Missouri River from St. Louis. At first, the expedition’s boats made slow progress against the Missouri’s swift current. One night, the current tore away the riverbank where they were camping. The party had to scramble into the boats to avoid being swept downstream.
Lewis and Clark Cross the Plains Eventually the expedition reached the plains of the Midwest. Lewis and Clark marveled at the broad, grassy plains that stretched “as far as the eye can reach.” Everywhere, they saw “immense herds of buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope.”
As they traveled across the plains, the expedition met people of various Native American nations. Lewis and Clark had brought many gifts for Native Americans, such as “peace medals” stamped with the United States seal. They also brought mirrors, beads, knives, blankets, and thousands of sewing needles and fishhooks.

» Not only did Lewis and Clark record their observations in words, they also drew maps and illustrations of the new things they encountered.
» This painting shows Sacajawea interpreting for Lewis and Clark. Her help made communication much easier for the expedition.
During the first winter, Lewis and Clark stayed with the Mandans in present-day North Dakota. The explorers planned to continue up the Missouri in the spring. The members of the expedition built a fort to live in over the winter. They took the opportunity to repair equipment in preparation for spring’s new challenges.
The Mandans lived along the upper Missouri River. They grew corn, beans, and squash, and hunted buffalo. During the winter, they helped the explorers find food and hunt buffalo. They also in exchange fo traded with the expedition members.
Staying with the Mandans was a woman named Sacajawea (sak uh juh WEE uh). Sacajawea belonged to the Shoshone (shoh SHOH nee) people, who lived in the Rockies. She and her French Canadian husband agreed to accompany Lewis and Clark as translators. Sacajawea carried her baby with her on the journey.
Exploring the Rocky Mountains In early spring, the party set out again. In the foothills of the Rockies, the landscape and wildlife changed. Bighorn sheep ran along the high hills. The thorns of prickly pear cactus jabbed the explorers’ moccasins. Once, a grizzly bear chased Lewis while he was exploring alone.
Crossing the Rocky Mountains meant crossing the Continental Divide. A continental divide is a ridge that separates river systems flowing toward opposite sides of a continent. In North America, some rivers flow east from the crest of the Rockies into the Mississippi, which drains into the Gulf of Mexico. Other rivers flow west from the Rockies and empty into the Pacific Ocean.
Past the Rockies, Lewis and Clark would be able to travel by river toward the Pacific. But to cross the Continental Divide, they needed horses. They began looking for the Shoshone, who had been using horses since Europeans brought them in the 1600s.
Finally, Lewis and Clark met some Shoshones. One of them was Sacajawea’s brother, whom she had not seen for many years. Upon seeing her own people, wrote Clark, she began to “dance and show every mark of the most extravagant joy.” The Shoshones supplied the expedition with the food and horses Lewis and Clark needed. They also advised them about the best route to take over the Rockies.
Lewis and Clark Reach the Pacific After building canoes, Lewis and Clark’s party floated toward the Columbia River into the Pacific Northwest. Finally, on November 7, 1805, Clark wrote in his journal, “Great joy in camp. We are in view of the ocean, this great Pacific Ocean which we have been so long anxious to see.” Lewis and Clark had reached their goal. Viewing

the Pacific from present-day Oregon, Lewis and Clark claimed the region for the United States by right of discovery.
The return trip to St. Louis took another year. In
1806,	Americans celebrated the return of Lewis and Clark. Their journey had been difficult. Clark described some of the storms and high winds he faced as “the most disagreeable time I have experienced.” But the explorers brought back much useful information about the Louisiana Territory, the land now part of the United States.
Pike’s Expedition Before Lewis and Clark returned, another explorer set out from St. Louis. From 1805 to
1807,	Zebulon Pike explored the upper Mississippi River, the Arkansas River, and parts of present-day Colorado and New Mexico. In November 1806, Pike viewed a mountain peak rising above the Colorado plains. Today, this mountain is known as Pikes Peak.
Continuing southward, Pike entered Spanish territory. Spanish troops soon arrested Pike and his men and took them into present-day Mexico. The Americans were later escorted through Texas back into the United States. The Spanish took Pike’s maps and journals, but he was able to hide one map in the barrel of his gun. His report on the expedition greatly expanded Americans’ knowledge about the Southwest.
The journeys of Pike and Lewis and Clark excited Americans. However, settlers did not move into the rugged western lands for a number of years. As you will read, they first settled the region closest to the Mississippi River. Soon, the territory around New Orleans had a large enough population of American citizens for the settlers to apply for statehood. In 1812, this territory entered the Union as the state of Louisiana.

American Shipping Faces Challenges
After the Revolution, American overseas trade grew rapidly. Ships sailed from New England on voyages that sometimes lasted three years. President Jefferson’s foreign policy during this time centered around protecting American shipping.
An Era of Trade Wherever they went, Yankee captains kept a sharp lookout for new goods and new markets. Clever traders sawed winter ice from New England ponds into blocks, packed it in sawdust, and
The Early Republic 233	5.4 Jefferson’s Presidency
carried it to India. There, they traded the ice for silk and spices. In 1784, the Empress of China, became the first American ship to trade with China. New England merchants quickly built up a profitable China trade.
More than 10 years before Lewis and Clark, Yankee merchants sailed up the Pacific coast of North America. So many traders from Boston visited the Pacific Northwest that Native Americans there called every white man “Boston.” Traders bought furs from Native Americans and sold them for large profits in China.
Jefferson Protects Trade Abroad Traders ran great risks, especially in the Mediterranean Sea. Pirates from the Barbary States, countries along the coast of North Africa, attacked passing vessels. To protect American ships, the United States paid a yearly tribute, or bribe, to rulers of the Barbary States such as Tripoli.
In 1801, Tripoli increased its demands. When Jefferson refused to pay, Tripoli declared war on the United States. Jefferson then ordered the navy to blockade the port of Tripoli.
During the blockade, the American ship Philadelphia ran aground near Tripoli. Pirates boarded the ship and hauled the crew off to prison. The pirates planned to use the Philadelphia to attack other ships.
To prevent this, American naval officer Stephen Decatur and his crew quietly sailed into Tripoli harbor by night. They then set the captured American ship on fire.
In the meantime, American marines landed on the coast of North Africa, marched 500 miles, and successfully captured, with the help of allies, the port of Derna. However, during the fight, the ruler of Tripoli signed a treaty promising not to interfere with American ships.
Caught Between France and Britain American ships faced another problem. Britain and France went to war again in 1803. At first, Americans profited from the conflict. British and French ships were too busy fighting to engage in trade. American merchants eagerly traded with both sides. As profits increased, Americans hurried to build new ships.
Neither Britain nor France wanted the United States to sell supplies to its enemy. As in the 1790s, they ignored American claims of neutrality. Napoleon seized American ships bound for England. At the same time, the British stopped Yankee traders on their way to France. Between 1805 and 1807, hundreds of American ships were captured.

Painful Embargo Jefferson knew that the small American fleet was no match for the powerful British navy. Like Washington and Adams, he sought a foreign policy that would avoid war.
An Embargo on Foreign Trade Jefferson hoped that an American embargo, or ban on trade, would hurt France and Britain by cutting off needed supplies. “Our trade is the most powerful weapon we can use in our defense,” one Democractic Republican newspaper wrote. In 1807, Jefferson persuaded Congress to impose a total embargo on foreign trade. This meant that American traders could not receive goods from European traders, and American traders could not ship their goods to Europe.
The Embargo Act did hurt Britain and France. But it hurt Americans even more. Supplies of imports such as sugar, tea, and molasses were cut off. Exports dropped by more than $80 million in one year. Docks in the South were piled high with cotton and tobacco. The Embargo Act hurt New England merchants most of all.
Merchants protested loudly against the embargo. Some turned to smuggling, importing or exporting goods in violation of trade laws. Jefferson began using the navy and federal troops to enforce the embargo. On the border between New York and Canada, some smugglers engaged in skirmishes with federal troops.
The two political parties had different points of view on the embargo. Democratic Republicans mostly supported the embargo as a way to protect the country and punish France and Britain. Most Federalists apposed the embargo as damaging to the economy.

Jefferson Scales Back the Embargo In 1809, Jefferson admitted that the Embargo Act had failed. Congress replaced it with the milder Nonintercourse Act. It allowed Americans to carry on trade with all nations except Britain and France. The Embargo Act had decreased support for the Democratic Republican party, as Americans hurt by the policy turned to the Federalists instead. Federalists favored maintaining closer relations with Britain.
They wanted to build ties with Britain because Britain was the main trading partner of the United States, and the powerful British navy could protect American merchants.
Although the embargo was the most unpopular measure of Jefferson’s presidency, the Democratic Republicans still remained strong. Following President Washington’s precedent, Jefferson refused to run for a third term. Democratic Republican James Madison easily won the 1808 presidential election. Madison hoped that Britain and France would soon agree to respect American neutrality.

\~S About 900,000 white settlers moved west of the Appalachians between 1790 and 1810. Some Native American groups resented these newcomers, who built farms on Indian lands and hunted the animals Indians needed for food. The settlers ignored treaties that the United States had signed with Native American nations of the region.



Madison and the War of 1812
Conflict in Ohio
Fighting often broke out between these Native American groups and the settlers. Isolated acts of violence led to larger acts of revenge. As both sides killed innocent people, warfare spread. In Ohio, Little Turtle of the Miamis and Blue Jacket of the Shawnees organized a resistance movement in 1791. Armed with British muskets and gunpowder, the Miamis and Shawnees drove white settlers from the area.
President Washington had sent General Anthony Wayne into Ohio in 1794. Forces from the Delaware, Miami, Iroqouis, Wabash, and others gathered at a place called Fallen Timbers.
They thought that Wayne would have trouble fighting there because fallen trees covered the land. But Wayne’s well-trained army pushed through the tangle of logs and defeated the Indians.
In 1795, leaders of the Miamis and other Native American nations signed the Treaty of Greenville. They gave up land that would later become part of Ohio. In return, they received $20,000 and the promise of more money if they kept the peace.

The Kickapoo, Ottawa, Chippewa, and Piankashaw joined with the Shawnee leaders. The Miami initially remained neutral.
The Wyandot, Seneca, and Delaware stayed allied with the United States. So did the Chocktaw, Cherokee, Chickasaw, and some sections of the Creek.

New Settlement in Indiana Territory The Prophet and Tecumseh taught that white customs corrupted the Indian way of life. They said that many Indians depended too much on white trade goods, such as muskets, cloth, cooking pots, and whiskey. They believed that by returning to their old ways, Native Americans could gain the power to resist the white invaders. In 1808, the Prophet built a village for his followers along Tippecanoe Creek in Indiana Territory. Indians from lands as far away as Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota traveled to Prophetstown to hear his message.
Tecumseh worked to organize the tribes of the Northwest into a confederation, or alliance with a shared military command. He called for unity against settlers:
The whites have driven us from the great salt water, forced us over the mountains. . . . The way, the only way, to check and stop this evil is for all red men to unite in claiming a common equal right in the land.

Fighting with Native Americans hurt relations between the United States and Britain. The British were supplying guns and ammunition to the Native Americans on the frontier. They also encouraged Indians to attack United States settlements.
Meanwhile, the ban on trade with Britain and France expired. Congress then authorized President Madison to make a tantalizing offer. If either the British or French stopped seizing American ships, the United States would reopen trade with that nation. Napoleon quickly announced that France would respect American neutrality. Britain did not respond to the offer. As promised, the United States resumed trade with France, but continued to ban all shipments to or from Britain.
The War Hawks Push for War While Madison did not want war, other Americans were not as cautious. In New England, antiwar feelings ran strong. However, members of Congress from the South and the West called for war. They were known as War Hawks.
War Hawks were stirred by a strong sense of nationalism, or devotion to one's country. War Hawks felt that Britain was treating the United States as if it were still a British colony. They were willing to fight a war to defend American rights.
The most outspoken War Hawk was Henry Clay of Kentucky. Clay wanted to punish Britain for seizing American ships. He also hoped to conquer Canada. The militia of Kentucky are alone [able] to place Montreal and Upper Canada at your feet,” Clay boasted to Congress.
War Hawks saw other advantages of war with Britain. If Americans went to war with Britain, War Bfewks said, the United States could seize Florida from

Britain’s ally, Spain. They also pointed out that Britain was arming Native Americans on the frontier and encouraging them to attack settlers.
The War Hawks felt that winning a war against Britain would bring lasting safety to settlers on the frontier.
War Is Declared The United States and Britain drifted closer to war as the security of American ships remained an issue. The British continued to board American ships and impress American seamen. To cut off American trade with France, British warships blockaded some American ports. In May 1811, near New York Harbor, a brief battle broke out between an American frigate and a British warship. The Americans crippled the British ship and left 32 British sailors dead or wounded.
The War Hawks urged Congress to prepare for war. Others in Congress disagreed. John Randolph of Virginia warned that the people of the United States would “not submit to be taxed for this war of conquest and dominion.” Representatives of New England were especially concerned. They feared that the British navy would attack New England seaports.
At last, President Madison gave in to war fever. In June 1812, he asked Congress to declare war on Britain. The House and Senate both voted in favor of war.

Americans would soon learn, though, that declaring war was easier than winning.

Early Events in the War of 1812
The American declaration of war took the British by surprise. They were locked in a bitter struggle with Napoleon and could not spare troops to fight the United States. As the war began, however, the United States faced difficulties of its own.
The Difficulties of Building a Military The United States was not ready for war. Because Jefferson had reduced spending on defense, the navy had only 16 ships to meet the huge British fleet. The army was small and ill equipped, and many of the officers knew little about warfare.“The state of the army," said a member of Congress, “is enough to make any man who has the smallest love of country wish to get rid of it."

These problems made it difficult to maintain national security.
Since there were few regular troops, the government relied on volunteers. Congress voted to give them a bounty of cash and land.
The money was equal to about a year’s salary for most workers. Attracted by the high pay and the chance to own their own farms, young men eagerly enlisted. They were poorly trained, however, with little experience in battle. Many deserted after a few months.
Surprising Victories at Sea The British navy blockaded American ports to stop American trade. Though unable to break the blockade, several American sea captains won stunning victories.
One famous battle took place early in the war, in August 1812. As he was sailing near Newfoundland, Isaac Hull, captain of the USS Constitution, spotted the British ship HMS Guerriere (geh ree air). For nearly an hour, the two ships jockeyed for position. At last, the guns of the Constitution roared into action. They tore holes in the sides of the Guerriere and shot off both masts. Stunned, the British captain had no choice but to surrender.
American sea captains won other victories at sea. These victories cheered Americans but did little to win the war.
H DESCRIBE
What problems did the United States military face?
The War in Canada
One goal of the War Hawks was to conquer Canada. They were convinced that Canadians would welcome the chance to throw off British rule and join the United States.
An Untested Force General William Hull moved American troops into Canada from Detroit. The Canadians had only a few untrained troops to ward off the invasion. However, they were led by a clever British general, Isaac Brock.
Brock paraded his soldiers in red coats to make it appear that experienced British troops were helping the Canadians. He also led Americans to think that a large number of Native Americans were fighting alongside the Canadians. Brock’s scare tactics worked. Hull retreated from Canada. Other attempts to invade Canada also failed.
However, on April 27, 1813, U.S. soldiers crossed Lake Ontario and successfully captured York, present-

day Toronto. The Americans seized British guns and supplies, and they set fire to public buildings.
American Victory on Lake Erie In 1813, the Americans, armed with the guns and supplies they had seized at York, set out to win control of Lake Erie. Captain Oliver Hazard Perry had no fleet, so he designed and built his own ships. In September 1813, he sailed his tiny fleet against the British.
During the Battle of Lake Erie, the British battered Perry's own ship and left it helpless. Perry rowed over to another American ship and continued to fight. Finally, the Americans won the battle. Captain Perry wrote his message of victory on the back of an envelope: “We have met the enemy and they are ours.”
Native American Losses in the War of 1812 After losing control of Lake Erie, the British and their ally Tecumseh retreated from Detroit into Canada. General William Henry Harrison, veteran of Tippecanoe, pursued them. The Americans won a decisive victory at the Battle of the Thames (temz). Tecumseh died in

The Burning of Washington and Victory in Baltimore In the spring of 1814, Britain and its allies defeated France. With the war in Europe over, Britain could send more troops and ships against the United States.
In August 1814, British ships sailed into Chesapeake Bay and landed an invasion force about 30 miles from Washington, D.C. American troops met the British at Bladensburg, Maryland. As President Madison

watched, the battle-hardened British quickly scattered the untrained Americans. The British met little further resistance on their march to the capital.
In the White House, First Lady Dolley Madison waited for her husband to return. Hastily, she scrawled a note to her sister:
Will you believe it, my sister? We have had a battle or skirmish near Bladensburg and here I am still within sound of the cannon! Mr. Madison comes not. May God protect us. Two messengers covered with dust come bid me fly. But here I mean to wait for him.
—Dolley Madison, Memoirs -uni /,< ■/!<.7<){	M.iHisor;
Soon after, British troops marched into the capital. Dolley Madison gathered up important papers of the President and a portrait of George Washington. Then, she fled south. She was not there to see the British set fire to the White House and other buildings. The British considered this an act of revenge for the burning of York.
From Washington, the British marched north toward the city of Baltimore. The key to Baltimore’s defense was Fort McHenry on Baltimore Harbor. From the evening of September 13 until dawn on September 14 during the Battle of Baltimore, British rockets bombarded the harbor.
When the early morning fog lifted, the "broad stripes and bright stars” of the American flag still waved over Fort McHenry. American forces had won the Battle of Baltimore. The British withdrew and the threat to the nation’s capital ended. Francis Scott Key, a young American lawyer who witnessed the battle, wrote a poem about it. Soon, his poem, "The Star-Spangled Banner,” was published and set to music. Today, it is the national anthem of the United States.
Success in New Orleans Makes Jackson a Hero
In late 1814, the British prepared to attack New Orleans. From there, they hoped to sail up the Mississippi However, Andrew Jackson was waiting. Jackson had turned his frontier fighters into a strong army.
He took Pensacola in Spanish Florida to keep the British from using it as a base. He then marched through Mobile and set up camp in New Orleans.
Jackson s force included thousands of frontiersmen and Choctaws. The Choctaws were longtime of the Indian nations who had been allied with the British. Many of Jackson’s troops were expert riflemen

Citizens of New Orleans also joined the army to defend their city from the British. Among the volunteers were hundreds of African Americans.
The American soldiers dug trenches to defend themselves. On January 8, 1815, the British attacked. Again and again, British soldiers marched toward the American trenches. More than 2,000 British fell under the deadly fire of American sharpshooters and, especially American cannons. Only seven Americans died.
Americans cheered the victory at the Battle of New Orleans. Overnight, Andrew Jackson became a national hero. His fame did not dim even when Americans learned that the battle had taken place two weeks after the war had ended.
The United States and Britain had already signed a heaty in Europe, but news took two months to cross the ocean by sail and had not yet reached the United States.
African Americans in the War The Battle of New Orleans was not the only place where black and white soldiers fought side by side. Throughout the War of 1812, African Americans joined in defending the nation gainst the British.
Following the British attacks on Washington and Baltimore, African American volunteers helped
defend Philadelphia against a possible British attack. Bishop Richard Allen and the Reverend Absalom Jones recruited more than 2,000 men to help build Philadelphia’s fortifications. The state of New York organized two regiments of black volunteers to serve in the army.
African Americans also served with distinction in the United States Navy. They helped win the Battle of Lake Erie as well as other naval battles. Commander Nathaniel Shaler praised one particular black sailor who was killed in battle:
He fell near me, and several times requested to be thrown overboard, saying he was only in the way of others. When America has such [sailors], she has little to fear from the tyrants of the ocean.

» As the commander who won victory during the Battle of New Orleans, shown here, General Andrew Jackson became a military hero. His fame would later help him become President.
The Effects of the War of 1812
By late 1814, Americans knew that peace talks had begun, but they did not know if they would succeed or how long they would last. As Jackson was preparing to fight the British at New Orleans, New Englanders were meeting to protest “Mr. Madison’s War.”
New Englanders Protest Economic Instability
The British blockade had hurt New England’s sea trade. Also, many New Englanders feared that the United States might win land in Florida and Canada. If new states were carved out of these lands, the South and the West would become more influential than New England.
Delegates from around New England met in Hartford, Connecticut, in December 1814. Most were Federalists. They disliked the Democratic Republican President and the war.
Some delegates to the Hartford Convention threatened to nullify, or cancel, the state of war in their states if the war continued. Others threatened to leave the Union.
Then, while the delegates debated what to do, news of the peace treaty arrived. The Hartford Convention ended guickly. With the war over, the protest was meaningless. In the end, the threat of secession further weakened the dying Federalist party.
The Varied Effects of the War A peace treaty was signed in the city of Ghent, in present-day Belgium, on December 24,1814. John Quincy Adams, son of John Adams and one of the American delegates, summed up the Treaty of Ghent in one sentence: "Nothing was adjusted, nothing was settled.”
Britain and the United States agreed to restore prewar conditions. The treaty said nothing about impressment or neutrality. These issues had faded due to the end of the wars in Europe. Other issues were settled later. In 1818, for example, the two nations settled a dispute over the border between Canada and the United States.
Looking back, some Americans felt that the War of 1812 had been a mistake. Others argued that Europe would now treat the young republic with more respect. The victories of heroes like Oliver Hazard Perry, William Henry Harrison, and Andrew Jackson gave Americans new pride in their country. As one Democratic Republican leader remarked, “The people are now more American. They feel and act more as a nation.”

Monroe’s Presidency
Sectionalism in the Era of Good Feelings
Monroe was the last Revolutionary War officer to become President. He was almost 60 years old when he took office, and he had old-fashioned manners.
Americans were fond of his old-fashioned ways. In 1817, he made a goodwill tour of the country. In Boston, crowds cheered Monroe enthusiastically. Boston newspapers expressed surprise at this warm welcome for a Democratic Republican from Virginia. After all, Boston had long been a Federalist stronghold.
An Era of Good Feelings Monroe hoped to create a new sense of national unity. One newspaper wrote that the United States was entering an “era of good feelings.” By the time Monroe ran for a second term in 1820, no candidate opposed him. The Federalist party had disappeared.
While conflict between political parties declined, disputes between different sections of the nation sharpened. These disputes We a result of sectionalism, or loyalty to one’s state or section rather than to the nation as a whole. In Congress, three ambitious young men took center stage in these disputes. All three would play key roles in Congress for more than 30 years, as well as serving in other offices.

Each represented a different section of the country, and each had unique leadership qualities.
Calhoun Stands for the South Against Federal Power John C. Calhoun spoke for the South. He had grown up on a frontier farm in South Carolina. Calhoun s immense energy and striking features earned him the nickname “young Hercules.”
He was slim and handsome, with deep-set eyes and a high forehead. His way of speaking was so intense that it sometimes made people uncomfortable to be in his presence.
Calhoun had supported the War of 1812. Like many southerners, he was a firm defender of slavery. In general, he opposed policies that would strengthen the power of the federal government.
Webster Speaks for the North Against Slavery and War Daniel Webster of New Hampshire was perhaps the most skillful public speaker of his time. With eyes flashing and shoulders thrown back, Webster was an impressive sight when he stood up to speak in Congress. An observer described him as a “great cannon loaded to the lips.”
Like many New Englanders, Webster had opposed the War of 1812. He even refused to vote for taxes to pay for the war effort. After the war, he wanted the federal government to take a larger role in building the nation’s

The charter that had set up the first Bank of the United States ran out in 1811. Without the Bank to lend money and regulate the nation's money supply, the economy suffered. State banks made loans and issued money. However, they often put too much money into circulation. With so much money available to spend, prices rose rapidly
In the nation’s early years, Democratic Republicans such as Jefferson and Madison had opposed a national bank because they saw it as unconstitutional.
They thought that the Constitution did not give the federal government the right to charter corporations, such as a national bank. By 1816, however, many Democratic Republicans believed that a bank was needed. They supported a law to charter the second Bank of the United States. By lending money and restoring order to the nation's money supply, the Bank helped American businesses grow.
Policies Protect Against Foreign Competition
Another economic problem facing the nation was foreign competition, especially from Britain. In the oarly 1800s, the Embargo Act and then the War of 1812 kept most British goods out of the United States. In response, ambitious American business leaders such as Francis Cabot Lowell established their own mills
and factories. As a result, American industry grew quickly until 1815.
Domestic Problems Caused by Foreign Goods
With the end of the War of 1812, British goods again poured into the United States. Because the British had a head start in industrializing, they could make and sell goods more cheaply than Americans could. Most British factory buildings and machines were older and had already been paid for. In contrast, Americans still had to pay for their new factory buildings.
Sometimes, British manufacturers sold cloth in the United States for less than it cost to make so that they could capture the market. British manufacturers hoped to put American rivals out of business. Then, the British planned to raise prices.
The Regional Impacts of Tariffs This British strategy caused dozens of New England businesses to fail. Angry owners asked Congress to place a protective tariff on all goods imported from Europe. As you have read, the purpose of a protective tariff is to protect a country's industries from foreign competition.
Congress responded by passing the Tariff of 1816. It greatly raised tariffs on imports. This increase made imported goods far more expensive than similar American-made goods.

The Early Republic 247	5.6 Monroe’s Presidency
» Daniel Webster supported a tariff to help northern industry.
» A slow freight wagon and a fast mail coach make their way down the National Road, built with federal support. Congress spent little on such roads, however.
The Tariff of 1816 impacted the North, West, and South differently because each region had a different economy. The North was the base of America’s manufacturing. It therefore benefited the most. Higher prices on foreign goods made American goods more competitive. American factories sold more products, and businesses grew.
The economies of the South and West relied heavily on farming. They were not as financially invested in manufacturing and therefore did not experience the same benefits as the North. Goods like cloth and iron became more expensive to southern and western consumers. Northerners gained income as a result.
Higher tariffs led to angry protests. Lacking factories, southerners did not benefit from the tariff. Also, southerners bought many British goods. The new tariff drove up the price of British-made goods. Southerners complained that the tariff made northern manufacturers rich at the expense of the South.
Henry Clay Combats Sectionalism The bitter
dispute over tariffs contributed to the growth of sectionalism. Americans identified themselves as southerners, northerners, or westerners. In Congress, representatives from different sections often clashed.
Henry Clay wanted to promote economic growth for all sections. His program, known as the American System, called for high tariffs on imports, which would help northern factories. With wealth from industry, Clay believed, northerners would have the money to buy farm products from the West and the South. High tariffs would also reduce American dependence on foreign goods.
Clay also urged Congress to use money from tariffs to build roads, bridges, and canals. A better transportation system, he believed, would make it easier and cheaper for farmers in the West and the South to ship goods to city markets.
Clay’s American System never fully went into effect. While tariffs remained high, Congress spent little on internal improvements—new roads, bridges, and canals. Southerners in particular disliked Clay’s plan. The South had many fine rivers on which to transport goods. Many southerners opposed paying for roads and canals that brought them no direct benefits.
Some Americans also thought Clay's plan for developing transportation with federal support was unconstitutional. They did not believe the federal government had the authority to build such projects. They believed that by regulating industry and building

roads and canals, the federal government would gain too much power.
CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why did many states in the South and West oppose the Tariff of 1816?
Supreme Court Decisions Expand Federal Power
Under Chief Justice John Marshall, the Supreme Court strengthened the power of the federal government. The Court gave the federal government the power to regulate the economy.
A
Broad Definition of “Necessary and Proper” After Congress chartered the second Bank of the United States, Maryland tried to tax the Bank in order to drive it out of the state. James McCulloch, the Bank cashier, refused to pay the tax.
In the case of McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), the Court ruled that states had no right to interfere with federal institutions within their borders. The ruling strengthened federal power. It also allowed the Bank of the United States to continue, which helped the economy to expand.
The Court decision addressed the issue of the meaning of the “necessary and proper” clause of the U.S. Constitution. It ruled that the federal government had the power to charter the Bank of the United States under the clause. This clause states that “The Congress shall have Power ... To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper” for carrying out functions outlined elsewhere in the Constitution. Since the Constitution gave the federal government the power to tax and borrow money and to regulate business, the Court stated that creating a bank could be considered "necessary and proper” to carrying out these powers.
The Supreme Court took a “loose constructionist” view of the Constitution, believing that the “necessary and proper” clause should be interpreted loosely as circumstances changed. Many Americans disagreed with the Court. Those who disagreed took a “strict constructionist” view that the “necessary and proper” clause permitted only actions absolutely necessary for performing the government’s constitutional duties. Strict constructionists generally agreed that the Bank of the United States was not truly necessary for the government to function.
Broad Powers Over Interstate Trade In another case, Gibbons v. Ogden (1824), the Supreme Court

upheld the power of the federal government to regulate trade between states. The Court struck down a New York law that tried to control steamboat travel between New York and New Jersey. The Court ruled that a state could regulate trade only within its own borders. Only the federal government had the power to regulate interstate commerce, or trade between different states. This decision helped the national economy by making it easier for the government to regulate trade.
These rulings not only affected the government. They also changed daily life for people in the United States. The New York law had given a monopoly, or exclusive rights, to Robert Fulton’s steamboat company to run ferries to New Jersey. Fulton’s company was the only one allowed to run ferries between the two states.
When the Supreme Court struck down this New York law, Fulton’s monopoly on steamboat traffic ended. As a result, his company could not compete with companies that charged a lower fare, and people working for Fulton lost their jobs. However, the increased competition was good for consumers because it led to lower fares.
Many people also liked this ruling because it created a single national market for goods and services, regulated by the federal government. Having clear

national laws to follow made it easier for people to do business and move goods and services nationwide.

How did the decision in McCulloch v. Maryland increase federal power?
Latin America Wins
Independence
By 1810, many people in Spain’s colonies in the Americas were eager for independence. They had many reasons to be unhappy. Most people, even wealthy creoles, had little or no say in government. In Latin America, the term creole described people born to Spanish parents there. They demanded a role in government. Opposition to Spain was also growing among Native Americans. Harsh rules kept Native Americans forever in debt. All over Latin America, people were eager to be free of the Spanish.
Mexico Gains Independence A Mexican priest named Miguel Hidalgo (mee GEL ee DAHL goh) called on Mexicans to fight for independence from Spain in 1810. Many Mexicans answered his call. Rebel forces won control of several provinces before Father Hidalgo was captured. In 1811, Hidalgo was executed.
Another priest, Jose Morelos (hoh SAY moh RAYlohs), took up the fight. Because he called for a program to give land to peasants, wealthy creoles opposed him. Before long, Morelos, too, was captured and killed by the Spanish.
Slowly, though, creoles began to join the revolutionary movement. In 1821, revolutionary forces led by creoles won control of Mexico. A few years later, Mexico became a republic with its own constitution.
Freedom From Spanish Rule in South America In
South America, too, a series of revolutions freed colonies from Spanish rule. The best-known revolutionary leader was Simon Bolivar (see MOHN boh LEE vahr). He became known as the Liberator for his role in the Latin American wars of independence.
Bolivar came from a wealthy creole family in Venezuela. As a young man, he took up the cause of Venezuelan independence. Bolivar promised, "I will never allow my hands to be idle, nor my soul to rest until I have broken the shackles which chain us to Spain.”
Bolivar rose to become a leader of the rebel forces. In a bold move, he led an army from Venezuela over the high Andes Mountains into Colombia. There, Bolivar took the Spanish forces by surprise and defeated them in 1819.

In 1821, the peoples of Central America declared independence from Spain. Two years later, they formed the United Provinces of Central America.
It included the present-day nations of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. By 1825, Spain had lost all its colonies in Latin America except Puerto Rico and Cuba.
The Portuguese colony of Brazil won independence peacefully. When Brazilian revolutionaries demanded independence, Prince Pedro, son of the Portuguese king, joined their cause. He became emperor of the new independent nation of Brazil in 1822.
The New Republics Spain’s former colonies modeled their constitutions on that of the United States. Yet, their experience after independence was very different fr°ni that of their neighbor to the north. Unlike the People of the 13 British colonies, the peoples of Latin
America did not unite into a single country. In part, geography made unity difficult. Latin America covered a much larger area than the British colonies. Thick rain forests and mountains such as the high, rugged Andes acted as barriers to travel and communication. Also, the Spanish colonies were spread out over a huge area. Therefore, several separate republics formed.
The new republics had a hard time setting up stable governments. Under Spanish rule, the colonists had gained little or no experience in self-government. Powerful leaders took advantage of the turmoil to seize control. As a result, the new nations were often unable to achieve democratic rule.
B IDENTIFY CENTRAL IDEAS
What characteristics of physical geography made it more difficult for Latin American colonies to unite than it had been for the United States?
Gaining Florida
Spain lost another one of its colonies, Florida—not to independence, but to the United States. Many Americans wanted to gain possession of Florida. White southerners were especially worried about disturbances across the border. Creeks and Seminoles in Florida sometimes raided settlements in Georgia.
The Early Republic 251	5.6 Monroe’s Presidency
Also, Florida was a refuge for many Africans and African Americans who escaped slavery.
Jackson Invades Spanish Florida Since the 1700s, Spanish officials had protected enslaved Africans who had fled from plantations in Georgia and South Carolina. Seminoles allowed Africans to live near their villages. In return, these “black Seminoles” gave the Seminoles a share of the crops they raised. The black Seminoles adopted many Seminole customs.
One settlement on the Apalachicola River known as the Negro Fort contained about 1,000 black Seminoles. General Andrew Jackson demanded that Spain demolish the Negro Fort. When the Spanish governor refused, the United States invaded Florida and destroyed the fort.
Adams Buys Florida In 1818, Jackson again headed to Florida with a force of more than 3,000 soldiers. Spain protested but did little else. It was busy fighting rebels in Latin America and could not risk war with the United States.
In the end, Spain agreed to peace talks. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams worked out a treaty with Spain’s foreign minister, Luis de Onis (loo ess day oh NEES). In it, Spain agreed to give Florida to the United

States in exchange for $5 million. The Adams-Onis Treaty took effect in 1821.
E2 DESCRIBE
What was the result of the Adams-Onis Treaty? The Monroe Doctrine
Americans cheered as Latin American nations won independence. The actions of European powers, however, worried Secretary of State Adams and President Monroe. In 1815, Prussia, France, Russia, and Austria formed an alliance aimed at crushing any revolution that sprang up in Europe. They seemed ready to help Spain regain its colonies in Latin America. In addition, Russia claimed lands on the Pacific coast of North America.
The British, too, worried about other European nations meddling in the Western Hemisphere. They feared that their profitable trade with the newly independent countries would be hurt if Spain regained control of its former colonies. Thus, they suggested that the United States and Britain issue a joint statement guaranteeing the freedom of the new nations of Latin America.
Monroe decided to act independently of Britain. In a message to Congress in 1823, he made a bold foreign policy statement, known as the Monroe Doctrine. Monroe declared that the United States would not interfere in the affairs of European nations or existing colonies of the European nations. At the same time, he warned European nations not to attempt to regain control of the newly independent nations of Latin America.
The Monroe Doctrine stated that the United States would oppose any attempt to reclaim old colonies or build new colonies in the Americas. Monroe's message showed that the United States was determined to keep European powers out of the Western Hemisphere.
The United States did not have the military power to enforce the Monroe Doctrine. Britain, however, supported the statement. With its strong navy, it could stop Europeans from building new colonies in the Americas.
As the United States became stronger, the Monroe Doctrine grew in importance. On several occasions, the United States successfully challenged European intervention, or direct involvement, in Latin America. In the 1900s, Presidents also used the Monroe Doctrine to justify sending troops to Caribbean nations. Thus,

C establishing political alliances with foreign nations could weaken American military power
D establishing political alliances with foreign nations could eventually force the United States into war
2 Which claim did Thomas Jefferson make in his argument against the federal government establishing a national bank?
F
The U.S. Constitution does not give the federal government the power to establish a national bank. G A
system of state banks under the control of the federal government is better than one national bank. H
Congress should not have to split its power to set and oversee the federal budget with a national bank. J
The nation was already deeply in debt, and the cost of running a national bank would increase this debt further. I

During the early 1800s, a growing spirit of democracy changed the political system and affected American ideas	|
about social classes. The main cause stemmed from the influence of Andrew Jackson. He was an American politician during this time who supported expanding democratic rights. From the time of his first campaign for president in 1824 until his death in 1845, he dominated American politics. Jackson's policies had a significant effect on issues such as voting rights and the ways in which government functions. This period is often known as the Age of Jackson.

» Objectives
Describe who gained suffrage by the 1820s.
Identify compromises made after the 1824 election, including the roles of Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams.
Explain the origin and development of new political parties under John Quincy Adams.
Describe the causes and effects of Jacksonian democracy and the impact of the election of Andrew Jackson.
Explain the spoils system.
The Age of Jackson
Increased Suffrage During the 1820s, or the early years of the Age of Jackson, more Americans gained suffrage, or the right to vote. Others, however, were denied full participation in the growing democracy.
The United States was growing rapidly. New states were joining the Union, and there were many citizens eager to participate in elections. Some of the first states to give voting privileges to white males who did not own property were in the West. In these states, any white man over age 21 could vote.
Reformers in the East worked to expand suffrage in that region. By the 1830s, most eastern states had dropped the requirement that voters had to own land. In this way, many craft workers and shopkeepers won the right to vote.
Throughout the country, growing numbers of Americans exercised their newly acquired right to vote. Before 1828, the turnout of eligible voters was never more than 27 percent. That low percentage rose to nearly 58 percent in the election of 1828. By 1840, voter turnout was nearly 80 percent.
Limits on Suffrage Despite the nation’s growing democratic spirit, a great many Americans did not have the right to vote. They included women, Native Americans, and the vast majority of African Americans. Slaves had no political rights at all. Meanwhile, the few states that still required white men to own property to vote failed to remove that barrier during Jackson’s presidency.
Although most white men had won suffrage, free African Americans had lost it. In the early years of the nation, most northern states and a few southern states allowed free African American men to vote. By the 1820s, however, many of these states had taken away that right. By 1830, only a few New England states permitted free African American men to vote on equal terms with white men. In New York, African American men had to own property in order to vote while white men did not. No state allowed enslaved African Americans to vote.
bi RECALL How did democracy expand during the
Age of Jackson?
The Election of 1824 Leads to a “Bargain”
There were four candidates for president in 1824. All four were members of the old Republican Party. However, each had support in different parts of the country. John Quincy Adams was strong in New England. Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson had support in the West. William H. Crawford was favored in the South, but became too ill to campaign.
The Candidates John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts was the son of Abigail and John Adams, the second president. A graduate of Harvard University, the younger Adams had served as Secretary

Democracy Expands
Alexis de Tocqueville Most Americans did not feel that the rich deserved special respect. Wealthy European visitors to the United States were surprised that American servants expected to be treated as equals. Others were amazed that butlers and maids refused to be summoned with bells, as in Europe.
A visitor from France, Alexis de Tocqueville became especially well known for his observations on American democracy. He arrived in the United States in 1831. The French government had sent him to study the American prison system. For several months, Tocqueville toured much of the United States. However, he observed much more than prisons. He observed a society that was becoming more and more democratic.
After his return to France, Tocqueville recorded his experiences and observations in a book titled Democracy in America. In it, he admired the American democratic spirit and the American goals of equality and freedom. He found that the results of the social “revolution taking place” in America, while “still far from coming to an end," were “already incomparably greater than anything which has taken place in the world before.”

Crawford had served as Treasury Secretary, War Secretary, Ambassador to France after the War of 1812, and as a senator from Georgia. Crawford’s support was concentrated in the Southeast.
To many Americans, especially on the western frontier, Andrew Jackson was a hero. A general during the War of 1812, he had defeated the British and a group of Creek Indians who were allied with the British. He had gone on to defeat the Seminoles and the Spanish in Florida, gaining that territory for the United States. He was known as the “Hero of New Orleans” for his victory in the War of 1812. He also earned the nickname “Old Hickory” after a soldier said he was “tough as hickory.” Jackson’s fame as a general helped him launch a political career. Although he was a
landowner and a slave owner, many saw him as a man of the people. Jackson had been born in a log cabin, and his parents had been poor farmers. He was admired by small farmers and others who felt left out of the growing economy in the United States. The expansion of the vote to white men without property helped account for Jackson’s political popularity.
The “Corrupt Bargain” No clear winner emerged from the election of 1824. Jackson won the popular vote, but no candidate won a majority, or more than half, of the electoral votes. As a result, under the provisions of the Constitution, the House of Representatives had to choose the president from among the top three candidates. Because he had finished fourth, Clay was out of the running. As Speaker of the House, though, he played an important role in influencing the results and reaching a compromise to settle the conflict.
Clay urged members of the House to vote for Adams. Clay’s support was enough for Adams to win the vote in the House. After he became president, Adams named Clay his Secretary of State. In the past, Secretaries of State had gone on to become president. Jackson and his backers were furious. They accused Adams and Clay of making a “corrupt bargain” and stealing the election from Jackson. In fact, the election was decided based on provisions of the Constitution. Still, the anger

CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why did some people refer to the 1824 election result as a “corrupt bargain”?
The Presidency of John Quincy Adams
Adams knew that the outcome of the election had angered many Americans. To “bring the whole people together, he pushed for a program of economic growth through internal improvements. His plan backfired, however, and opposition to him grew.
Promoting Economic Growth Like Alexander Hamilton and Henry Clay, Adams thought that the federal government should promote economic growth. He called for the government to pay for new roads and canals. These internal improvements would help farmers to transport goods to market.
Adams also favored projects to promote the arts and the sciences. He suggested building a national university and an observatory from which astronomers could study the stars. Most Americans objected to spending money on such programs. They feared that the federal government would become too powerful. Congress approved money for a national road and some canals but turned down most of Adams’s other programs.
Origin of New Political Parties During the 1820s, nearly all politicians were members of Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican Party. In the 1830s, however, new political parties took shape. These parties grew out of the conflict between John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson.
The Whig Party Democratic-Republicans who supported Adams and his programs for national growth called themselves National Republicans. In 1834, many of them joined a new party, organized by Henry Clay and known as the Whig Party.
Whigs had very specific points of view. Whigs wanted the federal government to promote business by paying for roads and canals. Whigs believed that the federal government should oversee banks. They believed that a stable banking system would encourage business. Whigs also wanted higher tariffs.
The Whigs had their strongest support the Northeast, with some support in cities and towns in the South and West. People from these places backed the Whigs because these places relied on manufacturing

and commerce, and Whig policies aimed to help those parts of the economy.
Tariffs are taxes or fees placed on imported goods. By making imports more expensive, they help domestic producers. However, they may prompt foreign governments to impose tariffs in response. So tariffs can threaten exporters. Those who supported the Whigs included eastern factory owners and other businessmen, some southern planters, and many former Federalists. Whigs were often divided into factions, and not all of the party’s members always followed the party’s direction.
The Democratic Party Jackson and other Democratic-Republicans who supported him began to call themselves the Democratic Party. Today’s Democratic Party traces its roots to Andrew Jackson’s time. Like the Whig Party, Democrats also had a point of view. They called for more political power for ordinary white men and opposed privileges for the wealthy or educated. Democrats were opposed to tariffs and a federal government role in the economy.
Democrats opposed high tariffs, because farmers counted on being able to sell their goods overseas and did not want to risk retaliatory tariffs. They also did not want to pay more for imported goods. Democrats
The Age of Jackson and Westward Expansion 269	6.1 The Age of Jackson
supported westward expansion to open up more land for frontier settlers.
Democrats were usually more tightly organized than Whigs. Members usually followed the direction set by party leaders. Democrats had strong support in the South and West, especially among small farmers and workers. These groups also supported Democrats in some parts of the Northeast. Small farmers and workers supported the Democrats because Democrats spoke up for small farmers, workers, and Westerners against bankers and Northeastern businessmen.
A
Bitter Campaign In 1828, Adams faced an uphill battle for reelection. This time, Andrew Jackson was Adams’s only opponent. The campaign was a bitter contest. The focus was not on issues, but on the candidates’ personalities. Jackson supporters renewed charges that Adams had made a “corrupt bargain” after the 1824 election. They also attacked Adams as an aristocrat, or member of the upper class. Adams supporters replied with similar attacks. They called Jackson a dangerous "military chieftain.” If Jackson became President, they warned, he could become a dictator like Napoleon Bonaparte of France.
Jackson won the election easily. His supporters cheered the outcome as a victory for the common people. By common people, they meant white people who worked for a living, including farmers and city
workers. For the first time, the politics of the common people were important.
Q SUMMARIZE
Why did Andrew Jackson win the election of 1828? Jacksonian Democracy
Like many who admired him, Jackson was born in a log cabin on the frontier. His parents had left Ireland to settle in the Carolinas. Both died before Jackson was 15. Jackson had to grow up quickly.
Although he was lean, he was a strong fighter. A friend who wrestled with him recalled, “I could throw him three times out of four, but he would never stay throwed.”
Always determined, Jackson showed his toughness at 13 when he joined the Patriots during the American Revolution. He was captured by the British while carrying messages for the Patriots. When a British officer ordered the young prisoner to clean his boots, Jackson refused. The officer took a sword and slashed the boy’s hand and face.
After the Revolution, Jackson studied law in North Carolina. He later moved to Tennessee and set up a successful law practice. Over time he became very wealthy by buying and selling land in Georgia and

Alabama. While still in his twenties, he was elected to Congress. He served for just a few years before becoming a judge and a major general in the Tennessee militia.
Jackson won national fame for his achievements during the War of 1812. He led American forces to a major victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans. He was also known for his leadership during the Creek War. A group of Creeks, angered in part by white settlers moving onto their land, began to attack settlers. These Creeks massacred at least 250 people, including soldiers and their families, at Fort Mims, in present-day Alabama. Commanding an army sent to stop the attacks, Jackson’s victory at Horseshoe Bend forced the Creeks to give up vast amounts of land in what are now Georgia and Alabama.
Andrew Jackson was a complex person. He had led a violent and adventurous life. He was quick to lose his temper, and he dealt with his enemies harshly. When he became president, his opponents sarcastically called him "King Andrew.” Jackson intended to be a strong president by expanding the powers of the presidency. At the same time, Jackson's supporters admired his ability to inspire and lead others. They considered him a man of his word and a champion of the common people.
As Jackson traveled to Washington to be inaugurated, large crowds cheered him along the way. For the first time, thousands of ordinary people flooded the capital to watch the President take the oath of office. After Jackson was sworn in, the crowd followed the new president to a reception at the White House. One onlooker described the scene with amazement:
Country men, farmers, gentlemen, mounted and dismounted, boys, women and children, black and white. Carriages, wagons, and carts all pursuing [Jackson] to the President’s house.
—Margaret Bayard Smith, Tlia First Fatty Years ot

The crowds were so huge, the observer continued, that the President was “almost suffocated and torn to pieces by the people in their eagerness to shake hands.” Jackson’s critics said the scene showed that King Mob” was ruling the nation. Amos Kendall, a loyal Jackson supporter, viewed the inauguration celebration in a more positive way: “It was a proud day for the people. General Jackson is their own President.

Causes of Jacksonian Democracy Andrew Jackson was elected in 1828 largely because white men without property could now vote. He drew much of his support from these people. In return, he promised to help less wealthy white men, and especially small farmers on the western frontier. The spread of political power to more people was part of what became known as Jacksonian democracy.
Effects of Jacksonian Democracy Jackson was the first westerner to occupy the White House. His election marked a shift of political power to the West. He was seen as a daring individualist. His image helped shape an American consciousness focused on individual freedom and daring.
Another effect of Jacksonian democracy was the growth in political parties and in citizen participation in the political process. It was one thing to make it legal for nearly all white men to vote. It was another thing to convince them to vote.
Jackson's Democratic Party introduced political campaigns that appealed to common people and their

A
Conflict Over States’ Rights The conflict over states’ rights divided the country along regional lines. The United States at the time was made up of three regions. The North included the New England and Middle Atlantic states. Manufacturing and trade were very important to the economy of the North. The West was the region we now know as the Midwest. Its economy was based mainly on farming to raise livestock and food crops. Finally the South consisted of today’s Southeast and South Central states. The South’s people relied heavily on farming to produce cash crops for export, such as cotton and tobacco.
Politically northerners generally favored a strong federal government, which they saw as necessary to promote manufacturing and trade. Southerners feared the domination of the North and national Policies that could hurt southern interests. Consequently, southerners tended to support stronger states’ rights. These differences often made it hard for people from the North and South to agree on political issues.
Westerners sometimes sided with the North and sometimes with the South. For example, westerners wanted internal improvements for transportation, which most northerners supported. Westerners also wanted to be free to move into new territories, which southerners also

wanted. Some westerners supported slavery, while others did not. In general, westerners agreed with northerners about tariffs.
Anger Over Tariffs In 1828, with the support of then President John Quincy Adams, Congress passed the highest tariff in the history of the nation. Southerners called it the Tariff of Abominations.
An abomination is something that is wrong and evil. Just like earlier tariffs, the new law, which was passed before Andrew Jackson’s first term, protected manufacturers from foreign competition.
Most manufacturers lived in the North and were helped by the tariff. Southern planters, however, were hurt by it. Southerners sold much of their cotton to Britain and bought British manufactured goods in return. A high tariff would mean that southerners had to pay more for those British goods. Worse still, they feared that if the United States imposed a tariff on British manufactures, Britain could respond by imposing a tariff on American cotton. Many southerners thought the tariff was unconstitutional.
Debate Over Nullification A leader in the South's fight against the tariff was Vice President John Calhoun, whose home state was South Carolina. He claimed that a state had the right to nullify, or cancel, a federal law

that the state considered to be unconstitutional. This idea is called nullification. Calhoun believed that the states’ rights gave them power over the provisions of the Constitution.
He argued that states could reject federal laws that they thought violated the constitution, because the states had joined together to form the federal government based on their understanding of the Constitution.
Daniel Webster, a Senator from Massachusetts, disagreed. He made a speech in 1830 to the Senate attacking the idea of nullification. The Constitution, he said, united the American people, not just the states, as a nation. If states had the right to nullify federal laws, the nation would fall apart. The U.S. Supreme Court had also ruled against earlier attempts at nullification, arguing that the provisions of Article III of the U.S. Constitution gave federal courts, not states, the right to decide on the constitutionality of federal laws. President Jackson agreed with the views of Webster and the Supreme Court. Because Calhoun strongly disagreed with Jackson, he resigned from the office of Vice President. He was then elected as a senator from South Carolina. The debate over nullification would continue for years.
The Nullification Act Leads to Crisis Anger against the tariff increased in the South. Congress passed a new law in 1832 that lowered the tariff slightly. South Carolina was not satisfied. It passed the Nullification Act, declaring the new tariff illegal. It also threatened to secede, or withdraw, from the Union if challenged. Jackson was furious. He knew that nullification could lead to civil war.
To defuse the crisis, Henry Clay, now a senator from Kentucky, proposed a lower compromise tariff, which President Jackson supported. Jackson also asked Congress to pass the Force bill, which allowed him to use the army, if necessary, to enforce the tariff. Daniel Webster sided with Jackson on the Force bill but opposed Clay’s compromise tariff. However, Congress passed both the compromise tariff and the Force bill.
Faced with Jackson’s firm stand, no other state chose to support South Carolina. Calhoun supported the compromise tariff that Clay had proposed. South Carolina repealed its Nullification Act, and the Nullification Crisis passed. National identity had proven stronger than the claim of a single state.
However, tensions between the North and South would lead to increased sectionalism in the years ahead.

The Bank War
Another political battle President Jackson waged during his first term as President was one against the Second Bank of the United States. Like many westerners, he thought that the Bank was too powerful and needed to be eliminated. Jackson’s Democratic Party opposed the Bank. The Whig Party, however, supported the Bank. Whigs believed that the Bank was needed to regulate state banks' lending to prevent a buildup of debts that could not be repaid.
A
Controversial Bank The Bank of the United States had been a subject of dispute since its early days. The Bank had great power over the nation’s banking system because it controlled loans made by state banks. When the Bank’s directors thought that state banks were making too many loans, they limited the amount these banks could lend. The cutbacks angered farmers and Merchants who borrowed money to buy land or finance hew businesses. President Jackson and other leading Democrats saw the Bank as undemocratic. Although Congress created the Bank, it was run by private bankers. Jackson condemned these men as agents of “special privilege who grew rich with public funds. He especially disliked Nicholas Biddle, president of the Bank since 1823.
Biddle came from a wealthy Philadelphia family. He was well qualified to run the bank. Under Biddle, the
U.S. economy had experienced stability and prosperity. However, Biddle was arrogant and vain. Jackson felt that Biddle used the Bank to benefit the rich. He also resented Biddle’s influence over certain members of Congress.
The Bank Applies for Renewal Biddle and other Whigs worried that the President might try to destroy the Bank. Two Whig senators, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, thought of a way to save the Bank and defeat Jackson in the upcoming election at the same time.
The Bank’s charter was not due for renewal by Congress until 1836. However, Clay and Webster wanted to make the Bank an issue in the 1832 election. They persuaded Biddle to apply for renewal early.
However, Clay and Webster wanted to make the Bank an issue in the 1832 election. They persuaded Biddle to apply for renewal early.
The Whigs believed that most Americans appreciated the role of the Bank in the nation’s prosperity. If Jackson vetoed the bill to renew the charter, they felt sure that he would anger voters and lose the election. Clay pushed the charter renewal bill through Congress in 1832. Jackson was sick in bed when he heard that Congress had renewed the Bank’s charter. “The Bank ... is trying to kill me,” Jackson fumed, “but I will kill it!”
Jackson Cuts Off the Bank In an angry message to Congress, Jackson vetoed the Bank bill. He gave two reasons for his veto. First, he said that the Bank was unconstitutional, even though in McCulloch v. Maryland the Supreme Court had ruled in the Bank’s favor. Like other Democrats, Jackson believed that the federal government could not charter a bank, because the Constitution did not explicitly give it the power to do so. However, the Supreme Court had ruled that the Constitution implicitly gave the federal government this right in the “necessary and proper clause.”
This clause states that the federal government has the power “To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the . . . Powers [already described], and all other Powers vested by this Constitution.” The Supreme Court had decided that the “necessary and proper” clause gave the government the power to charter a national bank. Jackson believed that only states had the right to charter banks.
Jackson also felt that the Bank helped aristocrats at the expense of the common people. He warned:
When the laws undertake ... to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of the society—the farmers, mechanics, and laborers—who have neither the
time nor the means of [getting] like favors for themselves . . . have a right to complain of the injustices of their government.
—Andrew Jackson, Veto Message, July 10, 1832
As planned, the Whigs made the Bank a major issue in the election of 1832. They chose Henry Clay as their candidate to run against Andrew Jackson.
When the votes were counted, however, they showed that Jackson had won a stunning election victory. The common people had surprised the Whigs by supporting Jackson and rejecting the Bank of the United States.
The Bank Loses Its National Role Without a new charter, the Bank would have to close in 1836. Jackson refused to wait. He ordered Secretary of the Treasury Roger Taney to stop putting government money in the Bank. Instead, Taney deposited federal money in state banks. They became known as pet banks because Taney and his friends controlled many of them. The loss of federal money crippled the Bank of the United States. Its elimination as a national bank was another effect of Jackson’s presidency. The end of the Bank's role in regulating lending contributed to an economic crisis that would have to be faced by the next President of the United States.
Without a national bank to regulate the country’s financial system, responsibility for regulating banks fell to individual states. The period from the late 1830s until the 1860s is known as the state banking era. During this time, each state set its own rules for banks.
Many banks issued loans in the form of paper money, and promised to redeem it with silver or gold. Because federal law defined the value of dollars in terms of silver and gold, state banks sometimes failed when they did not have enough silver or gold on hand to redeem the paper money they had issued.

Economic Crisis and Political Changes
Following tradition, Andrew Jackson left office after two terms. Americans then elected Martin Van Buren as President. Although Van Buren did not have Jackson’s popularity, he was clever and intelligent. As President, however, Van Buren needed more than sharp political instincts.
The Panic of 1837 Two months after taking office, Van Buren faced the worst economic crisis the nation had known. After the Bank of the United States closed, state banks could lend money without limit. To meet the demand for loans, state banks printed more and more paper money. Often, they did not have enough gold or silver to back their paper money.
Before leaving office, Jackson was alarmed at wild speculation, or risky investment, in land. Speculators were borrowing more and more money to buy land and driving land prices up. To slow this process down, he ordered that anyone buying public land had to pay for it with gold or silver. Speculators and others rushed to state banks to exchange their paper money for gold and silver. Many banks had lent too much money. They did not have enough gold and silver and were forced to close.
The nation soon plunged into a deep economic depression, a period when the economy shrinks and many people lose their jobs. The depression lasted five years. During the worst period, 90 percent of the nation’s factories were closed. Unemployment was widespread. Hundreds of thousands of people were out of work.
Many Americans blamed Van Buren and his policies for the economic depression. Van Buren believed in laissez-faire economics—the idea that government should play as small a role as possible in the economy. As the depression wore on, Van Buren became increasingly unpopular. His opponents called him “Martin Van Ruin.”
Party Caucuses and Conventions By the time the next election for President occurred in 1840, Whigs and Democrats had developed more democratic ways to choose candidates for President. In the past, powerful members of each party held a caucus, or private meeting. There, they choose their candidate. Critics called the caucus system undemocratic because only a few powerful people were able to take part in it.
In the 1830s, each party began to hold a nominating convention, where delegates from all the states chose hie party's candidate for President. Party leaders might

still dominate a particular convention, hut the people could now have some influence in the nominating process. Also, state nominating conventions encouraged citizen participation in elections. Once citizens learned about the events of the convention, they would work for their party’s choices. Today, the major political parties still hold conventions.
Democrats Lose the Election of 1840 Although Van Buren had lost support, the Democrats chose him to run for reelection in 1840. The Whigs chose William Henry Harrison of Ohio as their presidential candidate and John Tyler of Virginia as their vice presidential candidate.
Harrison was known as the hero of the Battle of Tippecanoe, which was fought between the American military and a Shawnee-led alliance in 1811. To appeal to voters, the Whigs focused on Harrison’s war record. “Tippecanoe and Tyler too” became their campaign slogan. The Whigs created an image for Harrison as a “man of the people” from the western frontier. They presented him as a humble farmer and boasted that he had been born in a log cabin. In fact, the Whigs' candidate, Harrison, was a wealthy, educated man who, at the time of the campaign, lived in a large mansion.

A
History of Conflict and Prejudice On both sides, biases, stereotypes, and prejudices led to mistrust and hostility. White settlers saw Native Americans as dangerous and untrustworthy. Native Americans feared that settlers’ hunger for land could never be satisfied and that settlers meant to kill them off. These fears fueled many bloody conflicts.
Before the Revolution, the British had made peace with Native American groups by drawing the Proclamation Line of 1763 through the Appalachian Mountains, roughly along the frontier, or edge, of white settlement. The British forbade whites to settle west of this hne. The line gave Native Americans west of the line and east of the Mississippi River some protection.

of Tippecanoe was a major defeat for Native American leader Tecumseh and his forces during this time of unrest.
When conflict between Britain and the United States broke out again in the War of 1812, many, but not all, Native American groups again sided with the British. A group of Creek Indians in present-day Georgia and Alabama formed an alliance with both Tecumseh and the British. Meanwhile, other Creeks and the neighboring Choctaw people sided with the United States. As you have learned, forces led by Andrew Jackson defeated the Creeks allied with the British.
Tensions on the Frontier The Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole, and Cherokee nations lived in parts of what are now Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. The Shawnee, Potawatomi, Sauk, and Fox nations lived in parts of present-day Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Many hoped to live in peace with their white neighbors on the frontier.
Some tribes, like the Cherokee nation, had adopted European customs hoping to preserve their land. They created a legal system and government that blended European and Cherokee traditions. Others, like the Choctaw, believed they would be allowed to keep their
land because they had sided with the United States during the War of 1812.
In 1821, Sequoyah (suh KWOH yuh), a Cherokee man, created a writing system for his people. Using Sequoyah’s letters, Cherokee children learned to read and write. The Cherokees also published a newspaper.
The efforts of Native Americans to adopt European ways failed to end the conflict with white settlers. The Native Americans’ fertile land remained attractive to white settlers, and white settlers feared more violent conflict with Native Americans.

At first, they aimed to convince Native Americans to rely less on hunting. They wanted them to start farming cash crops such as tobacco and cotton in addition to food crops. Government leaders thought that Native Americans would then sell any land that they weren’t farming to white settlers. While many Native Americans in the

South did adopt cash-crop farming, they were not willing to sell their land. Meanwhile, prejudices on both sides stood in the way of white settlers and Native Americans living side by side.
Pressure on Native Americans Increases In 1825, President James Monroe had suggested a plan to move all Native Americans living east of the Mississippi to land west of the river. At this time, nothing came of the plan. Yet, year by year, the pressure on the Native Americans living along the frontier grew. Those in the North occupied land good for growing corn and wheat and raising livestock. Native Americans in the South occupied land that was good for growing cotton.
Around them, more and more white settlers arrived, many with enslaved African Americans, seeking land to grow cotton. Many white southerners were demanding that Native Americans be removed by force.
In 1825 and 1827, the state of Georgia passed laws forcing the Creeks to give up most of their land. Georgia then claimed the right to make laws for the Cherokee nation in 1828.
Worcester v. Georgia Decision Is Ignored
Georgia’s actions were challenged in two suits that reached the Supreme Court. The decision in the first suit went against the Cherokees. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), the Court refused to stop Georgia from enforcing its law. But in Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the Court ruled that Georgia had the right to enforce its law.
Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the Court’s majority opinion in Worcester v. Georgia. He quoted treaties that the United States had signed, guaranteeing certain territory to Native Americans. Under the Constitution, treaties are the supreme law of the land. Therefore, Marshall said, Georgia had no say over Cherokee territory, and Georgia’s action was unconstitutional.
President Jackson’s response to the ruling was stern. He wanted to remove Native Americans from their land, and was furious when he heard of the ruling in Worcester v. Georgia. “John Marshall has made his decision,” he is reported to have said. “Now let him enforce it!”
In the Nullification Crisis, Jackson defended federal power. In the Cherokee case, however, he backed states rights. He said that the federal government should not stop Georgia from controlling Cherokee lands, and he refused to enforce the Supreme Court’s decision. This wos a fateful step for the removal of Cherokees from their land.
A
Native American woman planting corn seeds. The Indian Removal Act In 1830, more than 100,000 Native Americans still lived east of the Mississippi River. At Jackson’s urging, the government set aside lands beyond the Mississippi River through the Indian Removal Act, which Congress passed in 1830. The law let the government give land west of the Mississippi to Native Americans in exchange for their lands to the east.
At the time of Worcester v. Georgia, Jackson was already applying this law. Jackson believed that moving Native Americans west would bring a permanent resolution to this conflict.
In the North, the Ottawa, Potawatomi, Sauk, and Fox peoples all signed treaties to move west to Indian Territories in what are now Kansas and Oklahoma. While most members of these groups moved west, a few stayed behind in what are now Michigan and Wisconsin.
The Indian Removal Act resulted in the forced migration of thousands of Native Americans from lands east of the Mississippi River. Among the groups affected included the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, and Seminole. This human geographic factor from the 1800s has had an effect on contemporary events.
As a result of Jackson's policy, few Native Americans today live east of the Mississippi. Most live west of the Mississippi. As a result, that is where most

U EXPLAIN
Why did Congress pass the Indian Removal Act? Southern Native
Americans on the Trail of Tears
Faced with threats of military action, most Native American leaders in the South saw no choice but to sign new treaties giving up their lands. They agreed to move to what was called the Indian Territory. Today, most of that area is in the state of Oklahoma.
The Choctaw The Choctaw signed the first treaty in 1830. The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek stated that
the United States under a grant.
. . shall cause to be conveyed to the Choctaw Nation a tract of country west of the Mississippi river . . .
II,
Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, 1830 The treaty allowed for Choctaw to remain in their homeland if they gave up their tribal organization and agreed to be governed as citizens of Mississippi. A few remained in Mississippi, but most agreed to leave to preserve their culture. Closely guarded by American soldiers, the Choctaw moved west between 1831 and 1833.
The federal government, however, did not provide enough tents, food, blankets, shoes, winter clothes, or other supplies. Heavy rain and snow caused enormous suffering. An army lieutenant wrote that one group “walked for 24 hours barefoot through the snow and ice” before reaching shelter.
The Chickasaw The Chickasaw people held out for payment for their lands east of the Mississippi before they would agree to move. Finally, in 1837, the United States government agreed to pay them $3 million for these lands.
Expecting to receive this money, the Chickasaw spent $500,000 to purchase land from the Choctaw in what is now Oklahoma. In fact, the U.S. government failed to pay the Chickasaw the agreed amount for 30 years. The Chickasaw set out for their new land. Along the way, as a result of hardships, many became ill and died.

The Cherokee The Cherokee also tried to hold out. They were still on their land in 1836 when Jackson left office. A small group of Cherokee agreed to become citizens of North Carolina. As a result, they were allowed to stay. Other Cherokee hid in remote mountain camps.
Finally, in 1838, President Martin Van Buren forced the Cherokee who had not made agreements with North Carolina and those who were not in hiding to move. The United States Army forced more than 15,000 Cherokee to march westward. In the winter of 1838-39, they went to Indian Territory, patrolled by 7,000 soldiers. The Cherokee trekked hundreds of miles over a period of several months. Thousands perished during the march, mostly children and the elderly.
The Cherokee’s long, sorrowful journey west became known as the Trail of Tears. A soldier’s description helps explain why:
On the morning of November
17th, we encountered a terrific sleet and snow storm with freezing temperatures, and from that day until we reached the end of the fateful journey on March the 27th, 1839, the sufferings of the Cherokee were awful.
The trail of the exiles was a trail of death.
-—Memoirs of Private John G. Burnett, December 1890
The Seminole Resist In Florida, the Seminole Indians resisted the U.S. government. Led by Chief Osceola (ah see OH luh), they began fighting the United States Army in 1817. This conflict, known as the first Seminole War, ended in 1818. The second Seminole War lasted from 1835 to 1842. It was the costliest war waged by the government to gain Indian lands. In the end, after a third war ending in 1858, the Seminoles were defeated. The government forced the Seminole leaders and most of their people to leave Florida.
In their new homes in the Indian Territory, Native Americans struggled to rebuild their lives under very difficult conditions. Meanwhile, white settlers moved quickly into lands given up by Native Americans. While Jackson’s Indian removal cleared the area east of the Mississippi River for white settlement, settlers already had their eyes on lands west of the Mississippi.

6,3 Native Americans on the Frontier

Settlers had been moving steadily westward from the Atlantic coast since the 1600s. In the early 1800s, the promise of new farmland and other work opportunities brought a flood of new migrants to the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains.
Westward Movement
Entire families gathered up all their possessions, including furniture and livestock, and made the long journey westward in their quest for a better life on the frontier.
Heading Into the West
Settlers took a number of routes west. People from important regions and places like New England, New York, and Pennsylvania pushed into a region northwest of the Ohio River called the Northwest Territory. Some traveled west from Albany, New York, along the Mohawk River, through the Appalachians, and then west along the plains south of Lake Ontario. Many then sailed across Lake Erie into Ohio.
Another well-traveled path was the Great Valley Road that ran southward from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, through Maryland and western Virginia. Some settlers would then continue south and west along the trail opened by Daniel Boone before the Revolution. Known as the Wilderness Road, it led through the Cumberland Gap into Kentucky.
Other settlers pushed west across the Appalachians to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. There, they loaded their animals and wagons onto flatboats, or flat-bottomed boats, and journeyed down the Ohio River into Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois. Flatboats were well suited to the shallow waters of the Ohio, which became known as the “Gateway to the West.” Even when carrying heavy cargoes, these barges rode high in the water.
Pioneers from Georgia and South Carolina followed other trails west to Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Enslaved African Americans were forced to move with settlers or sold to new owners in

these territories. There, enslaved workers cleared fields and built plantations in the rich, fertile soil.
Before long, some western territories had populations large enough to apply for statehood. Between 1792 and 1819, eight states joined the Union: Kentucky (1792), Tennessee (1796), Ohio (1803), Louisiana (1812), Indiana (1816), Mississippi (1817), Illinois (1818), and Alabama (1819).
B COMPARE
How was travel during the early 1800s similar to and different from travel today? Building Better Roads
Settlers faced difficult journeys as they traveled to the West. Many roads were narrow dirt trails, barely wide enough for a single wagon. Trails often plunged through muddy swamps. Tree stumps stuck up in the road and often broke the wagon axles of careless travelers. The nation badly needed better roads.
Paying Tolls In the United States, as in Europe, private companies built gravel and stone roads. To pay for these roads, the companies collected tolls from travelers. At various points along the road, a pike, or pole, blocked the road. After a wagon driver had paid a toll, the pike
keeper turned the pole aside to let the wagon pass. As a result, these toll roads were called turnpikes.
Probably the best road in the United States was the Lancaster Turnpike. Built in the 1790s by a private company, the road linked Philadelphia and Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
Because the road was set on a bed of gravel, water drained off quickly. For a smooth ride, the road was topped with flat stones.
Other roads were more primitive. In swampy areas, roads were made of logs. These roads were known as corduroy roads because the lines of logs looked like corduroy cloth. Corduroy roads kept wagons from sinking into the mud, but they made for a very noisy and bumpy ride.
The First National Road Some states set aside money to improve roads or build new ones. Meanwhile, in 1806, Congress approved funds for the first national road-building project. The National Road was to run from Cumberland, Maryland, to Wheeling, on the Ohio River in western Virginia.
Work on the National Road began in 1811. Because of the War of 1812, it was not completed until 1818. Later, the road was extended into Illinois. As each new

roads make travel easier?
The Age of Steam
Whenever possible, travelers and freight haulers used river transportation. Floating downstream on a flatboat was both faster and more comfortable than bumping along rutted roads. It also cost a lot less.
Yet, river travel had its own problems. Moving upstream was difficult. People used paddles or long poles to push boats against the current. Sometimes, they hauled boats along the shore with ropes. Both methods were extremely slow. A boat could travel downstream from Pittsburgh to New Orleans in about six weeks. However, the return trip upstream took at least 17 weeks.
Steamboats Arrive Technology and innovations slowly began to effect transportation by making travel faster and cheaper. A new invention, the steam engine, started a new era in river travel. In 1787, John Fitch showed members of the Constitutional Convention how a steam engine could power a boat. He then opened a ferry service on the Delaware River. However, few people used the ferry, and Fitch eventually went out of business.
Inventor Robert Fulton may have seen Fitch’s steamboat while in Philadelphia. In 1807, Fulton launched his own steamboat, the Clermont, on the Hudson River. On its first run, the Clermont carried passengers from New York City to Albany and back. The 300-mile trip took just 62 hours—a record at the time.
A
Travel Revolution Fulton’s success ushered in the of steamboats. Soon, steamboats were ferrying passengers up and down the Atlantic coast. More important, steamboats revolutionized travel in the West. Besides carrying people, river steamboats gave farmers and merchants a cheap means of moving poods.
Because western rivers were too shallow for farger boats, Henry Shreve designed a flat-bottomed steamboat. It could carry heavy loads without getting stuck on sandbars.
Still, steamboat travel could be dangerous. Sparks from smokestacks could cause fires. High-pressure boilers sometimes exploded as steamboat captains raced each other in an effort to get to their destination

first. Between 1811 and 1851, 44 steamboats collided, 166 burned, and more than 200 exploded.

How did steamboats revolutionize travel in the West?
Canals Connect the
Country
Steamboats and better roads brought many improvements to transportation. But they did not help western farmers get their goods directly to markets in the East. To meet this need, Americans needed to modify the physical environment in a whole new way: they dug canals. A canal is an artificial channel filled with water that allows boats to cross a stretch of land.
The earliest American canals were no more than a few miles long. Some canals provided routes around waterfalls on a river. Others linked rivers to nearby lakes. By the early 1800s, however, Americans were building longer canals.
The Erie Canal In 1805, some New Yorkers developed a bold idea. They wanted to build a canal linking the Great Lakes to the Mohawk and Hudson rivers. Later known as the Erie Canal, this artificial waterway
would let western farmers ship their goods to the port of New York. It would also bring business to towns along the route.
To many people, the idea of such a canal seemed far-fetched. When Thomas Jefferson heard of the plan, he exclaimed:
Why, sir, you talk of making a canal
350 miles through the wilderness—it is little short of madness to think of it at this day!
—Thomas Jefferson to Joshua Forman of New York, 1809
New York's governor DeWitt Clinton ignored such criticism. He persuaded state lawmakers to provide money for the Erie Canal. Critics referred to the project as "Clinton’s Ditch.”
Work on the Erie Canal began in 1817. At first, thousands of workers dug the waterway using hand tools. To speed up progress, inventors developed new equipment. One machine, a stump-puller, could pull out nearly 40 tree stumps a day. In two places, the canal had to cross over rivers. Workers built stone bridges to carry the canal over the rivers.
» Steamboats became more powerful when their engines were used to turn paddle wheels. These wheels allowed larger boats to be built that could carry more passengers and cargo.

An Instant Success By 1825, the immense job was finished. On opening day of the Erie Canal, a cannon fired in Buffalo, New York. When the sound got to the next town along the route, that town fired a cannon. Town after town fired cannons, all the way to New York City. The thunderous salute took 80 minutes to complete.
The Erie Canal was an instant success. The cost of shipping goods dropped to about one tenth of what it had been before the canal was built. The canal also helped make New York City a center of commerce.
The success of the Erie Canal led other states to build canals. These canals created vital links between western farms and eastern cities, advancing the economic development of the United States. These links encouraged more growth, as people moved to the new cities in search of work.

By the 1820s, white settlers had purchased and occupied much of the land between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River. Families in search of good farmland kept moving farther west. Many settlers, however, were not attracted to the Great Plains between the Mississippi and the Rockies. The plains were considered too dry to support farming. Instead, many of these settlers headed to lands in the Far West.
course, Native American groups had lived there for centuries. However, the United States and European nations gave little thought to Indian rights.
In 1818, the United States and Britain agreed to occupy Oregon Country jointly. Citizens of each nation would have equal rights there. Spain and Russia had few settlers there, so they withdrew their claims to Oregon Country.
B PREDICT CONSEQUENCES
How might the arrival of many U.S. settlers affect the agreement between Britain and the United States over Oregon Country?

The Far West Fur Trade
At first, only a handful of Europeans or Americans traveled to Oregon Country. Most were fur traders. Since furs could be sold for huge profits in China, merchants from New England stopped along the Oregon coast before crossing the Pacific. In fact, so many New England traders visited Oregon to buy furs that, in some areas, the Indian name for a white man was “Boston.”
Only a few hardy fur trappers actually settled in Oregon. These adventurous men hiked throughout the
region’s vast forests, trapping animals and living off the land. They were known as mountain men.
Mountain men were admired as rugged individualists. Even their colorful appearance set them apart from ordinary society. Their shirts and trousers were made of animal hides and decorated with porcupine quills. Their hair reached to their shoulders. Pistols and tomahawks hung from their belts.
A
Hard Life Mountain men could make fine profits selling their furs. They led dangerous lives, however. The long, cold winters demanded special survival skills. In the forests, mountain men had to watch out for bears, wildcats, or other animals that might attack. In winter, food was scarce. Faced with starvation, a hungry trapper would eat almost anything. “I have held my hands in an anthill until they were covered with ants, then greedily licked them off,” one mountain man recalled.
Trappers often spent winters in Native American villages. They learned trapping and hunting skills from Indians. Some mountain men married Indian women who helped the newcomers survive in the rugged mountains.

Americans first heard about the area known as Oregon Country in the early 1800s. Lewis and Clark had explored this area west of the Louisiana Purchase in 1805. Oregon Country was a huge region west of the Rocky Mountains. Today, it includes Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Wyoming, Montana, and western Canada.
Wild Country The geography of Oregon Country was varied. Along the Pacific coast, the soil was fertile.
Temperatures there were mild all year round, and rainfall was plentiful. Early white settlers found fine farmland in the valley of the Willamette River and the lowlands around Puget Sound.
Dense forest covered the Coastal Ranges and Cascade Mountains, which surrounded these lowlands. Beavers and other fur-bearing animals roamed these forests and the Rocky Mountains to the east. For this reason, fur trappers were the first settlers to head into Oregon Country.
Not all of Oregon Country attracted Americans. Between the Cascade Mountains and the Rockies is a dry plateau. This region attracted neither fur trappers nor farmers.

The Fur Trade During the fall and spring, mountain men tended their traps. Then in July, they tramped out of the wilderness to meet with fur traders. They headed to a place chosen the year before, called the rendezvous (RAHN day voo). Rendezvous is a French word meaning “get-together.
The first day of the rendezvous was a time for entertainment. A visitor to one rendezvous captured the excitement:
“[The mountain men] engaged in contests of skill at running, jumping, wrestling, shooting with the rifle, and running horses. . . . They sang, they laughed, they whooped; they tried to out-brag and out-lie each other in stories of their adventures.”
—Washington Irving, The Adventures ei Captain

Soon enough, trappers and traders settled down to bargain. As long as beaver hats were in demand in the East and in Europe, mountain men got a good price for their furs. By the late 1830s, however, the fur trade was dying. Trappers had killed too many beavers, and the animals had become scarce. Also, beaver hats went out of style. Even so, mountain men found new uses for their skills. Some used their knowledge of the region to lead settlers along rugged mountain trails into Oregon Country.
Guides to the West In their search for furs, mountain men explored many parts of the West. They followed Indian trails through passes in the Rocky Mountains. Later, they used these trails to help guide settlers heading west.
Jedediah Smith led settlers across the Rockies through South Pass, in present-day Wyoming. Manuel Lisa, a Latino fur trader, led a trip up the Missouri River. In 1807, he founded Fort Manuel, the first outpost on the upper Missouri, in what is now North Dakota.
James Beckwourth, an African American freed from slavery, traveled west from Missouri to seek a new life. He worked as a fur trader and lived among the Crow Indians, who later accepted him as a chief. In his work as a guide, Beckwourth discovered a mountain pass through the Sierra Nevada mountain range that later became a major route to California.

First, read with a partner the section titled A Hard Life . Next, you and your partner will write down two questions to ask about the reading. Share your questions and answer them together. The Oregon Trail
The first white Americans to settle permanently in Oregon Country were missionaries. In the 1830s, they began to travel west to bring their religious beliefs to Native Americans.
Missionaries Bring Settlers Among these early settlers were Marcus and Narcissa Whitman. In 1836, the couple married and set out for Oregon Country, where they planned to convert local Native Americans to Christianity.
The Whitmans built their mission near the Columbia River and began to work with Cayuse (kay-YOOS) people, setting up a mission school and a clinic. Soon, other missionaries and settlers joined them.
Missionaries like the Whitmans helped stir up interest in Oregon Country. Eager to have others join them, the missionaries sent back glowing reports about the land. People throughout the nation read these reports. By 1840, more and more Americans were making the long and difficult journey to Oregon Country.
As settlers spread onto Cayuse lands, conflicts arose. Worse, the newcomers carried diseases that often killed the Cay uses. In 1847, tragedy struck. A measles outbreak among the settlers spread to the Cayuses. Many Cayuse children died. Blaming the settlers, a band of angry Indians attacked the mission, killing the Whitmans and 12 others.
Wagons Ho! Despite these and other killings, pioneers still boldly set out for Oregon Country. They were attracted by tales of wheat that grew taller than a man and turnips five feet around. Stories like these touched off a race to get to Oregon Country. Americans called it "Oregon fever.” As Oregon fever spread, pioneers clogged the trails west.
Beginning in 1843, wagon trains left every spring for Oregon Country. They followed a route called the Oregon Trail. Families planning to go west met at Independence, Missouri, in the early spring.
By mid-April, the prairie outside Independence was packed with people and wagons. Somehow, the pioneers formed themselves into wagon trains. Each Toup elected leaders to make decisions along the way.
The Oregon-bound pioneers hurried to leave Independence in May. Timing was important. Travelers

had to reach the Oregon lowlands by early October before the snow fell in the mountains. This meant that pioneers had to cover 2,000 miles in five months. In the 1840s, traveling 15 miles a day was considered making good time.
Life in a Wagon Train On the trail, families woke at dawn to a bugle blast. Everyone had a job to do. Girls helped their mothers prepare food. Men and boys harnessed the horses and oxen. By 6 A.M., the cry of “Wagons Ho!” rang across the plains.
The wagon train stopped for a brief noonday meal. Then, it returned to the trail until 6 or 7 P.M. At night, wagons drew into a circle to keep the cattle from wandering.
Most pioneer families started the journey with a large amount of gear. As they crossed rivers and scaled mountains, they discarded belongings to lighten their wagons.
The trail west held many dangers. During the spring, travelers risked drowning as they floated their wagons across rain-swollen rivers. In summer, they faced blistering heat on the treeless plains. Early snows could block passes through the mountains. Getting the heavy wagons past these obstacles was hard work. The biggest threat was sickness. Cholera and other

In the early 1800s, Texas was part of a Spanish province in the colony of New Spain, or Mexico. Texas had very few Mexican settlers. As a result, Spain had difficulty keeping order in the province, where settlers faced frequent raids by Comanche Indians. In 1820, Spain gave Moses Austin a land grant and permission to colonize Texas with 300 Catholic families. Although Austin died before he could set up a colony, his son, Stephen, took over the grant.
Often referred to as the “Father of Texas,” Stephen Austin was a major figure in the early history of Texas.
diseases could wipe out whole wagon trains. Because the travelers lived so close together, diseases spread quickly.
Meeting the Locals As they moved toward the Rockies, pioneers often saw Indians. Often, they traded with the wagon trains. Hungry pioneers were grateful for the food that the Indians sold in return for clothing and tools. A traveler noted:
“Whenever we camp near any Indian village, we are no sooner stopped than a whole crowd may be seen coming galloping into our camp. The [women] do all the swapping.”

Americans Colonize Mexican Texas
In 1821, before Stephen Austin could establish his colony, Mexico won independence from Spain. Austin went to Mexico City to make sure that the new government still supported his land grant. The new leaders agreed to let Austin bring settlers to Texas. As Spain had been, Mexico was eager for settlers to develop the land and help control Indian attacks. At the time, only about 4,000 Mexicans lived in Texas.
By the 1820s, most of the good land in the United States was already occupied, and land there could be expensive. There was a scarcity, or short supply, of affordable, fertile land, or land that is good for growing crops. In Texas, by contrast, there was a large supply of fertile land that settlers could buy very cheaply. This pulled many Americans to settle beyond the frontier. The eastern portion of the Spanish province of Texas contained some very fertile soil. The physical geography of the land, especially the fertile soil, increased settlement to Texas, and agriculture remains important to this region in contemporary times.
Austin began to gather the 300 families who would settle his colony in Texas. Starting in late 1821, they began settling the colony. Many

settlers came from the cotton country of the Southeast. Some built large cotton plantations and brought in slaves to work the land. Austin’s land grant was located between the Colorado and Brazos rivers. He made sure to divide the grant so that each colonist purchased a parcel of land that bordered a river to allow access to water. Having access to water was vital for the settlers as well as their farms and livestock.
As Austin’s colony grew and succeeded, Mexico gave Austin several more land grants. Grants were also given to other entrepreneurs like Austin to attract settlers to Texas. Some of these settlers were from Mexico, but the largest number came from the United States. By 1830, about 20,000 Americans had moved to Texas.
B RECALL
What factors influenced where Americans settled in Texas?
» Americans were not the only immigrants to settle in Texas. Mexico also encouraged Europeans, like these Germans, to settle there. Infer How might the presence of so many people with cultures from outside Mexico have contributed to conflict in Mexican Texas?
Conflict With the Mexican Government
In return for land, Austin and the original American settlers agreed to become Mexican citizens and to worship in the Roman Catholic Church. Later American settlers, however, felt no loyalty to Mexico. They spoke little or no Spanish and most were Protestant. These and other differences led to conflicts between the settlers and the Mexican government.
Mexico Tightens Its Grip on Texas In 1830, Mexico barred any more Americans from settling in Texas. Mexico feared that the Americans would try to make Texas a part of the United States. It had good reason to fear this possibility. The United States had already tried twice to buy Texas from Mexico.
To assert its authority, Mexico began to enforce laws that had long been ignored. One was the law requiring Texans to promise to worship in the Catholic Church. Another law banned slavery in the region. American settlers resented these laws. The law against slavery was a serious problem for American settlers. Many American settlers had brought enslaved people with them and relied on enslaved workers to grow cotton. Settlers’ anger grew when Mexico sent troops to enforce its will.
In 1833, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna gained power in Mexico. Two years later, he threw out the Mexican constitution and began governing the nation as dictator. A dictator is a ruler with absolute power and authority. Rumors began to spread that Santa Anna intended to drive the Americans out of Texas.
Texans Rebel With Santa Anna in power, Americans in Texas felt that the time had come for action. They had the support of many Tejanos (teh HAH nohs), people of Mexican descent born in Texas. Tejanos did not necessarily want independence from Mexico. However, they did want to be rid of the dictator, Santa Anna.
In October 1835, Texan settlers in the town of Gonzales (gahn Z AH les) clashed with Mexican troops. They forced the troops to withdraw. Inspired by that victory, Stephen Austin vowed to "see Texas forever free from Mexican domination.” Two months later. Texan settlers surrounded and then occupied the town of San Antonio. Determined to stamp out the rebellion Santa Anna marched north with a large army.

While Santa Anna was on the move, a group of Texans declared independence for the Republic of Texas on March 2, 1836. Sam Houston was given command of its army. Volunteers from the United States and from other nations, along with African Americans and Tejanos, joined the fight for Texan independence from Mexico.
Siege at the Alamo By the time Santa Anna reached San Antonio, the Texans had taken up positions in an old Spanish mission called the Alamo. There they waited for the Mexican attack.
The Texans were poorly equipped. Their supplies of ammunition, food, water, and medicine were low. Only about 150 Texans faced a force of 6,000 Mexican troops. Inside the mission, a young lieutenant colonel, William B. Travis, was in command. Among the volunteers at the Alamo were the famous frontiersmen Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett as well as several Tejano families, two Texan women, and two enslaved young African American men.
On February 23, 1836, Mexican troops began the siege of the Alamo. In a siege, enemy forces try to capture a city or fort by surrounding and often bombarding it. The Texan defenders barely held out as cannons pounded the walls. Travis knew that without help the defenders were doomed. He sent a messenger through the Mexican lines with a letter addressed “to the people of Texas and all the Americans in the World”:
I shall never surrender or retreat. . .
-1 call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism and everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all [speed]. . . . Victory or Death. —William B. Travis. Letter, February 24, 1836
Travis also sent scouts to find more volunteers and food. About 40 men also managed to slip through enemy lines and joined the Texans in their fight inside the Alamo. Still, no large force arrived to help the defenders of the Alamo. For 12 days, the Mexican bombardment continued.
At dawn on March 6, Mexican cannons shattered the mission walls. Santa Anna now launched an all-

out attack. Thousands of Mexican soldiers poured over the broken walls, shouting “Viva Santa Anna!” (“Long live Santa Anna!”). Attackers and defenders battled in hand-to-hand combat. In the end, about 180 Texans and almost 1,500 Mexicans lay dead. Most of the few Texans who survived were executed.
The Battle of San Jacinto The fall of the Alamo sparked Texan cries for revenge. A few weeks later, Texan fury grew when Mexican troops killed several hundred soldiers fighting for the Texan cause after they had surrendered at Goliad. News of these events inspired new volunteers to join the Texan forces. Many came from the United States. Houston worked hard to turn the volunteers into an effective army. Even though the Texans were eager to attack, Houston held them back until the time was right.
Houston soon found the chance to attack Santa Anna. Scouts reported that the Mexican general and his army were camped near the San Jacinto (juh SIN toh) River. On the afternoon of April 21, 1836, the Texans caught their enemies by surprise. With cries of “Remember the Alamo!” and “Remember Goliad!” Texans charged into battle.
The Battle of San Jacinto lasted only 18 minutes. Although the Texans were outnumbered, the element

of surprise was their greatest ally. They killed 630 Mexicans and captured 700 more. The next day, they captured Santa Anna, forcing him to sign a treaty granting Texas independence.
fi&2 RECALL What was the key to the Texan’s victory at
San Jacinto?
The Republic of Texas Is Born
In battle, Texans had carried a flag with a single star. After winning independence, they nicknamed their new nation the Lone Star Republic. A constitution was written using the United States Constitution as a model. In September 1836, voters elected Sam Houston president of the Republic of Texas.
The new country faced several serious problems, however. First, the government of Mexico refused to accept the treaty that Santa Anna had signed. Mexicans insisted that Texas was still part of Mexico. Second, Texas was nearly bankrupt.
Third, Comanche and other Indian groups threatened to attack small Texan communities. Most
Texans thought that the best way to solve these problems was to become part of the United States.
In the United States, people were divided about whether to annex, or add on, Texas to the Union. The arguments reflected sectional divisions in the country. White southerners generally favored the idea. Many northerners opposed it. The main issue was slavery. By the 1830s, antislavery feeling was growing in the North. Because many Texans owned slaves, northerners feared that Texas would join the Union as a slave-owning state, strengthening support for slavery in the U.S. government. In addition, President Andrew Jackson worried that annexing Texas would lead to war with Mexico. As a result, Congress refused to annex the Republic of Texas.
For the next nine years, leaders of the Republic of Texas worked to attract new settlers. The new Texas government encouraged immigration by offering settlers free land. During the Panic of 1837, thousands of Americans moved to Texas, where land was less expensive than in the United States.
Settlers also arrived from Germany and Switzerland. They helped the new nation grow and prosper. By the 1840s, about 140,000 people lived in Texas, including many enslaved African Americans and some Mexicans.

Manifest Destiny in California and the Southwest
New Mexico Territory and California
Spain and New Mexico Territory The physical characteristics of this region vary depending on location. Much of this region is hot and dry desert. There are also forested mountains. In some areas, thick grasses grow. Before the Spanish arrived, the Zuni (ZOON yee) and other Indians farmed here using irrigation, while other Native Americans lived mainly by hunting and gathering.
The Spanish explorer Juan de Onate (ohnYAH tay) claimed the region for Spain in 1598. In the early 1600s, the Spanish built Santa Fe and made it the capital of the territory. By trading horses, fur, and wool, Santa Fe grew into a busy trading town.
Some Americans were eager to settle in New Mexico, which was thinly populated but had good physical characteristics, including many natural resources. Spain, however, would not let Americans settle in Santa Fe or anywhere else in the territory. Only after Mexico

William Becknell, a merchant and adventurer, was the first American to head for Santa Fe In 1821 he led some traders from Franklin, Missouri, across the plains to the New Mexico town. Other Americans soon followed Becknell’s route, which became known as the Santa Fe Trail
Spanish Settlements in California California, too, was ruled first by Spain and then by Mexico. Spanish explorers had reached California in 1542, long before the English settled in Jamestown.
In 1769, Captain Gaspar de Portola led an expedition up the Pacific coast.With him was Father Junipero Serra (hooNEE peh roh sehr rah). Father Serra built his first mission at San Diego. Later he and other missionaries set up a string of 21 missions long the California coast.
Each mission complex included a church and the surrounding land. Each became self-sufficient, producing enough for its own needs. Spanish soldiers built forts nearby.
Before the Spanish arrived, California Indians lived in small, scattered groups. As a result, they had little success resisting the Spanish soldiers who made them work on mission lands. Native Americans were forced to herd sheep and cattle and raise crops for the missions. They were also forced to live at the missions and practice the Roman Catholic faith. Many missionaries were dedicated to converting the Indians to Christianity. However, mission life was harsh. Indians were forced to give up their culture. Families were often separated, and people faced great distress. Thousands of Native Americans died from overwork and disease.
Life on Mexican Ranches In the 1820s, newly independent Mexico decided that California's economy was growing too slowly. Hoping to speed up growth, the government took land from the missions and gave it to wealthy individuals. These new landowners set up huge cattle ranches in California.
Native Americans did most of the work on the ranches as well, tending cattle and other animals. A new culture developed on the ranches—the culture of the vaqueros. Vaqueros were the Indian and Mexican cowhands who worked on the ranches. They were excellent riders and ropers, and their traditions strongly influenced later cowhands.

6.7 Manifest Destiny in California and the Southwest
Manifest Destiny
In the mid-1840s, only about 700 people from the United States lived in California. Every year, however, more Americans began moving west. There were many economic, social, and political causes for this westward expansion. On several occasions, the United States government offered to buy California from Mexico. Some officials were eager to gain control of the ports at San Francisco and San Diego. Soon westward expansion became a major priority for the nation.
The Roots of Manifest Destiny There was another reason for wanting to purchase California. Many Americans saw their nation and its democratic government as the best in the world.
In the 1840s, a newspaper created the term Manifest Destiny to mean that the United States had the right to spread across the continent. Manifest means clear or obvious. Destiny means something that is fated to happen. The social roots of Manifest Destiny lay in the belief that Americans had the right and the duty of westward expansion to spread their culture across the continent all the way to the Pacific Ocean.
Americans who believed in Manifest Destiny thought that westward expansion would also open new opportunities for the United States economy. To many Americans, the fertile farmland and natural resources in the West were prime opportunities for economic growth.
Manifest Destiny and westward expansion had some negative effects, however. Many white Americans believed that they were superior to Native Americans and Mexicans. They used this belief to justify taking

lands belonging to people whom they considered inferior.
Polk and Westward Expansion The political roots of Manifest Destiny and westward expansion took hold during the election of 1844. The Whigs nominated the well-known national leader Henry Clay for President. Clay had opposed the annexation of Texas. The Democrats choose James Polk, a little-known candidate from Tennessee who wanted to add Texas and Oregon Country to the Union.
On Election Day, Americans showed their support for westward expansion by electing Polk president. He took office in March 1845 on a wave of support for expansion. Acting on his campaign promise, he took steps to gain control of Oregon Country. That move brought the possibility of war with Britain.
Polk did not really want to fight Britain, however. Instead, in 1846, he agreed to a compromise. Oregon Country was divided at latitude 49°N. Britain got the lands north of the line, and the United States got the lands south of the line. The United States named its lands the Oregon Territory. Later the states of Oregon (1859), Washington (1889), and Idaho (1890) were carved out of the Oregon Territory.
Texas proved a more difficult problem. The United States at first had refused to annex Texas. Then, in 1844, Texan president Sam Houston signed a treaty of annexation with the United States. However, the Senate again refused to ratify the treaty. Senators feared that annexing Texas would cause a war with Mexico.
Meanwhile, in a last effort to prevent annexation by the United States, Mexico offered to accept the , independence of Texas if Texas rejected annexation. |

RECALL
Why did U.S. senators refuse to ratify the treaty to annex Texas? The U.S.-Mexican War
The annexation of Texas outraged Mexicans. They had not accepted Texan independence, much less annexation. They also worried that Americans might encourage rebellions in California and New Mexico as they had in Texas.
At the same time, Americans resented Mexico. They were annoyed when Mexico rejected President Polk’s offer of $30 million to buy California and New Mexico. Many Americans felt that Mexico stood in the way of the Manifest Destiny of the United States.
The Clash Begins A border dispute finally caused a war. Both the United States and Mexico claimed control over the land between the Rio Grande and
^oiicicu zsacnary ’Taylor to set up posts in the disputed area. Polk knew that the move might lead to war. In April 1846, Mexican troops crossed the Rio Grande and clashed with the Americans. At Polk’s urging, Congress declared war on Mexico.
Americans were divided over the conflict. Many people in the South and West were eager to fight, hoping to win new lands. Some northerners, however, opposed the war. They saw it as a southern plot to add slave states to the Union. Still, the war was generally popular. When the army called for volunteers, thousands of young recruits flocked to the cause.

General Taylor crossed the Rio Grande into northern Mexico. In February 1847, he met Mexican General Santa Anna at the Battle of Buena Vista. The Americans were outnumbered more than two to one, but they were better armed and better led. After fierce fighting and intense artillery fire, they forced Santa Anna to retreat. Meanwhile, a second army under General Winfield Scott landed at the Mexican port of Veracruz. After a long battle, the Americans took the city. Scott then headed toward Mexico City, the capital.

A third army, led by General Stephen Kearny, captured Santa Fe without firing a shot.
Kearny then hurried on to San Diego. After several battles, he won control of southern California early in 1847.
Even before hearing of the war, Americans in northern California had begun a revolt against Mexican rule. The rebels declared California an independent republic on June 14, 1846. They nicknamed their new nation the Bear Flag Republic. Led by a young American officer, John C. Fremont (free mont), rebel forces then drove the Mexican troops out of northern California.
By 1847, the United States controlled all of New Mexico and California. General Scott, meanwhile, pushed closer to Mexico City. Blocking his way was the Mexican army in a well-protected position. At the Battle of Cerro Gordo, American troops went around this position to surprise the Mexican army. The Mexican army suffered heavy losses as it was forced to retreat. At the edge of Mexico City, Scott’s forces faced one last obstacle. Teenage Mexican cadets, or soldiers in training, made a heroic stand at Chapultepec (chahPOOL tuh pehk), a fort just outside the capital. Today, Mexicans honor those young cadets as heroes. At the battle’s end, however, the capital city was overtaken by the American forces
» Mexicans today remember the six young cadets who stood against U.S. forces by visiting this monument in Chapultepec Park, Mexico City.
When the American army captured Mexico City, the war was essentially over. Scott’s Mexico City campaign remains one of the most successful in U.S. military history. The war was a crushing defeat for Mexico. An outnumbered American army had caused significantly more casualties than it had suffered.
The War Ends The Mexican government moved to make peace with the United States. In 1848, Mexico signed the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo (gwah duh LOOP ay ih DAHL goh). Mexico suffered the effects of losing the war. It had to cede, or give up, all of California and New Mexico to the United States. These lands were called the Mexican Cession. In return, the United States paid Mexico $15 million and agreed to respect the rights of Spanish-speaking people in the Mexican Cession.
The war impacted the United States positively due to this new land. However, even more land was acquired later. In 1853, the United States paid Mexico an additional $10 million for a strip of land in present-day Arizona and New Mexico.
The Americans needed the land to complete a railroad. The land was called the Gadsden Purchase. With the Gadsden Purchase, many Americans felt that their dream of Manifest Destiny had been fulfilled.
CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why were Mexicans worried about the annexation of Texas by the United States?
Settling the Mexican Cession
Winning the U.S.-Mexican war had positive effects on westward expansion of the United States, which ushered in a whole new era of growth. New Mexico Territory, now the southwestern part of the United States, came to be known as the Southwest. After 1848, English-speaking settlers flocked to the Southwest. As the population of the country increased and affordable land in the east became scarce, more people decided to move. Americans migrated west for many reasons, from religious freedom to economic opportunities. The largest group of settlers to move into the Mexican Cession was the Mormons.
The Mormons Move West Mormons belonged to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The church was founded by Joseph Smith in 1830. Smith, a farmer in upstate New York, attracted many followers to his new faith. Smith was an energetic, popular man.

Some of his teachings were different from other Christian churches’ teachings. These new teachings angered many non-Mormons, who forced the Mormons to leave New York.
The Mormons moved west and, in the 1840s, built a community called Nauvoo on the banks of the Mississippi River in Illinois. Once again, the Mormons and their neighbors clashed. In 1844, an angry mob killed Joseph Smith, and Brigham Young was chosen as their new leader.
A
New Home in Utah Young sought a place where Mormons would be safe from persecution. He had read about a valley between the Rocky Mountains and the Great Salt Lake in Utah. He hoped that this isolated valley might make a good home for the Mormons. In 1847, Young led an advance party into the valley of the Great Salt Lake. Soon, waves of Mormon families J followed. For several years, Mormon wagon trains I Juggled across the plains and over the Rockies to ' Utah. Once there, they had to learn how to survive in i the desert climate. Human geographic factors played an important role in this adaptation. Young planned an
ligation system to bring water to farms.
He also drew up plans for a large city, called Salt Lake City, to be built in the desert. The Mormon Wlements in Utah grew quickly. Congress recognized
Brigham Young as governor of the Utah Territory in 1850. Eventually, in 1896, Utah became a state.
The California Gold Rush Begins While the Mormons were making the long trek to what would become Utah, thousands of other Americans were racing even farther west to California. The great attraction came from a unique geographic feature of the land—gold.
In 1848, John Sutter was having a sawmill built on the American River, north of Sacramento, California. Sutter had hired James Marshall to supervise the job. Early on January 24, Marshall set out to inspect a ditch his crew was digging. He later recalled the events of that day:
As I was taking my usual walk, . . . my eye was caught with the glimpse of something shining in the bottom of the ditch. ... I reached my hand down and picked it up; it made my heart thump, for I was certain it was gold.
—James Marshall, quote in Hutchings’ Illustrated
California Magazine, 1857-1858
At first, Sutter tried to keep the news a secret. But within a few days, news reached San Francisco that

gold had been found at Sutter’s Mill. Carpenters threw down their saws. Bakers left bread in their ovens. Schools emptied as teachers and students joined the rush to the gold fields.
The news spread across the United States and around the globe. Thousands of Americans caught “gold fever.” People from Europe, China, Australia, and South America joined in the great gold rush. More than 80,000 people made the long journey to California in 1849. They became know as forty-niners a nickname created in reference to the year they arrived.
Very few miners actually struck it rich. Many went broke trying to make their fortunes in the gold fields. Still, although many miners left the gold fields, they stayed in California. In time, they found jobs or took up farming.
Statehood for California The gold rush brought big changes to California. Almost overnight, San Francisco grew from a sleepy town to a bustling city, as newcomers poured in from all over the world. In the gold fields, towns sprang up just as quickly Greed led some forty-niners into crime. Murders and robberies plagued many mining camps.
Californians soon realized that they needed a strong government to stop such lawlessness. In November of 1849, they drafted a state constitution. They then asked to be admitted to the Union. Their request caused an
uproar in the United States. Many people wanted to know whether the new state would allow slavery. After a heated debate, California was admitted to the Union in 1850 as a free state. This was not the end of the issue. The question whether new states could allow slavery would end up causing bitter disagreements over the next ten years.

Americans faced serious hardships. During the 1850s and 1860s, many lost land that their families had owned for generations.
Native Americans fared even worse. Many were driven off the lands where they lived. Without any means to earn a living, large numbers died of starvation or disease brought by the newcomers. Still others were murdered. In 1850, about 100,000 Indians lived in California. By the 1870s, the state’s Indian population had dropped to 17,000.
The physical characteristics of California attracted the first settlers. Lured by the tales of a “mountain of gold,” thousands of Chinese immigrants sailed across the Pacific to California. At first, the Chinese were welcomed because California needed workers. When the Chinese staked claims in the gold fields, however, white miners often drove them off. Despite the harsh treatment, many Chinese Americans stayed in California. Their contributions helped the state to grow. They shaped the environment by draining swamplands and digging irrigation systems to turn dry land into fertile farmland.
Free blacks, too, joined the gold rush in California, hoping to strike it rich. Some became well-off by running businesses that contributed to the economy. In fact, by the 1850s, California had the richest African American population of any state. Yet, African Americans faced discrimination and were denied certain rights.
Changes to the Region In spite of these problems, California continued to grow and prosper. Settlers from other states and immigrants from all over the world kept arriving. With their diverse backgrounds, the newcomers added to California’s unique human characteristics. That is, the mix of people added to the identity of California as a place. The economy grew as commerce and mining expanded, and farms grew to feed the settlers. Cities and roads grew to accommodate the increase in people and goods. By 1860, the state s population was about 300,000.

Work in the textile mills in the early 1800s, such as the one shown here, was hard and dangerous. Workers faced long hours on their feet amid noisy machines and a risk of being caught and injured by moving parts.
In the early 1800s, busy factories and whirring machinery were part of a revolution that was reaching the United States. Unlike the American Revolution, this one had no battles or fixed dates. The new revolution—the Industrial Revolution—was a long, slow process that completely changed the way goods were produced and where many people worked and lived.

The Industrial
Revolution and Life in the North
The Industrial Revolution Begins
Before the 1800s, most Americans were farmers and most goods were produced by hand. As a result of the Industrial Revolution, this situation slowly changed. Machines replaced hand tools. New sources of power, such as steam, replaced human and animal power. While most Americans continued to farm for a living, the economy began a gradual shift toward manufacturing.
Technological Innovations The Industrial Revolution started in Britain in the mid-1700s. British inventors developed new machines that transformed the textile industry.
Since the Middle Ages, workers had used spinning wheels to make thread. A spinning wheel, however, could spin only one thread at a time. In 1764, James Hargreaves developed the spinning jenny, a machine that could spin several threads at once. Other inventions speeded up the process of weaving thread into cloth. In the 1780s, Edmund Cartwright built a loom powered by water. It allowed a worker to produce a great deal more cloth in a day than was possible

before. These technological innovations would change how goods were made not only in Britain, but also in America and around the world.
The Factory System New inventions led to a new system of producing goods. Before the Industrial Revolution, most spinning and weaving took place in the home. Industrial production involved large machines, however, and these had to be housed in large mills near rivers. Water flowing downstream or over a waterfall turned a wheel that captured the power to run the machines.
To set up and operate a spinning mill required large amounts of capital, or invested money. Capitalists supplied this money. A capitalist is a person who invests in a business in order to make a profit, or the difference between the cost of a good and its selling price. Capitalists built factories and hired workers to run the machines.
The new factory system brought workers and machinery together in one place to produce goods. Factory workers earned daily or weekly wages. They had to work a set number of hours each day.
In Britain, investors saw an opportunity. Because a single worker could produce much more with a machine than by hand, the cost of goods made by machine was much lower.
As a result, more of those goods could be sold. If an investor built a factory that could produce cloth more cheaply, the investor could make a profit. Investors’ desire to make a profit brought about rapid industrialization.
During the Industrial Revolution, the demand for factory-made products grew. In economics, demand is the readiness of people to purchase goods or services. The supply, or amount of goods available to sell, depended in part on the natural resources factories could get. To make products, factories needed raw materials, power, and laborers to run machinery. Some resources, such as cotton and iron, were in short supply This scarcity, or limited supply, resulted in high prices. In response to high prices, farmers began to grow more cotton to supply spinning mills. Miners and others searched for new sources of iron and other materials used in machinery. The growing demand for products and for the supplies needed to make them led to a great change in standards of living.

Factories Come to America
Britain wanted to keep its technological innovations, or new technologies, secret. It did not want rival nations to copy the new machines. Therefore, the British Parliament passed a law forbidding anyone to take plans of the new machinery out of the country.
Slater Breaks the Law Samuel Slater soon proved that this law could not be enforced. Slater was a skilled mechanic in a British textile mill. When he heard that Americans were offering large rewards for plans of British factories, he decided to leave Britain. In 1789, Slater boarded a ship bound for New York City. He knew that British officials searched the baggage of passengers sailing to the United States. To avoid getting caught, he memorized the design of the machines in the mill.
The First American Mill Slater soon visited Moses Brown, a Quaker capitalist who had a mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The mill was not doing well because its machinery constantly broke down. Slater set to work on improving the machinery. By 1793, in Pawtucket, he built what became the first successful textile mill in the United States that was powered by water. Slater's wife, Hannah Slater, contributed to the success of the

mill. She discovered how to make thread stronger so that it would not snap on the spindles.
Slater’s factory was a huge success. Before long, other American manufacturers began using his ideas.
Interchangeable Parts American manufacturers also benefited from the pioneering work of American inventor Eli Whitney. Earlier, skilled workers made goods by hand. For example, gunsmiths spent days making the barrel, stock, and trigger for a single musket. Because the parts were handmade, each musket differed a bit from every other musket. If a part broke, a gunsmith had to make a new part to fit that particular gun.
Whitney wanted to speed up the making of guns by having machines manufacture each part. All machine-made parts would be alike—for example, one trigger would be identical to another. Identical parts would fit together with all other parts, and gunsmiths would not have build each gun from scratch. Interchangeable parts would save time and money.
Because the government bought many guns, Whitney went to Washington, D.C., to try to sell his idea. At first, officials laughed at his plan. Carefully, Whitney sorted parts for 10 muskets into separate piles. He then asked an official to choose one part from each pile. In minutes, the first musket was assembled. Whitney repeated the process until 10 muskets were complete.
The idea of interchangeable parts spread rapidly. Inventors designed machines to produce interchangeable parts for clocks, locks, and many other goods. With such machines, small workshops grew into factories.
The Spread of Factories The War of 1812 provided a boost to American industries. The British blockade cut Americans off from their supply of foreign goods. As a result, they had to produce more goods themselves. American merchants and bankers sought new ways to meet the increased demand. To profit from the efficiency provided by manufacturing, they built more factories. As American investors took advantage of new technologies and built more factories, the American economy grew.
Where Factories Were Built The first factories were built where physical characteristics of the environment favored them. In Pennsylvania factories used charcoal, which could be made from abundant local timber, for power. These factories turned iron ore, which was mined and smelted locally, into machines, tools, and guns.

In New England, textile factories were built alongside the hilly region’s numerous falling streams, which provided power for mills. Investors modified the physical environment by building dams and canals to power the mills. These modifications spurred economic growth. Local wool and cotton from the South provided the raw materials for thread, yarn, and fabric. In Lynn, Massachusetts, businesses systematized shoemaking, starting shoe factories in the early 19th century. The large factories attracted new workers to the town, and the economy grew rapidly. New England became the first region in the United States to develop manufacturing on a wide scale.
Free Enterprise and the Industrial Revolution In
the United States, the Industrial Revolution took place in a period marked by the growth of free enterprise. British restrictions on trade had been lifted. Hamilton’s reforms had strengthened the banking system, and banks were able to lend more money. New access to credit, or borrowed money, allowed people to start mills and factories in cities and in rural places where swift streams provided power.
These and other businesses operated, for the most part, without much government control. Nor did the government own factories or intervene heavily in the market. The government, however, protected contracts and property. People could buy, sell, or use property as they saw fit.
Most Americans wanted the freedom to try new things. They believed in competition, which encouraged new inventions. In 1792, a group of 24 investors started the New York Stock Exchange. This stock market raised private capital to pay for new ventures. Success meant profits and brought new wealth to investors. Profits led to new investment and further economic growth.
Low taxes allowed businesses to hold onto large amounts of capital and use it to expand and create even more wealth. The desire for profit and accumulated wealth sparked new ventures under new investors.
The Role of Market Forces Investors looked to the market to decide where to invest or what businesses to start. In the free enterprise system, goods are bought and sold, and wages are determined, by the market. If a product is in high demand and the supply is limited, the price will be high. Entrepreneurs started businesses to supply high-priced or high-demand products. They abandoned businesses where the demand and price were low.
Workers faced the same market forces. People with skills that were in demand in factories could expect

higher wages than those whose skills had less value in the market.

Towns
Slater and Whitney’s innovations were just the first steps in America’s Industrial Revolution. During the early 1800s, entire cities began to emerge around factories.
The Lowell Mills During the War of 1812, Francis Cabot Lowell, a Boston merchant, found a way to improve on British textile mills. In Britain, one factory spun thread and a second factory wove it into cloth. Why not, Lowell wondered, combine spinning and weaving under one roof? The new mill that he built in Waltham, Massachusetts, had all the machines needed to turn raw cotton into finished cloth.
After Lowell’s death, his partners took on a more ambitious project. They built an entire factory town

and named it after him. In 1821, Lowell, Massachusetts, was a village of five farm families.
By 1836, it boasted more than 10,000 people. Visitors to Lowell described it as a model community composed of “small wooden houses, painted white, with green blinds, very neat, very snug, very nicely carpeted.”
“Lowell Girls” To work in their new mills, the company hired young women from nearby farms. The Lowell girls, as they came to be called, usually worked for a few years in the mills before returning home to marry. These young women, and women like them in other mill towns, made an important economic contribution to American society by providing labor for the Industrial Revolution. Most sent their wages home to their families.
At first, parents hesitated to let their daughters work in the mills. To reassure parents, the company built boardinghouses, or buildings with many shared bedrooms and a kitch that served meals. The company also made rules to protect the young women.
Although factory work was often tedious, hard, and dangerous, many women valued the economic freedom they got from working in the mills. One worker wrote her sister Sarah back on a farm in New Hampshire:
» Organized child labor was common during the Industrial Revolution. Many American children worked in factories like the English factory shown here. Draw Conclusions Why did reformers begin to speak out against child labor?
Since I have wrote you, another pay day has come around. I earned 14 dollars and a half ... I like it well as ever and Sarah don’t I feel independent of everyone!
— from Lowell Offering: Writings by New England Mill Women
In Lowell and elsewhere, mill owners hired mostly women and children. They did this because they could pay women and children half of what they would have had to pay men.
Child Labor Boys and girls as young as seven worked in factories. Small children were especially useful in textile mills because they could squeeze around the large machines to change spindles.
Today, most Americans look upon child labor as cruel. Yet in the 1800s, farm children also worked hard.
Most people did not see much difference between children working in a factory or on a farm. Often, a child’s wages were needed to help support the family.
Long Hours Working hours in the mills were long—12 hours a day, 6 days a week. True, farmers also put in long hours. However, farmers worked shorter hours in winter. Mill workers, in contrast, worked nearly the same hours all year round.
In the early 1800s, conditions in American mills were generally much better than in most factories in Europe. As industries grew, however, competition increased and employers took less interest in the welfare of their workers. This eventually led to worse working conditions.
Changes in Home Life The Industrial Revolution had a great impact on home life. As the factory system spread, more family members left the home to earn a living. These changes affected ideas about the role of women. In poorer families, women often had to go out to work. In wealthier families, husbands supported the family while wives stayed at home. For many husbands, having a wife who stayed at home became a sign of success.

Cities Expand
In 1800, the vast majority of Americans lived in rural areas. During the Industrial Revolution, many people left farms for cities, attracted by the job opportunities to be found in factories. As investors found that factories produced a profit, they invested those profits in building more factories, which attracted still more workers from farms. Older cities expanded rapidly, while new cities sprang up around factories. This movement of the population from rural areas to cities is called urbanization. Urbanization increased as industry grew.
Urbanization was a steady but gradual process. In
1800, only 6 percent of the nation’s population lived in urban areas. By 1850, the number had risen to 15 Percent. Not until 1920 did more Americans live in cities than in rural areas.
By today’s standards, these early cities were small.
A person could walk from one end of any American city to the other in as little as 30 minutes. Buildings were only a few stories tall. As the factory system spread, the nation’s cities grew.
Hazards of Urbanization Growing cities had many Problems. Many of these were negative consequences human modification of the environment. Dirt and
Piavel streets turned into mud-holes when it rained.
Cities had no sewers, and people threw garbage into the streets. A visitor to New York reported that “The streets are filthy, and the stranger is not a little surprised to meet the hogs walking about in them, for the purpose of devouring the vegetables and trash thrown into the gutter.”
Untreated sewage and garbage often seeped into wells or flowed into streams and rivers, polluting the water. The contaminated water spread disease. Epidemics of influenza and cholera (KAHL ur uh) raged through cities, killing thousands.
At about the same time, coal became an important source of industrial and home heating power. The smoke and soot from burning coal seriously modified the environment, polluting the air and dirtying cities. It also caused health problems.
Attractions Cities had attractions besides work opportunities. Theaters, museums, and circuses created an air of excitement. In cities, people could shop in fine stores that sold the latest fashions from Europe. Some offered modern “ready-to-wear" clothing. While most women continued to sew their own clothes, many enjoyed visiting hat shops, china shops, shoe stores, and “fancy-goods” stores.

New Technological
Innovations
Northern industry grew steadily in the mid-1800s. Most northerners still lived on farms. However, more and more of the northern economy began to depend on manufacturing and trade.
The 1800s brought a flood of new inventions in the North. "In Massachusetts and Connecticut,” a European visitor exclaimed, "there is not a laborer who has not invented a machine or a tool.” Americans of the period were a practical people. Americans, and especially northerners, looked to science for new and useful applications that could be put to work at once. They expected technology to bring economic development and to change the way people lived.
Technology refers to ways of doing things, sometimes involving advanced scientific knowledge, or tools that make use of advanced knowledge. Innovation is coming up with new ways of making or doing things.
Scientific and technological innovations during the colonial period, such as Franklin's lightning rod, had brought limited and modest changes to daily life in America. By comparison, the scientific and technological innovations of the 1800s transformed how Americans lived and worked.

In 1834, Philo Stewart developed a cast-iron stove small enough for use in an average kitchen. His factory-built wood-burning stove was a great success. About 90,000 were sold. The cast-iron stove was only one sign of the way northern factories were changing the lives of ordinary people.
Joseph Henry, a New Yorker, showed that electric current could be sent through a wire over long distances to ring a bell. His work paved the way for later inventions. Thomas Davenport, a blacksmith, invented a type of electric motor in 1834.
Both inventions were adapted and marketed. Competition among inventors brought about more innovation.
In 1846, Elias Howe patented a sewing machine. A few years later, Isaac Singer improved on Howe’s machine. Soon, clothing makers bought hundreds of the new sewing machines. Workers could now make dozens of shirts in the time it took a tailor to sew one by hand.
Farm Machines Some new inventions made work easier for farmers. In 1825, Jethro Wood began the manufacture of an iron plow with replaceable parts. John Deere improved on the idea when he invented a lightweight steel plow. Earlier plows made of heavy iron or wood had to be pulled by slow-moving oxen. A horse could pull a steel plow through a field more quickly.
In 1847, Cyrus McCormick opened a factory in Chicago that produced mechanical reapers. The reaper was a horse-drawn machine that mowed wheat and other grains. McCormick’s reaper could do the work of five people using hand tools.
Other farm machines followed. There was a mechanical drill to plant grain, a threshing machine to beat grain from its husk, and a horse-drawn hay rake. These machines helped farmers raise more grain with fewer hands. As a result, thousands of farmworkers left the countryside. Some went west to start farms of their own. Others found jobs in new factories in northern cities.

New Communications System, the Telegraph Samuel F. B. Morse received a patent for a “talking wire,” or telegraph, in 1844. The telegraph was a device that sent electrical signals along a wire. It was a new technology that was made possible by scientific discoveries about electricity. The signals were based on a code of dots, dashes, and spaces. The dots stood for short tones, the dashes for long tones. Later, this system of dots and dashes became known as the Morse code.
Congress gave Morse funds to run wire from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore. On May 24,1844, Morse

set up his telegraph in the Supreme Court chamber in Washington.
As a crowd, of onlookers watched, Morse tapped out a short message. What hath God wrought!” A few seconds later, the operator in Baltimore tapped back the same message. The telegraph worked!
Morse’s invention was an instant success. Telegraph companies sprang up everywhere. Thousands of miles of wire soon stretched across the country. As a result of the telegraph, news could now travel long distances in a matter of minutes.
The telegraph helped many businesses to thrive. Merchants and farmers could have quick access to information about supply demand, and prices of goods in different areas of the country. For example, western farmers might learn of a wheat shortage in New York and ship their grain east to meet the demand. The availability of instant information about markets changed the way goods were marketed across the country and contributed to the development of a nationwide market.
The quick and widespread use of the telegraph connected the nation in a completely new way. Almost every American town eventually had a telegraph, providing nearly instant communication from coast to coast. By the late 1850s, a telegraph cable connected the United States with Europe. Just as the telegraph transformed national marketing, it also helped change the way goods were marketed internationally.
Not only commerce and industry benefited from the telegraph, but ordinary people could communicate quickly with distant family and friends. The presence of telegraph offices in cities and towns was yet another of the many attractions that helped drive urbanization. The telegraph is an example of how scientific discoveries influenced daily life during the 1800s.

How did the invention of new farm machines contribute to urbanization in the North? The Age of Steam Power
At first, railroads were used to provide transportation to canals. In time, however, the railroad became a more practical means of transportation than canals. The first railroads were built in the early 1800s. Horses or mules Pulled cars along wooden rails covered with strips iron. Then, in 1829, an English family developed a steam-powered locomotive engine to pull rail cars.
The engine, called the Rocket, barreled along at 30 uuiles per hour.
» This engraving shows an early steam-powered locomotive. The steam-powered locomotive was the main way to travel and ship goods across America by the mid-1800s.
Interactive Gallery
Early Difficulties Not all Americans welcomed the new railroads. Workers who moved freight on horse-drawn wagons feared that they would lose their jobs. People who had invested in canals worried that competition from the railroads might cause them to lose their investments.
There were problems with the early railroads. They were not always safe or reliable. Soft roadbeds and weak bridges often led to accidents. Locomotives often broke down. Even when they worked, their smokestacks belched thick black smoke and hot embers. The embers sometimes burned holes in passengers’ clothing or set nearby buildings on fire.
Part of the problem was the way in which railroads were built. Often, instead of two tracks being laid—one for each direction—only one was set. Signals to control traffic on a single track did not yet exist. This increased the likelihood of a collision.
Another problem with early railroads was that there was no standard gauge, or distance between the rails. As a result, different railroads often used different gauges. To transfer from one railroad line to another, people and goods had to be moved off one train and then loaded onto another.

A
Railroad Boom Gradually, railroad builders overcame problems and removed obstacles. Engineers learned to build sturdier bridges and solid roadbeds. They replaced wooden rails with iron rails. Railroads developed signaling systems and agreed on a standard gauge. Such improvements made railroad travel safer and faster. By the 1850s, railroads crisscrossed the nation. The major lines were concentrated in the North and West. New York, Chicago, and Cincinnati became major rail centers. The South had much less track than the North.
Railroads played an important role in urban growth. Cities with good rail connections attracted factories and other businesses. Railroads also made it possible for people to migrate more easily to new cities, increasing urban populations.
Yankee Clippers Railroads increased commerce within the United States. At the same time, trade also increased between the United States and other nations. At seaports in the Northeast, captains loaded their ships with cotton, fur, wheat, lumber, and tobacco. Then, they sailed to other parts of the world.
Speed was the key to successful trade at sea. In 1845, an American named John Griffiths launched the Rainbow, the first of the clipper ships. These sleek vessels had tall masts and huge sails that caught every gust of wind. Their narrow hulls clipped swiftly
through the water. These technological innovations gave up cargo space for speed, which gave American merchants an advantage.
In the 1840s, American clipper ships broke every speed record. One clipper ship sped from New York to Hong Kong in 81 days, flying past older ships that took many months to reach China. The speed of the clippers helped the United States win a large share of the world’s sea trade in the 1840s and 1850s.
The golden age of clipper ships was brief. In the 1850s, Britain launched the first oceangoing iron steamships. These sturdy vessels carried more cargo and traveled even faster than clippers.
The Effects of Technological and Scientific Innovations In the late 1700s and early 1800s, scientists and inventors had found ways to harness heat, in the form of steam, to power machines. By the 1830s, factories began to use steam power instead of water power. Machines that were driven by steam were powerful and cheap to run. Also, factories that used steam power could be built almost anywhere, not just along the banks of swift-flowing rivers. As a result, American industry expanded rapidly.
At the same time, new machines made it possible to produce more goods at a lower cost. These more affordable goods attracted eager buyers. Families no longer had to make clothing and other goods in their homes. Instead, they could buy factory-made products.
Society and Culture Before the Civil War 330	7.1 The Industrial Revolution and Life in the North
The Impact of Railroads Railroads allowed factory owners to transport large amounts of raw materials and finished goods cheaply and quickly Also, as railroads stretched across the nation, they linked distant towns with cities and factories. These towns became new markets for factory goods. Railroads greatly increased the size of the American marketplace and fueled even more factory production.
The growth of railroads also affected northern farming. Railroads brought cheap grain and other foods from the West to New England. New England farmers could not compete with this new source of cheap foods. Many left their farms to find new jobs in towns and cities as factory workers, store clerks, and sailors.
The Benefits of Free Enterprise The early rise of industrialization in the United States under the free enterprise system brought striking economic and social benefits. Mass producation lowered prices and raised Americans' purchasing power and standard of living. Wages increased for average workers. Food canned in factories improved peoples’ year-round diets.
The use of stoves improved meals and home heating. Factory-made clothing was cheaper than homemade. Great numbers of newspapers and magazines reported regularly about the new inventions and advertised the new products. Along with these changes, though, there were also challenges.

Workers Respond to
Challenges
Factories of the 1840s and 1850s were very different from the mills of the early 1800s. As industrialization grew, life changed for workers. The factories were larger, and they used steam-powered machines. Laborers worked longer hours for lower wages. Usually, workers lived in dark, dingy houses in the shadow of the factory.
Changing Roles The emphasis on mass production changed the way workers felt about their jobs. Before the growth of factories, skilled workers, or artisans, were proud of the goods they made. The factory owner, however, was more interested in how much could be produced than in how well it was made. Workers could not be creative. Furthermore, unlike the artisan who could have his or her own business, the factory worker was not likely to rise to a management position.

Society and Culture Before the Civil War 331	7.1 The Industrial Revolution and Life in the North
Families in Factories As the need for workers increased, entire families labored in factories. In some cases, a family agreed to work for one year. If even one family member broke the contract, the entire family might be fired.
The factory day began when a whistle sounded at 4 A.M. The entire family—father, mother, and children— headed off to work. Many factories, at that time, employed young children. The workday did not end until 7:30 P.M., when a final whistle sent the workers home.
Hazards at Work Factory workers faced discomfort and danger. Few factories had windows or heating systems. In summer, the heat and humidity inside the factory were stifling. In winter, the extreme cold contributed to frequent sickness.
Factory machines had no safety devices, and accidents were common. There were no laws regulating factory conditions, and injured workers often lost their jobs.
Trade Unions and Strikes Poor working conditions and low wages led workers to organize into groups to improve their conditions. The first workers to organize

were artisans. In the 1820s and 1830s, artisans in each trade united to form trade unions. Trade unions were part of a labor reform movement.
The concentration of workers in cities helped the formation of unions by allowing people working in the same industry for different companies to organize together. Their trade unions called for a shorter workday, higher wages, and better working conditions. Sometimes, unions went on strike to gain their demands. In a strike, union workers refuse to do their jobs until managers agree to address their concerns.
In the early 1800s, strikes were illegal in many parts of the United States. Strikers faced fines or jail sentences. Employers often fired strike leaders. Employers were politically opposed to workers organizing.
Progress for Artisans Slowly, however, the labor reform movement made progress. In 1840, President Van Buren approved a ten-hour workday for government employees. Workers celebrated another victory in 1842 when a Massachusetts court declared that they had the right to strike.
Artisans won better pay because factory owners needed their skills. Unskilled workers, however, were unable to bargain for better wages since their jobs required little or no training. Because these workers were easy to replace, employers did not listen to their demands.
During the Industrial Revolution, a new awareness of class differences began to emerge. As a farming people, Americans had long viewed labor with deep respect. The changing conditions of factory labor and the gaps between the wages of unskilled workers, managers, and business owners led to a sense of people grouped in classes with shared interests. The interests of these classes were often different. By bringing together workers and managers in the same factories and cities, urbanization led to a rise in conflicts resulting from differences in social class.
Women Workers Organize The success of trade unions encouraged other workers to organize. Workers in New England textile mills were especially eager to protest cuts in wages and unfair work rules. Many of these workers were women.
Women workers faced special problems. First, they had always earned less money than men did. Second, most union leaders did not want women in their ranks. Like many people at the time, they believed that women should not work outside the home. In fact, the goal of many unions was to raise men’s wages so that their wives could leave their factory jobs.
Despite these problems, women workers organized. They staged several strikes at Lowell, Massachusetts,

B DRAW CONCLUSIONS
Why could artisans command higher wages while other workers could not? Ethnic Minorities in the North
By the late 1840s, many factory workers in the North were immigrants. An immigrant is a person who enters a new country in order to settle there. In the 1840s and 1850s, about 4 million immigrants arrived in the United States. They were attracted, in large part, by the opportunities for farming the land or working in the cities. Among them were immigrants from Britain who came to earn higher wages. There was a greater demand in the United States for skilled machinists, carpenters, and miners.
From Ireland and Germany In the 1840s, a disease destroyed the potato crop in Ireland, which was the mam food of the poor people. Other crops, such as wheat and oats, were not affected. At the time, Ireland was under British rule and most Irish crops were exported to England. When a large part of the potato crop was lost to disease, British landowners continued to ship the wheat and oats to England. There was little left for the Irish to eat. This situation caused a famine, or severe food shortage. Thousands of people died of starvation. Nearly as many died from disease. Between 1845 and 1860, over 1.5 million Irish fled to the United States seeking freedom from hunger and British rule.
Meanwhile, many Germans were also arriving in the United States. Harsh weather conditions from 1829 to 1830 resulted in severe food shortages in Germany. By 1832, more than 10,000 Germans were coming to the United States in a single year seeking fertile land to farm and a better life. In 1848, revolutions had broken out in several parts of Germany. The rebels fought for democratic reforms. When the revolts failed, thousands had to flee. Attracted by its democratic political system, many came to the United States.
Many other German immigrants came simply to make a better life for themselves. Between 1848 and f86O, nearly one million Germans arrived in the United States.
Enriching the Nation Immigrants supplied much °f the labor that helped the nation’s economy grow.
» This scene shows immigrants landing in New York City in the 1850s. Many immigrants had little money when they first arrived in the United States and had to remain in the cities where they disembarked.
Although most of the Irish immigrants had been farmers, few had money to buy farmland. Many settled in the northern cities where low-paying factory jobs were available. Other Irish workers transformed the environment by helping to build many new canals and railroads. Irish women often worked as servants in private homes.
Immigrants from Germany often had enough money to move west and buy good farmland. These immigrants transfomed the environment by turning prairie into farmland. Others were artisans and merchants. Cities of the Midwest such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Cincinnati had German grocers, butchers, and bakers.
A small minority of the immigrants from Germany were Jewish. German Jews began immigrating to the United States in the 1820s. By the early 1860s, there were about 150 communities in the United States with substantial Jewish populations.
Most Irish immigrants and many German immigrants were Catholic. By contrast, most Americans in the early 1800s were Protestant. Because many immigrants, especially from Ireland, were drawn to America’s growing cities, the process of urbanization led to an increase in both ethnic and religious diversity.
Society and Culture Before the Civil War 333	7.1 The Industrial Revolution and Life in the North
A
Reaction Against Immigrants Not everyone welcomed the flood of immigrants. One group of Americans, called nativists, wanted to preserve the country for native-born, white citizens. Using the slogan “Americans must rule America,” they called for laws to limit immigration. They also wanted to keep immigrants from voting until they had lived in the United States for 21 years. At the time, newcomers could vote after only 5 years in the country. Some nativists protested that newcomers “stole” jobs from native-born Americans because they worked for lower pay. Furthermore, when workers went out on strike, factory owners often hired immigrant workers to replace them. Many distrusted the different language, customs, and dress of the immigrants. Others blamed immigrants for the rise in crime in the growing cities. Still others mistrusted Irish newcomers because many of them were Catholics. Until the 1840s, the majority of immigrants from Europe had been Protestants. As American cities attracted Catholic immigrants, these cities became centers of conflicts over religion.
By the 1850s, hostility to immigrants was so strong that nativists formed a new political party. Members of the party were anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant. Many meetings and rituals of the party were kept secret. It was called the Know-Nothing party because members answered, “I know nothing,” when asked about the

party. The message of the party did gain supporters, but its support was limited to the North, where most immigrants settled. In 1856, Millard Fillmore, the Know-Nothing candidate for President won 21 percent of the popular vote. Soon after, however, the party died out.
In time, conflicts between ethnic groups were resolved as immigrants or their children became part of American society. Also, different ethnic groups became incorporated into the nation’s political fabric as political parties, particularly the Democratic Party, began to speak for their interests.
African Americans Face Discrimination During the nation’s early years, slavery was legal in the North. By the early 1800s, however, all of the northern states had passed laws to bring an end to slavery. In some states, only the children of slaves gained freedom at first. Many did not completely abolish slavery until the mid-1800s. Still, thousands of free African Americans lived in the North, and their number grew steadily during the early 1800s.
Free African Americans in the North faced discrimination. Discrimination is a policy or an attitude that denies equal rights to certain groups of people. As one writer pointed out, African Americans were denied “the ballot-box, the jury box, the halls of the legislature, the army, the public lands, the school, and the church.”
Even skilled African Americans had trouble finding good jobs. One black woodworker was turned away by every furniture maker in Cincinnati. At last, a shop owner hired him. However, when he entered the shop, the other woodworkers dropped their tools. Either he must leave or they would, they declared. Similar experiences occurred throughout the North. In addition, African Americans faced competition from immigrants who settled in northern cities.
Yet Some Find Success Despite such obstacles, free blacks in North had some choice over where they lived and worked, unlike enslaved blacks in the South. In fact, some northern African Americans achieved notable success in business. William Whipper grew wealthy as the owner of a lumberyard in Pennsylvania. He devoted much of his time and money to fighting slavery. Henry Boyd operated a profitable furniture company in Cincinnati.
African Americans made strides in other areas as well. Henry Blair invented a corn planter and a cottonseed planter.
In 1845, Macon Allen became the first African American licensed to practice law in the United States. After graduating from Bowdoin College in Maine, John

Eli Whitney Invents the Cotton Gin Eli Whitney, a young Connecticut schoolteacher, was traveling to Georgia in 1793. He was going to be a tutor on a plantation. At that time, there were few public schools in the South. When Whitney learned of the planters’ problem, he decided to build a machine to clean cotton.
In only 10 days, Whitney came up with a model. His cotton engine, or gin, had two rollers with thin wire teeth. When cotton was swept between the rollers, the teeth separated the seeds from the fibers.

could now grow cotton at a huge profit. As a result, this technological innovation brought economic growth.
Cotton Kingdom and Slavery The cotton gin led to a boom, or swift growth, in cotton production. In 1792, planters grew only 6,000 bales of cotton a year. By 1850, the figure was over 2 million bales.
There was not enough farmland suitable for growing cotton in the original southern states along the Atlantic coast to meet the demand. Cotton farmers needed new land to cultivate, or prepare for planting.
After the War of 1812, cotton planters began to move west. They brought enslaved African Americans with them. The huge demand for cotton, the efficiency offered by cotton gins, and southern planters reliance on slave labor led to the growth of large plantations, each with many enslaved workers.
By the 1850s, there were cotton plantations extending in a belt from South Carolina to Texas. This area of the South became known as the Cotton Kingdom. Physical aspects of the environment in this part of the South, including rich soils, warm temperatures, and abundant rainfall, encouraged an economy focused on cotton farming.
Tragically, as the Cotton Kingdom spread, so did slavery. Even though cotton could now be cleaned by machine, it still had to be planted and picked by hand. The result was a cruel cycle in which slave labor brought profits to planters, who then used the profits to buy more land and more enslaved workers.

Predict Consequences How would this invention affect the demand for slaves?
Reliance on Agriculture
Cotton was the South’s most profitable cash crop. However, the best soils and climate for growing cotton could be found mostly in a belt stretching across inland South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. In other areas of the South, rice, sugar cane, and tobacco were major crops. In addition, southerners raised much of the nation’s livestock. Physical characteristics of the environment in different regions of the South influenced what farmers in those regions produced.
Rice was an important crop along the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia. Sugar cane was important in Louisiana and Texas. Growing rice and sugar cane required expensive irrigation and drainage systems end a warm, moist climate, all found mainly along the coasts.

7.2 King Cotton and Life in the South
Cane growers also needed costly machinery to grind their harvest. Small-scale farmers could not afford such expensive equipment, however. As a result, rice and sugar farmers relied on the plantation system just as cotton farmers did.
Tobacco had been an export of the South since 1619, and it continued to be planted in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky. However, in the early 1800s, the large tobacco plantations of colonial days had given way to small tobacco farms. On these farms, a few field hands tended five or six acres of tobacco.
In addition to the major cash crops of cotton, rice, sugar, and tobacco, the South also led the nation in livestock production. Southern livestock owners profited from hogs, oxen, horses, mules, and beef cattle. Much of this livestock was raised in areas that were unsuitable for growing crops, such as the pine woods of North Carolina and hilly regions of Georgia, western Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas. Kentucky developed a rural economy that included the breeding of horses.
Limited Southern Industry Because the South relied on agriculture, most of the industry in the South remained small and existed only to meet the needs of a farming society. This contrasted with the North, with
its increasingly urban society and large and diverse industries. Agricultural tools such as cotton gins, planters, and plows were manufactured. Factories also made goods such as ironware, hoes, and jute, or hemp cloth, which was used to make bags for holding bales of cotton. Cheap cotton cloth was made for use in enslaved workers’ clothing. Some southerners wanted to encourage the growth of industry in the South. William Gregg, for example, modeled his cotton mill in South Carolina on the mills in Lowell, Massachusetts. Gregg built houses and gardens for his paid workers and schools for their children.
The South also developed a few other successful industries. In Richmond, Virginia, for example, the Tredegar Iron Works turned out railroad equipment, machinery, tools, and cannons. Flour milling was another important southern industry.
Even so, the South lagged behind the North in manufacturing. This difference had several causes. Rich planters invested their money in land and in purchasing enslaved African Americans rather than in factories.
Slavery also reduced the need for southern industry. In the North, most people had enough money to buy factory goods. In the South, however, millions of enslaved African Americans could not buy anything.

As a result, the demand for manufactured goods in the South was not as great as it was in the North.
Southern Cities Although the South was mainly rural, there were some cities. The major ones were New Orleans, Louisiana; Charleston, South Carolina; and Richmond, Virginia. These cities had the same problems as northern cities, including poor housing and poor sanitation.
Fewer than 8 percent of white southerners lived in towns of more than 4,000 people. However, many free African Americans lived in towns and cities.
Economically Dependent The South’s lack of industry had a number of effects on the South. Because there were few industrial jobs, small farmers in the South had few ways to escape the poverty of life on a small farm, whereas northern farmers could move to cities and take factory jobs. With little industry °f its own, the South also came to depend more and We on the North and on Europe. Southern planters °ften borrowed money from northern banks in order to expand their plantations. They also purchased much of their furniture, farm tools, and machines from northern or European factories.
Many southerners resented this situation. One southerner described a burial to show how the South upended on the North for many goods in the 1850s.
The grave was dug through solid marble, but the marble headstone came from Vermont. It was in a pine wilderness but the pine coffin came from Cincinnati. An iron mountain overshadowed it but the coffin nails and the screws and the shovel came from Pittsburgh. ... A hickory grove grew nearby, but the pick and shovel handles came from New York. . . . That country, so rich in underdeveloped resources, furnished nothing for the funeral except the corpse and the hole in the ground.
—Henry Grady, Speech to the Bay Street Club, Boston, 1883
Still, most southerners were proud of the booming cotton economy in their region. As long as cotton remained king, southerners believed, they could look to the future with confidence.

Southern Whites
The Old South is often pictured as a land of vast plantations worked by hundreds of enslaved African Americans. Such grand estates did exist in the South. However, most white southerners were not rich planters. In fact, most whites owned no enslaved African Americans at all.
The “Cottonocracy” A planter was someone who owned at least 20 enslaved workers. In 1860, only one white southerner in 30 belonged to a planter family. An even smaller number—less than 1 percent— owned 50 or more enslaved workers. These wealthy families were called the “cottonocracy” because they made huge amounts of money from cotton. These rich planters lived mainly in the cotton belt of the lowland South and in coastal areas of South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana. Though few in number, their views and way of life dominated the South.
The richest planters built elegant homes and filled them with expensive furniture from Europe. They entertained lavishly. They tried to dress and behave like European nobility.
Because of their wealth and influence, many planters became political leaders. Planters hired white overseers to run day-to-day affairs on their plantations and to manage the work of enslaved African Americans.
» Wealthy white southerners lived in elegant homes on plantations, like this plantation home in Mississippi.
®ll Interactive Chart
Small Farmers About 75 percent of southern whites were small farmers. These “plain folk” owned the land they farmed. They might also own one or two enslaved African Americans. Unlike planters, plain folk worked with their enslaved workers in the fields. Small farmers could be found in most parts of the South, but their numbers were fewer in the cotton belt and in coastal regions where plantation agriculture was dominant.
Among small farmers, helping one another was an important duty. “People who lived miles apart counted themselves as neighbors,” wrote a farmer in Mississippi. “And in case of sorrow or sickness, there was no limit to the service neighbors provided."
Poor Whites Lower on the social ladder were poor whites. These whites did not own enslaved African Americans. Many did not own the land they farmed. Instead, they rented it, often paying the owner with part of their crop. Many barely made a living.
Poor whites often lived in the hilly, wooded areas of the upland South, north and west of the cotton belt. They planted crops such as corn, potatoes, and other vegetables. They also herded cattle and pigs. Poor whites had hard lives, but they enjoyed rights that were denied to all black people, enslaved or free.
Comparing Northern and Southern Whites Like northern whites, most southern whites were farmers. Most white farmers in both regions were small farmers. However, there were important differences in the white populations of the two regions. In the South, the wealthiest whites were planters who made their money from the work of enslaved African Americans. In the North, the wealthiest whites were capitalists who made their money from investing in industry. There were many white industrial workers and middle class people living in cities in the North. Relatively few southerners of any class lived in cities.
U RECALL
Who made up the “cottonocracy” in the Old South?
Southern African Americans
Both free and enslaved African Americans lived in the South. Their legal and political conditions were different. Although free under the law and with certain legal rights, free African Americans faced harsh discrimination. Enslaved African Americans had no rights at all.
Society and Culture Before the Civil War
340	7.2 King Cotton and Life in the South
Free African Americans Most free African Americans were descendants of enslaved people who were freed during and after the American Revolution. Others had bought their freedom. In 1860, over 200,000 free blacks lived in the South. Most lived in Maryland and Delaware, where slavery was in decline. Others lived in cities such as New Orleans, Richmond, and Charleston.
Many free African Americans reached an impressive level of success. Working as farmers, laborers, and artisans, such as blacksmiths, carpenters, and cobblers, they contributed to and influenced southern life. Some owned and operated businesses, such as inns and barbershops. A few became large plantation owners, growing cotton and owning enslaved workers.
White slave owners did not like free African Americans living in the South. They feared that free African Americans set a dangerous example, encouraging enslaved African Americans to rebel. Also, slave owners justified slavery by claiming that African Americans could not take care of themselves. Free African Americans proved this idea wrong.
To discourage free African Americans, southern states passed laws that made life even harder for them. Free African Americans were not allowed to vote or travel. In some southern states, they had to move out of the state or risk the chance of being kidnapped and enslaved.
Despite these limits, free African Americans were able to make a life for themselves and make valuable contributions to southern life. For example, Norbert Rillieux (rihl yoo) invented a machine that revolutionized the way sugar was refined. Another inventor, Henry Blair, patented a seed planter.
Enslaved African Americans By 1860, enslaved African Americans made up one third of the South’s population. Most worked as field hands on cotton plantations. Both men and women cleared new land and planted and harvested crops. Children helped by pulling weeds, collecting wood, and carrying water to the field hands. By the time they were teenagers, they worked between 12 and 14 hours a day. Daily labor in the fields bound enslaved workers into a community of people who tried to help and protect one another.
On large plantations, some enslaved African Americans had better positions. They might work as household servants or as skilled artisans, such as carpenters and blacksmiths. Such jobs might entitle Workers to better food or clothing than field hands. A few enslaved people worked in cities. Their earnings, however, belonged to their owners. Unlike free African Americans, enslaved African Americans could not easily start businesses of their own.
» These reconstructed slave cabins in Louisiana, which would have housed up to two families of enslaved African Americans each, appear as they would have on mid-nineteenth century plantations.
Another major difference between the social circumstances of free and enslaved African Americans was that enslaved African American families could be broken up by their owners, with family members sold separately. While they faced discriminations, free African American families were not forced to separate.
COMPARE AND CONTRAST
How was life in the South similar and different for free and enslaved African Americans? Slavery in the South
The life of enslaved African Americans was determined by strict laws and the practices of individual slave owners. Conditions varied from plantation to plantation. Some owners made sure their enslaved workers had clean cabins, decent food, and warm clothes. Other planters spent as little as possible on their enslaved workers.
Slave Codes Southern states passed laws known as slave codes to keep enslaved African Americans from either running away or rebelling. These codes applied to enslaved blacks but not to free blacks. Under the
Society and Culture Before the Civil War 341	7.2 King Cotton and Life in the South
codes, enslaved African Americans were forbidden to gather in groups of more than three.
They could not leave their owner’s land without a written pass from their owner. They were not allowed to own guns.
Slave codes also made it a crime for enslaved African Americans to learn how to read and write. Owners hoped that this law would make it hard for African Americans to escape slavery. They reasoned that uneducated enslaved African Americans who escaped their owners would not be able to use maps or read train schedules. They would not be able to find their way north.
Some laws were meant to protect enslaved African Americans, but only from the worst forms of abuse. However, enslaved African Americans did not have the right to testify in court. As a result, they were not able to bring charges against owners who abused them.
Enslaved African Americans had only one real protection against mistreatment. Owners looked on their enslaved workers as valuable property. Most slave owners wanted to keep this human property healthy and productive.
Hard Work Even the kindest owners insisted that their enslaved workers work long, hard days. Enslaved
» Slave owners expected enslaved children to work alongside their parents, such as these children working on a cotton field in Georgia.
African Americans worked from “can see to can’t see," or from dawn to dusk, up to 16 hours a day. Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery, recalled his life under one harsh master:
We were worked in all weathers. It was never too hot or too cold; it could never rain, blow, hail, or snow too hard for us to work in the field. Work, work, work. . . . The longest days were too short for him and the shortest nights too long for him.
—Frederick Douglass, Ncinative? ot I: tie Life of Frederick
Douglass, An American Slave
Family Life It was hard for enslaved African Americans to keep their families together. Southern laws did not recognize slave marriages or slave families. As a result, owners could sell a husband and wife to different buyers. Children were often taken from their parents and sold.
On large plantations, many enslaved families did manage to stay together. For those African Americans, the family was a source of strength, pride, and love. Grandparents, parents, children, aunts, uncles, and cousins formed a close-knit group. This idea of an extended family had its roots in Africa.
Enslaved African Americans preserved other traditions as well. Parents taught their children traditional African stories and songs. They used folk tales to pass on African history and moral beliefs.
Religion Offers Hope By the 1800s, many enslaved African Americans were devout Christians. Planters often allowed white ministers to preach to their slaves. African Americans also had their own preachers and beliefs.
Religion helped African Americans cope with the harshness of slave life. Bible stories about how the ancient Hebrews had escaped from slavery inspired a new type of religious song called a spiritual. As they worked in the fields, enslaved workers would often sing about a coming day of freedom.
Enslaved African Americans had to be cautious even in their religious practice. While they sang of freedom in spirituals, the words of the spirituals suggested that this freedom would come after death, so as not to alarm slave owners.

Resisting Slavery
Enslaved African Americans struck back against the system that denied them both freedom and wages. Some broke tools, destroyed crops, and stole food.
Many enslaved African Americans tried to escape to the North. Because the journey was long and dangerous, very few made it to freedom. Every county had slave patrols and sheriffs ready to question an unknown black person.
In the North, as you will learn, African Americans were able to fight slavery with peaceful means. Because southern laws offered no means to resist slavery, a few African Americans turned to violence to resist the brutal slave system. Denmark Vesey, a free African American, planned a revolt in 1822. Vesey was betrayed before the revolt began. He and 35 other people were executed.
In 1831, an African American preacher named Nat Turner led a major revolt. An enslaved worker on a plantation in Southampton County, Virginia, Turner believed his mission was to take revenge on plantation owners.
Turner led his followers through Virginia, killing more than 57 whites. For nearly two months terrified whites hunted the countryside looking for Turner. They killed many innocent African Americans before catching and hanging him.
Nat Turner’s revolt increased southern fears of an uprising of enslaved African Americans. Revolts were rare, however. Since southern whites were well armed and kept careful track of African Americans, a revolt by African Americans had almost no chance of success.

The period between 1815 and 1860 is sometimes known as the Reform Era in the United States, because there were so many movements for social reform during this period. Social reform is an organized attempt to improve what is unjust or imperfect in society. The impulse toward social reform had political, social, and religious causes.

which people would attain salvation after death. This belief led many people to worry that they could do nothing to be saved.
During the 1700s, Protestant thinkers in England and the colonies began to argue that salvation depended on a person’s actions in this life. Its leaders stressed free will rather than predestination. They taught that individuals could choose to save their souls by their own actions. In the early 1800s, a dynamic religious movement known as the Second Great Awakening swept the nation. Arguments by religious thinkers were the main cause of this movement. Another cause was the democratic spirit of the Jacksonian era, which encouraged people to think independently and not blindly obey established religious authorities.
To stir religious feelings, preachers held revivals, huge outdoor meetings. Revivals might last for days and attract thousands of people. A witness recalled the excitement of a revival at Cane Ridge, Kentucky:
The vast sea of human beings seemed to be agitated as if by storm. I counted seven ministers all preaching at once. . . . Some of the people were singing, others praying, some crying for mercy.
One of the most vigorous social reformers was Dorothea Dix, a Boston schoolteacher whose strong religious beliefs spurred her to care for those less fortunate. She turned her attention to what one minister called the “outsiders” in society: criminals and the mentally ill.
Reforming Care of the Disabled In 1841, Dix visited a jail for women near Boston. She was outraged to discover that some of the prisoners were not criminals, but mentally ill.
Dix demanded to know why these women were locked in small, dark, unheated cells. The jailer replied that “lunatics” did not feel the cold.
During the next 18 months, Dix visited every jail, poorhouse, and hospital in Massachusetts. Her shocking reports helped persuade state legislators to fund a new mental hospital:

An Era of Reform
Political Ideals Lead to Reform As you have read, during the Jacksonian era, politics was becoming more democratic. More people could vote and take part in government than ever before.
Still, some critics said American society was not democratic enough. They pointed to the promise of liberty and equality expressed in the Declaration of Independence. A true democracy, they argued, ' would not allow slavery. Others asked why women had fewer rights than men. By changing such injustices, reformers hoped to move the nation closer to its political ideals.
Social Conditions Call for Reform As you have learned, the Industrial Revolution was changing the American economy and working conditions, especially in the North, and cities were growing rapidly. Crowded cities created new challenges for social well being. At the same time, there was a growing need for an educated workforce.
As American society changed, it required new institutions to meet its changing needs.

One leader of the Second Great Awakening was a minister named Charles Grandison Finney. A powerful speaker, Finney taught that individual salvation was the first step toward “the complete reformation of the whole world.” Such teachings had effects that changed the country inspiring a number of new social reform movements.

Dix went on to inspect jails as far away as Louisiana and Illinois. Her reports persuaded most legislatures to treat the mentally ill as patients, not criminals.
The Impact of Prison Reform Dix also joined a growing movement to improve conditions in prisons. Men, women, and children were often crammed together in cold, damp rooms. When food supplies were low, prisoners went hungry—unless they had money to buy meals from jailers.
Five out of six people in northern jails were debtors, or people who could not pay money they owed. While behind bars, debtors had no way to earn money to pay back their debts. As a result, many debtors remained in prison for years.
Dix and others called for changes in the prison system. As a result, some states built prisons with only one or two inmates to a cell. Cruel punishments were banned, and people convicted of minor crimes received

shorter sentences. Slowly, states stopped treating debtors as criminals.
The Impact of the Temperance Movement Alcohol abuse was widespread in the early 1800s. At political rallies, weddings, and funerals, men, women, and sometimes even children drank heavily. Men could buy whiskey in candy stores or barbershops.
The temperance movement, a campaign against alcohol abuse, took shape in the late 1820s. Women often took a leading role in the battle. They knew that “demon rum” could lead to the physical abuse of wives and children and the breakup of families.
Some temperance groups urged people to drink less. Others sought to end drinking altogether. They won a major victory in 1851, when Maine banned the sale of alcohol. Eight other states passed “Maine laws." Most states later repealed the laws, but the temperance crusade would gain new strength in the late 1800s.
Id DESCRIBE Dorothea’s Dix’s legacy as a social

The Impact of Educational Reform
In 1800, few American children attended school. Massachusetts was the only state that required free public schools supported by the community. Teachers were poorly trained and ill paid. Students of all ages crowded together in a single room.
As more men won the right to vote, reformers acted to improve education. They argued that a republic required educated citizens.
Education Reform Gives Rise to Public Schools
Horace Mann became head of the Massachusetts board of education in 1837. A Unitarian inspired by the Second Great Awakening, Mann believed that education would help citizens become better Christians. He hounded legislators to provide more money for education. Under his leadership, Massachusetts built new schools, extended the school year, and raised teachers’ pay. The state also opened three colleges to train teachers.
Other states followed the lead of Massachusetts. By the 1850s, most northern states had set up free tax-supported elementary schools. Schools in the South improved more slowly. In both the North and the South, schooling usually ended in the eighth grade. There were few public high schools.
Expanding Education for African Americans In
most areas, African Americans had little chance to

attend school. A few cities, like Boston and New York, set up separate schools for black students. However, these schools received less money than schools for white students did. In the North, African American men and women often opened their own schools to educate their children.
Some attempts to educate African Americans met with hostility. In the 1830s, Prudence Crandall, a Connecticut Quaker, began a school for African American girls. Crandall continued to teach even as rocks smashed through the window. Finally, a mob broke in one night and destroyed the school.
Despite such obstacles, some African Americans went on to attend private colleges such as Harvard, Dartmouth, and Oberlin. In 1854, Pennsylvania chartered the first college for African American men.
Reforming Education for People With Disabilities
Some reformers improved education for people with disabilities. In 1817, a Christian evangelical Thomas Gallaudet (gal uh deht) set up a school for the deaf in Hartford, Connecticut.
Samuel Gridley Howe founded the first American school for the blind in 1832. Howe was active in many reform movements spurred by the Second Great Awakening, working for improvements in public schools, prisons, and treatment of the disabled. Howe used a system of raised letters to enable students to read with their fingers. One of Howe’s pupils, Laura Bridgman, was the first deaf and blind student to receive a formal education.

Early Opposition to Slavery
Early Reforms in the North Religious beliefs led some Americans to oppose slavery. Since colonial times, Quakers had taught that it was a sin for one human being to own another. All people, they said, were equal in the sight of God. Later, during the Second Great Awakening, ministers such as Charles Grandison Finney called on Christians to join a crusade to stamp out slavery. A movement to abolish slavery developed in response to religious teachings in England in the late 1700s.
In the North, slavery was not important to the economy As growing numbers of northerners opposed it, slavery gradually came to an end in the North. By 1804, all the states from Pennsylvania through New England had ended slavery or promised to free their enslaved African Americans over time. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 had banned slavery in the Northwest Territories, which became the Midwestern states north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River. Efforts to end slavery had little effect in the South. There were only 50,000 enslaved African Americans in the North in 1800, compared with nearly one million in the South.
At the same time as northern leaders were ending slavery in their states, the South was growing ever more dependent on slavery. As you have learned, plantation agriculture was growing rapidly in the South

I in the early 1800s. As a result, there was little support I in the South for ending slavery.
The Colonization Movement The American Colonization Society proposed to end slavery by
; setting up an independent colony in Africa for Africans and African Americans who had gained freedom from slavery. In 1822, President Monroe helped the society found a colony in western Africa. This colony gained control over a territory that later became the nation of Liberia.
Some African Americans favored colonization, believing that they would never have equal rights in the United States. Most, however, opposed the movement. Nearly all, enslaved or free, had been born in the United States. They wanted to stay in their homeland. In the end, only a few thousand African Americans settled in Liberia.
BRECALL
Why did the colonization movement fail? Abolitionism Gains Momentum
A growing number of reformers, known as abolitionists, wanted to end slavery completely in the United States. Some abolitionists favored a gradual end to slavery. They expected slavery to die out if it was kept out of the western territories. Other abolitionists demanded that slavery end everywhere, at once. Almost all abolitionists were northerners. The abolitionist movement gradually gained strength from the 1820s through the 1840s. It grew more rapidly during the 1850s.
African American Abolitionists Free African Americans played a key role in the abolitionist movement. Some tried to end slavery through lawsuits and petitions. In the 1820s, Samuel Cornish and John Russwurm set up an abolitionist newspaper, Freedom’s Journal. They hoped to turn public opinion against slavery by printing stories about the brutal treatment of enslaved African Americans.
Other African American abolitionists called for stronger measures. In An Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World, David Walker encouraged enslaved African Americans to free themselves by any means necessary. Walker’s friend Maria Stewart also spoke out against slavery. Stewart was the first American woman to make public political speeches.

Frederick Douglass. Douglass was born into slavery in Maryland. As a child, he defied the slave codes by learning to read.
Douglass escaped in 1838 and made his way to New England. One day at an antislavery meeting, he felt a powerful urge to speak. Rising to his feet, he talked about the sorrows of slavery and the meaning of freedom. The audience was moved to tears. Soon, Douglass was lecturing across the United States and Britain. In 1847, he began publishing an antislavery newspaper, the North Star.
William Lloyd Garrison Speaks Out The most outspoken white abolitionist was a fiery young man named William Lloyd Garrison. To Garrison, slavery was an evil to be ended immediately. In 1831, Garrison launched The Liberator, the most influential antislavery newspaper. On the first page of the first issue, Garrison revealed his'commitment:
I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. ... I am in earnest. ... I will not excuse—I will not retreat a single inch—and I WILL BE HEARD.
—-William Lloyd Garrison, The Liberator, January 1831
A year later, Garrison helped to found the New England AntiSlavery Society. Members included Theodore Weld, a young minister and follower of Charles Grandison Finney. Weld brought the energy of a religious revival to antislavery meetings.
The Grimke Sisters Contribute to Reform
Angelina and Sarah Grimke were the daughters of a South Carolina slaveholder. Hating slavery, they moved to Philadelphia to work for abolition. Their lectures drew large crowds.
Some people, including other abolitionists, objected to women speaking out in public. “Whatsoever it is morally right for a man to do,” replied Sarah Grimke, “it is morally right for a woman to do.” As you will see, this belief helped spark a crusade for women’s rights.
Civil Disobedience and the Underground Railroad Some abolitionists formed the Underground Railroad. It was not a real railroad, but a network of black and white abolitionists who secretly helped enslaved African Americans escape to freedom in the North or Canada.
“Conductors” guided runaways to “stations" where they could spend the night. Some stations were homes of abolitionists. Others were churches or even caves. Conductors sometimes hid runaways under loads of hay in wagons with false bottoms. It was illegal to

help enslaved African Americans to escape, but these conductors felt strongly about disobeying laws they considered unjust. Such acts of civil disobedience ted thousands of enslaved people to freedom.
One daring conductor, Harriet Tubman, had escaped slavery herself. She felt deeply committed to freeing others from slavery. Risking her freedom and her life, Tubman returned to the South 19 times. She led more than 300 enslaved African Americans, including her parents, to freedom. Those who admired Tubman’s civil disobedience called her the “Black Moses" after the biblical leader who led the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt. Slave owners offered a $40,000 reward for her capture.
A
Novel Promotes Abolitionism In 1852, a writer named Harriet Beecher Stowe published Uncle Tom's Cabin, a novel describing the suffering of enslaved African Americans. The novel’s characters were often unrealistic and stereotyped, or based on inaccurate assumptions and beliefs about supposed characteristics of African Amerrcans. However, the novel sold widely and convrnced many northerners during the 1850s that slavery was evil and should be outlawed.
As abolitionism spread during the 1850s, it had a powerful impact on the United States. It increased tensions between the North and the South and helped set the stage for the Civil War.

Abolitionism Faces
Opposition
By the mid-1800s, slavery existed only in the South. Still, abolitionists like Douglass and Garrison made enemies in the North as well.
Northerners Against Abolition As you have learned, abolitionists were one interest group in the controversy over slavery. Their view was that slavery had to end.
However, northern mill owners, bankers, and Merchants depended on cotton from the South. Some saw attacks on slavery as a threat to their livelihood. Some northern workers also opposed abolition. They feared that African Americans might come north and W their jobs by working for low pay.
These interest groups in the North took the view that slavery should be left up to individual states. Because few southerners opposed slavery, their view was that slavery should be allowed to continue.

accused abolitionists of preaching violence. Many southerners blamed Nat Turner’s rebellion on William Lloyd Garrison, who had founded The Liberator only a few months earlier. David Walker’s call for a slave revolt seemed to confirm the worst fears of southerners.
Slave owners responded to the abolitionist crusade by defending slavery even more. If enslaved African Americans were treated well, wrote one slave owner, they would “love their master and serve him . . faithfully.” Others argued that enslaved African Americans were better off than northern workers who
labored long hours in dusty, airless factories.
Even some southerners who owned no enslaved African Americans defended slavery. To them, slavery was essential to the southern economy. Many southerners believed northern support for the antislavery movement was stronger than it really was. They began to fear that northerners wanted to destroy their way of life.

Early Calls for Women’s Rights
Many women, such as Angelina and Sarah Grimke, had joined the abolitionist movement. As these women worked to end slavery, they became aware that they lacked full social and political rights themselves. Both black and white abolitionists, men and women, joined the struggle for women’s rights.
The Contributions of Sojourner Truth One of the most effective women’s rights leaders was born into slavery in New York. Her original name was Isabella. After gaining freedom, she came to believe that God wanted her to fight slavery. Vowing to sojourn, or travel, across the land speaking the truth, she took the name Sojourner Truth.
Truth was a spellbinding speaker. Her exact words were rarely written down. However, her message spread by word of mouth. According to one witness, Truth ridiculed the idea that women were inferior to men by nature:

The Contributions of Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton Other abolitionists also turned to the cause of women’s rights. The two most influential were Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Lucretia Mott was a Quaker and the mother of five children. A quiet speaker, she won the respect of many listeners with her persuasive logic. Mott also used her organizing skills to set up petition drives across the North.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton was the daughter of a New York judge. As a child, she was an excellent student and an athlete. However, her father gave her little encouragement. Stanton later remarked that her “father would have felt a proper pride had I been a man.”
In 1840, Stanton and Mott joined a group of Americans at a World Antislavery Convention in London. However, convention officials refused to let women take an active part in the proceedings. Female delegates were even forced to sit behind a curtain, hidden from view. After returning home, Mott and Stanton took up the cause of women’s rights with new energy.

Women’s Movement Organizes Even in London, Mott and Stanton had begun thinking about holding a convention to draw attention to the problems women faced. “The men . . . had [shown] a great need for some education on that question," Stanton later recalled. The meeting finally took place in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York.
Different Views of Suffrage at the Seneca Falls Convention About 200 women and 40 men attended the Seneca Falls Convention. Stanton’s greatest contribution to the convention was the Declaration of Sentiments, which she had modeled on the Declaration of Independence. The delegates approved the declaration. It proclaimed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal.”
The women and men at Seneca Falls voted for resolutions that demanded equality for women at work, at school, and at church. Only one resolution met with any opposition at the convention. It demanded that women be allowed to vote. Even the bold reformers at Seneca Falls hesitated to take this step. In the end, the resolution narrowly passed.
Women Struggle for Justice The Seneca Falls Convention marked the start of an organized campaign for equal rights, or the women’s rights movement. This movement was one of the most important reform movements of the Reform Era. New leaders took up the struggle. Susan B. Anthony built a close working partnership with Elizabeth Cady Stanton. While Stanton usually had to stay at home with her seven children, Anthony was free to travel across the country. Anthony’s contribution to the movement was her lifelong work convincing people that women deserved equal rights. Anthony was a tireless speaker. Even when audiences heckled her and threw eggs, she always finished her speech.
Around the country, Anthony campaigned for women’s suffrage. She petitioned Congress repeatedly, and was even arrested in 1872 for trying to vote. Anthony did not live to see the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920 granting women the right to vote, but the amendment is also called the Susan B. Anthony Amendment in her honor.
In the years after 1848, women worked for change in many areas. They won additional legal rights in some states. For example, New York passed laws allowing married women to keep their own property and wages. Still, many men and women opposed the women's

Opportunities
The women at Seneca Falls believed that education was a key to equality. Elizabeth Cady Stanton said:
"The girl must be allowed to romp and play, climb, skate, and swim. Her clothing must be more like those of the boy—strong, loose-fitting garments, thick boots... She must be taught to look forward to life of self-dependence and, like the boy, prepare herself for some [profitable] trade profession."
—Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Letter, 1851
Such an idea was startling in the early 1800s. Women from poor families had little hope of learning even to read. Middle-class girls who went to school learned dancing and drawing rather than science or
mathematics. After all, people argued, women were expected to care for their families. Why did they need an education?
Opportunities for Women’s Education Possibly the greatest impact of the women’s movement in the mid-1800s was the creation of greater opportunities for women in education. Emma Willard opened a high school for girls in Troy, New York. Here, young women studied “men’s” subjects, such as mathematics and physics.
Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in Massachusetts in 1837. She did not call the school a college because many people thought it was wrong for women to attend college. In fact, however, Mount Holyoke was one of the first women’s colleges in the United States.
New Employment Opportunities for Women At
about this time, a few men’s colleges began to admit women. As their education improved, women found jobs teaching, especially in grade schools.

continues today. As in the 19th century, different groups have differing points of view.
One issue on which interest groups differ today is whether companies or the government should be required to pay women on maternity leave, or a period away from their jobs to give birth and take care of babies. Some women’s groups today, such as the National Organization for Women, believe that employers, including the government, should be required to pay women during maternity leave. They argue that women need this support. Other groups, such as the Independent Women’s Forum, argue that requiring employers to pay for maternity leave might make them less willing to hire women.

New American Art Style By the mid-1800s, American artists began to develop their own style. The first group to do so became known as the Hudson River School. Artists such as Thomas Cole and Asher B. Durand painted vivid landscapes of New York’s Hudson River region and other parts of the Northeast. African American artist Robert S. Duncanson reflected the style of the Hudson River School.
Other artists painted scenes of hard-working country people. George Caleb Bingham of Missouri created a timeless picture of frontier life along the rivers that feed the great Mississippi. George Catlin and Alfred Jacob Miller traveled to the Far West to record the daily life of Indians on the Great Plains and in the Rockies.
John James Audubon was a wildlife artist who traveled across the country painting birds and mammals. His collection of 435 life-size prints, entitled The Birds of America, portrayed every bird known in the United States at the time.
American artists in the early and mid-1800s showed that the American landscape and people were worthy subjects of art. They portrayed continuity in the American way of life. Their paintings reflected continuity in the timelessness of the country’s geography end in the patterns of farm work. They also reflected the great changes that were underway in this new era. Artists depicted the effects of westward movement and the settlement of the frontier, capturing

In the 1820s, however, a new crop of poets and fiction writers began to write about American themes. At the same time, uniquely American forms of music began to emerge. These new forms of literature and music reflected American society in the early and mid-1800s.

New American Poetry Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was the favorite poet of Americans in the mid-1800s. Longfellow based many poems on events from the past. “Paul Revere's Ride” honored the Revolutionary War hero. “The Song of Hiawatha” idealized Native American life. Other poets spoke out on social issues. John Greenleaf Whittier, a Quaker from Massachusetts, and Frances Watkins Harper, an African American woman from Maryland, reflected change in American society as abolitionism gained supporters. They used their pens to make readers aware of the evils of slavery
Walt Whitman’s greatest work was a book of poems titled Leaves of Grass. He added to this collection over a period of 27 years. Like Longfellow, Whittier, and Harper, Whitman focused on themes that are unique to American culture. Whitman had great faith in the common people. His poetry celebrated democracy. He wrote proudly of being part of a “nation of many nations”:
At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the Texan ranch, comrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners. . . . of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion.

American Writers Begin to Tell American Stories
One of the most popular American writers was Washington Irving, a New Yorker. Irving first became known for The Sketch Book, a collection of tales published in 1820. Two of his bestloved tales are “Rip VanWinkle” and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.”
The exciting novels of James Fenimore Cooper were also set in the American past. In The Deerslayer and The Last of the Mohicans, Cooper created Natty Bumppo, a heroic model of a strong, solitary frontiersman. The novels gave an idealized view of relations between whites and Native Americans on the frontier.
The stories of Cooper and Irving gave Americans a sense of the richness of their past. Their appeal went beyond the United States, however. Washington Irving was the first American writer to enjoy fame in Europe.
Later Writers In 1851, Herman Melville published Moby-Dick. The novel tells the story of Ahab, the crazed captain of a whaling ship. Ahab vows revenge on the white whale that years earlier bit off his leg. Moby-Dick had only limited success when it was first published. Today, however, critics rank it among the finest American novels.
Nathaniel Hawthorne often drew on the history of New England in his novels and short stories. In The Scarlet Letter, published in 1850, Hawthorne explored Puritan notions of sin and salvation. The novel shows how a young man is consumed by guilt when he tries to hide his wrongdoing from the world.
Edgar Allan Poe became famous for his many tales of horror. His short story “The Tell-Tale Heart” is about a murderer, driven mad by guilt, who imagines he can hear his victim’s heartbeat. Poe is also known as the "father of the detective story” for his mystery stories, such as "The Murders in the Rue Morgue.”
William Wells Brown was the first African American to earn his living as a writer. He published Clotel, a novel about slave life, in 1853. Brown also wrote a play inspired by his own experiences as a fugitive slave and a conductor on the Underground Railroad. His lectures and readings drew large audiences in Europe as well as throughout the North.
Women Writers Flourish in the 1800s Many test-selling novels of the period were written by women. Some novels told about young women who gained wealth and happiness through honesty and self-sacrifice. Others showed the hardships faced by widows and orphans.
Few of these novels are read today. However, writers tee Catherine Sedgwick and Fanny Fern earned te more than Hawthorne or Melville. Hawthorne

complained about the success of a “mob of scribbling women.”
American Music American classical music in the 1800s continued to follow European traditions. Yet as American society changed and grew and different groups of people came into contact with one another, distinctly American musical forms began to emerge. Early songs were often patriotic or religious, such as “My Country Tis of Thee,” written by Samuel Francis Smith in 1831, or “Amazing Grace,” published in 1835.
The 1800s saw the rise of a middle class interested in music that was entertaining and emotionally stirring. The songs of Stephen Foster, which drew on American themes, were especially popular. Although Foster was a northerner, many of his songs, such as “Dixie,” referred to southern traditions and were popular in the South. Western expansion, immigration, and migration mingled musical traditions together, creating new American sounds.
African American music in particular had a strong influence on the new forms that were developing. African American spirituals and work songs combined African and European musical traditions. During the 1800s, a new style of music now known as gospel music began to develop in African American religious

congregations. These styles would later combine with European and American folk traditions to shape blues, jazz, country, and rock music.
El DRAW CONCLUSIONS What do many of the works
of American literature of the early to mid-1800s have in common?
The Development of
Transcendentalism
In New England, a small but influential group of writers and thinkers emerged. They called themselves transcendentalists because they believed that the most important truths in life transcended, or went beyond, human reason. They produced a unique body of literature reflecting transcendentalist thought. Transcendentalists valued the spark of deeply felt insights more than reason. They believed that each individual should live up to the divine possibilities within. This belief influenced many transcendentalists to support social reform.
» Ralph Waldo Emerson lectures before a large audience during a meeting of the Summer School of Philosophy in Concord, Massachusetts. The successful school drew participants from across the United States and Europe.
Emerson’s Lectures Emphasize the Individual
The leading transcendentalist was Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson was the most popular essayist and lecturer of his day. Audiences flocked to hear him talk on subjects such as self-reliance and character. Emerson believed that the human spirit was reflected in nature. Civilization might provide material wealth, he said, but nature exhibited higher values that came from God.
In his essays and lectures, Emerson stressed individualism, or the importance of each individual. In its individual focus, transcendentalism is unique to American culture. Individualism and individual responsibility are central to America’s democracy. Each person, Emerson said, has an “inner light.” He urged people to use this inner light to guide their lives and improve society. “Trust thyself,” he wrote. “Every heart vibrates to that iron string.”
Henry David Thoreau and Civil Disobedience Henry David Thoreau (thuh roh), Emerson’s friend and neighbor, believed that the growth of industry and the rise of cities were ruining the nation. He urged people to live as simply and as close to nature as possible. In Walden, his best-known work, Thoreau describes spending a year alone in a cabin on Walden Pond in Massachusetts.
Like Emerson, Thoreau believed that each individual must decide what is right or wrong. “If a man does not keep pace with his companions,” he wrote, in Walden, “perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music he hears.”
Thoreau’s “different drummer” told him that slavery was wrong. He argued in favor of civil disobedience and once went to jail for refusing to pay taxes to support the U.S.-Mexican War, which he felt promoted slavery. Thoreau wrote an essay titled “Civil Disobedience” that explained why an individual may feel the need to break laws that are unjust without resorting to violence.
He argued, though, that anyone who chooses this course has to be prepared to be imprisoned or otherwise punished. This essay had a great impact on future leaders.

vj/ There were 11 free states in the North and 11 slave states in the South in 1819. The era of sectionalism, or tension between people loyal to their section, or region, lasted from the 1810s to the 1860s. During this era, each of these two regions, or sections, had different economies, political views, and ideas about slavery. These differences were the main causes of sectionalism. The effects of sectionalism included political conflicts over issues important to each section, or region.

CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why did Missouri’s application to join the Union as a slave state spark a crisis in Congress?
not to allow slavery. Some also felt that slavery should be allowed where it existed at the time, but it should not be expanded to new territories.
fei DRAW CONCLUSIONS Why did the Missouri
Compromise fail to solve the issue of slavery beyond 1848?
The Free-Soil Party
Opposes Slavery in the West
The debate over slavery led to the birth of a new political party. By 1848, many northern Democrats and Whigs opposed the spread of slavery. However, the leaders of both parties refused to take a stand. They did not want to lose any southern votes. Some also feared that the slavery issue would split the nation.
In 1848, antislavery members of both parties met in Buffalo, New York. There, they founded the Free-Soil party. The main goal of the Free-Soil party was to keep slavery out of the western territories. Only a few Free-Soilers were abolitionists who wanted to end slavery in the South.
Conflicts and
Compromises
Henry Clay’s Missouri
Compromise
Before 1819, the equal number of slave and free states helped balance the sectional divide. That year, however, Congress considered Missouri’s application to join the Union as a slave state. Immediately, a crisis erupted. Missouri’s admission would give the South a majority in the Senate. Determined not to lose power, northerners opposed letting Missouri enter as a slave state.
The argument lasted many months. Finally, Senator Henry Clay made a proposal. During the long debate, Maine had also applied for statehood. Clay suggested admitting Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state. His plan, called the Missouri Compromise, kept the number of slave and free states equal.
Under the provisions of the Missouri Compromise, Congress drew an imaginary line extending the southern border of Missouri at latitude 36°30’ N. Slavery was permitted in the part of the Louisiana

Western Expansion
Heightens Tension Over Slavery
The Missouri Compromise applied only to the Louisiana Purchase. In 1848, the Mexican War added vast western lands to the United States. Once again, the question of slavery in the territories arose.
The Wilmot Proviso Divides Congress Many northerners feared that the South would extend slavery into the West. David Wilmot, a member of Congress from Pennsylvania, called for a law to ban slavery in any territories won from Mexico. Southern leaders angrily opposed this Wilmot Proviso. They said that Congress had no right to ban slavery in the West.
The House passed the Wilmot Proviso in 1846, but the Senate defeated it. As a result, Americans continued to argue about slavery in the West even while their army fought in Mexico.
Opposing Views Around the Country As the debate heated up, people found it hard not to take sides. One of the effects of sectionalism was sharp division over the issue of expanding slavery. Abolitionists wanted slavery banned throughout the country. They insisted that slavery was morally wrong. Southern slaveholders thought that slavery should be allowed in any territory. They also demanded that enslaved African Americans who escaped to the North be returned to them. Even white southerners who did not own enslaved African Americans generally agreed with these ideas.
Between these two extreme views were more moderate positions. Some moderates argued that the Missouri Compromise line should be extended across the Mexican Cession to the Pacific. Any new state north of the line would be a free state. Any new state south of the line could allow slavery. Other moderates felt that the Missouri Compromise line should not be extended at all.
Still others supported the idea of popular sovereignty, or the right of people to create their government. Under popular sovereignty, voters in a new territory would decide for themselves whether or

8.1 Conflicts and Compromises
In the 1848 presidential campaign, Free-Soilers named former President Martin Van Buren as their candidate. Democrats chose Lewis Cass of Michigan. The Whigs selected Zachary Taylor, a hero of the Mexican War.
For the first time, slavery was an important election issue. Van Buren called for a ban on slavery in the Mexican Cession. Cass supported popular sovereignty. Taylor did not speak on the issue. However, because he was a slave owner from Louisiana, many southern voters assumed that he supported slavery.
Zachary Taylor won the election. Still, Van Buren took 10 percent of the popular vote, and 13 other Free-Soil candidates won seats in Congress. The success of the new Free-Soil party showed that slavery had become a national issue.

What was significant about the Free-Soil Party and the fact that slavery was a political issue for the first time?
California Reignites the Slavery Debate
For a time after the Missouri Compromise, both slave and free states entered the Union peacefully. However, when California requested admission to the Union as a
free state in 1850, the balance of power in the Senate was once again threatened.
Conflict and Compromise Over California In 1849 there were 15 slave states and 15 free states in the Union. If California entered the Union as a free state, the balance of power would be broken. Furthermore, it seemed quite possible that Oregon, Utah, and New Mexico might also join the Union as free states.
Many southerners feared that the South would be hopelessly outvoted in the Senate. Some even suggested that southern states might want to secede, or remove themselves, from the United States. Northern congressmen, meanwhile, argued that California should enter the Union as a free state because most of the territory lay north of the Missouri Compromise line.
It was clear that the nation faced a crisis. Many in Congress looked to Senator Henry Clay for a solution.
Conflicts Between Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun Clay had won the nickname "the Great Compromiser ” for working out the Missouri Compromise and the compromise Tariff of 1833, which resolved the Nullification Crisis. Now, decades later, the 73-year-old Clay was frail and ill. Still, he pleaded for the North and South to reach an agreement. If they failed to do so, Clay warned, the nation could break apart.
Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina had worked with Clay to pass the compromise Tariff of 1833,

but now he opposed compromise over the extension of slavery to the West. He drafted a speech expressing his opposition.
Calhoun was dying of tuberculosis and could not speak loudly enough to address the Senate. He stared defiantly at his northern foes while Senator James Mason of Virginia read his speech.
Calhoun refused to compromise. He insisted that slavery be allowed in the western territories. In addition, Calhoun demanded that fugitives, or African Americans who had fled slavery, be returned to their owners. He wanted northerners to admit that southern slaveholders had the right to reclaim their "property.”
If the North rejected the South’s demands, Calhoun told the Senate, “let the states ... agree to part in peace. If you are unwilling that we should part in peace, tell us so, and we shall know what to do.” Everyone knew what Calhoun meant. If an agreement could not be reached, the South would use force to leave the Union.
Daniel Webster Offers Compromise Daniel Webster of Massachusetts spoke next. He had opposed Clay's compromise Tariff of 1833. Now, he supported Clay's plea to save the Union. Webster stated his position clearly:
“I speak today not as a
Massachusetts man, nor as a northern man, but as an American. ... I speak today for the preservation of the Union.
. . . There can be no such thing as a peaceable secession.”
—Daniel Webster, Speech in the U.S. Senate, July 17, 1850
Webster feared that the states could not separate without starting a bloody civil war. A civil war is a war between people of the same country.
Like many northerners, Webster viewed slavery as evil. The breakup of the United States, however, he believed was worse. To save the Union, Webster was willing to compromise. He would support southern demands that northerners be forced to return fugitives from slavery.

Congress Reaches a

In 1850, as the debate raged, Calhoun died. His last words reportedly were “The South! The poor South! God knows what will become of her now!” President Taylor also died in 1850. The new President was Millard Fillmore. Unlike Taylor, he supported Clay’s compromise plan.
The Compromise of 1850 Addresses Regional Concerns Henry Clay gave more than 70 speeches in favor of a compromise. At last, however, he became too sick to continue. Stephen Douglas, of Illinois, took up the fight for him and guided Clay’s plan, the Compromise of 1850, through Congress.
The Compromise of 1850 had five main provisions. First, it allowed California to enter the Union as a free state. Second, it divided the rest of the Mexican Cession into the territories of New Mexico and Utah.
Voters in each would decide the slavery question according to popular sovereignty. Third, it ended the slave trade in Washington, D.C., the nation’s capital. Congress, however, declared that it had no power to
ban the slave trade between slave states. Fourth, it included a strict fugitive slave law. Fifth, it settled a border dispute between Texas and New Mexico.
The Fugitive Slave Act Helps the South The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required all citizens to help catch African Americans trying to escape slavery. People who let fugitives escape could be fined $1,000 and jailed. The new law also set up special courts to handle the cases of runaways. Suspects were not allowed a jury trial. Judges received $10 for sending an accused runaway to the South but only $5 for setting someone free. Lured by the extra money, some judges sent African Americans to the South whether or not they were runaways.
The Fugitive Slave Act Enrages the North The
Fugitive Slave Act enraged antislavery northerners. By forcing them to catch runaways, the law made northerners feel as if they were part of the slave system. In several northern cities, crowds tried to rescue fugitives from their captors.
Despite the compromise, tensions remained high because neither side got everything that it wanted. The new Fugitive Slave Act was especially hard for northerners to accept. Each time the act was enforced, it convinced more northerners that slavery was immoral and evil.

To counter the Fugitive Slave Act, many northern states passed personal liberty laws. These laws made it harder to recapture those accused of running away The laws brought suspects before judges, provided jury trials, and prohibited kidnapping.
Some laws also gave legal assistance. One state, Vermont, declared free any enslaved person who entered the state. Southerners were outraged by these laws and called any interference with the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional.
Effects of Conflict and Compromise The
Compromise of 1850 had the effect of holding the union together for a while longer and creating a peaceful solution to the threat of secession by the South and civil war. However, the conflict between the North and the South over the issues of slavery and its expansion remained. Many in the North and in the South were not satisfied with the compromise.
Three great Congressional leaders' actions had an effect on the conflict over slavery and the Compromise of 1850, just as they had had on an earlier compromise, the compromise Tariff of 1833 that ended the Nullification Crisis. In 1833, the actions of Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun had brought the passage of the compromise tariff, while Daniel Webster stood in opposition. In 1850, Clay, the Great Compromiser, once again arranged the passage of a compromise, but this time with the support of Webster, as Calhoun tried to block the compromise. As they had in 1833, the compromisers of 1850 helped preserve the Union. In 1850, though, the opponents of compromise threatened to tear it apart.

Nationwide Reaction Is Mixed Although Uncle Toni’s Cabin was popular in the North, southerners objected to the book. They claimed that it did not give a true picture of slave life. Indeed, Stowe had seen little of slavery firsthand.
Despite such objections, Uncle Toni’s Cabin helped to change the way northerners felt about slavery. No longer could they ignore slavery as a political problem for Congress to settle. More and more northerners now saw slavery as a moral problem facing every American. For this reason, Uncle Toni’s Cabin was one of the most important books in American history.

The Question of Slavery in Kansas and Nebraska
In January 1854, Senator Stephen Douglas introduced a bill to set up a government for the lands covering the northwestern part of the Louisiana Purchase. This territory stretched from present-day Oklahoma north to present-day Canada, and from Missouri west to the Rockies.
Douglas knew that white southerners did not want to add another free state to the Union. He proposed that this large region be divided into two territories, Kansas and Nebraska. The settlers living in each territory would then be able to decide the issue of slavery by popular sovereignty. Douglas’s bill was known as the Kansas-Nebraska Act.
The Kansas-Nebraska Act Ignites Sectionalist Disputes The
Kansas-Nebraska Act seemed fair to many people. After all, the Compromise of 1850 had applied popular sovereignty in New Mexico and Utah. Southern leaders especially supported the Kansas-Nebraska Act. They were sure that slave owners from neighboring Missouri would move with their enslaved African Americans across the border into Kansas. In time, they hoped, Kansas would become a slave state.
President Franklin Pierce, a Democrat elected in 1852, also supported the bill. With the President’s help, Douglas pushed the

Kansas-Nebraska Act through Congress. He did not realize it at the time, but he had lit a fire under a powder keg. Sectionalist arguments over slavery once again erupted, this time bringing the nation closer to civil war.
Many northerners were unhappy with the new law. The Missouri Compromise had already banned slavery in Kansas and Nebraska, they insisted. In effect, the Kansas-Nebraska Act would repeal the Missouri Compromise.
The northern reaction to the Kansas-Nebraska Act was swift and angry. Opponents of slavery called the act a “criminal betrayal of precious rights.” Slavery could now spread to areas that had been free for more than 30 years. Some northerners protested by openly challenging the Fugitive Slave Act.

Violent Clashes Over Slavery in Kansas
Kansas now became a testing ground for popular sovereignty. Stephen Douglas hoped that settlers would decide the slavery issue peacefully on election day. Instead, proslavery and antislavery forces sent settlers to Kansas to fight for control of the territory.
Most of the new arrivals were farmers from neighboring states. Their main interest in moving to Kansas was to acquire cheap land. Few of these settlers owned enslaved African Americans. At the same time, abolitionists brought in more than 1,000 settlers from New England.
Proslavery settlers moved into Kansas as well. They wanted to make sure that antislavery forces did not overrun the territory. Proslavery bands from Missouri often rode across the border. These Border Ruffians, as they were called, battled the antislavery forces in Kansas.
Rival Governments in Kansas In 1855, Kansas held elections to choose lawmakers. Hundreds of Border Ruffians crossed into Kansas and voted illegally. They helped to elect a proslavery legislature.
The new legislature quickly passed laws to support slavery. One law said that people could be put to death for helping enslaved African Americans escape. Another made speaking out against slavery a crime punishable by two years of hard labor. Antislavery settlers refused to accept these laws. They elected their own governor and legislature. With two rival governments, Kansas was in chaos. Armed gangs roamed the territory looking for trouble.

Brown rode with his four sons and two other men to the town of Pottawatomie (paht uh WAHT uh mee) Creek. In the middle of the night, they dragged five proslavery settlers from their beds and murdered them.

Violence Over Slavery Breaks Out in the Senate
Even before John Brown’s attack, the battle over Kansas had spilled into the Senate. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts was the leading abolitionist senator. In one speech, the sharp-tongued Sumner denounced the proslavery legislature of Kansas. He then viciously criticized his southern foes, singling out Andrew Butler, an elderly senator from South Carolina.
Butler was not in the Senate on the day Sumner spoke. A few days later, however, Butler’s nephew, Congressman Preston Brooks, marched into the Senate chamber. Using a heavy cane, Brooks beat Sumner until he fell down, bloody and unconscious, to the floor. Sumner did not fully recover from the beating for three years.
Many southerners felt that Sumner got what he deserved for his verbal abuse of another senator. Hundreds of people sent canes to Brooks to show their support.
To northerners, however, the brutal act was more evidence that slavery led to violence. The violence in the Senate was another warning that the nation was veering toward a civil war over slavery.

The Impact of the Dred Scott Case
With Congress in an uproar, many Americans looked to the Supreme Court to settle the slavery issue and restore peace. In 1857, the Court ruled on a case that involved an enslaved man named Dred Scott. Instead of bringing harmony, however, the Court’s decision further divided the North and the South.
Dred Scott had been enslaved for many years in Missouri. Later, he moved with his owner, who was on army surgeon, to Illinois and then to the Wisconsin Territory, where slavery was not allowed. After they returned to Missouri, Scott's owner died. The owner's wife took ownership of Scott, and eventually those rights transferred to her brother, John Sanford.

Antislavery lawyers helped Scott to file a lawsuit, a legal case brought to settle a dispute between people or groups. Scott’s lawyers argued that, because Scott had lived in a free territory, he had become a free man.
The Decision and Significance of Dred Scott v. Sandford In time, the case reached the Supreme Court as Dred Scott v. Sandford. The Court’s decision shocked and dismayed Americans who opposed slavery. First, the Court ruled that Scott could not file a lawsuit because, as an enslaved person, he was not a citizen. Also, the Court’s written decision clearly stated that slaves were considered to be property.
The Court’s ruling did not stop there. Instead, the Justices went on to make a sweeping decision about the larger issue of slavery in the territories. According to the Court, Congress did not have the power to outlaw slavery in any territory. The Court’s ruling meant that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional.
The Dred Scott v. Sandford decision had a far-reaching impact on life in the United States.

also further increased tensions between the North and South.
The Democratic Party began to divide over the issue of slavery. The decision also increased support for abolition in the North.
Reactions to Dred Scott v. Sandford White southerners rejoiced at Dred Scott v. Sandford. It meant that slavery was legal in all the territories. This was just what white southerners had been demanding for years.
African Americans responded angrily to the Dred Scott decision. In the North, many held public meetings to condemn the ruling. At one meeting in Philadelphia, a speaker hoped that the ruling would lead more whites to “join with us in our efforts to recover the long lost boon of freedom.”
White northerners were also shocked by the ruling. Many had hoped that slavery would eventually die out if it were restricted to the South. Now, however, slavery could spread throughout the West. Even northerners who disliked abolitionists felt that the ruling in Dred Scotty. Sandford was wrong. A newspaper in Cincinnati declared, “We are now one great . . . slaveholding community.”
Abolitionist Frederick Douglass also spoke out against Dred Scott v. Sandford: “This infamous decision,” he declared, “maintains that slaves ... are property in the same sense that horses, sheep, and swine are property . . . that [people] of African descent are not and cannot be citizens of the United States.” He told his listeners:

The Republican Party Challenges Other Parties
By the mid-1850s, people who opposed slavery in the territories sought a new political voice. Neither Whigs nor Democrats, they argued, would take a strong stand against slavery. We have submitted to slavery long enough,” an Ohio Democrat declared.
A group of Free-Soilers, northern Democrats, and antislavery Whigs gathered in Michigan in 1854. There they formed the Republican party. Its main goal was to keep slavery out of the western territories. Some Republicans were abolitionists. They hoped to end slavery in the South as well. Most Republicans, however, wanted only to stop the spread of slavery.
Growth of the Republican Party The new party grew quickly By 1856, it was ready to challenge the older parties for power. Republicans selected John C. Fremont to run for President.
Fremont was a frontiersman who had fought for California’s independence. He had little political experience, but he opposed the spread of slavery.
Fremont’s main opponent was Democrat James Buchanan of Pennsylvania. Many Democrats saw Buchanan as a “northern man with southern principles.” They hoped that he would attract voters in both the North and the South. Former President Millard Fillmore also ran as the candidate of the American, or “Know-Nothing,” party A strong supporter of the Union, Fillmore feared that a Republican victory would split the nation apart.
Buchanan won the election with support from a large majority of southerners and many northerners. Still, the Republicans made a strong showing in the election. Without the support of a single southern state, Fremont won one third of the popular vote. Southerners worried that their influence in the national government was fading.

When the race began, Lincoln was not a national figure. Still, people in Illinois knew him well and liked him. To them, he was "just folks”—someone who enjoyed picnics, wrestling contests, and all their favorite pastimes. His honesty, wit, and plain-spoken manner made him a good speaker. Lincoln strongly opposed the Dred Scott decision and used his political platform to speak against it. He voiced his opposition when he debated Stephen Douglas. He later spoke against it during his presidential campaign, rallying Republicans to oppose the Court’s decision.

Lincoln and Douglas Debate Slavery During the Senate campaign, Lincoln challenged Douglas to a series of debates. Douglas was not eager to accept, but he did. During the campaign, the two debated seven times. Slavery was the important issue.
Douglas wanted to settle the slavery question by popular sovereignty, or a popular vote in each territory. He personally disliked slavery, but stated that he did not care whether people in the territories voted “down or up” for it.
Lincoln, like nearly all whites of his day, did not believe in “perfect equality” between blacks and whites. He did, however, believe that slavery was wrong.
“There is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights [listed] in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. .
. . In the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal and
the equal of Judge Douglas, and the
equal of every living man.”
—Abraham Lincoln, Speech at Ottawa, Illinois, August 21, 1858
Since slavery was a “moral, social, and political wrong,” said Lincoln, Douglas and other Americans should not treat it as an unimportant question to be voted “down or up.” Lincoln was totally opposed to slavery in the territories. Still, he was not an abolitionist. He had no wish to interfere with slavery in the states where it already existed.
Lincoln Emerges as a Leader Week after week, both men spoke nearly every day to large crowds. Newspapers reprinted their campaign speeches. The more northerners read Lincoln’s words, the more they thought about the injustice of slavery.
In the end, Douglas won the election by a slim margin. Still, Lincoln was a winner, too. He was now known throughout the country. Two years later, the two rivals would again meet face to face—both seeking the office of President.

In the meantime, more bloodshed inflamed divisions between the North and the South. In 1859, the radical abolitionist John Brown carried his antislavery campaign from Kansas to the East. He led a group of followers, including five African Americans, to the town of Harpers Ferry, Virginia.
There, Brown planned to raid a federal arsenal, or gun warehouse. He thought that enslaved African Americans would flock to him at the arsenal. He would then give them weapons and lead them in a revolt.
The Impact of John Brown’s Raid Brown quickly gained control of the arsenal. No slave uprising took place, however. Instead, troops under the command of Robert E. Lee killed ten raiders and captured Brown.
Most people, in both the North and the South, thought that Brown's plan to lead a slave revolt was insane. After all, there were few enslaved African Americans in Harpers Ferry. Furthermore, after seizing the arsenal, Brown did nothing further to encourage a slave revolt. At his trial, however, Brown seemed perfectly sane. He sat quietly as the court found him guilty of murder and treason, or actions against one's country. Before hearing his sentence, he gave a moving defense of his actions. He showed no emotion as he was sentenced to death.

In years to come, New Englanders would sing a popular song with the chorus: “John Brown's body lies amold’ring in the grave, but his soul is marching on.” When poet Julia Ward Howe heard the song, she was inspired to write the poem “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” which became a popular Civil War song set to the same tune, a piece of music that was unique to American culture.

Abraham Lincoln and the Election of 1860
The Democrats held their convention in Charleston, South Carolina. Lack of unity proved costly for the Democratic party. Southerners wanted the party to call for slavery in all new territories. However, northern Democrats refused to do so. In the end, the party split in two. Northern Democrats chose Stephen Douglas to run for President. Southern Democrats picked John Breckinridge of Kentucky.
Some Americans tried to heal the split between the North and the South by forming a new party. The Constitutional Union party chose John Bell of Tennessee to run for President.
Bell was a moderate who wanted to keep the Union together. He jot support only in a few southern states that were still seeking a compromise.
Douglas was sure that Lincoln would win. However, he believed that Democrats “must try to save the Union.” He urged southerners to stay with the Union, no matter who was elected.
When the votes were counted, Lincoln had carried the North and won the election. He was able to take advantage of divisions in the Democratic party. Also, southern votes did not affect the outcome

at all. Lincoln’s name was not even on the ballot in 10 southern states. Northerners outnumbered southerners and outvoted them. The stage for civil war had been set.
B GENERATE EXPLANATIONS
How did the split in the Democratic Party in the 1860 election reflect the split in the country? The Nation Moves Toward Civil War
Lincoln’s election brought a strong reaction in the South. A South Carolina woman described how the news was received:
“The excitement was very great. Everybody was talking at the same time. One . . . more moved than the others, stood up saying . . . ‘No more vain regrets—sad forebodings are useless. The stake is life or death.’”
—Mary Boykin Chesnut, A Diary From Dixie, 1860
» A crowd in South Carolina gathered to learn that Lincoln had been elected President. Infer How was this crowd likely to have reacted to Lincoln's victory with only northern votes?
To many southerners, Lincoln’s election meant that the South no longer had a voice in national government. They believed that the President and Congress were now set against their interests especially slavery. Even before the election, South Carolina’s governor had written to other southern governors. If Lincoln won, he wrote, it would be their duty to leave the Union. This sentiment revealed the strong currents of sectionalism running through the country. Many in the South felt stronger ties to their region than to the nation.
The Nation Splits Along Sectional Lines Senator John Crittenden of Kentucky made a last effort to save the Union. In December 1860, he introduced a bill to extend the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific. Crittenden also proposed an amendment to the Constitution that was unamendable, one that could not be changed. Such an amendment would guarantee forever the right to hold enslaved African Americans in states south of the compromise line.
The compromise bill received little support. Slavery in the West was no longer the issue. Many southerners believed that the North had put an abolitionist in the White House. They felt that secession was their only choice. Most Republicans also were unwilling to surrender what they had won in the national election.
On December 20, 1860, South Carolina became the first state to secede. By late February 1861, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas had also seceded.
At a convention in Montgomery, Alabama, the seven states formed a new nation, the Confederate States of America. Jefferson Davis of Mississippi became the first president of the Confederacy.
Causes Leading to War Now a new issue emerged: whether southern states were allowed to secede under the Constitution. Most southerners believed that they had every right to secede. After all, the Declaration of Independence said that “it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish” a government that denies the rights of its citizens. Lincoln, they believed, would deny white southerners the right to own African Americans as slaves.
For many southerners, secession was an issue of states’ rights and sovereignty, or independent control of an area. Many in the southern states believed that states had the sovereign right to secede. According to this view, states had the authority to make decisions without interference from the federal government, and the Constitution created a Union made up of states that could decide to leave the Union at any point. Those states also had the sovereign right to join together to form a new government, such as the Confederacy.
Sectionalism and Civil War 392	8.3 Division and the Outbreak of War
Lincoln disagreed. He maintained that the Constitution allowed for shared powers between national and state governments, but did not give states sovereignty that would allow them to secede. The causes of the looming Civil War thus included sectionalism, disagreement over the extension of slavery, claims of states rights, and disagreement over the constitutionality of those claims.
COMPARE AND CONTRAST
the views of southerners and President Lincoln on the issues of state sovereignty and the right to secede from the Union.
War Breaks Out
When Lincoln took the oath of office on March 4, 1861, he faced a dangerous situation. Seven southern states had seceded from the United States and had joined together to form the Confederacy.
Lincoln’s First Inaugural Address When he took office, Lincoln delivered an inaugural address. In his inaugural address, Lincoln warned that “no state . . . can lawfully get out of the Union." Still, he pledged that there would be no war unless the South started it:
“In YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE, is the momentous issue of civil war. . .
. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.”
Abiaham Lincoln, Lust. Inaugural .Adcliess
Lincoln’s First Inaugural Address expressed ideas about union, liberty, equality, and government. Regarding union, Lincoln emphasized that the Constitution set limits on the actions of states, and that there was no provision in the Constitution for secession. That is, the Constitution required that the Union be preserved. On liberty, again, Lincoln emphasized that the states’ liberty was constrained by their acceptance of the Constitution and did not include a right to secede.
Lincoln also addressed another aspect of liberty. He stated his willingness to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, but only if the liberty of free African Americans from kidnapping and enslavement could be ensured. Regarding equality, Lincoln assured Americans that he Would provide government services and enforce federal

law equally in all states, whether they were slave or free states.
Finally, on government, Lincoln stated that government required acquiescence, or the willingness to accept laws whether or not a person agreed with those laws. The unwillingness of the South to accept his legal election under the Constitution, he implied, was a threat to government.
The Inaugural Address of Jefferson Davis By
the time Lincoln gave his address, the Confederate States of America had already sworn in Jefferson Davis as President. Davis had a role similar to that of the American President, being chief executive of the Confederate government. In his inaugural address, he said the Confederacy would adopt the same Constitution as the United States for its government
However, Davis’s inaugural speech was very different from Lincoln’s. Whereas Lincoln pledged to keep the Union together, Davis explained why the South had decided to secede from the Union. Davis said secession was based on “the desire to preserve our own rights and promote our own welfare.”
He also said, "It is joyous, in the midst of perilous times, to look around upon a people united in heart,
Sectionalism and Civil War 393	8.3 Division and the Outbreak of War
where one purpose of high resolve animates and actuates the whole—where the sacrifices to be made are not weighed in the balance against honor and right and liberty and equality.” Lincoln, in contrast, described secession as “the essence of anarchy.” He believed secession countered the principles of liberty and equality on which the nation was founded and its government was based. For Davis, liberty and equality existed only between white men. In a later speech, Lincoln would extend the idea of equality to all Americans.
Davis emphasized that government exists only with the consent of the governed. Since southerners could no longer consent to a government they considered opposed to their interests, they had to break away and form a government to which they could consent. This was in contrast to Lincoln’s argument that government sometimes requires citizens to acquiesce to, or obey, laws with which they disagree. Davis also argued that, under the U.S. Constitution, states had the right to reclaim powers that they had given to the federal government by seceding. Lincoln took the opposite view, that states had no such right.
1861—Lincoln Faces War Lincoln said in his inaugural address that he did not want war, but Jefferson Davis had already ordered Confederate forces

to begin seizing federal forts in the South. Lincoln faced a difficult decision. Should he let the Confederates take over federal property? If he did, he would seem to be admitting that states had the right to leave the Union. On the other hand, if he sent troops to hold the forts, he might start a civil war. He might also lose the support of the eight slave states that had not seceded from the Union.
In April, the Confederacy forced Lincoln to make up his mind. By then, Confederate troops controlled nearly all forts, post offices, and other federal buildings in the South. The Union held only three forts off the Florida coast and Fort Sumter in South Carolina. Fort Sumter was important to the Confederacy because it guarded Charleston Harbor.
The Attack on Fort Sumter President Lincoln learned that food supplies at Fort Sumter were running low. He notified the governor of South Carolina that he was going to ship food to the fort. Lincoln promised not to send troops or weapons.
The Confederates, however, felt that they could not leave the fort in Union hands. On April 11, 1861, they demanded that Fort Sumter surrender. Major Robert Anderson, the Union commander, refused to give in until he had run out of food or was ordered to surrender by the United States government. Confederate guns then opened fire. The Union troops quickly ran out of ammunition. On April 13, Anderson surrendered the fort.
When Confederate troops shelled Fort Sumter, people in Charleston gathered on their rooftops to watch. To many, it was like a fireworks show. No one knew that the fireworks marked the start of the Civil War, which would last four terrible years, from 1861 to 1865. This deadly part of the Civil War era would have devastating effects to lives, property, and national unity.
SUMMARIZE
Lincoln’s dilemma over southern states taking control of federal property. Taking Sides
When the war began, each side was convinced that its cause was just. Southerners believed in states’ rights, so they believed that states had the right to leave the Union. In fact, they called the conflict the War for Southern Independence. White southerners wanted independence so that they could keep their traditional way of life—including the institution of slavery. They also believed the North had caused the war. Many

southerners, therefore, also called it the War of Northern Aggression.
Northerners, meanwhile, believed that they had to fight to save the Union. At the outset of the war, abolishing slavery was not an official goal of the North. In fact, many northerners, guided by feelings of racism, approved of slavery. Racism is the belief that one race is by nature superior to another.
In April 1861, eight slave states were still in the Union. As the war began, they had to make the difficult decision of which side to join.
Their decision would greatly affect the outcome of the war. These states had more than half of the South’s population and food crops. In addition, many of the South’s factories were in these states.
Four of these states—Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas—quickly joined the Confederacy. However, after some wavering between the North and South, the four border states—Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and Delaware—decided to remain in the Union. Maryland was especially critical to the Union cause since it bordered the nation’s capital at Washington, D.C.
Still, there were some citizens of the border states who supported the South. In April 1861, pro-Confederate *nobs attacked Union troops in Baltimore, Maryland. In response, President Lincoln declared martial law, or rule by the army instead of the elected government.
Many people who sided with the South were arrested. Sectionalism had led Americans to feel connected to their region, rather than to the country overall. Now they not only identified as northerners or southerners, they had also officially split into two governments with military forces.
El CHECK UNDERSTANDING Why were both the
North and South trying to attract slave states outside the Confederacy to join their cause?
Strengths and Weaknesses of the North and South
Both sides during the Civil War had strengths and weaknesses as the war began. The South had the strong advantage of fighting a defensive war. “We seek no conquest," said Confederate President Jefferson Davis. “All we ask is to be let alone.” If the North did not move its forces into the South, the Confederacy would remain a separate country.
The South’s Strengths at Home and Economic Limitations White southerners believed that they were fighting a war for independence, similar to the American Revolution. Defending their homeland and their way of life gave them a strong reason to fight. “Our
Sectionalism and Civil War 395	8.3 Division and the Outbreak of War
men must prevail in combat,” one Confederate said, “or they will lose their property, country, freedom—in short, everything.”
Confederate soldiers also enjoyed an advantage because they knew the southern countryside better. Friendly civilians often guided soldiers along obscure roads that did not appear on maps. Much of the South was wooded, too. Confederate forces used the woods for cover as they defended themselves against invading Union troops.
The South, however, had serious economic weaknesses. These weaknesses were the effects of economic differences between the North and the South. The South had few factories to produce weapons and other vital supplies. It also had few railroads to move troops and supplies. The railroads that it did have often did not connect to one another. Tracks simply ran between two points and then stopped.
The South also had political problems. The Confederate constitution favored states’ rights and limited the authority of the central government. As a result, the Confederate government often found it difficult to get things done. On one occasion, for example, the governor of Georgia insisted that only Georgian officers should command Georgian troops.
Finally, the South had a small population. Only about 9 million people lived in the Confederacy, compared with 22 million in the Union.
More than one third of the southern population were enslaved African Americans. As a result, the South did not have enough people to serve as soldiers and to support the war effort.
The North’s Military Disadvantages and Financial Strengths The North had almost four times as many free citizens as the South. Thus, it had a large source of volunteers. It also had many people to grow food and to work in factories making supplies.
The North’s biggest advantages reflected the effects of economic differences with the South. Industry was the North's greatest resource. Before the war, northern factories produced more than 90 percent of the nation’s manufactured goods. Once the war began, these factories quickly began making guns, bullets, cannons, boots, uniforms, and other supplies for the Union army. In addition, the North had more than 70 percent of the nation’s rail lines, which it used to transport both troops and supplies.
The North benefited from a strong navy and a large fleet of trading ships. With few warships and only a small merchant fleet, the South was unable to compete with the North at sea.
Despite these advantages, the North faced a difficult military challenge. To bring the South back into the Union, northern soldiers had to conquer a huge area. Instead of defending their homes, they were invading

The Leadership Roles of Lincoln and Davis
Leadership was a crucial factor in the Civil War. President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy, President Abraham Lincoln of the Union, and military leaders on both sides played key roles in determining the war’s outcome.
Jefferson Davis Leads the South Before the war, many people thought that Davis was a stronger leader than Lincoln. Davis’s experience prepared him for the position. However, he did not want it. As one observer stated:
“Mr. Davis’s military instincts still predominate, and his eager wish was to have joined the airny instead of being elected piesident.”
Davis had attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. He had served as an officer in the Mexican War. Later, he served as Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce.
Furthermore, Davis was widely respected in the South as President of the Confederacy for his honesty and courage. Davis, however, did not like to turn over to others the details of military planning. As a result, he spent much time worrying about small matters and arguing with his advisers.
The Leadership Qualities of Abraham Lincoln
At first, some northerners had doubts about Abraham Lincoln’s ability to lead as President of the United States. He did not have much experience in national politics or military matters. However, Lincoln proved to he a patient but strong leader and a fine war planner.
Day by day, Lincoln gained the respect of those around him. Many liked his sense of humor. They noted that Lincoln even accepted criticism with a smile. When Secretary of War Edwin Stanton called Lincoln a fool, Lincoln commented, “Did Stanton say I was a fool? Then I must be one, for Stanton is generally right and he always says what he means.”
» A graduate of West Point and an accomplished military officer with experience in the Mexican War, Jefferson Davis wished to serve in the Confederate Army rather than become the Confederacy’s president.
» At the start of his first term, President Lincoln gained the respect of those around him. He was admired for his leadership as well as his good nature and sense of humor.

» General Robert E. Lee of Virginia rejected Lincoln’s offer to command the Union army. The decision would prove costly for the Union, because Lee was a brilliant military commander.
The Role of Robert E. Lee, Military Leader As the
war began, army officers in the South had to decide whether to stay in the Union army and fight against their home states, or join the Confederate forces.
Robert E. Lee of Virginia faced this dilemma when Lincoln asked him to command the Union army. He explained in a letter to a friend:
“If Virginia stands by the old Union, so will I. But if she secedes . . . , then I will still follow my native State with my sword and, if need be, with my life.”

Lee, quoted in Carl Sandburg’s Abraham Lincoln
Virginia did secede and Lee refused Lincoln’s offer. Later, Lee became commander of the Confederate army. Many of the prewar United States Army’s best officers served the Confederacy. As a result, President Lincoln had trouble finding generals to match those of the South.

The Different Strategies of the North and South
Union Strategy First, the Union planned to use its navy to blockade southern ports. This would cut off the South’s supply of manufactured goods from Europe and its ability to earn money from cotton exports.
In the East, Union generals aimed to seize Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital. They thought that they might end the war quickly by capturing the Confederate government.
In the West, the Union planned to seize control of the Mississippi Hiver. This would prevent the South from using the river to supply its troops. It would also separate Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana from the rest of the Confederacy.

how the Union plan for victory was more aggressive than the southern plan.
The Beginnings of a Long War
“Forward to Richmond! Forward to Richmond!” Every day for more than a month, the influential New York Tribune blazed this war cry across its front page. At last, responding to popular pressure, President Lincoln ordered an attack.
Stonewall Jackson Makes a Stand at Bull Run On
July 21, 1861, Union troops set out from Washington, D.C., to attack the Confederate army, which was camped 30 miles southwest of the capital. Hundreds of Washingtonians, in a festive mood, rode out along with them to watch the battle. Many northerners thought the Union army would crush the Confederates.
The Union troops had not gone far when they met up with Confederate soldiers. A battle quickly followed. It took place near a small Virginia stream known as Bull Run, which was also near the town of Manassas.
At first, Union forces succeeded in breaking up Confederate battle lines. “The war is over!” yelled some soldiers from Massachusetts. But General Thomas Jackson rallied the Virginia troops on a nearby hill. “Look!” cried a Confederate officer to his men, "There is Jackson standing like a stone wall! Rally behind the Virginians!” From that day on, the general was known as “Stonewall” Jackson. Historians consider him one of the most gifted tactical commanders in the Civil War, and he led many successful military campaigns for the Confederate army.
In the end, it was the Union troops who panicked and ran. “Off they went,” reported one observer, “across fields, toward the woods, anywhere, everywhere, to escape.” For most of the soldiers, the retreat did not stop until they reached Washington, D.C.
The Battle of Bull Run (also referred to as the Battle of Manassas by the Confederates) showed both the Union and the Confederacy that their soldiers needed training. It also showed that the Confederate army could stand up to the Union, meaning the war would be long and bloody.

as the Army of the Potomac. McClellan, a superb organizer, transformed inexperienced recruits into an army of trained soldiers prepared for battle.
McClellan, however, was very cautious. He delayed leading his troops into battle. Newspapers reported "all quiet along the Potomac” so often that the phrase became a national joke. Finally, President Lincoln lost patience. “If General McClellan does not want to use the army,” the President snapped, “I would like to borrow it.”
At last, in March 1862, McClellan and most of his troops left Washington and sailed down the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay. After landing south of Richmond on the Virginia Peninsula, McClellan began inching slowly toward the Confederate capital.
Learning of the Union approach, General Robert E. Lee launched a series of counterattacks. At the same time, Lee sent General Stonewall Jackson north to threaten Washington. As a result, Lincoln was prevented from sending the rest of the Union army to help McClellan. Cautious as usual, McClellan abandoned the attack and retreated. The Peninsula Campaign, as it became known, had failed.
The Blockade and the Ironclads Early in the war, Union ships blockaded southern ports. At first, some small, fast ships slipped through the blockade. These "blockade runners” brought everything from matches to guns to the Confederacy.
In time, however, the blockade became more effective. Trade through southern ports dropped by more than 90 percent. The South desperately needed a way to break the Union blockade. One method it tried was the ironclad ship. Clad means clothed, or covered. Ironclad ships were covered with iron for protection.
Confederates took over an abandoned Union warship, the USS Merrimack. They covered it with iron plates and renamed it the Virginia. On its first day out in March 1862, the Virginia destroyed two Union ships and drove three more aground. Union cannonballs bounced harmlessly off the Virginia's metal skin.
The Union countered with its own ironclad, the Monitor The two ships clashed in a body of water called Hampton Roads near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.
Despite an exhausting battle, neither vessel seriously damaged the other, and both withdrew. Two months later, Confederates had to sink the Virginia when the Union captured Norfolk. The Union eventually built more than 50 ironclads.
Ironclad ships changed naval warfare. However, the South was never again able to mount a serious attack gainst the Union navy. The Union blockade held throughout the war.
» The Confederate ship Virginia battled the Union ship Monitor near Hampton Roads, Virginia, in 1862. This was the first engagement of ironclad warships in the Civil War.
The Battle of Antietam In September 1862, General Lee took the offensive and marched his troops north into Maryland. He believed that a southern victory on northern soil would be a great blow to northern morale.
Luck was against Lee, however. At an abandoned Confederate campsite, a Union officer found a copy of Lee’s battle plan. It was wrapped around three cigars, left behind by a careless general. General McClellan was overjoyed to have the information. “If I cannot whip ‘Bobbie Lee,’ I will be willing to go home,” he boasted.
However, McClellan was slow to act. Finally, after a few days, he attacked Lee’s main force near a creek called Antietam (an TEE tuhm) in the town of Sharpsburg, Maryland, on September 17. In the battle that followed, more than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed or wounded—in one day. September 17, 1862, remains the bloodiest day in American military history.
On the night of September 18, Lee ordered his troops to slip back into Virginia. The Confederates breathed a sigh of relief when they saw that McClellan was not pursuing them.
Neither side was a clear winner at the Battle of Antietam (also called the Battle of Sharpsburg by the Confederates). The battle was significant, however, because the North was able to claim victory, since
Sectionalism and Civil War
Lee had ordered his forces to withdraw. As a result, northern morale improved. Still, President Lincoln was keenly disappointed. General McClellan had failed to follow up his victory by pursuing the Confederates. In November, Lincoln appointed General Ambrose Burnside to replace McClellan as commander of the Army of the Potomac.
B DRAW CONCLUSIONS
What conclusions can you draw from the first battles of the Civil War?
Confederate Forces Win in the East
Two stunning victories for the Confederacy came in late 1862 and 1863. In December 1862, Union forces set out once again toward Richmond. General Robert E. Lee played a key role in both victories, part of a record of success as the Confederacy’s leading general.
Meeting General Ambrose Burnside’s Union army outside Fredericksburg, Virginia, Lee’s forces dug into the crest of a hill. There, in a strong defensive position, Confederate guns mowed down wave after wave of charging Union troops. The Battle of Fredericksburg was one of the Union’s worst defeats.
» Union troops charged the Confederates at
Fredericksburg. Confederate troops soundly defeated them and won the battle. Predict Consequences How might this defeat have affected Union strategy?
Half a year later, in May 1863, Lee, aided by Stonewall Jackson, again outmaneuvered Union forces. The Battle of Chancellorsville took place on thickly wooded ground near Chancellorsville, Virginia. Lee and Jackson defeated the Union troops in three days.
Victory came at a high price for the South, however. During the battle, nervous Confederate sentries fired at what they thought was an approaching Union soldier. The “Union soldier” was General Stonewall Jackson. Several days later, Jackson died as a result of his injuries. The Confederacy had lost one of its best generals.
ET IDENTIFY
How might the Confederates have felt after the Battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville?
Union Forces Find Success in the West
In the West, Union forces met better results. As you have read, part of the Union strategy was to seize control of the Mississippi River. General Ulysses S. Grant began moving toward that goal. In February 1862, Grant attacked and captured Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in Tennessee. These Confederate forts guarded two important tributaries of the Mississippi.
Grant now pushed south to Shiloh, a village on the Tennessee River. There, on April 6, he was surprised by Confederate forces. By the end of the day the Confederates had driven the Union troops back to the banks of the river.
Grant now showed the toughness and determination that would enable him to win many battles in the future and made him the Union’s most successful leading general. He rushed reinforcements to the battle. That night, one of Grant’s generals approached him. The officer thought Union forces should retreat.
But, seeing Grant’s stubborn face, the officer only said, “Well, Grant, we've had the devil’s own day, haven’t we?”
“Yes,” Grant replied. “Lick ’em tomorrow, though."
And they did. With the aid of the reinforcements, Grant beat back the Confederates and won the Battle of Shiloh. It was, however, one of the bloodiest encounters of the Civil War.

The Emancipation Proclamation
“If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would	'
also do that.”
—Abraham Lincoln, August 22, 1862. quoted in Call Sandhaui's
Abmn ic Lincoln
Lincoln had a reason for handling the slavery issue cautiously. As you have read, four slave states remained in the Union. The President did not want to do anything that might cause these states to shift their	,
loyalty to the Confederacy. The resources of the border states might	j
allow the South to turn the tide of the war.
By mid-1862, however, Lincoln came to believe that he could save the Union only by broadening the goals of the war. He decided to emancipate, or free, enslaved African Americans then living in Confederate territory. In the four loyal slave states, however, enslaved African Americans would not be freed. Nor would African Americans I

be freed in Confederate lands that had already been captured by the Union, such as the city of New Orleans, Tennessee, or parts of Virginia.
A
Cautious Introduction Lincoln had practical reasons for his emancipation plan. At the start of the Civil War, more than 3 million enslaved African Americans labored for the Confederacy. They helped grow the food that fed Confederate soldiers. They also worked in iron and lead mines that were vital to the South's war effort. Some served as nurses and cooks for the army. Lincoln knew that emancipation would weaken the Confederacy’s ability to carry on the war. However, Lincoln did not want to anger slave owners in the Union. Also, he knew that many northerners opposed freedom for enslaved African Americans. Lincoln hoped to introduce the idea of emancipation slowly, by limiting it to territory controlled by the Confederacy.
The President had another motive. Lincoln believed that slavery was wrong. When he felt that he could act to free enslaved African Americans without threatening the Union, he did so.
Lincoln was concerned about the timing of his announcement. The war was not going well for the Union. He did not want Americans to think he was freeing enslaved African Americans as a desperate
effort to save a losing cause. He waited for a victory to announce his plan.
On September 22, 1862, following the Union victory at Antietam, Lincoln announced a preliminary proclamation. He issued the formal Emancipation Proclamation on January 1,1863.
A
Significant Proclamation Because the rebelling states were not under Union control, no African Americans actually gained their freedom on January 1, 1863. Still, the Emancipation Proclamation changed the purpose of the war. Now, Union troops were fighting to end slavery as well as to save the Union. The opponents of slavery greeted the proclamation with joy. In Boston, African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass witnessed one of the many emotional celebrations that took place:
“The effect of this announcement was startling . . , and the scene was wild and grand. , . . My old friend Rue, a Negro preacher, . . . expressed the heartfelt emotion of the hour, when he led all voices in the anthem, ‘Sound the loud timbrel o’er Egypt’s dark sea,

In the South, Lincoln's proclamation was seen as a “fiend’s act” that destroyed valuable property. The proclamation won the sympathy of Europeans, especially workers. As a result, it became less likely that Britain or any other European country would come to the aid of the South.
B CHECK UNDERSTANDING
How did the Emancipation Proclamation change the purpose of the Civil War?
African Americans Fight Heroically for the Union
When the war began, thousands of free blacks volunteered to fight for the Union. At first, federal law forbade African Americans to serve as soldiers. When Congress repealed that law in 1862, however, both free African Americans and African Americans who had escaped from slavery enlisted in the Union army.
» Nearly half of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment died in the failed attack on Fort Wagner, South Carolina. Yet the regiment’s bravery and heroism helped earn respect for African American soldiers in the Union army.
Military Service The army assigned African American volunteers to all-black units, commanded by white officers. At first, the black troops served only as laborers. They performed noncombat duties such as building roads and guarding supplies. Black troops received only half the pay of white soldiers.
African American soldiers protested against this policy of discrimination, which denied them the same treatment as other soldiers. Gradually, conditions changed. By 1863, African American troops were fighting in major battles against the Confederates. In 1864, the United States War Department announced that all soldiers would receive equal pay. By the end of the war, about 200,000 African Americans had fought for the Union. Nearly 40,000 lost their lives.
The Story of the 54th Regiment One of the most famous African American units in the Union army
was the 54th Massachusetts Regiment. The
54th accepted African Americans from all across the North. Frederick Douglass helped recruit troops for the regiment, and two of his sons served in it.
On July 18,1863, the 54th Massachusetts Regiment led an attack on Fort Wagner near Charleston, South Carolina. Under heavy fire, troops fought their way into the fort before being forced to withdraw. In the desperate fighting, almost half the regiment was killed.
The courage and heroism of the 54th Massachusetts and other regiments helped to win respect for African American soldiers. Sergeant William Carney of the 54th Massachusetts was the first of 16 African American soldiers to win the Congressional Medal of Honor in the Civil War. Such Union heroes had “proved themselves among the bravest of the brave,” Secretary of War Edwin Stanton told Lincoln.
An Opportunity for Freedom Despite the Emancipation Proclamation, African Americans still worked in the South as slaves on plantations. However, many enslaved African Americans slowed down their work or refused to work at all. In this way, they hoped to weaken the South’s war effort. They knew that when victorious Union troops arrived in their area, they would be free.
Thousands of enslaved African Americans took direct action to free themselves. Whenever a Union army moved into a region, enslaved African Americans from all over the area would flee their former masters. They crossed the Union lines to freedom. By the end

On both sides, most soldiers were under the age of 21. War, however, quickly turned gentle boys into tough men. Soldiers drilled and marched for long hours. They slept on the ground even in rain and snow. Often their Nothing was inadequate and uncomfortable. Many soldiers had no shoes, especially in the Confederacy. In combat, boys of 18 learned to stand firm as cannon Masts shook the earth and bullets whizzed past their ears.
As the death toll rose, the age restrictions for soldiers were relaxed. The South drafted boys as young as 17 and men as old as 50.
New technology added to the horror of war. Cone-shaped bullets made rifles twice as accurate. Improved cannons hurled exploding shells several miles. The new weapons had deadly results. In most battles, one fourth or more of the soldiers were killed or wounded.
Sick and wounded soldiers faced other horrors. Medical care on the battlefield was crude. Surgeons routinely amputated injured arms and legs. At the time, doctors did not know how germs cause infection and disease. As a result, minor wounds often became infected. In addition, poor sanitary conditions in the army camps allowed disease to spread rapidly. Diseases such as pneumonia and malaria killed more men than guns or cannons did. Improper diet also caused sickness.
On both sides, prisoners of war faced horrifying conditions. At Andersonville, a prison camp in Georgia, many Union prisoners died of disease or starvation. The difficult life of soldiers led many to desert. One out of every seven Union soldiers and one out of every nine Confederate soldiers deserted.

Political Challenges in the North and South
Many northerners opposed using force to keep the South in the Union. Supporters of the war called these people Copperheads, after the poisonous snake. Other northerners supported the war but opposed the way Lincoln was conducting it.
The Draft As the war dragged on, public support dwindled. When the war began, the North offered men money to enlist. However, some men abused the system. They would sign up, collect the money, and then desert. Soon, however, there was a shortage of volunteers to serve in the Union army.
Congress passed a draft law in 1863. It required all able-bodied males between the ages of 20 and 45 to serve in the military if they were called.
Under the law, a man could avoid the draft by paying the government $300 (about as much as an unskilled worker could earn in a year) or by hiring someone to serve in his place. This angered many people, who began to see the Civil War as “a rich man’s war and a poor man’s fight.”
» The draft law of 1863 meant that if men wanted to avoid fighting in the war, they either paid the government $300 or hired others to fight in their place. Here, “bounty brokers” offer their services as potential substitutes.
The Draft Riots Opposition to the draft law led to riots in several northern cities. The law had gone into effect soon after Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. Some white northerners, especially recent immigrants in the cities, believed that they were being forced to fight to end slavery. Unlike abolitionists, many people in northern cities had little reason for wanting slavery abolished. Freed African Americans, they thought, would compete with them for jobs and drive down their wages. Essentially, they feared, the draft would force them to fight for something that was against their self-interest. The draft riots showed that urbanization could lead to conflicts resulting from differences in political beliefs. With so many people gathered in northern cities, it was possible for large-scale unrest to develop over political issues such as the draft.
The worst riot took place in New York City during July 1863. For four days, white workers attacked free blacks. Rioters also attacked rich New Yorkers who had paid to avoid serving in the army. At least 74 people were killed during the riot.
President Lincoln moved to stop the riots and other “disloyal practices.” Several times, he suspended habeas corpus (hay bee uhs KOR puhs), the right to be charged or have a hearing before being jailed. Lincoln argued that the Constitution allowed him to deny people their rights “when in the cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.” The President also said that those arrested could be tried under the stricter rules of a military court. Eventually nearly 14,000 people were arrested. However, most were never charged with a specific crime or brought to trial.
A
Draft Comes to the South President Jefferson Davis struggled to create a strong federal government for the Confederacy. Many southerners firmly believed in states’ rights. They resisted paying taxes to a central government. At one point, Georgia even threatened to secede from the Confederacy! Like the North, the South was forced to pass a draft law to fill its army. However, men who owned or supervised more than 20 slaves did not have to serve. Southern farmers who had few or no slaves resented this law.
Near the end of the war, the South no longer had enough white men to fill the ranks. Robert E. Lee urged that enslaved African Americans be allowed to serve as soldiers. Desperate, the Confederate Congress finally

IDENTIFY
How were draft problems in the South different from those in the North? War Challenges and Fuels the Northern Economy
The Civil War cost far more than any previous war. The Union had to use several strategies to raise money. In some ways, however, war helped the North’s economy.
Taxation and Inflation To pay for the war, Congress established the nation’s first income tax, or tax on people’s earnings, in 1861. A new agency, the Internal Revenue Bureau, oversaw the collection process. The Union also issued bonds worth millions of dollars. Still, taxes and bonds did not raise enough money. To get the funds it needed, the North printed more than $400
i million in paper money.
As the money supply increased, each dollar was Wth less. In response, businesses charged more for their goods. The North was experiencing inflation, a rise in prices and a decrease in the value of money. Uuring the war, prices for goods nearly doubled in the North.
Wartime Economic Advantages The war also helped the North’s economy in several ways. Since many farmers went off to fight, there was a greater need for machines to plant and harvest crops. The purchase of reapers rose to nearly 165,000 during the war. As a result, farm production actually went up during the war.
The wartime demand for clothing, shoes, guns, and other goods helped many northern industries. Some manufacturers made fortunes by profiteering. Profiteers charged excessive prices for goods that the government desperately needed for the war.
H CHECK UNDERSTANDING
How did the Civil War strengthen the North’s economy?
War Devastates the
Southern Economy
For the South, war brought economic ruin. The South had to struggle with the cost of the war, the loss of the cotton trade, and severe shortages brought on by the Union blockade.
A
Weak Wartime Economy To raise money, the Confederacy imposed an income tax and a tax-in-kind. The tax-in-kind required farmers to turn over one tenth of their crops to the government. The government took Sectionalism and Civil War 409	8.5 Emancipation and Life in Wartime
crops because it knew that southern farmers had little money.
Like the North, the South printed paper money. It printed so much that wild inflation set in. By 1865, one Confederate dollar was worth only two cents in gold. Prices were especially high in Richmond, where a barrel of flour was $275 in early 1864, potatoes were $25 a bushel, and butter was $15 a pound.
The war did serious damage to the cotton trade, the South’s main source of income. Early in the war, President Davis halted cotton shipments to Britain. He hoped to force Britain to side with the South in return for renewed shipments of cotton. The tactic backfired. Britain simply bought more cotton from Egypt and India. Davis succeeded only in cutting the South’s income.
The Union Blockade Creates Shortages The
Union blockade created severe shortages in the South. Confederate armies sometimes had to wait weeks for supplies of food and clothing. With few factories of its own, the South bought many of its weapons in Europe. However, the blockade cut off most deliveries from across the Atlantic. To acquire goods, the government began building and running factories. Private manufacturers were offered contracts and draft exemptions for their workers if they started making war goods.
For civilians, the blockade brought food shortages. The production of food became critical to the economy. Many plantations switched from growing cotton to raising grain and livestock, or animals raised for food. In some states, cotton production was limited.

Contributions of Women to the War Effort
Women of both the North and the South played vital roles during the war. As men left for the battlefields, women took jobs in industry and on farms. While men fought in the war, many women took over responsibilities of family farms and businesses. They also had to raise their families on their own.
In rare instances, some women even disguised themselves as men and enlisted in the army to fight in the war. Others served as spies and provided valuable information to military commanders. Many served in army camps, some of them choosing to accompany their husbands to war.

The Siege of Vicksburg
General Grant Captures Vicksburg In the West, Union triumph came along the Mississippi River. The Union, which had captured New Orleans and Memphis, already controlled both ends of the southern Mississippi River. Still, the Confederates held Vicksburg, Mississippi. It controlled a crucial Mississippi River crossing linking the eastern and western Confederate states. Vicksburg sat on a cliff high above the river. Its physical geography made it difficult to attack from the river.
Early in 1863, Grant’s forces tried again and again to seize Vicksburg. The Confederates held out bravely. At last, Grant devised a brilliant plan. Landing at an unguarded spot on the river and arching his troops inland, he launched a surprise attack on Jackson, Mississippi. Then, he turned west and attacked Vicksburg from the rear. On the side facing away from the river, no physical barriers protected Vicksburg.
For more than six weeks, Grant's forces laid siege to Vicksburg. A siege is a military encirclement of an enemy position and blockading or bombarding it in order to force it to surrender. Finally, on July 4, 1863, the Confederates surrendered Vicksburg.
On July 9, Union forces also captured Port Hudson, Louisiana. The entire Mississippi River was now under Union control. The Union

took advantage of physical geography by using the Mississippi River to supply its troops.

The Battle of Gettysburg
Meanwhile, in the East, after his victory at Chancellorsville, General Lee moved his army north into Pennsylvania. He hoped to take the Yankees by surprise. If he succeeded in Pennsylvania, Lee planned to swing south and capture Washington, D.C. The Union army followed the Confederates, making sure to remain between the Confederates and Washington.
On June 30,	1863, the Union Army of the
Potomac, now under command of General George C. Meade, met part of Lee’s army at the small town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Both sides quickly sent in reinforcements. The three-day Battle of Gettysburg that followed was one of the most significant events of the Civil Wai.
On the first day of battle, July 1, the Confederates drove the Union forces out of Gettysburg. The Yankees, however, took up strong positions on Cemetery Ridge, overlooking the town. Union troops fortified these positions throughout that night.
The next day, Lee ordered an attack on both ends of the Union line, much of which was positioned on high ground, making the attacks difficult. Southern troops fought hard, but the Union army was well prepared for Lee’s offensive. At the end of a day of savage fighting, Lee’s forces had suffered heavy casualties but failed to dislodge the Union army from its strong position.
General Lee’s Disastrous Decision Despite his losses, Lee decided to attack again. He wanted to "create a panic and virtually destroy the [Union] army. On July 3, he ordered General George Pickett to lead 15,000 men in a daring charge against the center of the Union line. To reach their target, Pickett’s men would have to march about 1,000 yards across sloping, open ground—all within clear view of the enemy.
This last attack led by Pickett is known as Pickett’s Charge. Prior to the charge, Confederate cannons pounded the Union position on Cemetery Ridge, but the Union lines remained intact.
» For more than six weeks, General Grant’s forces circled Vicksburg, cutting off its supplies, and used siege cannons, like the one shown here, to bomb the city until its eventual surrender.

Pickett then gave the order to charge. As the Confederates marched forward, Union guns opened fire. Row after row of soldiers fell to the ground, dead or wounded. The battle noise, one soldier recalled, was “strange and terrible, a sound that came from thousands of human throats . . . like a vast mournful roar.”
Pickett’s Charge failed. The steady barrage of bullets and shells kept all but a handful of Confederate soldiers from penetrating the Union lines. The next day, a Union officer trying to ride over the battlefield could not because "the dead and wounded lay too thick to guide a horse through them.”
As the survivors limped back, Lee rode among them. “It’s all my fault,” he admitted humbly. Lee had no choice but to retreat with his weakened army. After they were defeated at Gettysburg, the Confederates would never invade the North again.
General Meade was proud of the victory. He had protected Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. Lincoln, however, was disappointed. He felt that the Union army had once again allowed the Confederate troops to get away.
The Union victories at Vicksburg and Gettysburg marked the turning point of the Civil War. It seemed just a matter of time before the Confederacy would fall.
» Describing the sacrifices made at the Battle of Gettysburg, President Lincoln proclaimed that, if the war preserved the Union and its principles of liberty and equality, “these dead shall not have died in vain.”

However, the South was still determined to fight. The war would last another two years.
B IDENTIFY CENTRAL IDEAS
Why was the Union victory at Gettysburg significant?
The Gettysburg Address
The Battle of Gettysburg left more than 50,000 dead or wounded. On November 19, 1863, there was a ceremony to dedicate a cemetery to the memory of those soldiers who died at Gettysburg. President Lincoln attended the ceremony. He delivered a speech now known as the Gettysburg Address. The speech expressed the purpose of the Civil War and exemplified Lincoln's leadership at a time of tremendous crisis. Lincoln said that the Civil War was a test of whether or not a democratic government could survive. This claim implied that the nation's survival depended on the integrity of the Union. He also addressed the theme of equality. He reminded Americans that their nation was founded on the belief that “all men are created equal.” Lincoln told the audience:
“We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. ”
—Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg Address, November
19, 1863
Lincoln’s words, “all men are created equal,” taken from the Declaration of Independence, and his mention of "a new birth of freedom” both express his ideas about liberty and equality. Coming so soon after the Emancipation Proclamation, made earlier that same year, Lincoln’s words implied that “a new birth of freedom” for millions of African Americans had become not just one of the goals of the Civil War, but one of the nation’s ideals. Lincoln’s entire speech was only ten sentences long and took about three minutes to deliver, but it is honored as a profound statement of American ideals.

Union Forces Move
Southward
Since the beginning of the war, Lincoln had searched for a general who could lead the Union to victory. More and more, he thought of Ulysses S. Grant. After capturing Vicksburg, Grant continued to win battles in the West. In 1864, Lincoln appointed him commander of the Union forces. In this role, Grant would lead the final Union advance against the Confederacy.
Some questioned the choice, but President Lincoln felt that "Unconditional Surrender” Grant, as some called him, was the general who would end the war in the Union’s favor. Even back when Grant had been criticized for near disaster at the Battle of Shiloh, Lincoln had defended Grant: "I can’t spare this man,” Lincoln said. “He fights.”
Grant had a plan for ending the war. He wanted to destroy the South’s ability to fight. To achieve this, Grant ordered his generals to wage total war against the South.
He wanted the Union army to destroy food, equipment, and anything else they found that might he useful to the enemy. In the past, most wars had been restricted to soldiers. Total war, however, did not make any distinctions. Civilians in the South, like the Confederate army, would suffer hardship.
Grant Sends Sheridan to the Shenandoah To set
his plan in motion, Grant sent General Philip Sheridan and his cavalry into the rich farmland of Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. He instructed Sheridan:
“Leave nothing to invite the enemy to return. Destroy whatever cannot be consumed. Let the valley be left so that crows flying over it will have to carry their rations along with them.”
S.
Grant, quoted in Bruce Catton’s Grant, Takes Command
Sheridan obeyed. In the summer and fall of 1864, he marched through the valley, destroying farms and livestock.
During the campaign, Sheridan’s troops burned 2,000 barns filled with grain. There was nothing left for Lee’s troops or for southern civilians.
Sherman’s March to the Sea Grant also ordered General William Tecumseh Sherman to capture Atlanta, Georgia, and then march to the Atlantic coast. Like Sheridan, Sherman had orders to destroy everything useful to the South.
Sherman's troops captured Atlanta in September 1864. They began their campaign by turning the people
Sectionalism and Civil War 415	8.6 The War’s End
of Atlanta out of their homes and burning a large part of the city. Then, Sherman began his “march to the sea.”
As they marched through Georgia, Sherman’s troops ripped up railroad tracks, built bonfires from the ties, then heated and twisted the rails. (The now useless rails, often twisted around trees, were nicknamed “Sherman’s neckties.”) The soldiers killed livestock and tore up fields. They burned barns, homes, bridges, and factories.
Ki DESCRIBE Grant's concept of total war.
Contrasting Ideas of
Liberty and Union
Lincoln ran for reelection in 1864. At first, his defeat seemed, in his own words, “exceedingly probable.” Before the capture of Atlanta, Union chances for a final victory looked bleak. Lincoln knew that many northerners were unhappy with his handling of the war. He thought that this might cost him the election.
The Democrats nominated General George McClellan to oppose Lincoln. They adopted a resolution demanding the immediate “cessation of hostilities” against the South. Although he had commanded the

Union army, McClellan was willing to compromise with the Confederacy. If peace could be achieved, he was ready to restore slavery.
Then, in September, Sherman took Atlanta, and the North rallied around Lincoln. Sheridan’s smashing victories in the Shenandoah Valley in October further increased Lincoln’s popular support. In the election in November, the vote was close, but Lincoln remained President.
In his Second Inaugural Address, Lincoln looked forward to the coming of peace:
“With malice toward none, with charity for all . . . let us strive ... to bind up the nation’s wounds ... to do all which may achieve a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.”
—Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address
Two Inaugural Addresses Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address, along with his First Inaugural and Gettysburg Addresses, are landmark speeches in American history. Taken together, they present Lincoln’s ideas about liberty, equality, union, and government.
In his First Inaugural, Lincoln emphasized the importance of the union of the states, which he viewed as “perpetual,” or never-ending. Again, in the Gettysburg Address, he emphasized the importance of maintaining the union of the country, especially since the country was based on freedom and equality. Lincoln’s Second Inaugural highlighted slavery as a violation of equality and liberty, yet emphasized, again, the preservation of unity by urging people to “bind up the nation’s wounds.”
In contrast, Confederate President Jefferson Davis had conveyed different views in his inaugural address, given shortly after Lincoln’s inauguration. In his speech, Davis explained southerner’s reasons for withdrawing from the Union and seceding. It was “a necessity not a choice,” he said. Quoting the Declaration of Independence, Davis stated this about government:
“Our present condition . . . illustrates the American idea that governments rest upon the consent of the governed, and that it is the right of the people to alter or abolish governments whenever
Sectionalism and Civil War 416	8.6 The War’s End
they become destructive of the ends
for which they were established.”
—President Jefferson Davis. First Inaugural Address, February 18, 1861
Lincoln had insisted in his First Inaugural Address that the Constitution required union. In the Emancipation Proclamation and the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln had extended the idea of liberty to all Americans. While Lincoln’s speeches called for equality and liberty for enslaved African Americans, Davis called for the equality and liberty only of southern whites.
In his commitment to principles of liberty, equality, and the preservation of the Union and the government, and in his decisions as President during the most difficult crisis the United States had ever faced, Lincoln demonstrated remarkable leadership qualities.

Surrenders at Appomattox
Grant had begun a drive to capture Richmond in May 1864. Throughout the spring and summer, he and Lee fought a series of costly battles.
Northerners read with horror that 60,000 men were killed or wounded in a single month at the Battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, all in Virginia. Still, Grant pressed on. He knew that the Union could replace men and supplies. The South could not.
Lee dug in at Petersburg, near Richmond. Here, Grant kept Lee under siege for nine months. At last, with a fresh supply of troops, Grant took Petersburg on April 2,1865. The same day, Richmond fell.
The War Ends Lee and his army withdrew to a small Virginia town called Appomattox Court House. There, a week later, they were trapped by Union troops. Lee knew that his men would be slaughtered if he kept fighting. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered.
At Appomattox Court House, Grant offered generous terms of surrender to the defeated Confederate army.
» Richmond, Virginia, shown here, was the capital of the Confederacy. It was in Richmond that Confederate President Jefferson Davis gave his inaugural address in 1861.
Soldiers were required to turn over their rifles, but officers were allowed to keep their pistols. Soldiers who had horses could keep them. Grant knew that southerners would need the animals for spring plowing. Finally, ordered Grant, “each officer and man will be allowed to return to his home, not to be disturbed by the United States authorities.”
As the Confederates surrendered, Union soldiers began to cheer. Grant ordered them to be silent. “The war is over,” he said. “The rebels are our countrymen again.”
Honoring Those Who Served The war was over, but for hundreds and thousands of men, women, and children, it would be remembered as the most important event of their lives. The men who fought on both sides were honored for their services with ceremonies up to 75 years after the war. During the war, President Lincoln had signed into law what would become the Medal of Honor, the highest honor in the American military. Over 1,500 soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor for their heroic actions during the Civil War.
One Medal of Honor recipient was Philip Bazaar, an immigrant from Chile. He enlisted in the Navy at New Bedford, Massachusetts. Although his rank was low—"ordinary seaman”—his actions proved him a
Sectionalism and Civil War 417	8.6 The War s End
hero. He earned the Medal of Honor carrying vital messages between commanders while serving on the U.S.S. Santiago de Cuba during the assault on Fort Fisher, North Carolina, on January 15,1865:
“As one of a boat crew detailed to one of the generals on shore, O.S. Bazaar bravely entered the fort in the assault and accompanied his party in carrying dispatches at the height of the battle. He was 1 of 6 men who entered the fort in the assault from the fleet."
—Medal of Honor Citation for Philip Bazaar, June 22,
1865
Id RECALL What was significant about how General
Grant treated Confederate soldiers after they surrendered?
The Nation Begins a New Chapter
The effect of the Civil War was immense. The Civil War years, 1861-1865, were significant on many levels. More than 360,000 Union soldiers and 250,000 Confederate soldiers lost their lives. No war has ever resulted in more American deaths. In dollars, the war’s cost was about 20 billion. That was more than 11 times the entire amount spent by the federal government between 1789 and 1861.
The Civil War was a major turning point in American history. The balance of power was changed. The Democratic party lost its influence and the Republicans were in a commanding position. No longer would Americans speak of the nation as a confederation of states. Before the war, Americans referred to “these United States.” After, they began speaking of “the United States.” The idea that each state might secede, if it chose, was dead. As a result, the power of the federal government grew.
The war also put an end to slavery in the United States. For years, Americans had debated whether slavery could exist in a nation dedicated to the ideals of liberty and equality. By the war’s end, millions of African Americans had gained their freedom. Millions more Americans, both northern and southern, began to think about what it meant to be free and equal.

To be sure, a long and difficult struggle for equality lay ahead. Yet, Lincoln’s words at Gettysburg were prophetic: "We here highly resolve . . . that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom.” From out of a cruel, bitter, often heart-rending war, the United States did indeed emerge a stronger, freer nation.

Early Reconstruction
Effects of the Civil War
After four years of war, both northerners and southerners had to adjust to a changed world. The adjustment was far more difficult in the South.
Political, Economic, and Social Problems in the North Despite
their victory, northerners faced a number of economic problems. Some 800,000 returning Union soldiers needed jobs. The government was canceling its war orders, and factories were laying off workers. Still, the North’s economic disruption was only temporary. Boom times quickly returned.
The North lost more soldiers in the war than the South did. However, only a few battles had taken place on northern soil.
Northern farms and cities were hardly touched. One returning Union soldier remarked, “It seemed ... as if I had been away only a day or two, and had just taken up . . . where I had left off." However, thousands of soldiers suffered wounds from the war, many of which included missing limbs and other painful injuries.
The North faced political problems, too. There was disagreement about how to bring the South back into the Union and what to do with newly freed African Americans. Many wanted to punish southerners for what they had done, while others wanted a more moderate approach

Political, Economic, and Social Problems in the South Economic conditions in the South were far worse than in the North. Confederate soldiers had little chance of taking up where they had left off. In some areas, every house, barn, and bridge had been destroyed.
Two thirds of the South’s railroad tracks had been turned into twisted heaps of scrap. The cities of Columbia, Richmond, and Atlanta had been leveled.
The war wrecked the South’s financial system. After the war, Confederate money was worthless. People who had loaned money to the Confederacy were never repaid. Many southern banks closed, and depositors lost their savings.
The war changed southern society forever. Almost overnight, there was a new class of nearly four million people known as freedmen—men and women who had been enslaved. Under slavery, they had been forbidden to own property and to learn to read or write. What would become of them? How could the South cope with this sudden, drastic change?
These economic and social problems combined with political problems. It was unclear how the southern states would run their governments. There were not yet legal systems in place to protect African Americans, and many white southerners feared African Americans gaining political power. Also, many white politicians who had held office in the Confederacy were forbidden from politics.
Overall, the economic differences between the agrarian South and industrial North increased after the war. The northern economy picked up, while the South struggled to rebuild. Many southerners resented northerners coming in to "fix” southern problems, and the ruined economy made recovery especially hard.

difficulties faced by the South after the war.
The Causes and Effects of Reconstruction
When the Civil War ended, President Lincoln hoped to deal with the tremendous damage and turmoil the Civil War had caused. The era following the Civil War became known as Reconstruction, or the rebuilding of the South. Lincoln wanted to make it fairly easy for southerners to rejoin the Union. The sooner the nation was reunited, Lincoln believed, the faster the South would be able to rebuild.
Lincoln’s Ten Percent Plan As early as 1863, Lincoln outlined his Ten Percent Plan for Reconstruction.
» After the war, soldiers such as this Union officer returned to their homes. Despite the high loss of life, the North did not require as much rebuilding as did the South.
» Registered enemies of the Union swear their allegiance to the United States at the office of General Bowen in New Orleans.

Under this plan, a southern state could form a new government after 10 percent of its voters swore an oath of loyalty to the United States. The new government had to abolish slavery. Voters could then elect members of Congress and take part in the national government once again.
Lincoln’s plan also offered amnesty, or a government pardon, to Confederates who swore loyalty to the Union. Amnesty would not apply to the former leaders of the Confederacy, however.
Lincoln Rejects a Rival Proposal Many Republicans in Congress felt that the Ten Percent Plan was too generous toward the South. In 1864, they passed the Wade-Davis Bill, a rival plan for Reconstruction. It required a majority of white men in each southern state to swear loyalty to the Union. It also denied the right to vote or hold office to anyone who had volunteered to fight for the Confederacy. Lincoln refused to sign the Wade-Davis Bill because he felt it was too harsh.
The Freedmen’s Bureau Addresses Economic and Social Needs There were many effects of the Reconstruction era. One such effect was Congress and the President agreed on a proposal to create a new agency. One month before Lee surrendered, Congress
» Southern freedmen attended schools set up by the Freedmen’s Bureau to gain skills necessary for employment. In this engraving, African American children attend a school in South Carolina.
passed a bill creating the Freedmen’s Bureau, a government agency to help former slaves. Lincoln signed the bill.
The Freedmen’s Bureau gave food and clothing to former slaves. It also tried to find jobs for freedmen. The bureau helped poor whites as well. It provided medical care for more than one million people.
One of the bureau’s most important tasks was to set up schools for freedmen. Most of the teachers were volunteers, often women from the North. Grandparents and grandchildren sat side by side in the classroom. Charlotte Forten, an African American volunteer from Philadelphia, wrote:
“It is wonderful how a people who have been so long crushed to the earth . . . can have so great a desire for knowledge, and such a capacity for attaining it.”
—Charlotte Forten, article in the Atlantic Monthly
The Freedmen’s Bureau laid the foundation for the South’s public school system. It also created colleges for African Americans, including Howard, Morehouse, and Fisk. Many of the graduates of these schools became teachers themselves. By the 1870s, African Americans were teaching in grade schools throughout the South.
H CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why did President Lincoln want to make it easy for the South to rejoin the Union?
The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln
President Lincoln hoped to persuade Congress to accept his Reconstruction plan. However, he never got the chance.
On April 14,1865, just five days after Lee’s surrender, President Lincoln attended a play at Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C. A popular actor who supported the Confederate cause, John Wilkes Booth, crept into the President’s box and shot Lincoln in the head. Lincoln died the next morning. Booth was later caught and killed in a barn outside the city.
The nation was plunged into grief. The assassination was significant because Lincoln was the first American President to be assassinated. Also, millions who had been celebrating the war’s end now mourned Lincoln’s death. His body was transported by train for burial in his hometown, Springfield, Illinois. Millions of Americans came to pay their respects along the route.
B EXPLAIN
the meaning behind Secretary of War Edwin Stanton’s statement about Lincoln. » This present-day photo shows the box at Ford’s Theatre where John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865.
"Now he belongs to the ages,” commented Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.
Booth was part of a group of ten conspirators who had long been plotting to kill Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William Seward. None of the other assassinations took place, although Seward was attacked by one of the conspirators. Four of Booth’s co-conspirators were hanged for their crimes, including Mary Surratt, the first woman executed by the United States.
President Johnson’s Reconstruction Plan
Vice President Andrew Johnson was now President. Johnson had represented Tennessee in Congress. When his state seceded, Johnson had remained loyal to the Union.
The Impact of the Thirteenth Amendment on Life in the United States Republicans in Congress believed Johnson would support a strict Reconstruction plan. But his plan was much milder than expected. It called for a majority of voters in each southern state to pledge loyalty to the United States. Each state also had to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment, which Congress had approved in January 1865. It banned slavery throughout the nation. (As you read, the Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in areas already under Union control.)
The Thirteenth Amendment had a significant impact on life in the United States. Without slavery, the South developed new social and economic systems. Many newly freed African Americans were hired on plantations. Others moved to towns or to the North to tad work.
Politically, the amendment overturned previous state laws and Supreme Court decisions upholding slavery. Many people had argued that slavery was a state decision. The Thirteenth Amendment gave Congress the power to intervene, and later to pass additional legislation protecting civil rights.
Political Problems in Congress The southern states Quickly met Johnson's conditions. As a result, the President approved their new state governments in late ^65. Voters in the South then elected representatives to Congress. Many of those elected had held office in Ihe Confederacy. For example, Alexander Stephens, the

Republicans in Congress were outraged. The men who had led the South out of the Union were being elected to the House and Senate. Also, no southern state allowed African Americans to vote.
When the new Congress met, Republicans refused to let southern representatives take their seats. Instead, they set up a Joint Committee on Reconstruction to form a new plan for the South. The stage was set for a showdown between Congress and the President.

Reconstruction Difficulties Persist
Rights and Restrictions in the South The black codes did grant some rights. For example, African Americans could marry legally and own some kinds of property. Still, the codes were clearly meant to keep freedmen from gaining political or economic power.
Black codes forbade freedmen to vote, own guns, or serve on juries. In some states, African Americans were permitted to work only as servants or farm laborers. In others, they had to sign contracts for a year’s work. Those without contracts could be arrested and sentenced to work on a plantation.
Reconstruction Turns Radical Republicans charged that, by Placing too few restrictions on the South, Johnson’s Reconstruction Plan had encouraged southern legislatures to pass the black codes. Republicans were also outraged by reports of violence against feedmen. In 1866, white police officers in Memphis, Tennessee, attacked African American Union soldiers, who fired back at the officers. A protest against the police ended in violence, and rioting broke out. Angry whites burned homes and schools in a black section

A report by the Joint Committee on Reconstruction accused the South of trying to “preserve slavery . . . as long as possible.” When President Johnson ignored the report, members of Congress called Radical Republicans vowed to take control of Reconstruction.
H CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why were Radical Republicans outraged at President Johnson’s approach to Reconstruction?
Reforms of the Radical Reconstruction Congress
The Radicals were led by Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania in the House and Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in the Senate. Radical Republicans had two main goals. First, they wanted to break the power of wealthy planters who had long ruled the South. Second, they wanted to ensure that freedmen received the right to vote. They used legislative reforms, or changes in laws, to achieve their goals.
» African Americans such as this laborer were granted citizenship with the Fourteenth Amendment. Yet during Reconstruction, African Americans still struggled to achieve basic rights, such as the right to vote.
Legislative Reform Radicals needed the support of moderate Republicans, the largest group in Congress. Moderates and Radicals disagreed on many issues, but they shared a strong political motive. Most southerners were Democrats. With southerners barred from Congress, Republicans could control both houses.
To combat the black codes, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in April 1866. It gave citizenship to African Americans. When Johnson vetoed the bill, Congress overrode the veto.
The Impact of the Fourteenth Amendment
Republicans feared that the Supreme Court might use its power of judicial review to declare the Civil Rights Act unconstitutional. In the Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Court had ruled that African Americans were not citizens. To avoid a similar ruling, Republicans proposed the Fourteenth Amendment. It defined citizens as “all persons born or naturalized in the United States.” (The amendment did not apply to most Native Americans.) It guaranteed citizens “equal protection of the laws” and forbade states to “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” Thus, states could not legally discriminate against a citizen on unreasonable grounds, such as race.
The Fourteenth Amendment was proposed in 1866. As you will read, it was not ratified for another two years.
Under the Fourteenth Amendment, any state that denied any male citizen age 21 or older the right to vote would have its representation in Congress reduced. Republicans believed that freedmen would be able to defend their rights if they could vote.
Republicans hoped the impact of the amendment on life in the United States would be to secure basic political rights for African Americans in the South. That goal would take a century to achieve. In the 1950s, the Fourteenth Amendment became a powerful tool in the struggle for citizenship rights.

Amendment was necessary.
Political and Social
Problems During Reconstruction
President Johnson encouraged former Confederate states to reject the Fourteenth Amendment. He also decided to make the amendment an issue in the 1866 congressional elections.
The Reconstruction Era (1865-1877)	440	9.2 Radical Reconstruction
A
Republican Majority Across the North, Johnson urged voters to reject the Radicals. When a heckler yelled for Johnson to hang Jefferson Davis, Johnson shouted, “Why not hang Thad Stevens?” Many northerners criticized the President for losing his temper. In July, riots in New Orleans killed 34 African Americans who had gathered in support of a convention backing voting rights. White mobs attacked the crowd and fired into the convention. The violence convinced many northerners that stronger measures were needed. In the end, the elections were a disaster for Johnson. Republicans won majorities in both houses of Congress.
Radical Reforms Impact the South In 1867, Republicans in Congress prepared to take charge of Reconstruction. With huge majorities in both houses, Congress could easily override vetoes. The period that followed is often called Radical Reconstruction.
Congress passed the first Reconstruction Act in March 1867. It threw out the state governments that had refused to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment— all the former Confederate states except Tennessee. The Military Reconstruction Acts of 1867 divided the southern states into five military districts, each governed by a military general. Army commanders were given broad permission to enforce Reconstruction.
Military rulers in these military districts had nearly unlimited power. They sometimes conducted trials without juries in the South. Many southerners bitterly resented the imposition of military rule. They argued that the military occupation violated their rights because it was done without their consent or representation.
Congress, however, continued to impose new rules. To rejoin the Union, former Confederate states had to write new constitutions and ratify the Fourteenth Amendment. The Reconstruction Act also required that southern states allow African Americans to vote.
With the new constitutions in place, reconstructed states held elections to set up new state governments. The Fourteenth Amendment barred former Confederate officials from voting. Many other white southerners stayed away from the polls in protest. Protected by the army, freedmen proudly exercised their new right to vote. Most favored the Republican party, since it had supported their rights. As a result, Republicans gained control of all of the new southern state governments.

Political Problems and a New President
Congress passed other Reconstruction acts over Johnson’s veto. As President, Johnson had a duty to execute the new laws. However, Johnson did what he could to limit their effect. He fired several military commanders who supported Radical Reconstruction. Republicans in Congress decided to try to remove Johnson from office.
The President on Trial On February 24, 1868, the House of Representatives voted to impeach, or bring formal charges against, Johnson. According to the Constitution, the House may impeach a President for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” The President is removed from office if found guilty by two thirds of the Senate.
During Johnson’s trial, it became clear that he was not guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. Even Charles Sumner, Johnson’s bitter foe, admitted that the charges were “political in character.” Despite intense pressure, seven Republican senators refused to vote for conviction. The Constitution, they said, did not allow Congress to remove a President just because they

disagreed with him. In the end, the vote was 35 to 19— one vote shy of the two thirds needed to convict.
Grant Wins the Election of 1868 Johnson served out the few remaining months of his term. In May 1868, Republicans nominated the Union’s greatest war hero, Ulysses S. Grant, for President.
In July 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment finally passed, granting citizenship to African Americans. Former Confederate states had to ratify the amendment as if they were in the Union—even though they had not yet been readmitted. On the other hand, states that had been loyal to the Union during the war felt that the Confederate states had lost their constitutional rights by rebelling. This rule did not affect Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, or Missouri, slave states that did not secede.
By election day, most southern states had ratified the amendment and rejoined the Union. As Congress demanded, the southern states allowed African American men to vote. About 500,000 blacks voted— nearly all of them for Grant. With support from most northerners as well, he easily won the election.
The Impact of the Fifteenth Amendment In 1869, Congress proposed the Fifteenth Amendment. It forbade any state to deny any citizen the right to vote because of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”
Republicans had moral and political reasons for supporting the Fifteenth Amendment. They remembered the great sacrifices made by African American soldiers in the Civil War. They also felt it was wrong to let African Americans vote in the South but not in the North. In addition, Republicans knew that if African Americans could vote in the North, they would help Republicans win elections there.
The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870. At last, all African American men over age 21 had the right to vote.
The Fifteenth Amendment was a difficult amendment to enforce. The South soon found ways around it, as you will read. It was only in the mid-1900s that new legislation protected voting rights and the full impact of the amendment was felt.

Before the Civil War, a small group of rich planters had dominated southern politics. During Reconstruction, however, new groups tried to reshape southern politics. The state governments created during Radical Reconstruction were different from any governments the South had known before. The old leaders had lost much of their influence. Three groups stepped in to replace them.
Reconstruction and Southern Society
New Political Groups in the South
White Southern Republicans One group to emerge consisted of white southerners who supported the new Republican governments. Many were businesspeople who had opposed secession in 1860. They wanted to forget the war and get on with rebuilding the South.
Many whites in the South felt that any southerner who helped the Republicans was a traitor. They called the white southern Republicans scalawags, a word used for small, scruffy horses.
Northerners in the South Northerners who came to the South after the war were another important force. White southerners accused the new arrivals of hoping to get rich from the South’s misery. Southerners jested that these northerners were in such a hurry to move south that they had time only to fling a few clothes into cheap suitcases, or carpetbags. As a result, they became known as carpetbaggers.
In fact, northerners went south for various reasons. A few did hope to profit as the South was being rebuilt. Many more, however, were Union soldiers who had grown to love the South’s rich land. Others,
both white and black, were teachers, ministers, and reformers who sincerely wanted to help the freedmen
African Americans African Americans were the third major new group in southern politics. Before the war, they had no voice in southern government. During Reconstruction, they not only voted in large numbers but they also ran for and were elected to public office in the South. African Americans became sheriffs, mayors and legislators in the new state and local governments. Sixteen African Americans were elected to Congress between 1869 and 1880.
Two African Americans, both representing Mississippi, served in the Senate. Hiram Rhodes Revels, a clergyman and teacher, became the nation’s first black senator in 1870. He completed the unfinished term of former Confederate president Jefferson Davis. In 1874, Blanche K. Bruce became the first African American to serve a full term in the Senate.
Revels’s election had a powerful impact. It was an important victory for African American politicians. He served on the Committee on Education and Labor, where he opposed legislation that would segregate, or separate, schools for African Americans and whites. He also promoted opportunities for African American workers.
Freedmen had less political influence than many whites claimed, however. Only in South Carolina did African Americans win a majority in one house of the state legislature. No state elected a black governor.

Reform
Most white southerners who had held power before the Civil War resisted Reconstruction. These Conservatives ^sented the changes imposed by Congress and enforced by the military. They wanted the South to change as little as possible. Conservatives were willing to let African Americans vote and hold a few offices. Still, they were determined that real power would remain in the hands of whites. This tension caused social problems in the South during Reconstruction that impacted free African Americans and Conservatives.
A few wealthy planters tried to force African Americans back onto plantations. Many small farmers and laborers wanted the government to take action against freedmen, who now competed with them for land and power.
Most of these white southerners were Democrats. They declared war on anyone who cooperated with the Republicans. “This is a white man's country,” declared one southern senator, “and white men must govern it.”
The Problem of the Ku Klux Kian Some white southerners formed secret societies to help them regain power. The most dangerous was the Ku Klux Kian, or KKK. The Kian worked to keep African Americans and white Republicans out of office.
Dressed in white robes and hoods to hide their identities, Klansmen rode at night to the homes of African American voters, shouting threats and burning wooden crosses. When threats did not work, the Kian turned to violence. Kian members murdered hundreds of African Americans and their white allies.

Political Problems and Legislative Reform
Reconstruction governments tried to rebuild the South. They built public schools for both black and white children. Many states gave women the right to own property. In addition, Reconstruction governments rebuilt railroads, telegraph lines, bridges, and roads. Between 1865 and 1879, the South laid 7,000 miles of railroad track. However, political problems due to controversial government policies and political corruption impacted southerners and hindered progress.
Taxation Without Representation Rebuilding cost money. Before the war, southerners paid low taxes. Reconstruction governments raised taxes sharply. This created discontent among many southern whites. Many former Confederate officers and officials were denied voting rights during Reconstruction and thus were being taxed without representation. The tax increases also caused some landowners to lose their land.
Corruption Plagues Reconstruction Southerners were further angered by widespread corruption in the Reconstruction governments. One state legislature, for example, voted $1,000 to cover a member’s bet on a horse race. Other items billed to the state included hams, perfume, and a coffin. Corruption was not limited to the South. After the Civil War, dishonesty plagued northern governments, as well. Most southern officeholders, however, served their states honestly.
Attempts at Legislative Reform State legislative reform programs in the South met with mixed success. New state constitutions allowed all adult men to vote, removed restrictions for holding office, and made public officials elected rather than appointed. Executive branches were also given increased power to provide government services.
However, legislation to enroll voters was hindered by new voting restrictions that kept many African Americans from making use of their new voting rights. Many of the laws preventing former Confederates from

Economic Problems
During Reconstruction
In the first months after the war, freedmen left the plantations on which they had lived and worked. They found few opportunities, however.
Limited Opportunities for Freedmen Some Radical Republicans talked about giving each freedman “40 acres and a mule” as a fresh start. This idea stemmed from a field order given by General William Tecumseh Sherman in 1865. Thaddeus Stevens suggested breaking up big plantations and distributing the land. Most Americans opposed the plan, however. In the end, former slaves received—in the words of a freedman— "nothing but freedom.”
Through hard work or good luck, some freedmen were able to become landowners. Most, however, had little choice but to return to where they had lived in slavery. At the same time, some large planters found themselves with land but nobody to work it.
Economic Problems Confront the South Before the Civil War, Southern planters enjoyed prosperity because of strong demand for cotton, tobacco, and other farm products in the North and in Britain. During the war, a Union blockade had prevented the South from selling most of its products in those markets. As a result, prices for those products rose, and suppliers in Latin America, India, and other parts of the world began producing more tobacco, cotton, sugarcane, and rice. When the war ended and southern farmers returned to the market, they faced much greater competition from foreign producers, resulting in lower prices according to the laws of supply and demand.
Meanwhile, the war had destroyed many of the South’s cities and factories. Southern planters had lost their enslaved workers, who were often planters’ main investment. The South had little money to invest in industry. As a result, it remained dependent on farming st a time when farming brought less income.

tools in return for a share of the crop at harvest time. To many freedmen, sharecropping offered a measure of independence. Many hoped to own their own land one day.
In fact, this arrangement had a damaging impact on these groups. Most sharecroppers and small landowners became locked in a cycle of poverty. Each spring, they received supplies on credit. In the fall, they had to repay what they had borrowed. As you have read, southern farm products were worth less after the Civil War. If the harvest did not cover what they owed, they sank deeper into debt. Many farmers lost their land and became sharecroppers themselves.

Tilden won the popular vote. However, he had only 184 electoral votes, one short of the number needed to win. The outcome of the election hung on 20 votes from states where the election was disputed. All but one came from the three southern states still controlled by Republicans. The exception was Oregon, where a Democratic governor replaced a Republican elector with a Democratic one, even though his state had voted heavily Republican. In the three southern states, Republican election officials were accused of throwing out Democratic votes.
As inauguration day drew near, the nation still had no one to swear in as President. Congress set up a special commission to settle the crisis. The commission, made up mostly of Republicans, decided to give all the disputed electoral votes to Hayes.
Southern Democrats could have fought the decision. However, they agreed to support the commission’s decision in return for a promise by Hayes to end Reconstruction. This agreement is known as the Compromise of 1877. Once in office, Hayes removed all remaining federal troops from Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida. Reconstruction was over.
The Political Impact of Reconstruction
Reconstruction had a deep and lasting impact on southern politics. White southerners had bitter memories of Radical Republican policies and military

New Legislation Restricts African American Rights
As federal troops withdrew from southern states, Conservative Democrats tightened their grip on southern governments. These Conservatives found new ways to keep African Americans from exercising their rights. Many of these were laws that restricted the right to vote.
Voting Restrictions Limit Political Participation Over time, many southern states passed poll taxes, requiring voters to pay a fee each time they voted. As a result, poor freedmen could rarely afford to vote.

States also imposed literacy tests that required voters to read and explain a section of the Constitution. Since most freedmen had little education, such tests kept them away from the polls. Election officials also applied different standards to black and white voters. Blacks who were able to read often had to answer much more difficult questions than whites on literacy tests.
Still, many poor whites could not pass the literacy test. To increase the number of white voters, states passed grandfather clauses. These laws stated that if a voter’s father or grandfather had been eligible to vote on January 1,1867, the voter did not have to take a literacy test. No African Americans in the South could vote before 1868, so grandfather clauses ensured that white men could vote.
Conservatives Implement Jim Crow Laws After 1877, segregation, or legal separation of races, became the law of the South. Jim Crow laws, as they were known, separated blacks and whites in schools, restaurants, theaters, trains, streetcars, playgrounds, hospitals, and even cemeteries. Louisiana novelist George Washington Cable described segregation as:
“A system of oppression so rank
that nothing could make it seem
small except the fact that [African
Americans] had already been ground
under it for a century and a half.”
-Gcoige Washington Cabin, “The lb eedman’s Case in E<{uit y"
African Americans brought lawsuits to challenge segregation. In 1896, in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation was legal so long as facilities for blacks and whites were equal. In fact, facilities were rarely equal. For example, southern states spent much less on schools for blacks than for whites.
Despite such setbacks, the Constitution now recognized African Americans as citizens. Laws passed during Reconstruction—especially the Fourteenth Amendment—would become the basis of the civil rights movement almost 100 years later.

Interactive Timeline
The ‘‘New South” Moves Toward Industry
During Reconstruction, the South made some progress toward rebuilding its economy. Cotton production, long the basis of the South’s economy, slowly recovered. By 1880, planters were growing as much cotton as they had in 1860.
After Reconstruction, a new generation of southern leaders worked to expand the economy. In stirring speeches, Atlanta journalist Henry Grady described a “New South” that used its vast natural resources to build up its own industry instead of depending on the North.
Agriculture Leads to New Industries in the South
In 1880, the entire South still produced fewer finished textiles than Massachusetts. In the next decade, more and more communities started building textile mills to turn cotton into cloth.
The tobacco industry also grew. In North Carolina, James Duke used new machinery to revolutionize the manufacture of tobacco products. Duke’s American Tobacco Company eventually controlled 90 percent of the nation’s tobacco industry.

Developing the Environment to Shape New Industries The physical characteristics of the environment influenced many of the economic activities of the South. In addition to farming, abundant natural resources provided opportunities for new industries to emerge. In particular, the South tapped its mineral resources. With its large deposits of iron ore and coal, Alabama became a center of the steel industry. Oil refineries sprang up in Louisiana and Texas. Other states produced copper, granite, and marble.
By the 1890s, many northern forests had been cut down. The southern yellow pine competed with the northwestern white pine as a lumber source. Southern factories turned out cypress shingles and hardwood furniture.
Factories, farming, and mining modified the physical environment of the South. The work clearing land and making use of natural resources provided jobs and opportunities for southerners who had been struggling economically after the Civil War. Its wood, steel, and other products were used in industry around the country.
The South had developed a more balanced economy by 1900. “We find a South wide awake with business,”
wrote a visitor, “eagerly laying lines of communication, rapidly opening mines, building furnaces, foundries, and all sorts of shops.” Still, the South could not keep up with even more rapid growth in the North and the West.

Cattle Kingdom on the Plains Before this time, the Spanish, and then the Mexicans, had set up cattle ranches in the Southwest. Over the years, strays from these ranches, along with American breeds, grew into large herds of wild cattle. These wild cattle were known as longhorns. They roamed freely across the grassy plains of Texas.
After the Civil War, the demand for beef increased. People in the Towing cities in the East were eating more meat. Miners, railroad crews, farmers, and growing communities in the West added to the demand. The Texas longhorns were perfect for the commercial market. They could travel far on little water, and they required no winter feeding.
In response, Texas ranchers began rounding up herds of longhorns. They drove the animals hundreds of miles north to railroad lines in Kansas and Missouri on trips called cattle drives.
Jesse Chisholm blazed one of the most famous cattle trails. Jhisholm was half Scottish and half Cherokee. In the late 1860s, he Began hauling goods by wagon between Texas and the Kansas Pacific Railroad. His route crossed rivers at the best places and passed by weter holes. Ranchers began using the Chisholm Trail in 1867. Within five years, more than one million cattle had walked the road.

Tending Cattle in the West Ranchers employed cowhands to tend their cattle and drive herds to market. These hard workers rode alongside the huge herds in good and bad weather. They kept the cattle moving and rounded up strays. After the Civil War, veterans of the Confederate Army made up the majority of the cowhands who worked in Texas. However, it is estimated that nearly one in three cowhands was either Mexican American or African American. Some cowhands dreamed of setting aside enough money to start a herd of their own. Most, in the end, just worked to earn wages.
Spanish Influences American cowhands learned much about riding, roping, and branding from Spanish and Mexican vaqueros (vah KEHR ohs). Vaqueros were skilled riders who herded cattle on ranches in Mexico, California, and the Southwest.
The gear used by American cowhands was modeled on the tools of the vaquero. Cowhands used the leather lariat to catch cattle and horses. Lariat comes from the Spanish word for rope. Cowhands wore wide-brimmed hats like the Spanish sombrero.
Their leather leggings, called chaps, were modeled on Spanish chaparreras (chah pah REH rahs). Chaps protected a rider’s legs from the thorny plants that grow in the Southwest.
The Physical Environment Shaped a Cowhand’s Work A cattle drive was hot, dirty, tiring, and often boring work. A cowboy’s days could last for nearly 18 hours.
The work was so strenuous that cowhands usually brought a number of horses so that each day a fresh one would be available. Cowhands worked in all kinds of weather and faced many dangers, including prairie dog holes, rattlesnakes, and fierce thunderstorms. They had to prevent nervous cattle from drowning while crossing fast-flowing rivers. They had to fight raging grass fires. They also faced attacks from cattle thieves who roamed the countryside.
One of the cowhand’s worst fears on a cattle drive was a stampede. A clap of thunder or a gunshot could set thousands of longhorns off at a run. Cowhands had to avoid the crush of hoofs and horns while attempting to turn the stampeding herd in a wide circle.
Most cowhands did not work for themselves. Instead, they were hired hands for the owners of large ranches. For all their hard work, cowhands were fed, housed, and lucky to earn $1 per day. Even in the 1870s, this was low pay.

Ranching Impacts
Settlement Patterns
Before long, cattle drives began to influence the settlement of western towns. As more cattle were driven through these areas, businesses offering services to the cowhands began to form in towns. As a result, cattle drives ended in cow towns that had sprung up along the railroad lines. The Chisholm Trail, for example, ended in Abilene, Kansas. Other cow towns in Kansas were Wichita, Caldwell, and Dodge City. In cow towns, cattle were held in great pens until they could be loaded into railroad cars and shipped to markets in the East.
In Abilene and other busy cow towns, dance halls, saloons, hotels, and restaurants catered to the cowhands. Sheriffs often had a hard time keeping the peace. Some cowhands spent wild nights drinking, dancing, and gambling.
The mam street of a town was where people conducted business. Almost every town had a general store that sold groceries, tools, clothing, and all sorts of other goods. The general store also served as a social center where people could talk and exchange the latest news. As a town grew, drugstores, hardware stores, and even ice cream parlors lined its main street.
Religion also played an important role for the townspeople. Throughout the West, places of worship grew in number and membership. They served as spiritual and social centers and as symbols of progress and stability. "A church does as much to build up a town as a school, a railroad, or a fair,” noted one New Mexico newspaper.

How would you describe the settlement pattern of cow towns in the West?
The Spread of Farming
In the 1870s, ranching spread north from Texas and across the grassy Plains. Soon, cattle grazed from Kansas to present-day Montana. Ranchers had built a Cattle Kingdom in the West. They came to expect high profits. Millions of dollars poured into the West from people in the East and in foreign countries who wanted to earn money from the cattle boom. However, the boom did not last.
Conflicts Over Land Ranchers let their cattle run wild on the open range. To identify cattle, each ranch had its own brand that was burned into a cow s hide.
Sometimes, there were conflicts on the range. When sheepherders moved onto the Plains, ranchers tried to

drive them out. The ranchers complained the sheep nibbled the grass so low that the cattle could not eat it. To protect the range, which they saw as their own, ranchers sometimes attacked sheepherders and their flocks.
New Settlements Encroach on Cattle Land In
the 1870s, farmers began moving onto the range. They fenced their fields with barbed wire, which kept cattle and sheep from pushing over fences and trampling plowed fields. As more farmers bought land, the open range began to disappear. Large grants of land to the railroads also limited it. As a result, a more organized system began to develop in which ranchers bought and maintained private property. This protection of property rights further boosted settlement in the West.
Nature, however, imposed limits on the cattle boom. After a time, there just was not enough grass to feed all the cattle that lived on the plains. The need to buy feed and land pushed up the costs. Diseases such as "Texas fever” sometimes destroyed entire herds. Then, the bitterly cold winters of 1886 and 1887 killed entire herds of cattle. In the summer, severe heat and drought dried up water holes and scorched the grasslands.
Cattle owners began to buy land and fence it in. Soon, farmers and ranchers divided the open range into

a patchwork of large fenced plots. The days of the Cattle Kingdom were over.
RECALL
What effect did the arrival of growing numbers of farmers have on the open range system?
Effects of the Homestead Act
Congress passed the Homestead Act in 1862. It was the centerpiece of the government’s land policy. The law promised 160 acres of free land to anyone who was head of a household, who had not fought for the Confederacy, and who paid a small filing fee and improved the land over five years.
The Environment Impacts Western Settlement
The main effect of the Homestead Act was a stream of immigrants and easterners took up the offer of free land. Many planted their 160 acres with wheat and corn. By 1900, half a million Americans had set up farms under the Homestead Act. Under the Homestead Act the land was free, but setting up a farm required money and hard work. Many people did not have the

money to move west and start a farm. Also, only about 20 percent of the homestead land went directly to small farmers. Land-owning companies took large areas of land illegally and resold it to farmers at a high price. As a result, many settlers struggled to make ends meet.
African Americans Settle in Kansas African Americans joined the rush for land in the West. Some were able to take advantage of the Homestead Act. The largest group of black settlers moved west at the end of Reconstruction, when the freedoms African Americans had gained after the Civil War were slipping away.
In 1879, a group of African Americans moved to Kansas. They called themselves Exodusters, after Exodus, the book of the Bible that tells about the Jews escaping from slavery in Egypt. The Exodusters paid for their land rather than claim it under the Homestead Act. Between 40,000 and 70,000 African Americans had moved to Kansas by 1881, though only some of these were Exodusters.
Settlement Patterns of Anglos and Mexicanos
Easterners who moved to the Southwest found a large established Spanish-speaking population there. As you recall, the United States had gained much of the Southwest through the Mexican War. Many of its inhabitants were people of Spanish or Mexican origin who lived in the region before it became part of the United States.
Spanish-speaking southwesterners called themselves Mexicanos. White Americans who lived in the region were known as Anglos. Most Mexicanos lived in small villages, where they farmed and raised sheep. A few wealthy Mexicanos were large landowners and merchants.
As more Anglos settled in the Southwest, they acquired the best jobs and land. Often, Mexicanos found themselves working as low-paid laborers on Anglo farms. In New Mexico, in the 1880s, angry farmers known as Las Gorras Blancas, or “White Caps,” demanded fair treatment. Other Mexicanos in Arizona founded the Hispanic-American Alliance in 1894 to protect and fight for their rights.
Settlements on Oklahoma Farmland As settlers spread across the West, free land began to disappear. The last major land rush took place in Oklahoma. Several Native American nations lived there, but the government forced them to sell their land. The government then announced that farmers could claim free homesteads in Oklahoma. They could not stake their claims, however, until noon on April 22,1889.
On the appointed day, as many as 100,000 land seekers lined up at the Oklahoma border. At noon,
The Reconstruction Era (1865-1877)

a gunshot rang out. The “boomers” charged into Oklahoma, but they found that others were already there. ‘ Sooners had sneaked into Oklahoma before the official opening and had staked out much of the best land. The physical characteristics of the Oklahoma environment meant that farmers needed good land in order to succeed. Those who settled on fertile farmland had better chances than those who ended up with less fertile land.

Who worked to get around the rules of the Homestead Act in order to profit from the land, and how did they profit?
Effects of the Morrill Acts
Agriculture was becoming more of a business as farmers increasingly grew food for the market at the same time as industry was growing. To train professionals for both agriculture and industry, there was a growing call for publicly supported agricultural and mechanical colleges. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862, put forth during the Civil War by Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont, offered states a federal land grant to build schools that would teach and promote scientific farming and engineering.
States received 30,000 acres of public land per congressional representative, a policy that gave more land to more populous states. Colleges founded on this land had to teach science, classics, agriculture, mechanics, and military tactics.
In 1890, a second Morrill Act was passed to extend the benefits of land-grant funding to African American students. It required states either to admit students of all races to their land-grant colleges or to set up separate land-grant colleges for African Americans. Upholding segregation, the South created separate colleges for African American and white students. Many of these agricultural colleges grew into historically black colleges and universities serving African Americans in the South.
Both of the Morrill Acts had important effects on the country. Private colleges were expensive. The new public schools were more affordable. They made college more available to Americans and affirmed that the government would play a role in supporting higher education.
Private colleges also did not teach the practical skills that many Americans needed to find jobs. Land-Jrant colleges emphasized the training and skills needed in an agricultural and industrial society. The first land-grant college to open was the University of

Massachusetts. Large universities also formed in the West and Midwest.
B DRAW CONCLUSIONS
Why were the Morrill Acts important for the average American student? Life on the Plains
Farmers on the western plains faced many hardships. The first problem was shelter. Because wood was scarce on the Great Plains, many farmers built houses of sod—soil held together by grass roots. Rain was a serious problem for sod houses. One pioneer woman complained that her sod roof “leaked two days before a rain and for three days after.”
Sodbusting The fertile soil of the Great Plains was covered with a layer of thick sod that could crack wood or iron plows. A new sodbusting plow made of steel reached the market by 1877. It enabled sodbusters, as Plains farmers were called, to cut through the sod to the soil below.
Technology helped farmers in other ways. On the Great Plains, water often lay hundreds of feet underground. Farmers built windmills to pump the

Interactive 3-D Model
water to the surface. New reapers, threshing machines, and binders helped farmers to harvest crops.
Environmental Challenges The dry climate was a constant threat. When too little rain fell, the crops shriveled and died. Dry weather also brought the threat of fire. A grass fire traveled “as fast as a horse could run.” The summers often brought swarms of grasshoppers that ate everything in their path—crops, food, tree bark, even clothing. Pioneers dreaded the winters most. With few trees or hills to block the wind, icy gusts built huge snowdrifts. The deep snow buried farm animals and trapped families inside their homes.
Women’s Roles on the Plains Women had to be strong to survive the hardships of life on the Great Plains. Since there were few stores, women made clothing, soap, candles, and other goods by hand. They also cooked and preserved food needed for the long winter.
Women served their communities in many ways. Most schoolteachers were women. When there were no doctors nearby women treated the sick and injured.
Pioneer families usually lived miles apart. They relaxed by visiting with neighbors and gathering for church services. Picnics, dances, and weddings were eagerly awaited events.
Dependence on the Physical Environment
Homesteaders depended on the environment for their livelihood. They needed the right amounts of water, sunlight, rain, and soil for their crops. This made homesteading risky; there were many difficult harvests and lean years.
It also meant that homesteaders put a great deal of care into the land. Those who owned their farms worked hard to keep the land productive. They wanted to ensure that their property would continue to supply the resources they needed to survive.
Reliance on the land and distance from more populous eastern cities meant that homesteaders were extremely self-sufficient. They used resources from the environment to meet their needs. If something was broken, they fixed it themselves.
Economic Challenges Despite the harsh conditions, farmers began to thrive in the West. Before long, they were selling huge amounts of wheat and corn in the nation’s growing cities and even in Europe. Then, farmers faced an unexpected problem. The more they harvested, the less they earned. In 1881, a bushel of wheat sold for $1.19. By 1894, the price had plunged to 49 cents. Western farmers were hurt most by low grain prices. They had borrowed money during good times to

What effects did the isolation of western farms have on the women of the Plains?
Farming and the Economy
As early as the 1860s, farmers began to work together. They learned that they could improve their condition through economic cooperation and political action.
The National Grange Supports Cooperation In
1867, farmers formed the National Grange. Grangers wanted to boost farm profits and reduce the rates that railroads charged for shipping grain.
Grangers helped farmers set up cooperatives. In a cooperative a group of farmers pooled their money to buy seeds and tools wholesale. Wholesale means buying or selling something in large quantities at lower prices. Grangers built cooperative warehouses so that fanners could store grain cheaply while waiting for Tetter selling prices.
Leaders of the Grange urged farmers to use their vote. In 1873, western and southern Grangers pledged to vote only for candidates who supported their aims.
They elected officials who understood the farmers’ problems.
As a result, several states passed laws limiting what could be charged for grain shipment and storage. Nevertheless, crop prices continued to drop. Farmers sank deeper into debt.
The Farmers’ Alliance Spreads Another group, the Farmers’ Alliance, joined the struggle in the 1870s. Like the Grange, the Alliance set up cooperatives and warehouses. The Farmers’ Alliance spread from Texas through the South and into the Plains states. Alliance leaders also tried to join with factory workers and miners who were angry about their treatment by employers.

» Analyze Political Cartoons What does the object on which William McKinley is standing in this image suggest about his political views in the election of 1896?
The Rise of the People’s Party in the West
In 1892, farmers and labor unions joined together to form the People’s Party, also known as the Populists. At their first national convention, the Populists demanded that the government help to raise farm prices and to regulate railroad rates. They also called for an income tax, an eight-hour workday, and limits on immigration.
The key Populist party demand was “free silver.” Populists wanted all silver mined in the West to be coined into money. They said that farm prices dropped because there was not enough money in circulation. Free silver would increase the money supply and make it easier for farmers to repay their debts.
Eastern bankers and factory owners opposed this. They argued that increasing the money supply would cause inflation, or increased prices. Business people feared that inflation would wreck the economy. They favored the gold standard with which the government backs every dollar with a certain amount of gold. Since the supply of gold is limited, there would be less money in circulation. Prices would drop.
Bryan Versus McKinley The Populist candidate for President in 1892 won one million votes. The next year, a severe depression brought the Populists new support. In 1894, they elected six senators and seven representatives to Congress.
The Populists looked toward the election of 1896 with high hopes. Their program had been endorsed by one of the great orators of the age: Democrat William Jennings Bryan.
A young Democratic congressman from Nebraska, Bryan was called the “Great Commoner” because he championed the cause of common people. Like the Populists, he believed that the nation needed to increase the supply of money. At the Democratic convention in 1896, Bryan made a powerful speech against the rich and for free silver. At the end of his speech, referring to the rich, Bryan proclaimed, “You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.”
Both Democrats and Populists supported Bryan for President. However, bankers and business people feared that Bryan would ruin the economy. They supported William McKinley, the Republican candidate. McKinley and the Republican party called for keeping the dollar tied to the gold standard.
Bryan narrowly lost the election of 1896. He carried the South and the West, but McKinley won the heavily populated states of the North and East.
The Populist Movement Ends With the Election of 1896 The People’s Party broke up after 1896. One reason was that, with Bryan as a candidate, the Democrats adopted several Populist causes. Also, prosperity returned in the late 1890s. People worried less about railroad rates and the gold standard.

Native Americans had been living for centuries on the Great Plains, the vast, gently sloping region west of the Mississippi River and east of the Rocky Mountains. Many different Native American nations lived on the Great Plains. A number of them, such as the Arikaras, had lived on the Plains for hundreds of years. Others, like the Lakotas, did not move to the Plains until the early 1700s.
These Crow Indians once roamed the Yellowstone River Valley. Like other Plains Indians, the Crow resisted pioneers’ attempts to settle their ancestral lands.

Hardship for Native Americans
The Plains Indians
Farming and Hunting Plains Indians had rich and varied cultures. They were skilled artists. They also had well-organized religions and warrior societies. Each nation had its own language. People from different nations used sign language to communicate with one another.
At one time, most Plains Indians were farmers who lived in semipermanent villages. From there, they sent out hunting parties that pursued on foot herds of buffalo and other animals. Agriculture, however, was their main source of food.
The Introduction of Horses Proved Useful During the 1600s, the Plains Indians’ way of life changed as they learned about horses from neighboring tribes.
Christopher Columbus had brought horses to the Americas in the late 1400s, and the Spanish brought them to the North American mainland in the 1500s. At first, Native Americans were not allowed to own horses, but they did learn how to care for them and ride them. After the Pueblo Indians revolted against the Spaniards in 1680, the

The buffalo served as a living grocery store for Plains Indians. After acquiring horses, they followed the huge buffalo herds that had roamed their homeland for centuries. Plains Indians began to live in tepees (tee pees), or tents made by stretching buffalo skins on tall poles. The tepees could easily be carried on a travois (truh VOl)—a sled pulled by a dog or a horse.
The migration of the Plains Indians mirrored the movement of the buffalo. In winter, small groups of buffalo moved to protected valleys and forests. In summer, huge buffalo herds gathered on the Plains where the grass was plentiful. In the same way, Plains Indians spent the winter in small bands and gathered in large groups during the summers.
» Plains Indians developed a culture based on following and hunting buffalo. The introduction of the horse made this possible.
Hunting the Buffalo There were different ways to hunt buffalo. Before horses came to the Plains, a group of hunters would shout and wave colored robes at the buffalo. The hunters would gradually drive a herd of buffalo into a corral, or enclosure.
There they killed the trapped buffalo. When the hunt was over, the women and children joined the hunters in cutting up the buffalo and taking it back to camp. Once they had horses, hunters would ride the horses right into the herd and kill the buffalo with bows and arrows.
The Buffalo Sustained a Way of Life Although the Plains Indians also hunted deer and elk, they depended on the buffalo for food, clothing, and shelter. Buffalo meat, rich in protein, was a main item of the Plains Indians' diet. Women cut up and dried the meat on racks. The dried meat was called jerky.
Women also tanned buffalo hides to make sleeping robes and tepee covers. They wove buffalo fur into coarse, warm cloth. The cloth was used as an outer covering for a tepee.
Councils and Ceremonies Many Native American groups met on the Plains. They hunted together and attended special events. Summer gatherings were the time for councils. At the councils, the elders were consulted about the problems that affected an entire Plains Indian nation.
The most important religious ceremony was the Sun Dance. Hundreds of people attended the four-day ceremony to thank the Great Spirit for blessings, good hunts, and help in times of trouble. Sun Dancers also asked the Great Spirit for good fortune in the coming year.

Gender Roles in Plains Indian Society
Women and men usually had specific roles in Plains Indian society. In some tribes, women helped men with the hunting and governing. A Blackfoot woman, Running Eagle, led many hunting parties herself.
Responsibilities at Home Women oversaw life in the home. They gathered food and prepared meals for their families. The women not only made the tepees, but they were also responsible for raising and taking down tepees. Women cared for the children and, along with the men, passed along the traditions of their people.

Women also engaged in many crafts. They made the baskets and blankets. Their work often showed great artistic skill and design. In fact, a woman’s ability in crafts helped establish her rank in society.
Community Leadership The men of the Plains Indians had important responsibilities, too. They hunted to provide food and other materials they needed. They also protected the women, children, and the elders. They passed on their valuable skills and knowledge to the boys. They supervised the spiritual life of the community by leading religious ceremonies.
Another important responsibility of the men was to provide military leadership. They waged war to defend or extend territory, to gain horses and other riches, or to seek revenge. More than anything else, however, men waged war to protect their people and to prove their bravery and ability. The most successful warriors gained great respect from the members of their nation. 0 DESCRIBE the role women played in the household.
Broken Promises
Before Europeans and Americans began to settle on the Plains, the Plains Indians often fought with one another over territory or other resources. But as American settlers began to encroach on Plains Indians’ lands, their attention turned toward this new threat. Conflict on the Plains began as early as the 1840s, when settlers and miners began to cross Plains Indian hunting grounds. The settlers and miners asked for government protection from the Native Americans.
A
Treaty Quickly Forgotten The U S. government built a string of forts to protect settlers and miners. In 1851, federal government officials met with Plains Indian nations near Fort Laramie in Wyoming. The officials asked each nation to keep to a limited area. In return, they promised money, domestic animals, agricultural tools, and other goods. Officials told the Native Americans that the lands that were reserved for them would be theirs forever. Native American leaders agreed to the terms of the Fort Laramie Treaty. However, in 1858, gold was discovered at Pikes Peak in Colorado. A wave of miners rushed to land that the government had promised to the Cheyenne and Arapaho peoples. Federal officials forced Native American leaders to sign a new treaty giving up the land around Pikes Peak. Some Native Americans refused to accept the agreement. They attacked white settlers.
» In Plains Indian societies, women were responsible for child rearing and also held many other roles. In some tribes, they took part in hunting and governing.
» Native American leaders met with government officials at Fort Laramie. The treaty they signed was part of a broader federal effort to create peace between native groups and western settlers.

» Soldiers of the U.S. Cavalry attack a Cheyenne Village at Sand Creek. More than 150 Native American men, women, and children lost their lives in the massacre.
» Buffalo run as passengers and crew aboard this train shoot at them for sport. This contributed to the rapid decline of the buffalo population in the mid to late 1800s.
The Sand Creek Massacre The settlers struck back. In 1864, Colonel John Chivington led his militia against a Cheyenne village whose leaders had come to a fort asking for protection. When Chivington attacked, the Native Americans raised both a white flag of surrender and the flag of the United States. Chivington had thought the Native Americans were hostile. He either ignored or did not see the flags. He ordered his men to destroy the village and take no prisoners. In what would become the Sand Creek Massacre, the militia slaughtered more than 150 men, women, and children.
After the massacre, soldiers said they found scalps of whites in the camp, indicating that there had been some hostile Native Americans there. A congressional committee that investigated the massacre condemned Chivington’s actions, but Chivington had already left the army. As a result of the massacre, Plains Indians went to war. They attacked white settlers and U.S. troops. U.S. troops responded by attacking Indians.
Changing Traditional Ways of Life In 1867, federal officials established a peace commission to end the wars on the Plains so that settlers would be safe. The commission urged Native Americans to settle down and live as white farmers did. It also urged them to send their children to white schools to learn "American'' ways.
Agreeing to Resettle In 1867, the Kiowas, Comanches, and other southern Plains Indians signed a new treaty with the government. They promised to move to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. The soil there was poor. Also, most Plains Indians were hunters, not farmers. The Native Americans did not like the treaty but knew they had no choice.
The Lakotas and Arapahos of the northern Plains also signed a second Fort Laramie Treaty in 1868. They agreed to live on reservations in present-day South Dakota. A reservation is a limited area set aside for Native Americans.
Buffalo Populations Fall Dramatically The Plains Indians suffered from lost battles and broken treaties. Even worse for them, however, was the destruction of the buffalo.
The decline of the buffalo began before the arrival of white settlers. Herds of buffalo lived in areas west of the Mississippi and east of the Rockies. However, with disease, drought, and destruction of the areas in which they lived, the herds were slowly growing smaller. As the market demand for buffalo robes increased during the 1830s and 1840s, professional buffalo hunters killed more buffalo. In addition, buffalo hunting became a pleasure sport when railroads cut through the areas

in which buffalo lived. Native Americans themselves learned to hunt more efficiently. Some Plains Indian tribes, such as the Pawnees, continued to hunt buffalo even though they recognized that the number of buffalo was decreasing.
The buffalo hunt was a part of their culture that they did not want to give up. As the buffalo disappeared, so did the Plains Indians’ way of life.
CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why were the terms of the Fort Laramie treaty broken? Conflict in the West
Continues
Settlers and miners continued to move into the West. They wanted more and more land for themselves. Even on reservations, Native Americans were not left in peace.
The Battle of Little Bighorn In 1874, prospectors found gold in the Black Hills region of the Lakota, or Sioux, reservation. Thousands of miners rushed to the area.
In June 1876, Colonel George A. Custer led a column of soldiers into the Little Bighorn Valley. They were sent by the federal government to protect the miners, even though miners were violating the 1868 U.S. treaty with the Lakotas. A group of 600 men under Custer’s command prepared to attack a Lakota hunting party, although the!868 treaty gave the Lakota the right to hunt in the area. Indian scouts warned Custer that there were many Lakotas and Cheyennes camped ahead. Nearly 2,000 warriors awaited Custer and his men. Custer divided his troops and attacked with approximately 225 men.
Custer and all these men died in the Battle of Little Bighorn. This was the first battle of the Sioux War of 1876, in which the Lakotas, led by Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and other chiefs, fought U.S. forces.
The Native American victory at the Little Bighorn was short-lived. The army soon defeated the Lakotas and Cheyennes. Then, Congress ordered that no food rations be distributed to the Native Americans until they agreed to the government’s demands. To avoid starvation, the Lakotas gave up most claims to the Black Hills and other territory. In this way, they surrendered about one third of the lands that the United States government had guaranteed them with the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868.
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse had taken their few remaining followers to Canada. Eventually, both men returned.

Chief Joseph Resists Further Settlement The Nez
Perce people lived in the Snake River valley, at the place where today Oregon, Washington, and Idaho meet. In 1855, some Nez Perce signed a treaty with the United States government in which they relinquished part of their land.
In the 1860s, gold discoveries brought miners onto Nez Perce land. The government ordered the Nez Perces to move to a reservation in Idaho. Those who had not signed the treaty refused. Led by Chief Joseph, about 700 Nez Perces fled north toward Canada. Army troops followed close behind.
In the months that followed, the Nez Perces fought off or eluded pursuing army units. Finally, after a tragic journey of more than 1,000 miles, Chief Joseph decided that he must surrender. Of the approximately 700 Nez Perces who had set out with him, fewer than 450 remained.
Geronimo Surrenders in the Southwest In the arid lands of the Southwest, the Apaches fiercely resisted the loss of their lands. One leader, Geronimo, continued fighting the longest. In 1876, he assumed leadership of a band of Apache warriors when the government tried to force his people onto a reservation.

Why did the Sioux War of 1876 begin? Remembering a Lost Way of Life
Many Native Americans longed for their lost way of life. On the reservations, the Lakotas and other Plains Indians turned to a religious ceremony called the Ghost Dance. It celebrated the time when Native Americans lived freely on the Plains.
The Ghost Dance In 1889, word spread that a prophet named Wovoka (woh VOH kuh) had appeared among the Paiute people of the southern Plains. Wovoka said that the Great Spirit would make a new world for his people, free from whites and filled with plenty. To bring about this new world, all the Native Americans had to do was dance to the Ghost Dance.
In their ceremonies, Ghost Dancers joined hands in a large circle in which they danced, chanted, and prayed. As they danced, some felt a “growing happiness.” Others saw a glowing vision of a new world.
Settlers Misinterpreted the Ghost Dance Many settlers grew alarmed. The Ghost Dancers, they said, were preparing for war. The settlers persuaded the government to outlaw the Ghost Dance.
In December 1890, police officers entered a Lakota reservation to arrest Sitting Bull, who had returned from Canada and was living on the reservation. They claimed that he was spreading the Ghost Dance among the Lakotas. In the struggle that followed, Sitting Bull was accidentally shot and killed.
Tragedy at Wounded Knee Upset by Sitting Bull s death, groups of Lakotas fled the reservations. Army troops pursued them to Wounded Knee Creek, in present-day South Dakota. On December 29, the Native Americans were preparing to surrender. As nervous troops watched, the Indians began to give up their guns.
Suddenly, a shot rang out. One account says a rifle went off by accident. The army opened fire. By the time the shooting stopped, nearly 300 Native American men, women, and children lay dead. About 25 soldiers

What was the purpose of the Ghost Dance?
Calls to Reform Native American Policies
The Native Americans were no longer able to resist the government. During the late 1800s, more Native Americans were forced onto reservations.
Publicizing Native American Tragedies Many people, Native American and white, spoke out against the tragedy that was occurring. One reformer, Susette La Flesche, was the daughter of an Omaha chief. She wrote and lectured about the destruction of the Native American way of life.
Another reformer, Helen Hunt Jackson, published A Century of Dishonor in 1881. The book recounts the long history of broken treaties between the United States and the Native Americans.
The Dawes Act Calls for reform led Congress to pass the Dawes Act in 1887. The act encouraged Native Americans to become farmers. Some reservations were divided up and given to individual Native American families.
The Dawes Act was a major change in the government’s policy toward Native Americans. Before the Act, Native Americans had been removed from their land and placed on reservations. There, they were poorly provided for by the government. With the Dawes Act, the government hoped that Native Americans would adopt white ways and become farmers.
The Dawes Act did not have the desired effect, however. To Native Americans, land was an open space for riding and hunting. Moreover, much of the land they were given was not suitable for farming. As a result, Native Americans often sold their shares of land to whites for low prices.
Life on the reservations changed Native American culture. The federal government took away the power of Native American leaders. In their place, it appointed government agents to make most decisions.

Silver and Gold Mining
The Comstock Lode Two prospectors struck gold in Nevada in 1859. Then, another miner, Henry Comstock, appeared. "The land is mine,” he cried, demanding to be made a partner. From then on, Comstock boasted about “his” mine. The strike became known as the Comstock Lode. A lode is a rich vein of gold or silver.
Comstock and his partners often complained about the heavy blue sand that was mixed in with the gold. It clogged the devices used for separating out the gold and made the gold hard to reach. When Mexican miners took the “danged blue stuff” to an expert in California, tests showed that it was loaded with silver. Comstock had stumbled onto one of the richest silver mines in the world.
Miners moved into many other areas of the West. Some found valuable ore in Montana and Idaho. Others struck it rich in Colorado. In the 1870s, miners discovered gold in the Black Hills of South Dakota. In the late 1890s, thousands rushed north to Alaska after major gold strikes were made there.

Boomtowns and Ghost Towns Gold and silver strikes attracted thousands of prospectors. Towns sprang up almost overnight near all the major mining sites.
First, miners built a tent city near the diggings. Then, people came to supply the miners’ needs. Traders brought mule teams loaded with tools, food, and clothing. Merchants hauled in wagon-loads of supplies and set up stores.
Soon, wood-frame houses, hotels, restaurants, and stores replaced the tents. For example, it took less than a year for the mining camp at the Comstock Lode to become the boomtown of Virginia City, Nevada.
Most settlers in the boomtowns of the mining frontier were men. However, enterprising women also found ways to profit. Some women ran boardinghouses and laundries. Others opened restaurants, where miners gladly paid high prices for home-cooked meals.
Many boomtowns lasted for only a few years. When the gold or silver ore was gone, the miners moved away. Without the miners for customers, businesses often had to close. In this way, a boomtown could quickly go bust and turn into a ghost town.
Still, some boomtowns survived and prospered even after the mines shut down. In these towns, miners stayed and found new ways to make a living.
» The Comstock Lode Mine in Nevada was originally a gold mine. Then, during the mid-1800s, prospectors discovered a large deposit of silver there as well, which fueled a silver rush to the West.

The Costs of Mining
The surge of miners in the West created problems, as did the arrival of cattle ranchers and homesteaders. Mines and towns polluted clear mountain streams. Miners cut down forests to get wood for buildings. They also forced Native Americans from the land.
Foreign miners were often treated unfairly. In many camps, mobs drove Mexicans from their claims. Chinese miners were heavily taxed or forced to work claims abandoned by others.
Few miners ever got rich. Much of the gold and silver lay deep underground. It could be reached only with costly machinery. Eventually, most mining in the West was taken over by large companies that could afford to buy this equipment. Furthermore, independent Prospectors like Henry Comstock largely disappeared. They were replaced by paid laborers who worked for toe large companies.

fights and killings that took place in these towns, but some towns actually were violent places. In response, miners sometimes resorted to organizing groups of vigilantes, or self-appointed law enforcers. Vigilantes tracked down outlaws and punished them, usually without trials. A common punishment was lynching.
Occasionally, vigilante groups did not form to fight crime. At least one San Francisco group organized to take political control of the city.
Informal methods of governing gradually gave way to more formal arrangements. In 1861, Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada were organized into territories. Idaho and Arizona followed in 1863 and Montana in 1864. The process of permanent settlement and government had begun.

mining towns, railroads meant supplies, new townsfolk, and a rapid means of transporting their gold and silver. The West needed a transportation system that could carry heavy loads over great distances at a cost low enough to guarantee a profit. It is no wonder, then, that railroad companies raced to lay track to the mines and boomtowns. In time, the technological innovations that made the expansion of railroads possible opened the West and fostered economic growth for the nation.
The Transcontinental Railroad In 1863, two companies began a race to build the first transcontinental railroad. A transcontinental railroad is one that stretches across a continent from coast to coast. The Union Pacific Railroad started building a rail line westward from Omaha, Nebraska. The Central Pacific Railroad began in Sacramento, California, and built eastward. A local paper reported:
“With rites appropriate to the occasion . . . ground was formally broken at noon for the commencement of the Central Pacific Railroad—the California link of the continental chain that is to unite American communities now divided by thousands of miles of trackless wilderness.”
—Sacramento Union, January 8, 1863
The federal government helped the railroad companies because it felt that rail lines in the West would benefit the entire nation. The government's aid came in the form of subsidies.
A subsidy is financial aid or a land grant from the government. Congress lent money to the railroad companies and gave them land. For every mile of track completed, the railroad companies received twenty sections of land in the states along the route and forty sections per mile in the territories. By the time the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroads were completed, they had received about 45 million acres of land. Often, both business and government ignored the fact that Native Americans lived on the land.
Building the Transcontinental Railroad Both companies had trouble getting workers. Labor was scarce during the Civil War. Also, the work was backbreaking and dangerous, and the pay was low.
The railroad companies hired immigrant workers, who accepted low wages. The Central Pacific brought in thousands of workers from China. The Union Pacific

hired newcomers from Ireland. African Americans and Mexican Americans also worked for each line.
The railroad workers faced a daunting task. The Central Pacific had to carve a path across the rugged Sierra Nevada.
The Union Pacific had to cut through the towering Rocky Mountains. Snowstorms and avalanches killed workers and slowed progress. At times, crews cutting tunnels through rock advanced only a few inches a day.
Building the railroad forced workers to adapt to or modify environments as varied as forests, deserts, and mountains. In some places, the railroad was built around mountains. In other places, however, workers blasted tunnels through mountains with technological innovations such as specialized tools and explosives to achieve their goals.
Railroads Encourage Urban and Rural Growth
The Central Pacific and Union Pacific met at Promontory, Utah, on May 10, 1869. Leland Stanford, president of the Central Pacific, dropped a solid-gold spike into a pm-drilled hole in the rail. In doing so, he joined the two tracks and united the country. The nations first transcontinental railroad was complete.
With the Civil War fresh in their minds, people cheered this new symbol of unity. The words that were engraved on the golden spike expressed their feelings:
“May God continue the unity of our
Country as the Railroad unites the two great Oceans of the world.”
—Engraved on the Golden Spike
Before long, other major rail lines linked the West and the East. The railroads brought economic growth and new settlement all across the West. They enabled people, supplies, and mail to move quickly and cheaply across the plains and mountains. Wherever rail lines went, settlements—“railroad towns”—sprang up along the tracks. The largest towns and cities developed where major railroad lines met. Cities where sea and land transportation met, such as Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, experienced huge population growth with the coming of the railroads. Western cities, such as Denver, Cheyenne, and Wichita, grew when railroads were joined to the great cattle trails. Thus the railroad—the most advanced transportation system of its day—had a major impact on the urbanization of the United States.
Because of their rapid growth, western territories began to apply for statehood. Nevada became a state in 1864; Colorado, in 1876; North Dakota, South

Building a National
Network of Rails
The Civil War showed the importance of railroads. Railroads carried troops and supplies to the battlefields. They also moved raw materials to factories. After the war, railroad companies began to build new lines all over the country.
A
Race to Construct New Lines Railroad builders raced to create thousands of miles of new tracks. In the years after completion of the first transcontinental rail line in 1869, Americans built three more. James Hill, a Canadian-born owner, finished the last major cross- » Workers constructed what would become part of the Great Northern Railway in the 1880s.

country line in 1893. His Great Northern Railway wound from Duluth, Minnesota, to Everett, Washington.
Unlike other rail lines, the Great Northern was built without financial aid from Congress. To make his railroad succeed, Hill had to turn a profit from the start. He encouraged farmers and ranchers to move to the Northwest and settle near his railroad. He gave seed to farmers and helped them buy equipment. He imported special bulls in order to breed hardier cattle. Not only was Hill’s policy generous, it also made good business sense. In the end, Hill’s railroad proved very successful even without government assistance, and it was a key to the development of the Northwest.
A
National Transportation System Early railroads were short lines that served local communities. Many lines ran for no more than 50 miles. When passengers and freight reached the end of one line, they had to move to a train on a different line to continue their journey. Even if the lines had been connected, the problem would not have been eliminated. Different lines used tracks of different gauges, or widths. As a result, the trains from one line could not run on the tracks of another line. In general, the tracks of northern lines used different gauges from those of southern lines.
In 1886, railroads in the South decided to adopt the northern gauge. On May 30, southern railroads stopped running so that work could begin. Using crowbars and sledgehammers, crews worked from dawn to dusk to move the rails a few inches farther apart. When they had finished, some 13,000 miles of track had been changed.
Once the track was standardized, American railroads formed a network, or system of connected lines. The creation of a rail network brought benefits to shippers. Often, rail companies arranged for freight cars on one line to use the tracks of another. For example, goods loaded in Chicago could stay on the same car all the way to New York, instead of being transferred from one car to another. As a result, the shipper had to pay only one fare for the whole distance.
New rails knit the sprawling nation together. By 1900, there were more miles of tracks in the United States than in Europe and Russia combined.
Westinghouse Brakes and Pullman Cars New
inventions helped make railway travel safer and faster. On early trains, each railroad car had its own brakes and its own brake operator.
If different cars stopped at different times, serious accidents could result. In 1869, George Westinghouse began selling his new air brake. Westinghouse’s air brake allowed a locomotive engineer to stop all the
The Reconstruction Era (1865-1877)	472	9.7 Mining, Railroads, and the Economy
railroad cars at once. The air brake increased safety and allowed for longer, faster trains.
Long distance travel also became more comfortable. In 1864, George Pullman designed a railroad sleeping car. Pullman cars had convertible berths for sleeping as well as lavatories. Rail lines also added dining cars. Porters (who carried baggage), conductors, and waiters attended to the needs of passengers.
The Railroads and Economic Growth The growth of the railroads in the 1800s shows the benefits of the U.S. free-enterprise system. As William Vanderbilt pointed out, the railroads “are built for men who invest their money.” That is, the railroads were built to make money for the people who invested in them. Yet the railroads benefited many other people: the workers who laid the tracks, the employees who ran the trains, the passengers who rode the rails, and the businesses that filled cars with cargo. People who lived in the towns that sprouted up along the rail lines also benefited. Ultimately, the railroads benefited the country as a whole.
The expansion of the railroads brought significant changes in ways of producing, distributing, and consuming goods. Businesses brought raw materials on railroads to factories. Finished goods from those factories could be shipped far and wide for a reasonable price. Consumers—especially those far from cities— could now have access to more goods than ever before. The same held true for farm goods: farmers had wider markets, and consumers had more food choices.
Consolidation Brings Efficiency As railroads grew, they looked for ways to operate more efficiently. Small lines were often costly to run, so many companies began to consolidate, or combine. Larger companies bought up smaller ones or forced them out of business. The Pennsylvania Railroad, for example, consolidated 73 companies into its system.
Tough-minded business people led the drive for consolidation. Cornelius Vanderbilt was among the most powerful of these leaders. The son of a poor farmer, Vanderbilt earned one fortune in steamship lines. He then began to buy up railroad lines in New York State.
Vanderbilt sometimes used ruthless tactics to force smaller owners to sell to him. In the early 1860s, he decided to buy the New York Central Railroad. The owners refused to sell. Vanderbilt then announced that New York Central passengers would not be allowed to transfer to his trains. With their passengers stranded and business dropping sharply, the New York Central owners gave in and sold their line to Vanderbilt.
Vanderbilt then bought up most of the lines between Chicago and Buffalo. By the time of his death in 1877,
» After making a fortune in the steamship business, Cornelius Vanderbilt turned his attention to railroads. He bought up most of the rail lines between Buffalo, New York, and Chicago, Illinois.
his companies controlled 4,500 miles of track and linked New York City to the Great Lakes region.
Other consolidations were soon underway. Before long, the major railroads of the United States were organized into a number of systems directed by a handful of wealthy and powerful men.

Railroads and Competition
With builders rushing to share in the profits of the railroad boom, overbuilding occurred. Soon, there were too many rail lines in some parts of the country. Between Atlanta and St. Louis, for example, 20 different lines competed for business. There was not nearly enough rail traffic to keep all these lines busy.

Especially in the West, there were too few people— and therefore not enough paying customers for the railroads to make a profit. Competition was fierce. Rate wars broke out as rival railroads slashed their fares to

win customers. Usually, all the companies lost money as a result.
Often, railroads were forced to grant secret rebates, or discounts, to their biggest customers. The railroads preferred big customers for two reasons. First, big customers were more likely to pay their bills and keep being customers in the future. Second, it was less expensive to deal with a few big customers than many small customers.
Fewer customers meant less paperwork and simpler loading and unloading. Unfortunately, the practice of giving rebates hurt small shippers, such as farmers, who still had to pay the full price. It even drove many small companies out of business.
Railroad owners soon realized that cutthroat competition was hurting even their large lines. They looked for ways to end the competition. One method was pooling. In a pool, several railroad companies agreed to divide up the business in an area. They then fixed their prices at a high level.
Farmers React to High Railroad Prices Railroad rebates and pools angered small farmers in the South and the West. Both practices kept shipping prices high for them. Indeed, rates were so high that at times

farmers burned their crops for fuel rather than ship them to market.
Many farmers joined the Populist movement. Populists called for government regulation of rail rates. Some Populists even called for a government takeover of the railroads. Congress and several states passed laws regulating railroad companies. However, the laws did not end abuses. Railroad owners sometimes bribed officials to keep the laws from being enforced.
The Panic of 1893 In 1893, an economic panic hit the United States. The economy went through a drastic downsizing. About 15,000 businesses and 500 banks closed, leaving many American workers unemployed.
The railroads were both a cause and a victim of the economic downturn. Overbuilding in the 1860s meant that many railroad companies’ finances were fragile—they were barely making money. In 1893, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad went bankrupt, helping to start the panic. Many other leading railroads followed, including the Erie, the Northern Pacific, the Union Pacific, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe. Industries, like steel, and a wide variety of businesses that had come to depend on the railroad were hurt, as were businesses that depended on those businesses. Through a ripple effect, the whole economy suffered.
The economy would not recover for about four years. When it did, it was the railroad that once again provided the transportation the economy needed.

profits in a competitive business environment?
Railroads Build a Nation
Although railroads caused certain problems, they also made possible the rapid growth of industry after 1865. Building rail lines created thousands of jobs. Steelworkers turned millions of tons of iron into steel for tracks and engines. Lumberjacks cut down whole forests to supply wood for railroad ties. Miners sweated in dusty mine shafts digging coal to fuel railroad engines. The railroad companies themselves employed thousands of workers. They laid tracks, built trestles across rivers, carved tunnels through mountains, and built countless railroad stations.
The large railroads also pioneered new ways of managing business. Rail companies created special departments for shipping and accounting and for servicing equipment. Expert managers headed each department, while chains of command ensured that the organization ran smoothly. Other big businesses soon copied these management techniques.

We all agree that the seceded States, so called, are out of their proper relation with the Union; and that the sole object of the government, civil and military, in regard to those States is to again get them into that proper practical relation. I believe it is not only possible, but in fact, easier to do this, without deciding, or even considering, whether these States have ever been out of the Union, than with it. Finding themselves safely at home, it would be utterly immaterial whether they had ever been abroad. Let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restoring the proper practical relations between these States and the Union; and each forever after, innocently indulge his own opinion whether, in doing the acts, he brought the States from without, into the Union, or only gave them proper assistance, they never having been out of it.

Declaration of
Independence
When the Continental Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in 1776, they did more than announce their separation from Great Britain. They also summed up the most basic principles that came to underlie American government. The first section is sometimes called the “social contract” section. You can read the words at left.
These ideas have had significant effect on later developments in American history. You will notice the relationship of the ideas behind the Declaration of Independence to the American Revolution, the writing of the U.S. Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, and the movements to end slavery and to give women the right to vote. You’ll see how the United States became a nation of immigrants, with its rich diversity of people, and the ways this development relates to the ideas of the Declaration of Independence.
Read the first three paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence. Then recite words from the Declaration of Independence quoted at left. Consider their meaning and then answer these questions.

Assembly
During Celebrate Freedom Week, Texas students remember not only the Declaration of Independence. They also honor the United States Constitution. September 17 is Constitution Day, and your school may hold an assembly or other celebration in honor of the day. As part of this celebration, your teacher may ask you to participate in planning and holding a Constitution Day assembly.
Organize As a class, create the basic plan for your assembly. Discuss the following:
1.	When and where should the assembly take place?
2.	How long should it take? Should you plan on a short program taking a single class period, or a longer program?
3.	Who should be involved? Will other classes or other grades take part? Will you invite outsiders, such as parents or people from the community?
4.	What activities might be included?
Plan After your discussion, divide the class into committees to complete jobs such as getting permission from the school administration, preparing a program, inviting any guests, advertising the plan beforehand, and blogging about it afterward.
Give thought to the types of activities that might be included in the assembly. You might invite a guest speaker from your community. You might run an essay contest among students and have the winners read their essays during the assembly. Some students might prepare a video presentation about the Bill of Rights. Others might write and perform a skit about what the Declaration of Independence or U.S. Constitution mean to them.
You might start your assembly by asking everyone to rise to say the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States flag and the Pledge of Allegiance to the Texas state flag. One student might give a brief speech about how the pledges reflect the ideas of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constituion.

ESSENTIAL QUESTION ]
How much does geography affect people’s lives? In 1492, the European explorer Christopher Columbus landed on the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean Sea. Columbus called the Native Americans he met there “Indians,” thinking he had landed in the Indies. Following Columbus’s landing, Europeans began to slowly make contact with the many peoples already living in North and South America. The arrival of the Europeans dramatically affected these native peoples. One consequence was the rapid spread of diseases among the Indian population that not only claimed lives but demoralized survivors.

European Colonies in the
Americas
Over the next two centuries European nations explored the Americas and began establishing colonies, often taking control of land from Native Americans in the process. Spain, which had sponsored Columbus’s voyage, rapidly conquered a vast empire around the Caribbean and in Central and South America, with a few holdings in North America. France established smaller colonies in what is now Canada. England established 13 colonies along the mid-Atlantic coast of North America. Eventually, these colonies would declare their independence from England and become a new nation: the United States of America.
Wealth flowed into Spain from its colonies in Mexico, Central America, and South America. The population was thin and life was hard in the borderland regions in the present-day Southwest and in Florida. To encourage settlements and protect these outposts, Spain established presidios, or forts. Priests and nuns established dozens of missions to convert Native Americans to Christianity.
American Indians were eager to exchange beaver pelts for European-made metal axes, knives, and kettles. During the 1690s, the

French founded Louisiana, along the Mississippi River valley and the Gulf Coast.
The French established colonies in Canada along the coast of Nova Scotia and the St. Lawrence River. Besides exploiting rich fishing off the coast, they found a fortune in furs.
The Virginia Colonies In 1607, the English established their first enduring settlement, Jamestown, in Virginia. Despite enormous losses from disease, starvation, and war with Native Americans who lived in the area, the English expanded around the Chesapeake Bay. The colonists prospered by raising tobacco for export. Claiming the political rights of Englishmen, the Virginia planters elected a legislature, known as the House of Burgesses. It governed the colony in partnership with a royal governor appointed by the king of England.
New England To the north, the English established more colonies, which they called New England. The first colonists were devout Protestants called “Puritans,” who hoped to create model moral communities. They settled first in 1620 at Plymouth, where they adopted the Mayflower Compact. The Mayflower Compact provided a framework for self-government. By 1700,
New England had four colonies: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire.
Adapting to the cold climate and short growing season, the New Englanders supplemented farming with lumber harvested from the forests and fish from the sea. By building ships, they were able to trade with the other colonies and with Europe.
The Middle and Southern Colonies The English developed a third cluster of colonies between Maryland and New England. They conquered Dutch New Netherland and renamed it New York, then added New Jersey and Pennsylvania, a haven for Quaker immigrants. The Middle Colonies offered religious toleration and a prospering economy based on exporting wheat.
South of Virginia, the English developed a fourth cluster of colonies. The Southern Colonies consisted of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia in addition to Virginia. The colonists raised rice on coastal plantations and cattle on farms in the backcountry. The plantations relied on the labor of enslaved Africans.

Democratic Ideals in the American Colonies
The English colonists brought ideas about democracy and republican government with them to America. Some of these ideas came from ancient Greece and Rome, others from Judeo-Christian roots, and still others came from traditions and thinkers from Europe’s relatively recent past.
Political Traditions From England As English citizens, the colonists believed that they were entitled to the same rights as English citizens in Britain. Many of these rights were contained in two important documents: the Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights. The Magna Carta, signed by King John in 1215, limited the power of the English monarch. It protected the right of people to own private property and guaranteed the right to trial by jury. The English Bill of Rights, signed by King William and Queen Mary in 1688, was a written list of freedoms that the government promised to protect.
The English Bill of Rights required Parliament, England’s lawmaking body, to meet regularly. It also stated that the monarch could not raise taxes or build an army without Parliament’s consent.
The Influence of the Enlightenment and the Great Awakening During the 1700s, ideas based on the Enlightenment circulated among well-educated American colonists. The Enlightenment was a European intellectual movement. Enlightenment philosophers believed that all problems could be solved by human reason. Frenchman Baron de Montesquieu
and Englishman John Locke were two thinkers who applied reason to government and politics.
Enlightenment philosophy affected religious beliefs in the colonies. Colonists who admired these ideas wanted a religion that was less emotional and more rational. At the same time, attendance at church services was in decline.
During the 1740s, concern about these trends led to a religious movement called the Great Awakening.
Evangelical preachers such as Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield toured the colonies promoting revivals where people felt a direct and transforming contact with an overwhelming Holy Spirit. The Great Awakening led to the birth of new churches. This eventually increased tolerance of religious differences. Many colonists also came to believe that if they could decide how to worship God, they could also decide how to govern themselves.
The Enlightenment and the Great Awakening would later combine to influence the American Revolution. The Enlightenment informed the writings of political leaders, while the Great Awakening inspired and united many of the common people.

Causes of the American Revolution
The tradition of a limited English monarchy, experience with self-government, and exposure to Enlightenment ideas influenced the leading American colonists. A European war and a spirit of independence in the colonies prompted the colonists to take action that would change the course of world history.
Between 1689 and 1763, the British and French fought a series of wars in Europe. (In 1707, a treaty joined England and Scotland to form Great Britain.) These conflicts spread to North America and involved the French and British colonists and their Native American allies.
The last of these wars, called the French and Indian War, erupted in 1754 and ended in 1763 with a British victory. The peace treaty gave Canada, Florida, and a portion of French Louisiana to Britain. British colonists were eager to move into Louisiana, but Britain wished to keep peace with the Indians who lived on this territory British limits on westward expansion angered the colonists.
Violation of the Rights of Englishmen The British victory was expensive, nearly doubling Britain s national debt. During the 1760s, the British Parliament asserted that the colonists should pay new taxes
to help the empire. The proposed taxes and tighter trade regulations shocked the colonists. Certain parliamentary acts in the 1760s and 1770s violated other rights enjoyed by men in Britain, including the principles of no standing army in peacetime without consent and trial by jury.
Many colonists believed that since they were not directly represented in Parliament, new taxes and trade regulations denied them their rights as Englishmen. They cited the Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights, which blocked the king from levying taxes without the permission of Parliament. During the 1760s, their problem was with Parliament, rather than with King George III. Professing loyalty to the king, the colonists hoped to be free from Parliament’s efforts to tax them. They would pay taxes levied only by their own elected assemblies in the colonies.
Pressuring Parliament Valuing the prosperity and protection of the empire, the colonists did not immediately seek independence. Instead, they wanted to remain part of the empire that for so long had produced so many benefits at so little cost to them. They also wanted to enjoy the traditional rights of Englishmen.
To pressure Parliament, colonists boycotted British goods. Local committees enforced this boycott, which threatened the British economy. Angry crowds

harassed colonists who helped to collect the new taxes. Colonists who refused to honor the boycotts or who spoke out in favor of the taxes were considered Loyalists. Representing a large minority, the Loyalists preferred to pay the taxes and honor Parliament and the king. They also feared that the resistance would lead to a war that Britain seemed certain to win.
H EXPLAIN
Why did many American colonists oppose an increase in taxes?
The American Revolution
In 1774, leading colonists held a convention, called the First Continental Congress. Delegates from 12 of the colonies (all except Georgia) met in Philadelphia to discuss what to do next. The delegates sent a list of complaints to the British government. The letter was ignored.
Americans Declare Their Independence In 1775, war began when British troops tried to seize arms and ammunition stored at Concord, Massachusetts. New Englanders quickly organized an army, which the Continental Congress adopted as the army for all the colonies.
That year, the Second Continental Congress assembled. Another letter of complaint was sent to the British government. When this letter was also ignored, Congress decided to declare the colonies’ independence from Britain. A committee made up of Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, and Thomas Jefferson was given the task of drafting an official declaration.
The Declaration of Independence was mainly written by Thomas Jefferson with help from Adams and Franklin. After it was approved by the delegates at the Continental Congress, the first person to sign the document was John Hancock, a wealthy merchant and leader of the Patriots in Massachusetts who later served nine terms as governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Other signers included the well-known doctor Benjamin Rush, of Philadelphia, who later served as treasurer of the U.S. Mint.
The Intent and Meaning of the Declaration The
intent of the Declaration of Independence was to state that the 13 American colonies were now independent from Britain and to give reasons why the Patriots felt this step was necessary. But it had more meaning than a statement of independence. It expressed Enlightenment ideas about the natural rights of people and the purposes of government.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
—Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776
Jefferson made the argument that the purpose of the government is “to secure these rights,” a position influenced by Enlightenment thinkers. He asserted that when a government fails to respect or protect the rights of its people, the people have the right to replace that government with a new government of their own making.
The importance of the Declaration of Independence lay in both how it captured the ideals of the revolution, inspiring the struggle, and how it laid the groundwork for the creation of the United States Constitution. In addition, revolutionary movements in other countries drew inspiration from the document and its enduring ideals.
The Declaration went on to list the reasons why the colonists felt that they had no other choice but rebellion. The colonists had not come to the decision to rebel lightly. Once they did, they fought hard for victory.
Patriot Leaders During the war, the British made many military mistakes because they underestimated the Patriots, who were highly motivated by their cause. Colonists of all kinds gave up their lives to fight for the cause of independence. John Peter Muhlenberg, a Virginia minister, gave up preaching to recruit and lead a troop of 300 men. He proclaimed, "There is a time to pray and a time to fight, and that time has now come!” Another minister, John Witherspoon of New Jersey, was elected to the Continental Congress and was the only clergyman to sign the Declaration of Independence.
The Patriots greatly benefited from the leadership of George Washington, who had gained valuable military experience during the French and Indian War. They also owed much to the resourcefulness of leaders such as Jonathan Trumbull, Sr., who was a close friend and advisor to Washington. Trumbull, a former merchant, was the colonial governor of Connecticut. He made a key contribution to the revolution's success by helping to organize the supply of food, clothing, shoes, guns, and ammunition for the Continental Army.
French Assistance In 1776, the colonists sent a small delegation led by Maryland planter Charles Carroll to seek the assistance of French Canadians in the fight against the British. Carroll was the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence and was the last survivor of the 56 signers, dying in 1832. The mission failed, but by 1778, the Patriots began receiving military assistance from France itself. In 1781, a French

Confederation of States States Establish Republican Governments By declaring their independence, the former colonies became states. Each of the 13 new states wrote a constitution that created a republican government, or a government in which officials are representatives elected by the people. Most state constitutions also included a bill of rights, a list of freedoms guaranteed by the state government. Many of them guaranteed freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and the right to trial by jury.
At the time, voting rights were very limited. Only white male property owners could vote, except in New Jersey, where women had the right to vote until 1807. African Americans—whether free or enslaved—and Native Americans were not permitted to vote.

all 13 states did not occur until March 1781, six months before the British surrender at Yorktown that ended the war.
Under the Articles of Confederation, most power remained with the states. The Articles created a national government without a President or a judicial branch. The legislative branch had only very limited powers. Congress could declare and conduct war. It could also regulate trade with foreign countries and with Indian nations. But it could not raise troops or levy taxes, and there was no way to enforce trade regulations. The United States government could only collect money and muster an army with voluntary contributions from the states.
Weaknesses of the Articles Under the Articles, the national government had no say over the rules of interstate commerce. Each state set its own trade policy. Most states tried to protect their industries and agriculture from competition by taxing goods imported from other states. This practice discouraged trade among the states and led to competition that had the potential to become destructive.
The national debt was also a problem. Because the Continental Congress had borrowed money and issued paper currency during the Revolutionary War, the new government was deeply in debt. However, it
had no way to raise the money to pay off this debt. The states were all paying off their own war debts and were largely unwilling or unable to contribute money to the national government.
The national government also suffered from structural weaknesses. There was no President. Each state, no matter how large or small, had a single vote in a unicameral, or one-house, Congress. On the major issues, including declaring war and making treaties, two thirds of the states (9 out of 13) had to approve. Amending the Articles was almost impossible, because every single one of the states had to endorse any change.
Managing the Northwest Territory Despite its weaknesses under the Articles of Confederation, the national government took up the task of fulfilling its duties as best it could. The Articles gave Congress authority over the vast Northwest Territory, which lay north of the Ohio River and stretched west from Pennsylvania to the Mississippi River. In 1785 and 1787, Congress passed two laws to manage this land. The first, the Land Ordinance, created a system for surveying and selling the land to settlers. The second, the Northwest Ordinance, described how territories should be governed and how they could become full-fledged states. This law also banned slavery in the territory and provided for public education.

Increasing Troubles Lacking an army, the weak confederation could not defend American interests on the frontier. The Spanish in Louisiana tried to constrain western American settlements by closing the port of New Orleans. Along the Great Lakes, the British refused to abandon frontier forts on the American side of the boundary set by the terms of the peace treaty that ended the American Revolution.
Domestic troubles also began plaguing the young republic. During the mid-1780s, an economic depression reduced the prices paid to farmers for their produce. Unable to pay their debts, farmers faced losing their crops, livestock, and even their homes. In Massachusetts, matters worsened when the courts seized farms from farmers who did not pay taxes to the state or their loans. In rural Massachusetts in 1786, armed farmers led by Daniel Shays shut down the courts, blocking foreclosures. The state of Massachusetts sent troops to suppress this revolt, known as Shays’ Rebellion. The rebellion highlighted the weaknesses of the national government set up by the Articles of Confederation.
B RECALL
What were the main weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation?
The Constitutional
Convention
By 1787, many Americans agreed that the Articles of Confederation were flawed. In May 1787, the states sent delegates to a special convention in Philadelphia to draft proposed amendments to the Articles. However, once there, the delegates decided not to revise the Articles of Confederation. Instead, they agreed to undertake a complete restructuring of the national government. The convention came to be known as the Constitutional Convention. The Convention would go on to produce a completely new, much stronger plan of government. That plan, the United States Constitution, has endured to this day with relatively few significant changes.
Two Opposing Plans While the delegates agreed that the Articles of Confederation were deeply flawed, it was much harder for them to reach an agreement on the best solution.
The first proposal put forth was the Virginia Plan, designed by James Madison. The Virginia Plan advocated a national union that was both strong and republican. Madison insisted that a large republic could be more stable than a small one, because in a large republic, the diverse interests would provide checks

and balances to preserve the common good. In addition to securing the power to tax and to regulate commerce, this plan proposed major structural changes. The nation would have a bicameral legislature: a House of Representatives and a Senate. In both houses, the states with larger populations would have more members. The Virginia Plan also featured a President to command the armed forces and to manage foreign relations.
William Paterson offered a counterproposal called the New Jersey Plan. This plan, favored by the small states, would give Congress the power to regulate commerce and to tax while keeping the basic structure of the Confederation. The plan retained a unicameral legislature representing the states as equals—no matter how large or small. The states remained sovereign except for those few powers specifically granted to the national government. Under the New Jersey Plan, the United States would stay a loose confederation of states, rather than become a unified nation.
The Great Compromise The delegates worked throughout the hot Philadelphia summer to resolve their differences. Roger Sherman proposed what has come to be called the Great Compromise. It settled the differences between the Virginia and the New

Jersey plans by creating a bicameral, or two-house, legislature. In a concession to the smaller states, the Senate would equally represent every state by allowing just two senators per state.
In keeping with the Virginia Plan, the House of Representatives, in which representation was based on population, granted more power to the larger states.
The Slavery Issue Another major compromise appeased the southern states. Their delegates feared domination by the northern states, which had a larger white population. To reassure the South, the delegates adopted the three-fifths clause. It counted each enslaved person as three fifths of a person, to be added to a state’s free population, which boosted the number of the Souths seats in Congress. The three-fifths clause, however, gave no rights to enslaved African Americans.

The Struggle Over
Ratification
The Constitution was now written, but it was not yet the law of the land. Before it could go into effect, 9 of the 13 states had to ratify, or officially approve, it.
Federalists Argue for Ratification Supporters of the Constitution were called Federalists. They wanted the United States to have a strong central government. Three leading Federalists—James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay—wrote a series of letters to newspapers in support of the Constitution. These letters, collectively called The Federalist Papers, explained why they believed the Constitution was vital to the survival of the new nation. They also explained how the new system of government would work. Today, the Federalist essays are recognized as perhaps the most sophisticated explanation of the new American political system ever written.

Antifederalists Argue Against Ratification
Opponents of the proposed Constitution were called Antifederalists. They included some leading Americans, such as Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams. The Antifederalists objected to the Constitution because they thought it gave the national government far too much power at the expense of the states. They believed that the President had too much power, that Congress was too small and could not represent voters,

and that a federal court system interfered with local courts.
A
Bill of Rights Leads to Ratification One of the most powerful arguments of the Antifederalists was that the proposed Constitution lacked a bill of rights. Most of the states already had bills of rights protecting individual liberty. The Antifederalists were concerned that the federal government would become a threat to Americans’ prized freedoms without a similar set of protections. To help secure ratification, the Federalists promised to add a bill of rights once the new government was established. By June 1788, the nine states required to ratify the Constitution had voted to make it the law of the land, with two other important states—Virginia and New York—quickly following.
In 1789, Congress approved the 10 constitutional amendments that became the federal Bill of Rights. The states ratified these amendments in 1791.
Importance of the Bill of Rights The Bill of Rights protects a wide range of personal freedoms, including freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press and of assembly, the right to bear arms as part of “a well-regulated militia,” and protections against arbitrary intrusions and arrests, unfair trials, and “cruel and unusual” punishments. The personal freedoms established by the Bill of Rights have been cherished by Americans ever since. The protection they provide against abuses of power by the government are as important today as they were when they were originally written, perhaps even more so.

Constitution
The intent of the Constitution was to create the framework for a republican form of government that strengthened the federal government from what it had been under the Articles of Confederation while balancing the interests of the large and small states.
The Meaning of the Constitution The authors of the Constitution established a representative government based on these basic principles: popular sovereignty, separation of powers, limited government, federalism, checks and balances, and representative government.
Popular Sovereignty The government derives its political authority from the people. This sentiment is

reflected in the Constitution’s opening words, “We the People of the United States . . .”
Separation of Powers The Constitution defined distinct legislative, executive, and judicial branches with different powers and responsibilities to prevent misuses of power by any of the three branches.
Limited Government Popular sovereignty ensures that a government's power is restricted, or limited. The Constitution specifically defined and limited the powers of government. Government leaders are not above the law.
Federalism To create a national government stronger than the one under the Articles of Confederation, the framers created a new form of federalism to share power between the national and state governments. The states could no longer issue their own paper money or regulate trade with other states. These powers, known as the delegated powers, now belonged only to the federal government. Certain reserved powers continued to belong to the states alone, including the power to regulate and conduct elections. The federal and state governments also held some overlapping, or

The Importance of the Constitution The Republic established by the Constitution of the United States became a symbol of freedom not only to Americans but to countries in Europe and republics in Latin America as well. The 13 colonies were now forged together into a single nation with a strong central government to bind it together.
E pluribus unum This unity had already been suggested by the phrase “E pluribus unum,” which is Latin for “Out of many, one.” This phrase was first suggested as a motto for the young nation by the committee appointed in 1776 to design an official seal for what political leaders were beginning to call “the United States of America.” As the United States grew and developed into a more diverse nation, it began to take on a second meaning. ““Out of many, one” is now commonly taken to signify that a single, unified people has grown out of people with many different backgrounds, ethnicities, and beliefs.

concurrent, powers, among them parallel court systems and the right to collect taxes.
Checks and Balances The three branches were given separate and sometimes overlapping responsibilities, along with specific ways to override, or check and balance, the decisions of the other branches. This distribution of power was intended to prevent the emergence of a single center of power and to provide remedies for abuses of power by the members of any one branch.
Representative Government The writers created an indirect democracy in which voters elect representatives to be their voice in government. The state legislatures rather than the voters would choose the members of the Senate, and the electoral college would indirectly elect the President.

American neutrality by seizing U.S. merchant ships trading with French colonies. This added to U.S. outrage at the continued presence of British forts on the American side of the Great Lakes. To avoid war, Washington sent Chief Justice John Jay to London to negotiate with the British. In the Jay Treaty of 1794, the British gave up the forts but kept most of their restrictions on U.S. shipping.
New Powers and New Territory As the nation was struggling to find its footing in foreign affairs, the federal government took steps that expanded the government’s powers and enlarged the nation’s territory.
In 1803, Chief Justice John Marshall used a partisan dispute in the case of Marburyv. Madison. to assert that the Supreme Court had the power of judicial review. That meant that the judicial branch could now decide the constitutionality of congressional actions.
That same year, France’s new ruler, Napoleon Bonaparte, agreed to sell the vast Louisiana Territory west of the Mississippi to the United States. The Louisiana Purchase nearly doubled the size of the United States and cost the country only $15 million. In 1804, President Jefferson sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to explore the new territory, in what became known as the Lewis and Clark expedition.
The War of 1812 By the early 1800s, the British navy had resumed seizing American merchant ships trading with France. In order to pressure the British to stop, the United States declared an embargo on British goods, but the embargo ended up hurting Americans more than it hurt the British. Congress lifted the embargo in 1809. The next President, James Madison, was unable to end the problems with Britain, and in 1812, Congress declared war. Some Americans hoped for a quick victory and the capture of British Canada.
During the two-and-a-half years of war, little progress was made by either side. In 1815, both sides agreed to end the fighting and sign a peace treaty. Although the treaty did not change any boundaries, the war was hailed as a victory by many Americans. They felt that the war proved the strength of their young nation. Twice in two generations, a young, upstart nation had fought successfully against one of the world’s greatest powers. Some called it “The Second American Revolution” because it proved the stability of the country’s republican form of government.
In 1817, James Monroe of Virginia succeeded Madison as President. Monroe and his Secretary of State John Quincy Adams made another foreign policy statement by issuing the Monroe Doctrine. In this declaration, the United States asserted that the monarchies of Europe had no business meddling with

What is the principle of judicial review? The Age of Jackson
The rise of war hero General Andrew Jackson in the 1820s shifted the politics of the nation. While the age of Jacksonian democracy expanded the concept of democracy, some policies of the Jackson era resulted in long-term political strife.
The End of an Era The conclusion of the War of 1812 brought on a period of relative political unity in the United States. Some historians call this the “Era of Good Feeling.” However, during the early 1820s, internal differences among Democratic Republicans began emerging. These differences resulted in a fourway presidential race in 1824.
Jackson was the clear winner of the popular vote, but in a four-way race, no candidate was able to win a majority of electoral votes. Therefore, under the Constitution, the election was decided by the House of Representatives. Fourth-place finisher Henry Clay
threw his support to John Quincy Adams, who became President.
Aided by his party’s organization, Jackson triumphed over Adams in 1828. Jackson’s victory split the Democratic Party when Democrats who opposed Jackson founded a new political party known as the Whigs. The Era of Good Feelings was at an end.
Jacksonian Democracy Jackson rose to prominence at a time when national politics was becoming increasingly democratic. More states chose presidential electors by popular vote, rather than by state legislatures, and many states abolished property requirements for voting. Participation in elections grew from less than 30 percent of white men in the early 1800s to almost 80 percent in 1840.
Jacksonian democracy had serious limits. Most state constitutions took the vote away from free blacks, even those with property. Native Americans, who were not citizens, and women could not vote in any state.
The Nullification Crisis Jackson was at the center of conflicts over economic policy that shaped the tone of American politics for decades. The federal government’s use of protective tariffs had long been a source of sectional debate. The industrial North favored tariffs while the agrarian South opposed them.
Connecting with Past Learnings
0.3 America in the Early 1800s
In 1828, Congress adopted an especially high tariff, which southerners called “The Tariff of Abominations.” South Carolina, relying on the doctrine of nullification, claimed that it could void, or nullify, unconstitutional laws within its borders.
Jackson signed into law a new tariff that was not as harsh as the 1828 tariff, but it was still unacceptable to many southerners. The South Carolina state government voted to nullify the tariff law and threatened to secede from the Union. Jackson threatened to use troops to enforce federal law in South Carolina. Although South Carolina eventually backed down after Congress passed a compromise tariff, this showdown between proponents of the states’ rights view and the federal government hinted at thorny future conflicts.
Jackson Pushes Indian Removal Despite his stand against nullification, Jackson’s political base was in the South, and those voters expected him to help them remove the 60,000 Native Americans living in the region. In 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. This law sought to negotiate the peaceful exchange of Indian lands in the South for new lands in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma).
Most Choctaws and Chickasaws did agree to accept lands in the West. But other groups resisted removal. In 1836, after several violent conflicts, the U.S. military
forcibly removed the Creeks from their southern lands. In Florida, the Seminoles fought the Second Seminole War between 1835 and 1842. In the end, U.S. troops forced most Seminoles from Florida.
In 1838, federal troops compelled more than 15,000 Cherokees to travel from the Southeast to Oklahoma. At least 4,000 Cherokees died of disease, exposure, and hunger along what came to be called the Trail of Tears
Bank Politics and Economic Woes Jackson also sided with the interests of southern farmers in his opposition to the second Bank of the United States, which Congress had chartered in 1816. Business leaders argued that the Bank fostered economic growth and confidence, but Jacksonian Democrats felt that it favored a small number of rich investors. In 1832, Jackson vetoed the renewal of the Bank’s charter.
Supporters of the Bank formed the Whig Party to oppose Jackson’s policies. After Jackson won re-election in 1832, he took steps to finish off the Bank. Relieved from federal regulation, state and private banks flooded the nation with paper money of uncertain value. Jackson’s decision to stop accepting paper money for the purchase of federal land eventually let to the Panic of 1837, the nation’s worst economic depression to that date.

The Young Republic The United States in the early 1800s had its share of political disputes and economic hiccups, but these problems only served to prove the stability and strength of the United States. Once a young nation engaged in an experiment with the republican form of government, by the 1830s, the United States was a rising economic power and a model of democratic stability. Beginning in 1831, French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville undertook a study of American society and politics. His findings were published in a now-classic work of political science, Democracy in America. Tocqueville was impressed with the young nation’s commitment to the ideals of liberty and individualism expressed in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution.
According to Tocqueville, there were five crucial ingredients to the success of representative democracy in the United States: liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, populism, and laissez-faire.
Liberty and egalitarianism, or the view that people are equal and should be treated equally, were rallying cries of the many revolutions that followed the American Revolution, including the one in France. But in the 1830s, these values had little or no reality for most people living outside the United States. In the United States, individual rights were explicitly protected in the federal Constitution and in many of its state
counterparts, if only for white men. The Declaration of Independence stated that “all men are created equal.”
Tocqueville was particularly astonished by American individualism and populism, or the widespread participation of regular citizens in the political process. These traits were largely absent in the older social systems of Europe, where class systems determined an individual’s place in society and the upper classes dominated politics to the exclusion of nearly everyone else. In some ways, Jackson was the symbol of both individualism and populism. His successes, driven by determination and talent rather than an elite background and connections, inspired many other common Americans.
The American government also had a “hands off” or laissez-faire approach to the national economy. Many citizens agreed with the maxim that government is best which governs least, especially when it came to the economy In the early 1800s, American industry budded and thrived and cotton exploded as a new cash crop in the South, with the federal government taking a light hand in guiding the economy. While none of the ingredients Tocqueville noticed were completely unique to the United States, no other nation exhibited all five to the same degree as the United States.

Growing Differences
Between North and South
In the United States, the Industrial Revolution took hold first in the Northeast, which had more water power than any other region. As factories cropped up, cities grew and attracted European immigrants seeking work. With more labor power available, more factories were built.
While the Northeast industrialized, the southern states became more reliant on an agricultural economy fueled by slave labor. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 made cotton the South’s leading crop and increased the need for, and the profitability of, slaves.
Growing Demand for Cotton The growth of the textile industry in the North spurred further increases in cotton production in the South. Because of demand for cotton from textile mills in both Europe and the North, cotton prices increased. This encouraged southern planters to expand their fields and increase the number of enslaved African Americans they owned.
As the northern and southern economies developed different specializations, their political differences increased as well. Many northerners objected to slavery on moral grounds, and by 1804, every state north of Maryland had passed laws to end slavery gradually. Because of the importance of slavery to the southern
economy, southerners grew stronger in their defense of slavery.
Resistance to Slavery Many enslaved people did whatever they could to fight back against their oppressors. Resistance often took the form of sabotage, such as breaking tools or outwitting overseers.
Sometimes, resistance became violent. Historians estimate that nearly 200 significant slave revolts took place in the first half of the 1800s. Terrified by the idea of a successful slave revolt, southerners passed harsher laws and controls regarding slavery. Enslaved people were forbidden to gather in groups unless an overseer was present. In addition, it became illegal to teach enslaved people to read.
The increasingly harsh conditions faced by slaves inspired some people in the North to work against slavery. Some northern abolitionists and free blacks organized a network known as the underground railroad to help slaves escape from the South. A secret network of “conductors” hid runaway slaves in farm wagons and on riverboats and then moved them to destinations in the North or in Canada. Using complex signals and hiding places, the underground railroad carried its passengers over hundreds of miles of dangerous terrain.

The Voices of Abolitionism By the early 1800s, a growing number of abolitionists began to speak out against slavery. One of the most influential abolitionists was Frederick Douglass. As a former slave with direct experience of the harsh conditions the enslaved endured in the South, Douglass became a powerful speaker at abolitionist meetings. In 1852, Douglass was invited to speak at an Independence Day celebration.
Fellow citizens, pardon me, and allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today? What have I or those I represent to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? . . . What, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.
—Frederick Douglass, speech at Rochester, 1852
Slavery Divides the Nation In cities across the Northeast and the Midwest, abolitionist societies sprang up, yet most Americans did not support the abolition of slavery. White workers in the North feared that free African Americans would take their jobs, and wealthy industrialists worried that the end of slavery would cut off the supply of southern cotton and reduce the demand for ships and shipyards.
Defenders of slavery maintained that slave labor was superior to the wage labor of the North. They argued that northern employers and laborers were inevitably at odds, since employers wanted workers to work more for less money while workers wanted to work less for more money.
Despite the interdependence of the northern and southern economies, the issue of slavery above all others increasingly divided Americans.

Reform in the Early 1800s
Abolitionism was part of a drive to reform American society in the early 1800s. This reform movement was partly created by the Second Great Awakening, a revival of religious feeling that led to an increase in participation in evangelical Protestant movements. This reform movement provided new opportunities for women. In the early 1800s, American women lacked many basic legal and economic rights. Education beyond grade school was almost unheard-of, and they rarely took part in public life.
Women Lead Reform Efforts Women, however, were welcomed by the emerging reform movements. They worked in the temperance movement, the abolition movement, and other reform movements. Sisters Angelina and Sarah Grimke spoke and wrote against slavery. Dorothea Dix campaigned to win better, more humane treatment for people with mental illness. Emma Willard established schools for women in Connecticut, Ohio, and New York. Soon, some of these reformers began to work to gain equality for women as well. Their efforts would lay the groundwork for women’s struggle for equal rights—especially the right to vote—over the next hundred years.
A
Women’s Rights Movement Emerges The industrialization of the 1820s and 1830s provided the first real economic opportunity for women outside the home in the nation’s history. Thousands of young
women who would have stayed in the family home instead went to work in mills and factories. This gave them a small degree of economic independence and a larger degree of social independence.
Although many women became leading reformers and many others entered the workforce, there had still been virtually no progress in women’s rights. As more women became involved in the abolitionist movement, they began to see their own social restrictions as being comparable to slavery. They began to call for increased rights of their own. Women's rights reformers began to publish their ideas in pamphlets and books.
The Seneca Falls Convention In 1848, Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, two prominent abolitionists, helped organize the Seneca Falls Convention. This meeting, the first of the women’s rights movement in the United States, attracted hundreds of men and women. One of the most illustrious attendees was Frederick Douglass.
The delegates to the convention adopted a Declaration of Sentiments, modeled after the language of the Declaration of Independence.

The Declaration called for greater educational opportunities for women, as well as for the right of women to control their own wages and property.
The convention inspired a generation of leaders who carried on the struggle. Among them was Susan B. Anthony, whose involvement in the temperance and abolition movements inspired her to work for greater rights for women as well. By the mid-1800s, women reformers had laid the foundation for a future in which equality seemed a real possibility. However, the most coveted goal of the women’s rights movement— suffrage—was not achieved until 1920.
B IDENTIFY MAIN IDEAS
What was the outcome of the Seneca Fall Convention?
The Nation Expands
By 1830, the United States had grown beyond its original territory along the Atlantic Coast to include the Louisiana Purchase and Florida. American expansionists coveted the Oregon Territory in the Northwest and the Mexican provinces of New Mexico, Texas, and California.
Manifest Destiny In an influential editorial, journalist John L. O’Sullivan expressed the ideals that motivated many American expansionists.
Connecting with Past Learnings
The American claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and . . . self-government entrusted to us.
L.
O’Sullivan, New York Morning News,December 27, 1845
The phrase Manifest Destiny soon became a rallying cry for expansionists. During the 1840s alone, nearly 20,000 Americans migrated to California, Oregon, and Utah along the major overland trails. The trails also became trade routes, carrying merchants and goods in both directions.
The Texas Revolution During the 1820s, farmers from the South had begun to settle in Texas, becoming Mexican citizens. By 1835, Texas was home to about 30,000 colonists from the United States known as Anglo-Texans. In 1835, Anglo-Texans rebelled against the Mexican government, and in 1836, Texas declared its independence and adopted a republican constitution. In response, Mexican forces attacked the Texans. Led by Sam Houston, Texan forces crushed the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto, forcing the Mexican general to sign a treaty recognizing Texan independence and conceding generous boundaries that stretched south and west to the Rio Grande. The government in Mexico City refused to honor the terms of the treaty, and a border war persisted between Texas and Mexico.
0.3 America in the Early 1800s
After achieving independence, Texas quickly asked to be annexed by the United States. President Jackson favored annexation, as did American expansionists from the South. However, northern representatives in Congress balked at adding another slave state, especially one so large and potentially powerful. Texas was not annexed until 1845.
War With Mexico In 1844, James K. Polk, a slaveholder and expansionist, was elected President. Polk favored the annexation of Texas, and he vowed to fight Britain if it did not give up its claims to the Oregon Territory. Despite his strong words, Polk compromised with the British, agreeing to split the Oregon Territory at the 49th parallel of latitude.
Polk took a harder line on the Texas question. He endorsed a Texan border claim that was still disputed by Mexico and sent troops to occupy the contested territory. After a Mexican patrol clashed with U.S. soldiers in May 1846, Polk asked for and received a declaration of war against Mexico.
Democrats, especially those from the South, were enthusiastically in favor of the war. Whigs suspected Polk of deliberately provoking the conflict in order to
annex New Mexico and California, which might then enter the Union as slave states.
A
Decisive Victory Expands U.S. Territory The war with Mexico was extremely one-sided. During the next year and a half, the United States won every major battle, and by September 1847, U.S. forces had captured the Mexican capital of Mexico City, forcing the Mexicans to sign the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo This treaty gave the United States possession of New Mexico and California for the price of $18 million and secured the Rio Grande as the southern boundary of Texas. The Mexican-American War, together with the annexation of Texas, increased the size of U.S. territory by a third.
The slavery debate was rekindled when California applied for statehood a year later. In 1849, the nation had an equal number of free and slave states—15 each— maintaining the sectional balance in the Senate. The admission of California would tip that balance in favor of the free states. Thus, the U.S. victory over Mexico ultimately contributed to the growing conflict between North and South.

Slavery and Western Expansion
During the Mexican-American War, the question of slavery in the West emerged as a major issue. To prevent the South from extending slavery into the western territories, in 1846 Pennsylvania congressman David Wilmot proposed an amendment, or proviso, to an appropriations bill. The Wilmot Proviso called for a ban on slavery in any territory that the United States gained from Mexico as a result of the war.
Southern leaders angrily denounced the proposal.
The amendment passed the northern-dominated House of
Representatives, but it was defeated in the Senate. Although it never became law, the Wilmot Proviso contributed to the increasing tension between the North and South over the slavery issue.
The Formation of the Free-Soil Party The Wilmot Proviso helped spur the rise of antislavery political parties. In 1848, northern opponents of slavery formed the Free-Soil Party. The Free-Soil Party wanted to prevent the expansion of slavery into the western territories. The party nominated former President Martin Van Buren as their presidential candidate in the election of 1848. Van Buren did not win, but he and other Free-Soil candidates garnered enough votes to show that the party s motto of “Free soil, Free speech, Free labor, and Free men” would not be silenced.

Another Compromise In 1850, California applied to enter the Union as a free state, threatening the balance of power between slave and free states in the Senate. To ease southern concerns, Congress debated and then passed the Compromise of 1850.
According to this measure, California was admitted as a free state, but in the other territory acquired from Mexico, voters would decide the slavery issue for themselves. This approach became known as popular sovereignty, an application of that founding principle enshrined in the Constitution. But by permitting slavery north of 36°30’N latitude, the Compromise of 1850 undid the Missouri Compromise.
The Compromise of 1850 included a Fugitive Slave Act. This law allowed officials to arrest any person accused of being a runaway slave, denied fugitives the right to a jury trial, and required all citizens to help capture runaway slaves. The Fugitive Slave Act outraged many northerners, who resented being legally forced to support the slave system.
Some northern states fought back by passing personal liberty laws. These laws nullified the Fugitive Slave Act, allowing the states to arrest slave catchers for kidnapping. Northern opponents of the law also mounted an intense resistance. In 1851, at Christiana, Pennsylvania, a small band of African Americans gathered to protect several runaways from southern slave catchers. Local white bystanders refused to help the slave-hunting party. Then, after the slave owner died in the scuffle, a white jury refused to convict the killers.
RECALL
Which piece of legislation kept the balance between free states and slave states? The Road to Disunion
Resentment against the Fugitive Slave Act spurred Harriet Beecher Stowe to write the novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin, a powerful condemnation of slavery. Stowe’s sympathetic main character, Uncle Tom, put a human face on slavery for readers who had never witnessed slavery firsthand. Uncle Tom’s Cabin sold 300,000 copies in its first year, increasing antislavery sentiment in the North. But it angered southerners, who argued that Stowe's book presented a false picture of slavery and the South.
Published in 1852, Uncle Tom’s Cabin was so influential that years later, when Stowe visited President Lincoln at the White House during the Civil War, Lincoln reportedly greeted the author by saying, “So you are the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war.”

Popular Sovereignty in Kansas and Nebraska In
1854, Congress again tried to settle the issue of slavery in the West. When Senator Stephen Douglas introduced a bill to establish a government for the Nebraska Territory, his proposal was defeated by southern senators who objected to allowing Nebraska to enter the Union as a free state. To accommodate southerners, Douglas rewrote the bill. After much debate, Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which divided the Nebraska Territory into Kansas and Nebraska. Voters in each territory would decide the issue of slavery by popular sovereignty. Many northerners complained that this plan allowed slavery in areas where it had been banned by the Missouri Compromise.
Soon, both proslavery and antislavery settlers were flocking to Kansas, each hoping to outnumber the other when the time came to vote on slavery. In 1855, proslavery supporters set up a territorial government at Shawnee Mission. Free-state settlers responded by establishing an antislavery government in Topeka. Kansas now had two governments—a formula for disaster.
“Bleeding Kansas” On May 21, 1856, southern proslavery forces attacked the free-state town of Lawrence, Kansas. They looted homes, burned down the hotel, and destroyed the presses of The Kansas

Free State newspaper. Swift retaliation came from New York abolitionist John Brown, who had moved his family to Kansas in pursuit of an opportunity to confront the slavery issue. A few days after the sack of Lawrence, Brown, along with his sons and a few friends, conducted a midnight raid on the proslavery settlement at nearby Pottawatomie Creek. During the raid, they brutally murdered five proslavery settlers. These killings led to even more violence. Throughout the fall of 1856, there was so much violence perpetrated by both sides that the territory became known as “Bleeding Kansas.” Finally, in 1861, Kansas entered the Union as a free state.
The Formation of the Republican Party Opposition to slavery led to the creation of the new Republican Party in 1854. Republicans included abolitionists, antislavery business leaders, and northerners who argued that the Fugitive Slave Act intruded into state politics. The Republican Party quickly became a powerful political force, winning 105 seats in the House of Representatives in the 1854 congressional elections.
The presidential election of 1856 pitted Democrat James Buchanan against John C. Fremont, the candidate of the new Republican Party. Buchanan, who promised that as President he would stop “the agitation of the slavery issue,” was supported by a large majority of southerners. He won the election, but Fremont, who opposed the spread of slavery, made a strong showing. Fremont won one third of the popular vote and 11 northern states.
A
Controversial Supreme Court Ruling In 1857, a controversial Supreme Court ruling widened the growing divisions over slavery. The ruling concerned the case of Dred Scott, an enslaved African American from Missouri who had sued for his freedom in 1846. Scott’s lawyers argued that he should be considered free because he had lived with his master in the free state of Illinois between 1834 and 1838. After a series of appeals, Scott’s case reached the Supreme Court. In Dred Scott v. Sandford, the Court ruled against Scott. But the Court’s sweeping ruling went far beyond the particulars of Scott’s case. The Court declared that African Americans were not citizens and, therefore, were not entitled to sue in the courts.
Chief Justice Roger Taney stated that since African Americans had not been part of the political community when the Constitution was adopted, they did not have the same rights as groups that were included in that community. He wrote that slaves “are not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word ‘citizens' in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which
Connecting with Past Learnings 32	0.4 The Union in Crisis
that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States.”
The Court went beyond the question of slaves’ citizenship and stated that Congress did not have the power to ban slavery in any territory. Taney pointed out that such a ban deprived citizens of their property without due process of law, a violation of the Fifth Amendment. This meant that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, as would be any future attempt by Congress to decide the slavery status of a new state.
Reaction to the Dred Scott Decision The
language of the Court’s ruling seemed to indicate that the Constitution itself settled the issue: slaves were not citizens, and states had the right to decide on the issue of slavery themselves. However, the Dred Scott decision only intensified the slavery debate rather than helping settle it, and public reactions drove the North and the South further apart than ever. Southerners were delighted with the Court's ruling while northerners viewed it with alarm. Some abolitionists, however, felt that such an unfair decision would bring the crisis to a head more quickly, actually hastening the end of slavery. As leading black abolitionist Frederick Douglass said, “This very attempt to blot out forever the hopes of an enslaved people may be one necessary link in the chain of events preparatory to the complete overthrow of the whole slave system.”

The Lincoln-Douglas
Debates
The 1858 Senate race in Illinois crystallized the slavery issue for many Americans. Republican Abraham Lincoln challenged Senator Stephen Douglas, a Democrat and the architect of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, to a series of debates.
The Lincoln-Douglas Debates Both Lincoln and Douglas were excellent speakers whose political differences were underscored by their contrasting physical appearances. Lincoln, tall and thin, had a reputation for integrity that had earned him the nickname “Honest Abe.” Senator Douglas, short and stout, with a deep voice, was known as the Little Giant.”

in the House of Representatives and then returned to his law practice in Springfield. His opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act and popular sovereignty inspired Lincoln to resume his political career.
The politically ambitious Douglas believed that popular sovereignty was the implied intent of the Constitution. But many questioned his motives, saying that Douglas favored popular sovereignty in order to gain southern support for a future presidential run. Others claimed that Douglas was eager for Kansas and Nebraska to achieve statehood, because railroad lines built through the new states would benefit Chicago, the largest city in Douglas’s state, by making it a hub for economic development of the West.
Thousands of Americans attended the Lincoln-Douglas debates and listened intently as the candidates presented opposing views of slavery and its role in America. Lincoln did not call for the immediate abolition of slavery or for political equality for African Americans. Still, he argued:
There is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, . < . In the right to eat the
bread, without leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.
--Abraham Lincoln, debate at Ottawa, Illinois, 1858
Douglas, meanwhile, promoted popular sovereignty as the solution to regional tensions. “This Union was established on the right of each State to do as it pleased on the question of slavery, and every other question,” he insisted. Douglas won the Senate race, but the debates, covered by newspapers throughout the country, brought Lincoln national attention.
Trying to Spark a Slave Rebellion While Lincoln and Douglas used the political process to address the slavery issue, radical abolitionist John Brown concluded that using violence was the best way to defeat slavery. In the fall of 1859, Brown and a small band of followers seized the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia). He hoped to inspire and arm local slaves for an uprising that would spread into a general slave rebellion, eventually ending slavery. But no slaves joined Brown’s revolt. Instead, troops under the command of Colonel Robert E. Lee retook the arsenal, wounding Brown and killing or capturing most of his men.

Put on trial for treason and murder, Brown proclaimed his willingness to “mingle my blood with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments.” After a brief trial, the court found him guilty and sentenced him to death by hanging.
Brown’s defense of his actions and the dignified calm with which he faced execution made him a heroic martyr to the antislavery cause. Although most northerners had condemned the raid, Brown’s death touched many, increasing northern opposition to slavery. But northern sympathy for a man who had tried to lead a slave revolt further inflamed southern anger and suspicion.

The Union Collapses
Despite repeated attempts at compromise, disagreement between the North and the South over the issue of slavery continued to deepen. With ill will running so deep, the upcoming elections posed a serious dilemma. It was hard to imagine that either northerners or southerners would accept a President from the other region. Could the Union survive?
A
Divide Among Democrats The Democrats held their nominating convention in Charleston, South Carolina. The southern Democrats called for a platform supporting federal protection of slavery in the territories. The northern Democrats supported the doctrine of popular sovereignty. When the northern forces prevailed, the delegates from eight southern states walked out and formed a separate convention.
The Democrats were now split into two parties. The northern Democrats nominated Stephen A. Douglas. The southern Democrats nominated the Vice President, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. Breckinridge was committed to expanding slavery into the territories.
In the meantime, the few remaining Whigs teamed up with the Know-Nothings to create the Constitutional Union Party. They nominated John Bell of Tennessee, and their platform condemned sectional parties and promised to uphold "the Constitution of the country, the Union of the States and the enforcement of the laws.”

principle of federalism. They asserted the right of each state to control its own institutions and stipulated that there should be no interference with slavery in the states where it already existed. At their convention held in Chicago, Abraham Lincoln—with his great debating skills, his moderate views, and his reputation for integrity—was chosen as the candidate to carry the Republican party to victory.
Lincoln’s Victory Benefiting from the fracturing among the other political parties, Lincoln won the election handily but did not receive a single southern electoral vote. In fact, he was not even on the ballot in most southern states.
Southerners were outraged at Lincoln’s election. As they had during the Nullification Crisis of Andrew Jackson’s presidency, many believed that the Constitution gave the states sovereign power over their own affairs, including the decision to leave the Union if the federal government wasn’t protecting their rights. Lincoln and most northerners disagreed.
The First Wave of Secession As soon as Lincoln’s election was confirmed, the South Carolina legislature summoned a state convention.
Meeting in Charleston on December 20, 1860, the convention declared that “the union now subsisting between South Carolina and the other States, under
the name of the ‘United States of America,’ is hereby dissolved.’’ They cited as their reason for seceding the election of a President “whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.”
The Southern States Band Together In the next few weeks, six other states of the Deep South seceded from the Union. In February 1861, the seven seceding states established the Confederate States of America
They then proceeded to frame a constitution for the new government. The Confederate constitution closely resembled the U.S. Constitution. However, it stressed the independence of each state and implied that states had the right to secede. It also guaranteed the protection of slavery.
Not all southerners backed the Confederacy. Some large planters with economic ties to the North still hoped for a compromise. So, too, did many small farmers with no vested interest in slavery. To gain the loyalty of such citizens, the Confederacy chose former Mississippi senator Jefferson Davis as their president. Davis had supported the Compromise of 1850, but he had also insisted that the South should be left alone to manage its own culture and institutions— including slavery.

Lincoln Challenges Secession Lincoln was sworn in as President on March 4,1861. In his inaugural address, he took a firm but conciliatory tone toward the South. “I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists,” he began. But he didintend to preserve the Union. “No state, upon its own mere action, can lawfully get out of the Union,” he said. Still, he would avoid violence. There would be no war, he pledged, unless the South started it. He concluded with an appeal to the South to live in peace.

touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.
—Abraham Lincoln, March 4, 1861
Lincoln Makes the First of Many Difficult Decisions When the southern states seceded, they seized the federal forts and arsenals within their borders. Only four forts remained in Union hands. The most important of these was Fort Sumter, which guarded the harbor at Charleston, South Carolina. In Januaryl861, President Buchanan tried to send troops and supplies to the fort, but the unarmed supply ship sailed away when Confederate guns fired on it. Upon taking office, Lincoln had to decide whether to take the risk required to hold on to these forts or yield to Confederate demands that they be surrendered.
By April, the troops at the fort desperately needed food and supplies. Lincoln, who still hoped to bring back the South without bloodshed, faced a dilemma. Should he try to resupply the fort? Or should he let the Confederates take it? Lincoln struggled to make a decision. During his inaugural address, he had promised southerners that “the government will not assail you.” But as President, he was sworn to defend the property of the United States. A wrong move could touch off a war. At last, trying to steer a middle course, Lincoln notified South Carolina that he was sending supplies—food only, no arms—to the fort.
The Surrender of Fort Sumter South Carolinians were suspicious of Lincoln's motives and ordered the Fort Sumter garrison to surrender to the Confederacy. When the Union troops refused, the Confederates fired on the fort. The Union troops eventually ran out of ammunition, forcing the commander to surrender.
President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to fight against the Confederacy. The South responded just as strongly. As in the North, the South raised troops quickly and struggled to equip and train them before sending them into battle. Both sides predicted a short skirmish, with victory only a few days or months away. These predictions were unfounded. Americans faced years of terrible suffering before the fighting that had begun at Fort Sumter would finally end.
Northerners responded to the attack on Fort Sumter with shock and anger. A few days later, on April 15, President Lincoln declared that “insurrection existed. The Civil War had officially begun. The slave states that had remained in the Union now had to choose sides. Within two months of the surrender at Fort Sumter, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina
joined the Confederacy. Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri remained in the Union.

At stake was the future not only of slavery but of the Union itself.

supported a wide range of manufacturing. Replenished by a continuing influx of immigrant workers from Europe, northern factories were able to increase production of the supplies needed to wage war: ammunition, arms, uniforms, medical supplies, food, ships, and railroad cars.
Across the North, the railroad network was well developed, as were systems for farming, mining, and processing raw materials. Banking, insurance, and financing industries were also clustered in the urbanized North. The federal government had a well-organized navy. By the end of 1861, the Union navy had outfitted and launched more than 250 warships and was constructing dozens more. Naval superiority allowed the Union to blockade the South’s few vital ports.
Advantages Enjoyed by the South Given such advantages, Northerners anticipated a quick victory. But the South had distinct disadvantages as well. When the war began, the Union army consisted of only about 16,000 men. Although the South had an even smaller army, its troops at the outset of the war were more highly motivated, and they were led by some of the nation’s finest and most experienced officers. The experienced and inspiring Robert E. Lee had originally been

offered command of Union forces but chose instead to remain loyal to his native Virginia. Throughout the war, General Lee provided the Confederacy with expert military leadership. The North struggled for much of the war to find a commander of comparable skill and daring.
Perhaps the biggest advantage the Confederates enjoyed was the fact that they were fighting a defensive war on their own territory. All they had to do was outlast the Union to achieve victory. The Union had the much more difficult task of conquering the South. They had to do this fighting in unfamiliar territory against an enemy that had a lot more at stake.
Early Strategies Each side had a clear military goal. The Confederacy simply had to survive, keeping their armies in the field until northerners became tired of fighting. The Union, however, had to crush and conquer the Confederacy.
The North adopted a strategy designed to starve the South into submission. It was called the Anaconda Plan after the snake that slowly squeezes its prey to death. The plan involved seizing the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico so that the South could not send or receive shipments. By the middle of 1862, with victories in Mississippi and New Orleans, the North had captured the Mississippi Valley. Union soldiers also seized the strategic railroad juncture at Chattanooga, Tennessee, and scored victories in battles as far west as New Mexico.
Stalemate On the East Coast, though both sides won battles, neither side could gain a clear and decisive victory in the early part of the war. Union armies hoped to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. But troops outside Washington, D.C., could not seem to make progress toward that goal. Confederate troops were equally unsuccessful in pushing the war north toward Washington, D.C.
Thanks to efficient new weapons—especially more accurate rifles and deadlier bullets—a single day’s battle might produce more than 10,000 casualties. This new lethal warfare stung the public consciousness. Battle sites such as Bull Run (July 1861), Shiloh (April 1862), Antietam (September 1862), and Fredericksburg (December 1862) are still remembered as the scenes of some of the deadliest encounters in American history. Limited medical care ensured that many of the wounded died of infection rather than of the wounds themselves.

The Emancipation
Proclamation
Early in the war, President Lincoln insisted that he did not have the authority to end slavery. In his public statements, he emphasized the fact that his chief goal was to preserve the Union, not end slavery. Although Lincoln personally opposed slavery, he did not want to lose the support of the four slave states—Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri—that had remained loyal to the Union.
However, by the autumn of 1862, with the military situation beginning to look better for the Union, Lincoln decided to take a first step toward the end of slavery. In January 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation. This presidential decree declared that ‘‘all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.”
The Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to the loyal slave states or to those areas of the South already under Union control. As a result, it did not immediately free a single slave. Nevertheless, it was an important turning point because it encouraged enslaved African Americans in the South to run away to Union army encampments and to aid the Union cause. It also symbolically redefined the war as being ‘‘about slavery.”
African Americans had always believed that the war should be about slavery, and they had volunteered to fight as soon as the war began. But at first they were turned away and told "this is a white man’s war.” After the Emancipation Proclamation, however, the Union began to actively recruit both free blacks from the North and newly freed African Americans from the South. Eventually, some 180,000 African American men served in the Union Army.
H DESCRIBE
What were the effects of the Emancipation Proclamation?
War Affects Daily Life
The Civil War not only engaged the nation in a prolonged and violent conflict, it also transformed the nation’s civilian life. In the North, mines and factories stepped up production to supply military needs such as ships, railroads, weapons, uniforms, provisions, and fuel. To pay for the war, the federal government raised tariffs, imposed income taxes, and printed money. Congress also encouraged western settlement and offered free land to soldiers who would give two years of military service. Such land grants sparked agricultural growth, which helped feed Union troops.
» The South had claimed that the war was being fought over states’ rights. The Emancipation Proclamation focused the war on the ending of slavery.
» African Americans celebrated the Emancipation Proclamation. However, freedom for African Americans in the South would only become a reality if the Union defeated the Confederacy.

» During the Civil War, women helped by caring for the sick and wounded. They were so successful that nursing became an accepted profession for women following the war.
The Union Takes Extraordinary Measures As
the war dragged on, the Union army experienced a shortage of volunteers. When Congress passed a draft law in 1863, requiring all able-bodied men between the ages of 20 and 45 to serve in the military if called, riots broke out in several northern cities. The most severe rioting took place in New York City in July 1863. White workers attacked free African Americans as well as wealthy New Yorkers who were able to pay a fee to avoid military service.
Some Northerners opposed Lincoln’s conduct of the war and demanded immediate peace. To deal with dissent, Lincoln suspended the Constitutional right of habeas corpus which guarantees that no one can be held in prison without specific charges being filed. Union troops arrested many people suspected of disloyalty. Although Lincoln felt such measures were necessary to preserve the Union, others criticized his actions as unconstitutional.
Hardships in the South Almost all of the battles took place on southern soil. The fighting destroyed some of the South’s traditional strengths, such as large-scale agriculture, and stripped the Confederacy of the resources it might have used to rebuild. By 1863, the Union plan to starve the South into submission seemed to be on the verge of succeeding.
The South seized every opportunity to ease its economic problems. As Lincoln had done, Confederate President Jefferson Davis authorized the Confederacy to issue paper money, backed only by the government’s promise to pay.
Doubts about the true value of Confederate money led to severe inflation, or price increases. The combination of rising prices and food shortages sparked food riots in some parts of the South.
A
Time of Social Change On both sides, the war gave women new tasks. Women set up field hospitals and nursed wounded soldiers. Many Confederate women took to the fields to harvest crops. White and black teachers from the North went south to become teachers of newly freed slaves. Churches in both the North and South supported the war effort. Confederate soldiers often held revival meetings near the field of battle. One Virginia chaplain claimed that many southern men “have come out of this war Christian soldiers.”

The Union Prevails
In the summer of 1863, the Union succeeded in capturing Vicksburg, Mississippi. Advancing from the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River, Union General Ulysses S. Grant scored five victories in three weeks, ending with the surrender of 30,000 Confederate troops. The Anaconda Plan had achieved one of its major goals: Confederate territory was split apart.
The Battle of Gettysburg Meanwhile, in the East, General Lee marched into Pennsylvania. He hoped to win a surprise victory, then swing south to Washington, D.C. But in July 1863, Union troops defeated Lee at the town of Gettysburg. The Battle of Gettysburg destroyed one third of Lee’s forces and marked the last major Confederate attempt to invade the North.
A few months later, the President went to Gettysburg to help dedicate a battle cemetery by giving a speech that would come to be known as the Gettysburg Address. In the speech, Lincoln referred to the Declaration of Independence and its founding principles of liberty and equality. He applied these principles to the current struggle and asked that the Union remember the men who died at Gettysburg as they fought for a “new birth of freedom.”
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

The Confederacy Surrenders In the fall of 1864, Union General William T. Sherman led more than 60,000 troops on a 400-mile march of destruction through Georgia and South Carolina. The march was part of a strategy of total war, which targeted not only troops but all of the resources needed to feed, clothe, and support an army. Sherman’s troops burned crops in fields, tore up railroad tracks, and destroyed homes, plantations, and public buildings.
By spring 1865, the Confederacy was exhausted. Union troops captured the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. On April 9, in the small Virginia town of Appomattox Court House, Lee surrendered to Grant.

than one third of northern and southern soldiers were killed or disabled.
The southern landscape and economy were in shambles. Millions of dislocated southerners drifted north in search of new lives in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, or other points north. Others joined the increasing migration to the West, becoming cowboys or farmers. The war ended an era in American political life. Although debates about states’ rights and federal authority continue to this day, never again would states attempt to secede. More and more, Americans would see themselves not just as citizens of a state, but of a united nation.
Full Emancipation The Emancipation Proclamation had only applied to the states that left the Union, and it only freed slaves in Confederate territory that the Union was able to control. With the final Union victory, Congress and the President were ready to abolish slavery throughout the nation. Even before the Civil War ended, Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment, making slavery unconstitutional. However, this amendment had to be ratified by three fourths of the states to go into effect. This process took until December 1865, over six months after the fighting ended. The southern states that had seceded were now

For African Americans in the South, emancipation promised them new opportunities, including a chance to work for wages and to control their own lives. Some joined the migration to the North and West while others remained in the South, hoping to work as freedmen the land they had worked as slaves. The Thirteenth Amendment was a victory for the abolitionist movement and a milestone in the development of the civil rights movement in the nineteenth century. It further applied the founding principles of equality and liberty underlying our nation. But the freedmen and other African Americans had a long struggle ahead of them for full equality.

The Reconstruction Era
The Nation Moves Toward
Reunion
Conflict Over Reconstruction Policy Even before the war ended, Union politicians began debating the policies that would guide Reconstruction. For President Lincoln, the major goal of Reconstruction was reunifying the nation and healing the wounds of the war. As he said in his Second Inaugural Address, “Let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.”
Although Lincoln was seen by many Republicans as a heroic leader who had prevented the Union from coming apart, not all Republicans had the same ideas about Reconstruction as the President. Some congressional leaders wanted to punish the South. They favored a harsh Reconstruction plan designed to make the South pay for the devastation of the war. The next several years would bring sharp differences between congressional leaders bent on imposing their will on the South and two Presidents who wanted to make Reconstruction as painless as possible.

Aid for Emancipated Slaves Shortly before the war ended, Lincoln and Congress did agree on the creation of the Freedmen’s Bureau, a federal agency designed to aid freed slaves and relieve the South’s immediate needs. The black and white agents of the Bureau delivered food and healthcare and began to develop a public school system for both black and white southerners. It also helped to reunite families separated by slavery and to negotiate fair labor contracts between formerly enslaved African Americans and white landowners.
A
New President Meanwhile, debate over Reconstruction continued. Before he could gain support for his moderate plan of Reconstruction, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865. As the nation mourned, Vice President Andrew Johnson became President. As a southerner who had remained loyal to the Union, Johnson was similarly in favor of a relatively forgiving approach to Reconstruction. He put forth a plan that restored political power to southerners if they swore allegiance to the United States and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. In return, the new President promised to uphold states’ rights, with the laws of individual states taking precedence over federal regulations.
Many members of Congress disapproved of this plan. Arguing that southerners had caused the war,
these Radical Republicans favored punishment and a harsh reorganization for the South. Radicals also advocated full citizens’ rights for African Americans and wanted states’ authority to be subordinate to federal power. When southern legislatures passed laws to restrict the activities of African Americans, Radicals became even more determined to impose a harsh Reconstruction policy on the South.
Johnson and the Radicals in Congress clashed repeatedly. In 1868, Congress voted to impeach Johnson. Johnson won his impeachment trial by a single vote in the Senate, but this victory did him little good. By that time he had lost control of Reconstruction. A few months later, Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant was elected President.

southern states were required to grant voting rights to African American men.
Perhaps most important, Radicals passed the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed full citizenship status and rights to every man born in the United States, including African Americans. The Bill of Rights would now apply to all Americans no matter their race. The Amendment was ratified in 1868.
Voting Rights for African Americans Under Radical Reconstruction, many white southerners were not eligible to vote or chose to stay away from the polls. African American men, on the other hand, eagerly signed up to exercise their new right of suffrage. Most new African American voters voted for the Republican Party. Thus, by 1868, many southern states had black elected officials and were dominated by a strong Republican Party. South Carolina—the first state to secede—became the only state where, for a short time, an African American majority dominated the legislature.
At this time, no laws guaranteed the vote to African Americans in the North. To remedy this imbalance, Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment, which guaranteed that no male citizen could be denied the right to vote on the basis of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” It was ratified in 1870.
New Lives for Freedmen In the South, formerly enslaved African Americans worked to carve out new lives. Some struck out for the North or West. But many more stayed in the South. They assembled their scattered families and built strong churches that also served as community centers, employment agencies, schoolhouses, and—in later years—centers of protest.
For the first time, many African American men and women could legalize and celebrate their marriages, set up housekeeping with their families and make choices about where they would reside. Some freed women could leave field labor and care for their families at home.
Freed people also realized the importance of learning to read and do basic math. So the Freedmen’s Bureau schools quickly filled. By 1869, as many as 300,000 African American adults and children were acquiring basic literacy.
Terrorism in the Reconstruction South Even though the South remained under military occupation, organized secret societies, such as the Ku Klux Kian, used terror and violence against African Americans and their white supporters. A federal grand jury concluded that the chief goal of the Kian attacks was to keep African Americans from voting.

The Radical Republicans in Congress responded by passing laws making it a crime to use violence to prevent people from voting. Although Kian activities lessened somewhat, the threat of violence persisted, keeping many southern African Americans from the polls.

Analyze Political Cartoons How does this cartoon show southerners’ feelings about northern rule during Reconstruction?
Reconstruction Comes to an End
After a decade of Reconstruction, northerners began to lose interest in remaking the South. They turned their focus on other social, political, and economic issues. In the fall of 1873, a series of bank failures sparked a severe economic downturn. At the same time, a series of political scandals in the Grant administration damaged the Radical Republicans. Under these circumstances, Reconstruction began to fade. Gradually and quietly, beginning in 1871, troops were withdrawn from the South. In 1872, Congress dissolved the Freedmen’s Bureau.
The Return of Southern Democrats Meanwhile, southern white Democrats patiently devised a strategy for regaining political control of the South. They argued that Republican programs for public schools and road building resulted in higher taxes. Most white southerners shunned anyone who supported Radical Republicans. Southern Democrats grasped every opportunity to paint African American politicians as corrupt and incompetent. At the same time, the everpresent threat of violence kept African Americans from voting, thus depriving the Republicans of a large segment of their political base.
One by one, southern states reinstated wealthy white southern men as governors and sent former Confederate leaders to the U.S. Congress. In the 1874 elections, the Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives. By 1876, only South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana—three states with large African American populations—still had Reconstruction governments and remained under military occupation.
The Disputed Election of 1876 The presidential election of 1876 brought a final end to Reconstruction. Democratic candidate Samuel Tilden won more popular votes than Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes, but the electoral vote was in dispute. The disputed votes were those of Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana, the three southern states still controlled by Republican Reconstruction governments.
In an informal compromise intended to end the dispute, a congressional committee declared the Republican candidate the winner. In return, Hayes promised to pull all remaining federal troops from the South. In effect, the election of Hayes ended Reconstruction.

answers. All will agree, however, that some things were changed forever by those dozen years during which the victorious North tried to remake the vanquished South.
Certainly, Radical Reconstruction failed in most of its aims. It had violated the Constitution in several ways for years at a time. By the end of the century, the political rights of African Americans in the South had eroded. Southern states slowly took away the voting rights of African Americans. All of the former Confederate states created systems of de jure segregation that made African Americans second-class citizens. Support for African Americans was not abundant in the North either.
Still, Reconstruction did mark the beginning of the physical and economic rebuilding of the South. Despite continuing conflicts and resentments, the nation was permanently reunited. And the constitutional amendments passed during Reconstruction, especially the Fourteenth Amendment, would eventually form the basis for a revived civil rights movement that sought political equality for all citizens in the twentieth century.
H DEFINE

African Americans in the Late 1800s
After Reconstruction ended, many white politicians in the North and South turned their attention from racial issues, allowing racist laws and segregation to spread in the South, and, to a lesser extent, in the North. This turn away from equality for all had a lasting impact on society in the United States.
During the Gilded Age (1877 to 1900), southern state governments enacted various measures intended to disenfranchise African Americans and enacted Jim Crow laws to keep blacks and whites apart as much as possible.
Methods of Restricting Voting Rights The
Fifteenth Amendment prohibited state governments from denying someone the right to vote because of "race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” After Reconstruction, southern states got around this amendment by passing a number of other restrictive measures. They enacted a poll tax requiring voters to pay a tax to vote. Poor African Americans could scarcely afford such a fee. The states also required voters to pass literacy tests and “understanding” tests. Because African Americans had been exploited economically and denied an education, these restrictions disqualified many of them as voters.

Southern states got around the Fifteenth Amendment’s restriction on the use of “previous condition of servitude” with grandfather clauses that allowed a person to vote as long as his ancestors had voted prior to 1866. Some southern states also established all-white primaries, meaning only whites had a voice in selecting who got to run in general elections. In addition, whites resorted to violence to keep African Americans from participating in the political process.
As a result of these actions, throughout the Deep South, black participation in politics fell dramatically. In Louisiana, for example, the number of blacks registered to vote plummeted from 130,000 in 1894 to just over 1,300 in 1904.
Similarly, in northern states, including those that had civil rights laws that outlawed legal segregation, black migrants found many examples of de facto segregation limiting where they could live, work, and socialize.
During the 1870s, the Supreme Court issued rulings that accepted many of these methods of making African Americans into second-class citizens. In Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Jim Crow laws. It did so by arguing that as long as states maintained “separate but equal” facilities, they did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Yet, in reality, separate facilities were rarely equal.
African Americans Oppose Injustice Even during the darkest days of Jim Crow, African Americans refused to accept this inferior legal and social status. They established black newspapers, women’s clubs, fraternal organizations, schools and colleges, and political associations with the goal of securing their freedom. They did not always agree on the best strategies for achieving their goals, but they were united in their determination to “never turn back” until they had achieved equality.
One of the most famous black leaders of the late-nineteenth century was Booker T. Washington. Born a slave in 1856, Washington argued that African Americans needed to accommodate themselves to segregation, meaning they should not focus their energies on seeking to overturn Jim Crow. Instead, he called for blacks to “pull themselves up from their own bootstraps” by building up their economic resources and establishing their reputations as hardworking and honest citizens.
Washington’s ideas about accommodation were opposed by W.E.B. Du Bois, a man who by many measures was a living example of Washington’s hopes. Du Bois earned his Ph.D. from Harvard University in
Connecting with Past Learnings 50	0.6 The Reconstruction Era
1896, and he lived in a relatively tolerant community. Du Bois, however, criticized Washington’s willingness to accommodate southern whites. Echoing the spirit of the abolitionists, he argued that blacks should demand full and immediate equality and not limit themselves to vocational education. The dispute between gradual progress and radicalism that characterized the Washington-Du Bois debate would define the civil rights movement throughout much of its history.
One African American woman who fought for justice was Ida B. Wells. Born into slavery in 1862, Wells moved to Memphis, Tennessee, as a young adult. There she worked as a schoolteacher and became active in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Wells bought a local newspaper, renamed it Free Speech, and wrote numerous articles that condemned the mistreatment of blacks.
The contributions of leaders like Wells, Washington, and Du Bois, as well as the organizations they founded, would help direct the struggle for equality for African Americans as the United States entered a new era following the Civil War.

The general principles which are the groundwork of modern constitutions— principles which were imperfectly known in Europe, and not completely triumphant even in Great Britain, in the seventeenth century— were all recognized and determined by the laws of New England: the intervention of the people in public affairs, the free voting of taxes, the responsibility of authorities, personal liberty, and trial by jury, were all positively established without discussion. From these fruitful principles consequences have been derived and applications have been made such as no nation in Europe has yet ventured to attempt.

Thomas Edison, one of history’s most prolific inventors, poses with one of his many creations. By the age of 22, Edison had already produced his first major invention, a machine to report stock prices.
The Industrial Revolution began in the British textile industry in the 1700s. Within a few decades, it spread to other European countries and the new country of the United States, which had the greatest number of resources to expand the revolution. The first Industrial Revolution was marked by the introduction of steam power and the factory system. Coal and iron became key resources. Around the 1850s, the Industrial Revolution entered a new phase, dominated by steel, oil, and a major new power source—electricity. These new energy sources significantly improved the standard of living throughout the country. This second Industrial Revolution also had a distinctly American character.

American Industry Grows
The Civil War challenged industries to make goods more quickly and efficiently, especially in the North, which already had an industrial base. Using new tools and methods, factories stepped up production of guns, ammunition, medical supplies, and uniforms. The food industry developed ways to process foods so they could be shipped long distances. Railroads expanded, and more efficient methods of creating power were developed. Meanwhile, the government encouraged immigration to meet the increasing demand for labor in the nation's factories.
Natural Resources Fuel Economic Development The country’s growth was fueled, in part, by its vast supply of natural resources. Numerous coal mines along the eastern seaboard provided fuel to power steam locomotives and factories. Thick forests were cut into lumber for construction.
Iron ore was converted into iron and later into steel to build bridges, railroad tracks, and machines. The nation’s many navigable riverways transported these and other resources to cities and factories.

Many technological innovations expanded the country’s natural resource base even further. In 1859, Edwin Drake used a steam engine to drill the world’s first successful oil well near Titusville, Pennsylvania. Before Drake’s innovation, oil, which was used for light and fuel, was mainly obtained from boiling down whale blubber. But whale hunting was time-consuming, and whales were becoming scarce. Drilled oil was relatively cheap to produce and easy to transport. The oil industry grew quickly after 1859 and encouraged the growth of related industries such as kerosene and gasoline.
Another technological innovation of the 1850s made it easier to process iron ore into steel. Steel production soon skyrocketed as boatloads of iron ore moved across the Great Lakes from cities in Minnesota to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and other cities that became steelmaking centers. The steel rails produced by these new steel-making cities encouraged economic development by allowing railroads to bring distant natural resources to eastern cities and factories.
The Workforce Grows Population changes also promoted the growth of industry. After the Civil War, large numbers of Europeans, and some Asians, immigrated to the United States. They were pushed from their homelands by factors such as political upheaval, religious discrimination, and crop failures.
In 1881 alone, nearly three quarters of a million immigrants arrived in America. That number climbed steadily, reaching almost one million per year by 1905.
Immigrants were willing to work for low wages because competition for jobs was fierce. And they were prepared to move frequently in pursuit of economic opportunity. All of these factors meant that industries had a huge, and willing, workforce to fuel growth. The potential workforce grew even larger in the 1890s, when droughts and competition from foreign farmers drove American farmers in large numbers to seek jobs in the cities.
Free Enterprise Encourages the Rise of Entrepreneurship In 1868, Horatio Alger published his first novel, Ragged Dick or Street Life in New York. This wildly successful novel told the story of a poor boy who rose to wealth and fame by working hard. Alger's novels stressed the possibility that anyone could vault from poverty and obscurity to wealth and fame.
In this excerpt, he describes how Ragged Dick starts his climb to success.
Ten dollars a week was to him a fortune. . . . Indeed, he would have been glad, only the day before, to get a place at three dollars a week. . . . Then

he was to be advanced if he deserved it. It was indeed a bright prospect for a boy who, only a year before, could neither read nor write. . . . Dick’s great ambition to “grow up ‘spectable’” seemed likely to be accomplished after all.
—Horatio Alger, 1888
The “rags to riches” idea depended on the system of capitalism, in which individuals own most businesses.
The heroes of this system were entrepreneurs, or people who build and manage businesses or enterprises in order to make a profit. Entrepreneurs invest time, money, or both in a product or service, often risking their own livelihoods on the chance of success.
The rise of entrepreneurship fueled industrialization and economic growth in the late 1800s. Entrepreneurs thrived under the idea of free enterprise, or the freedom to run a business for profit with minimal regulation beyond what is necessary to protect the public interest. Entrepreneurs competed among themselves for consumers’ dollars. If one business priced a certain product too high, consumers might buy

a similar product from a competitor. So entrepreneurs found innovative ways to increase efficiency, cut costs, and lower prices, which enabled them to compete and survive in the free enterprise system. The factories, railroads, and mines they established created jobs and also attracted foreign investment.
Laissez-Faire Policies Encourage Growth The government encouraged laissez-faire policies, which allowed businesses to operate under minimal government regulation. Without government regulation, workplace conditions were sometimes challenging. However, laissez-faire policies, along with a strong legal system that enforced private property rights, provided the predictability and security that businesses and industries desired and encouraged investment and growth. These factors created an economic environment in which entrepreneurs could flourish.
To promote the buying of American goods, Congress enacted protective tariffs, or taxes that made imported goods cost more than those made in the United States. The government also gave innovative railroad builders millions of acres of land in return for their promise to quickly link the East and West coasts.

Innovation Drives
Economic Development
Fueled by entrepreneurship, competition, and the free enterprise system, the drive for innovation and efficiency seemed to touch every sphere of life in the United States by the late 1800s. The number of patents increased rapidly during this time. A patent is a grant by the federal government giving an inventor the exclusive right to develop, use, and sell an invention for a set period of time. Business leaders invested heavily in these new scientific discoveries and innovations, hoping to create new industries and expand old ones. Eager consumers welcomed new inventions to the market, helping to spur the nation’s economic development.
Electricity Improves Standards of Living With support from wealthy industrialists like J.P. Morgan, inventor Thomas Edison established a research laboratory at Menlo Park, New Jersey in 1876. Edison,

a creative genius who had only a few months of formal education, would receive more than 1,000 patents for new inventions and scientific discoveries. In 1880, for example, with the goal of developing affordable lighting for homes, Edison and his team invented the light bulb, experimenting with thousands of different types of materials to find one that worked. Within a few years, they had also developed plans for central power plants to light entire sections of cities. Other inventors later improved upon Edison’s work, and other applications for electricity quickly improved the standard of living throughout the country. George Westinghouse, for example, developed technology to send electricity over long distances. Electricity lit city streets and powered homes and factories, extending the number of hours in the day when Americans could work and play.
Innovation in Communications In 1844, inventor Samuel Morse perfected telegraph technology, or the process of sending messages over wire. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone. The two inventions attracted investors. Within a few years, 148 telephone companies had strung more than 34,000 miles of wire, and long-distance lines linked several cities in the Northeast and Midwest. By 1900, there were more than one million telephones in the United States, and more than 100,000 miles of telegraph
wire linked users across the land. In 1896, Guglielmo Marconi invented the wireless telegraph. Innovative entrepreneurs later built on Marconi’s achievement and developed the radio. All of these inventions improved communication between Americans. Instead of waiting days for a letter to arrive, Americans could receive telegraphs in a matter of minutes or hear loved ones' voices immediately on the telephone. Improved communication also meant that news of public events spread quickly
Steel, Innovation, and Economic Development In
the 1850s in England, a man named Henry Bessemer developed a process for purifying iron to make strong, but lightweight, steel. American industries quickly adopted the Bessemer process, and by 1890 the United States was outproducing British steel manufacturers. Strong steel made possible a host of innovations, including skyscrapers and the elevators to service them. One of its most dramatic uses was in the construction of suspension bridges, bridges in which the roadway is suspended by steel cables. The first suspension bridge was the Brooklyn Bridge, spanning the East River in New York City. Completed in 1883, it was at the time of its construction the longest bridge in the world.
Industry and Immigration 67	1-1 Innovation Boosts Growth
Technology Affects Travel As railroads expanded, they made other use of new technologies and also encouraged innovation. George Westinghouse patented air brakes for trains in 1869, while Granville Woods patented a telegraph system for trains in 1887.
Woods was one of many African Americans who used what they had learned from manual labor to get in on the national passion for developing and patenting new inventions. Meanwhile, meatpacker Gustavus Swift developed refrigerated cars for transporting food. By 1883, there were three transcontinental railroad lines in the United States.
The expanding transportation network caused some problems, however. Throughout most of the 1800s, most towns set their clocks independently. When trains started regular passenger service between towns, time differences made it hard to set schedules. In 1884, delegates from 27 countries divided the globe into 24 time zones, one for each hour of the day. The railroads adopted this system, which is still used today.
Technology also affected how Americans traveled and where they lived. Electric streetcars, commuter trains, and subways appeared in major cities. As a result, Americans could live in neighborhoods outside the city and commute to work. Factory production of automobiles with gas-powered engines began in 1902. Experiments in manned flight in a heavier-than-air craft by Orville and Wilbur Wright, among others, in
the early 1900s marked the birth of aeronautics, another new industry.
An Upward Spiral of Growth Railroads played a key role in transforming American industries and businesses. They could transport large amounts of goods long distances quickly, cheaply, and efficiently Because they linked the nation, they allowed businesses to obtain raw materials easily and to sell finished goods to larger numbers of people. They encouraged new methods for management and administration, which were soon adopted by the rest of the business community. In addition, the expanding railroad network stimulated innovation in many other industries.
An abundance of natural resources and an efficient transportation system to carry raw materials and finished goods set up a spiral of related growth. For example, factories turned out plate glass for windows of passenger rail cars. The factories needed freight cars to carry the windows to their destinations.
Those freight cars were created in factories that used railroads to transport fuel to supply the furnaces that turned out more railroad cars. In this way, factory production generated more factory production.
To meet the growing demand, factory owners and other innovators developed systems for turning out large numbers of products quickly and inexpensively.

Known as mass production, these systems depended upon machinery to carry out tasks that were once done with hand tools. In addition, Frederick Taylor and others studied the flow of work and workers’ places in it to develop a system of industrial management that found the most efficient ways for workers to use new machinery. These technological and management innovations improved the standard of living for some Americans by increasing the development of an economic middle class. Middle-class Americans, especially those that lived in the industrialized North, could afford less expensive products produced by companies utilizing new technology.
B CHECK UNDERSTANDING
How did new technologies influence industrialization?
Industrialization and the New South
While industry boomed in the North after the Civil War and Reconstruction, the South fell behind. The South struggled to develop its industry, and there were some pockets of success, especially in tobacco-processing, stone-quarrying, and furniture-making. In the 1890s, Altanta, Georgia, for example, was one of the earliest cities to develop an electric trolley system. But even though cities like Atlanta and Knoxville, Tennessee, grew strongly, the South struggled to overcome economic and social obstacles to broad industrial and urban development. As a result, the South remained largely agricultural and developed a smaller middle class than the North.
However, some post-Reconstruction industrial growth was led by many southern white leaders who envisioned a modernized economy that included not only agriculture but also mills and factories. Atlanta newspaper editor Henry Grady was among those who called for a “New South.” A gifted orator, Grady thought the South should use its resources to develop industry:
There was a South of slavery and secession—that South is dead. There is a South of union and freedom—that South, thank God, is living, breathing, growing every hour. . . . The old South rested everything on slavery and agriculture, unconscious that these could neither give nor maintain healthy growth. The new South presents a perfect democracy. . . a social system

compact and closely knitted, less splendid on the surface, but stronger at the core. . . and a diversified industry that meets the complex needs of this complex age.
—Henry Grady, 1886
New Industries Develop Before the Civil War, the South had shipped its raw materials—including cotton, wood, and iron ore—abroad or to the North for processing into finished goods. In the 1880s, northern investors and entrepreneurs backed textile factories in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, as well as cigar and lumber production, especially in North Carolina and Virginia. Other private investment in coal-, iron-, and steel-processing created urban centers in Nashville, Tennessee, and Birmingham, Alabama.
During this time, farming also became somewhat more diversified, with an increase in grain, tobacco, and fruit crops. Even the landscape of farming changed as smaller farms replaced large plantations.
Railroads Connect Cities and Towns The South needed reliable transportation to aid its industrial growth. To meet this need, southern rail lines
1.1 Innovation Boosts Growth
expanded, joining rural areas with urban hubs such as Mobile and Montgomery in Alabama and the bustling ports of New Orleans, Louisiana, and Charleston, South Carolina. Yet, by the 1880s, only two rail lines—from Texas to Chicago and from Tennessee to Washington, D.C.—linked southern freight to northern markets.
To combat economic isolation, southerners lobbied the federal government for economic help and used prison labor to keep railroad construction costs down. Gradually, rail connections supported the expansion of small hubs such as Meridian, Mississippi, and Americus, Georgia. The newer cities of Atlanta, Dallas, and Nashville developed rapidly and began rivaling older cities.
The Southern Economy Lags Behind Despite these changes, the southern economy continued to lag behind the rest of the country. While the North was able to build on its strong industrial base, the South first had to repair the damages of war. Moreover, industry rests on a three-legged stool: natural resources, labor, and capital investment, or money invested to start or improve the business. The South had plenty of the first but not enough of the second and third.
Sustained economic development also requires workers who are well trained and productive, as well as consumers who can spend. Public education in the South was limited.
In fact, the South spent less than any other part of the country on education, and it lacked the technical and engineering schools that could have trained the people needed by industry. At the same time, low wages discouraged skilled workers from coming to the South, and the lure of higher wages or better conditions elsewhere siphoned off southern workers.
Additionally, very few southern banks had survived the war, and those that were functioning had fewer assets than their northern competitors. Most of the South’s wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few people. Poor tenant farmers and low paid factory workers did not have cash to deposit. With few strong banks, southern financiers were often dependent on northern banks to start or expand businesses or farms. The southern economy suffered from this lack of labor and capital.
Farm Issues in the South Before the Civil War, most southern planters had concentrated on such crops as cotton and tobacco, which were grown not for their own use but to be sold for cash. The lure of the cash crop continued after the war, despite efforts to diversify. One farm magazine recommended that “instead of cotton fields, and patches of grain, let us have fields of grain, and patches of cotton.” But cotton remained the centerpiece of the southern agricultural economy. Although at the end of the Civil War cotton production had dropped to about one third of its prewar levels, by the late 1880s, it had rebounded. However, during

the war, many European textile factories had found suppliers outside the South, and the price of cotton had fallen. Now, the South’s abundance of cotton simply depressed the price further.
Dependence on one major crop was extremely risky. In the case of southern cotton, it was the boll weevil that heralded disaster. The boll weevil, a beetle which could destroy an entire crop of cotton, appeared in Texas in the early 1890s. Over the next decade, the yield from cotton cultivation in some states dropped by more than 50 percent. By 1900, cotton’s appeal and its problems dominated the southern economy, much as they had before the Civil War.

The Effects of
Industrialization
Free enterprise and industrialization touched every aspect of American life in the late 1800s, from the way businesses and farms operated to the kinds of products Americans used. They also affected the country’s relationship with the world and with its own environment.
Dominating World Markets By the 1880s, American exports of grain, steel, and textiles dominated international markets. Although Britain was building railroads to gain access to natural resources in Africa, Asia, and many other places across the world, by 1900, the United States had almost as many miles of railroad track as the rest of the world combined. The United States could easily transport goods from where they were made or grown to ports where they could be shipped around the world. Exports of food and goods greatly expanded the American economy. As the United States grew as a world economic power, it often clashed with the economic views and political policies of other countries.
Daily Life Changes Massive changes in industry altered how Americans lived and worked. Even farms became mechanized, meaning that fewer farm laborers were needed to feed the nation. Out-of-work farmers and their families moved to urban areas to find work, especially in the increasingly industrial North. Many moved to manufacturing centers that had sprung up around growing factories or industries. The mass production of goods meant that these new urban dwellers had easy access to clothing and supplies that they would have had to make by hand in the past. Yet

they faced higher costs of living, were dependent upon cash wages to buy food, and performed repetitive work in factories.
Concerns About the Environment In the early 1800s, few worried about how industry might affect the environment. However, by the late 1800s, industrial waste had risen dramatically and mining had begun to damage the land. In the Midwest, increasing
agricultural production had led to soil erosion and dust storms. People began to raise concerns about protecting natural resources. Congress responded by setting aside protected lands that would eventually become part of the National Park Service. Its creation of Yellowstone Park in 1872 was one of the first federal responses to concerns about the environment, and Yellowstone was the first such national park established anywhere in the world. Over the next decades, many more square miles of American land would be set aside to be protected.

The rapid industrial growth that occurred after the Civil War transformed American business and society. Yet it was only the beginning. The rise of big business, characterized by the investment of huge amounts of private financial resources, helped the United States push aside strong economies like Britain’s, to become one of the most economically powerful countries in the modern world.
Big Business Rises
Corporations Find New Ways of Doing Business
Until the mid-nineteenth century, most businesses were run by one person or family. This meant that no business could grow bigger than one family’s ability to invest in it or run it. Businesses were also local, buying and selling to customers who lived nearby. Industrialization changed all this. Railroads provided businesses with access to raw materials and customers from farther and farther away. Business leaders, desiring the profits offered by these larger markets, responded by combining funds and resources.
The Corporation Meets New Needs To take advantage of expanding markets, investors developed a form of group ownership known as a corporation. In a corporation, a number of people share the ownership of a business. If a corporation experiences economic problems, the investors lose no more than they had originally invested in the business. The corporation was the perfect solution to the challenge of expanding business, especially for risky industries such as railroads or mining. A corporation had the same rights as an individual: it could buy and sell property, and it could sue in the courts. If one person chose to leave the group, others could buy his interests.

Corporations were perfectly suited to expanding markets. They had access to huge amounts of capital, or invested money, allowing them to fund new technology, enter new industries, or run large plants across the country. Aided by railroads and the telegraph, corporations had the ability to operate in several different regions. After 1870, the number of corporations in America increased dramatically. They were an important part of industrial capitalism. The economic free-market system centered around industries.
Finding New Ways to Gain Advantage Corporations worked to maximize profits in several ways. They advertised their products widely, which enabled them to reach more potential customers. They paid low wages to workers and tried to obtain raw materials as cheaply as possible. They adopted forms of business organization, such as horizontal or vertical integration, and applied other innovations in production management to seek out efficiencies that would in turn decrease their cost of producing goods or services. Like J. P. Morgan, the heads of some corporations supported research laboratories where inventors could experiment with new processes that could lower production costs or new products that could bring future profits.
Others thought of new ways to make their businesses profitable. Cornelius Vanderbilt, an entrepreneur in the railroad industry, got his start in the steamboat business. He succeeded in getting his competitors to pay him to relocate because his low fares were driving
them out of business. Some corporations worked to eliminate competition by forming a cartel. In this arrangement, businesses making the same product agree to limit their production and thus keep prices high. John D. Rockefeller, an Ohio oil tycoon, made agreements with railroads that made it difficult for his competitors to ship their products:
[Rockefeller’s company] killed its rivals, in brief, by getting the great trunk lines to refuse to give them transportation. Vanderbilt is reported to have said that there was but one man—Rockefeller—-who could dictate to him.
D.
Lloyd, IW 1881 Business Management Innovations Business leaders continued to develop ever more effective ways to decrease costs and increase profits. One way was to merge competing firms into a giant company whose size would lead to lower production costs. This system of consolidating many firms in the same business is called horizontal integration. Some corporations used horizontal integration to gain a monopoly, or complete control of a product or service. To do this, a company either bought its competitors or drove them out of business.

and an efficient production process, the company was free to set its own prices based on demand for its products. This power did not always mean higher prices for consumers, but the potential for setting high prices was there. The management innovation of horizontal integration made business more efficient but occasionally had a negative impact on labor, because workers at smaller companies driven out of business would need to find employment elsewhere.
Production management, a management innovation designed to maximize the efficiency of a production process, also impacted labor. Business owners were understandably interested in controlling labor costs and continually looked for ways to improve worker productivity in conjunction with new machines. As a result, business owners could often meet production goals with fewer skilled workers. Those without the required skills to work with the new technologies and those unable to maintain the pace of a regimented workflow on factory floors oftentimes found themselves without work.
Rockefeller was one of the first businessmen to use horizontal integration. However, Ohio state law prevented one company from owning the stock of another. This meant that Rockefeller could not buy out his competitors. Instead he found a way to get around the law by forming a new type of business organization
called a trust. In a trust, companies assigned their stock to a board of trustees, who combined them into a new organization that the trustees ran. By the early 1880s, Rockefeller and his Standard Oil trust controlled most of the oil refined in the United States.
In Ohio and elsewhere, trusts arose, in part, because state laws governing corporations were inadequate. In many states in the mid-1800s, corporations could only be chartered by the state legislature passing an act. Business leaders looked for more flexible ways to build their businesses. For some business leaders, trusts were also a way to bring efficiency and stability to a free market where competition could be fierce and unpredictable. As state laws changed, trusts were replaced by other types of business mergers. However, the public continued to apply the term “trust” to any form of monopolistic business association.
Rockefeller, steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie, and other business leaders also strengthened their companies and made the workplace more efficient by gaining control of the different businesses that were involved in all stages of manufacturing their products. Carnegie, for example, owned the coal mines and iron-ore fields that provided the raw materials for his steel, as well as the ships and railroads that brought them to his

The Pros and Cons of Big Business
Throughout the 1880s, business mergers created powerful empires for those who controlled steel, railroads, meat, farm equipment, sugar, lumber, and a number of other enterprises. However, many smaller companies and consumers began to question the goals and tactics of those who led these businesses.

found that they received few profits. Some consumers were alarmed by the high prices that monopolies and cartels sometimes set on their products. Gradually, many consumers, workers, and the federal government came to believe that systems like trusts, cartels, and monopolies gave powerful business leaders unfair advantages. They believed that perhaps the government’s laissez-faire policies had been too hands off and costly in terms of hurting workers and consumers. People who held these views began to refer to these leaders as “robber barons.”
At the same time, other people believed that these industrialists served the nation positively. They believed that laissez-faire policies had benefited the nation by allowing business to flourish and regulate itself according to free enterprise principles. They recognized that the spread of factories, steel mills, and railroads provided jobs for an ever-growing labor force. Large, efficient corporations often lowered prices for consumers. Business supporters also noted that the industrialists’ efficient business practices and support for developing technology benefited the nation’s economy, stimulating innovation and shaping the United States into a strong international leader. Furthermore, many business leaders, like Carnegie, Rockefeller, and Vanderbilt, were important philanthropists.
They established universities, museums, and libraries, believing that such institutions made it possible for the disadvantaged to rise to wealth. For these reasons, people who took this point of view thought of business leaders as “captains of industry.”
The Causes and Effects of Social Darwinism In
1859, biologist Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species, arguing that animals evolved by a process of “natural selection” and that only the fittest survived to reproduce. Yale professor William Graham Sumner soon applied this theory to the rough-and-tumble world of American capitalism, calling it Social Darwinism. He declared that wealth was a measure of one’s inherent value and those who had it were the most "fit."
The theory of Social Darwinism, caused by this modification of Darwin’s scientific findings, became a social issue when it was used to justify a wide variety of beliefs and conditions. Supporters of the laissez-faire economic system argued that the government should stay out of private business, because interference would disrupt natural selection.
Many Social Darwinists believed that the nation would grow strong by allowing its most vigorous members to rise to the top, and that it was wrong to use public funds to assist the poor. Social Darwinism was often used to fuel discrimination. Social Darwinists

Relationship Between Government and Business
The great industrialists’ methods and their influence on the nation’s economy worried some Americans. Competing railroads took part in practices such as fixing rates and pooling, or entering into secret agreements to divide up the nation’s freight. Many Americans felt that price fixing and pooling drove up rates and were unfair to consumers. They also thought that unfair business practices and poor wages and working conditions for the labor force had made the costs of the government’s laissez-faire policies too high. They wanted the federal government to take action.
Attempts to Regulate Business Finally, in 1887, Congress responded by creating the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to monitor railroad shipping rates. However, it could only keep watch on railroads that crossed state lines. Also, it could not make laws or control the railroads’ transactions. Although court rulings favoring states and railroads weakened even these few powers, the ICC was the first federal agency to monitor business practices. Over the next several decades, the government would create many other federal bodies to regulate American businesses.
Similarly, the federal government slowly became involved in regulating trusts. In 1890, the Senate passed the Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlawed any trust that operated “in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states.” The government claimed that it had a constitutional right to regulate such commerce. But for more than a decade, the law was seldom enforced because court rulings generally favored business owners.
In fact, it was often used in businesses’ favor because they successfully argued in court that labor unions restrained trade. However, the ICC and the Sherman Antitrust Act began a trend toward federal limitations on corporations’ power.

A
Difficult Balance Between Business, Government, and Consumer These limits on corporations' power were made in an attempt to create a fair environment for competition. They sought to prevent any one company from undercutting market forces by driving its competition out of the market, which would allow the company rather than the market to determine the best price for its products. To this end, the federal government tried many kinds of legislation and regulation—with a mixture of costs and benefits. Often neither businesses nor consumers felt that their interests were well-served by government policies and actions. The costs and benefits of anti-trust acts continued to be debated. Over the course of 50 years, corporations, federal regulatory agencies, consumers, unions, and the courts struggled to find an acceptable balance between fair prices and wages, as well as workers’ safety and dignity and the corporations’ legitimate quest for efficiencies that would provide a fair return on the investment and risk involved in doing business in a free-market system. Historians continue to assess the ways in which—and the degree to which— that attempt at balance was met. Historians and economists also debate the question of who should have the responsibility for developing the policies to
achieve that balance. Indeed, these issues are still part of the relationship between business, government, and the consumer in our own time.

As industrialization intensified, the success of the booming American economy relied heavily on its workers. But struggles between business owners and workers also intensified, as workers rebelled against low pay and unsafe working conditions.
To keep the economy thriving, Americans had to find ways to ease the tensions between business owners and workers.

Workers Endure Difficulties
The industrial expansion in the United States produced great wealth for the owners of factories, mines, railroads, and large farms.
It also brought general improvements to American society in the form of a higher standard of living, wider availability of cheap goods, and increased access to public institutions like museums and schools. However, the economic growth of the late 1800s caused domestic issues. Many of the people who performed the work in the nation’s great industries struggled to survive. In addition, workers— especially immigrants, women, and minorities—often faced ridicule and discrimination.

The Hardships of Factory Work In the 1880s and 1890s, factory owners, seeking to keep down production costs, employed people who would work for low wages. Immigrants made up a large percentage of the workforce. Far from home, lacking good English-speaking skills, and often very poor, immigrants would generally take almost any job. Factory workers toiled long hours 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. Countless thousands of others worked similar hours in small, hot, dark, and dirty workhouses known as sweatshops. Sweatshop workers,

mainly women, labored long hours at machines making mass-produced items. Owners ensured productivity by strictly regulating workers’ days. They clocked work and break hours and fined workers for breaking rules or working slowly.
Factory work was often dangerous. Workspaces were poorly lit, often overheated, and badly ventilated. Some workers lost their hearing from the noisy machines. Accidents were common, both from faulty equipment and from lack of proper training. Despite the harsh conditions, employers suffered no shortage of labor. There were always more people than jobs.
Children in the Workplace As industrialization advanced, more jobs opened up for women. They worked as laundresses, telegraph operators, and typists. But most women—and their families—worked in the factories. Since low wages meant that both parents needed jobs, bringing children to work kept them off the streets and close to their parents. It also meant that the children could earn a wage, which helped the family to survive.
By the end of the 1800s, nearly one in five children between the ages of 10 and 16 worked rather than attending school. Harsh conditions affected these children deeply. Many suffered stunted physical and mental growth. By the 1890s, social workers began to recognize the social issues caused by child labor. They lobbied to get children out of factories and into child care or schools. Eventually, the efforts of social workers and other reformers prompted states to pass legislation to stop child labor.
Company Towns and Wage Slavery Many laborers, especially those who worked in mines, were forced to live in isolated communities near their workplaces. The housing in these communities, known as company towns, was owned by the business and rented out to employees. The employer also controlled the “company store," where workers were forced to buy goods. The company store sold goods on credit but charged high interest. As a result, by the time the worker was paid, most of the wages were owed back to the employer. Since workers could be arrested if they left their jobs before they completely repaid these debts, employers could hold onto workers through a system that workers’ advocates called “wage slavery.” Through management of their company towns, employers could also reinforce ethnic competition and distrust.

The Growth of Labor
Unions
Industrialization and free enterprise lowered the prices of consumer goods but helped business investors gain large profits. Workers usually did not object to their employer making a profit from their work. After all, if the business was not profitable, it could close and leave workers jobless. Keeping companies profitable was in the best interest of the workers as well.
However, workers were understandably frustrated that their wages did not earn enough to buy many consumer goods, even at lower prices. They also resented working in unsafe conditions that in some cases ruined their health and therefore their ability to earn a living. Increasingly, workers organized to take complaints about wages and working conditions to their employers. Employers usually opposed the growing labor movement, which they saw as a threat to their businesses and profits. Employers tended to view efforts to improve wages or working conditions as a violation of their property rights—their right to run their businesses as they saw fit.
Early Labor Protests As early as the 1820s, factory workers tried to gain more power by using the technique of collective bargaining, or negotiating as a group with their employer for higher wages or better working conditions. A related tool to collective bargaining was the strike, in which workers refused to work until certain demands were met. Most strikes were local, but sometimes they involved workers in a whole industry across a state, a region, or the country.
The first national labor union, founded in 1834, was the National Trades Union, open to workers from all trades. It lasted only a few years, and no new unions formed in the wake of the depressions of the late 1830s. However, strikes succeeded in reducing the length of the workday in some regions. By the mid-1800s, a six-day work week with a 10-hour workday became the standard in most New England factories. Gradually, national unions began to reappear.
» Many working-class families struggled to get by on low wages.
Socialism Influences Labor In the 1830s, a movement called socialism spread throughout Europe. Socialism is an economic and political philosophy that favors public, instead of private, control of property and income. Socialists believe that society at large, not just private individuals, should take charge of a nation’s wealth. That wealth, they argue, should be distributed equally to everyone.
In 1848, the German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels expanded on the ideas of socialism in a treatise titled The Communist Manifesto. This pamphlet denounced capitalism and predicted that workers would overturn it. Most Americans rejected these ideas, believing that they threatened the American ideals of free enterprise, private property, and individual liberty. The wealthy in particular opposed socialism because it threatened their fortunes. But many labor activists borrowed ideas from socialism to support their goals for social reform.
The Knights of Labor In 1869, Uriah Stephens founded a labor union called the Knights of Labor. Stephens, a tailor who had lived and worked around the country, included all workers of any trade, skilled or unskilled, in his union. The Knights also actively recruited women and African Americans. Under Stephens, the union functioned largely as a secret society, devoted to
Industry and Immigration 81	1.3 The Organized Labor Movement
broad social reform such as replacing capitalism with workers’ cooperatives. The Preamble to the Knights’ Constitution, written in 1878, read:
The recent alarming development and aggression of aggregated wealth, which, unless checked, will inevitably lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses, render it imperative, if we desire to enjoy the blessings of life, that a check should be placed upon its power . .
. and a system adopted which will secure to the laborer the fruits of his toil. . . .
—Preamble to the Knights’ Constitution, 1878
In 1879, Terence V, Powderly took on the leadership of the Knights. The son of Irish immigrants, he had worked as a machinist on the railroad before rising to become mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the 1870s. Powderly abandoned the secretive nature of the Knights. Under his leadership the union used collective bargaining, boycotts, and the threat of strikes to win gains for workers. But like Stephens, Powderly

also pursued reforms intended to free workers from wage labor. He planned large-scale manufacturing cooperatives which members workers would operate and take a share in the profits. By 1885, the Knights had grown to include some 700,000 men and women nationwide, of every race and ethnicity. By the 1890s, however, after a series of failed strikes, the Knights had largely disappeared. Many Knights who worked in skilled crafts or trades abandoned the union for a new, rival labor organization, the American Federation of Labor.
A
New Organization for Workers Samuel Gompers was a poor Jewish immigrant from England who had worked his way up to head the Cigarmakers’ Union in New York. In 1886, Gompers helped found the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and served as its president for nearly 40 years. While the Knights of Labor was open to nearly all workers, the AFL was a loose organization of some 100 unions of skilled workers devoted to specific crafts. These trade unions retained their individuality but gained strength in bargaining through their affiliation with the AFL. Gompers set high dues for membership in the AFL, pooling the money to create a strike and pension fund to assist workers in need. Unlike the Knights of Labor, the AFL did not aim for larger social gains for workers. Instead, it focused on specific workers’ issues such as wages, working hours, and working conditions. In testimony before a government labor commission, Gompers argued in fact that unions and strikes were the only way workers’ issues such as these could be addressed:
We recognize that peaceful industry is necessary to successful civilized life, but the right to strike and the preparation to strike is the greatest preventive to strikes.
If the workmen were to make up their minds tomorrow that they would under no circumstances strike, the employers would do all the striking for them in the way of lesser wages, and longer hours of labor.

Capital and Labor, 1890

The AFL was not as successful as the Knights in rapidly gaining the widespread support of workers, partly because of its own policies. It opposed union membership for women because Gompers believed their presence in the workplace drove wages down. While it was theoretically open to African Americans, member unions usually found ways to exclude them. Nevertheless, by 1910 AFL membership had reached two million workers.

What similarities and differences existed in the goals of various labor unions?
Labor Unions Lead
Protests
As membership in labor unions rose and labor activists became more skilled in organizing large-scale protests, a wave of bitter confrontations between labor and management hit the nation. The first major strike occurred in the railroad industry in 1877. Striking workers, responding to wage cuts, caused massive property destruction in several cities. State militias were called in to protect strikebreakers, or temporary workers hired to perform the jobs of striking workers. Finally, the federal government sent in troops to restore order. In the decades to follow, similar labor disputes
would affect businesses, the government, and the organization of labor unions themselves.
Workers Protest in Chicago In May 1886, thousands of workers mounted a national demonstration for an eight-hour workday. Strikes erupted in several cities, and fights broke out between strikers and strikebreakers. Conflict then escalated between strikers and police who were brought in to halt the violence. On May 4, protesters gathered at Haymarket Square in Chicago. The diverse crowd included anarchists, or radicals opposed to all government. A protester threw a bomb, killing a policeman. In the subsequent frenzy, dozens of people, both protesters and policemen, were killed. Eight anarchists were tried for murder, and four were executed. The governor of Illinois, deciding that evidence for the convictions had been scanty, pardoned three of the others. The fourth had already committed suicide in jail.
The Haymarket Riot left an unfortunate legacy The Knights of Labor fizzled out as people shied away from radicalism. Employers became even more suspicious of union activities, associating them with violence. In general, much of the American public at that time came to share that view.

summer of 1892, a Carnegie Steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania, cut workers’ wages. The union immediately called a strike. Andrew Carnegie’s partner, Henry Frick, responded by bringing in the Pinkertons,

a private police force known for their ability to break up strikes. The Pinkertons killed several strikers and wounded many others in a standoff that lasted some two weeks. Then, on July 23, an anarchist who had joined the protesters tried to assassinate Frick. The union had not backed his plan, but the public associated the two. Recognizing that public opinion was turning against unions, the union called off the strike in November. The Homestead Strike was part of an epidemic of steelworkers’ and miners’ strikes that took place as economic depression spread across America. In each case, troops and local militia were called in to suppress the unrest.
A
Union Addresses Social Issues in a Pullman Town In 1893, inventor George Pullman, whose Pullman Palace Car Company produced luxury railroad passenger cars, laid off many of his workers and cut wages by 25 percent. Although the economic slowdown plaguing the nation at the time justified this action to some degree, Pullman did not reduce the rents in his company town near Chicago, where his workers lived. In May 1894, workers sent a delegation to discuss their desperate situation with Pullman. He refused to negotiate and fired three workers. His other workers responded by going on strike. When Pullman brought in strikebreakers, the workers turned to the newly organized American
Railway Union (ARU) for help. Founded by former railroad worker Eugene V. Debs, the ARU was organized as an industrial union, grouping all railroad workers together rather than into separate trade unions according to the job they held. Debs believed that industrial unions allowed workers to exert united pressure on employers.
The ARU ordered a nationwide strike against Pullman. By June 1894, nearly 300,000 railworkers were refusing to work on, handle, or move any trains that had Pullman cars on them. As the Pullman Strike escalated, the nation’s railroad traffic came to a halt. Railroad owners cited the Sherman Antitrust Act to argue that the union was illegally disrupting free trade. Since the nation’s mail moved by train, the federal government took action to end the strike. A federal court ordered a halt to the strike. When Debs defied the court order, President Grover Cleveland sent in federal troops to force the strikers back to work. Debs was jailed for conspiring against interstate commerce. Debs appealed his conviction, claiming that the government had no authority to halt the strike. However, the Supreme Court upheld Debs' conviction in the case In re Debs in 1895, ruling that protecting interstate commerce and the private property rights of the railroads was a lawful exercise of government power.

1.3 The Organized Labor Movement
The Impact of Labor Unions The outcome of the Pullman Strike set an important trend. Employers, hoping to maintain profitability and thus create more jobs, appealed frequently for court orders against unions, citing legislation like the Sherman Antitrust Act. The federal courts and other federal officials routinely supported these appeals, denying unions recognition as legally protected organizations and limiting union gains for more than 30 years. As the twentieth century opened, industrialists, workers, and government continued to battle over numerous labor issues. Collective bargaining, strikes, and legislation would become the way of life for American industry.
In the decades after Pullman, the labor movement split into different factions, some increasingly influenced by socialism. By the end of the 1800s, Debs had become a Socialist. He helped organize the American Socialist Party in 1897, running for President in 1900. In 1905, he helped found the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), or Wobblies. The IWW was a radical union of unskilled workers with many Socialists among its leaders. In the first few decades of the 1900s, the IWW led a number of strikes, many of them violent.

Immigration has been a central
theme in American history. However, when the foreign-born population of the United States nearly doubled between 1870 and 1900, some Americans feared that the newcomers would damage American culture. Instead, Americans adopted parts of immigrants’ cultures, while immigrants adopted parts of American culture. The contributions of immigrants, combined with the existing culture, helped shape American culture into a diverse and unique whole.

Rush of “New” Immigrants Immigrants had always come to America for economic opportunity and religious freedom. Until the 1870s, the majority had been Protestants from northern and western Europe. They came as families to settle in the United States, often on farms with family or friends who had come previously. Many had saved some money for the journey, had a skill or trade, or had a formal education. Many German and Irish Catholics had immigrated in the 1840s and 1850s, and more arrived after the Civil War. Some Americans had prejudices against Catholics, but the Irish spoke English and the German Catholics benefited from the good reputation of their Protestant countrymen. Although many lacked skills and money, the children of these immigrants were often able to blend into American society. Beginning in the 1870s, Irish and Germans were joined by “new” immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. They arrived in increasing numbers until the outbreak of World War I.
In contrast to “old” immigrants who had come before the Irish and Germans, “new” immigrants were often Catholic or Jewish, and likely to settle in cities rather than on farms. Many came alone, planning to

save some money in the United States and return home to live. They came from Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary, and Russia in large numbers. After 1900, immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe made up more than 70 percent of all immigrants, up from about 1 percent in the mid-1800s. Many native-born Americans felt threatened by these newcomers with different cultures and languages.
Causes of Immigration The legal immigration of these immigrants changed demographic patterns in the United States. Two types of factors caused this immigration, as they have caused people to immigrate before and after the rush at the turn of the twentieth century. Push factors are those that compel people to leave their homes, such as famine, war, or persecution. For example, in the 1880s, farmers had a difficult time in many parts of the world. In Mexico, Poland, and China, land reform and low prices for crops forced many farmers off their land. Some chose to come to America to make a new start. Beginning in the 1840s, China and eastern Europe experienced repeated wars and political revolutions. These events disrupted economies and created political refugees. One of the largest groups to settle in America were Russian and eastern European Jews. Beginning in the 1880s, they fled religious persecution and came to the United
States to live in safety, and hopefully, achieve a better life.
Another type of factor that leads to immigration is a pull factor. Pull factors are those that draw people to a new place, such as economic opportunity or religious freedom. In addition to a vague hope for opportunity, the United States offered special attractions, including plentiful land and employment. The 1862 Homestead Act and aid from railroad companies made western farmland inexpensive. The railroads even offered reduced fares to get there because they needed customers in the West for their own businesses to succeed. Until 1885, immigrants were recruited from their homelands to build railroads, dig in mines, work in oil fields, harvest produce, or toil in factories. Others hoped to strike it rich by finding gold in the West.
Many others were “chain immigrants,” joining family or friends who had already settled in America. The immigrants who had arrived earlier promised to help the newcomers find work and housing, and sometimes they even sent them tickets for the journey. Immigrants may have lured their families and friends to America with the promise of religious and political freedom. In America, one could worship and vote as one chose without fear of persecution by the government. Many immigrants in the late nineteenth century had

B IDENTIFY SUPPORTING DETAILS
What details from the reading help explain why immigrants came to America?
Optimism and the
Immigrant Experience
Immigrant experiences varied greatly. However, there were common themes: a tough decision to leave home and family, a hard and costly journey with an uncertain end, and the difficulties of learning a new language and adjusting to a foreign culture. In spite of the difficult road in front of them, many immigrants were optimismic that moving to America would lead to better lives. As one young Russian Jewish woman explained, "America means for an Immigrant a fairy promised land that came out true, a land that gives all they need for their work, a land which gives morality through her churches and education through her free schools and libraries.” Millions of people decided that such possibilities outweighed the risks and set out for the United States.
» Passenger manifests such as this tracked the vital information of immigrants who entered U.S. ports to begin their lives as Americans.
The Long Journey to America Coming to America was a big task. Travelers needed money for passage and to make a new start, although some had only enough for a ticket. The immigrants’ first task was to pack the items that would help them start a new life. Usually, they brought only what they could carry: clothes, maybe a photograph of loved ones, a cherished musical instrument, or the tools of their trade. Next, they made their way to a port of departure, hoping that a ship would be leaving soon. In war-torn areas, just getting to the ship could be dangerous.
By the 1870s, steamships made the trip across the Atlantic safer and faster than ever before. However, it could be an awful voyage. Most immigrants traveled in steerage, the worst accommodations on the ship. Located on the lower decks with no private cabins, steerage was crowded and dirty. Illness spread quickly, while rough weather could force seasick passengers to stay in cramped quarters for days at a time. Under these conditions, even healthy immigrants fell ill, while frail passengers sometimes died. On other voyages, passengers were fortunate to have beautiful weather and no illness onboard.
immigrants Arrive at Ellis and Angel Islands The
first stop for ships at American ports was a processing station where immigration officials decided who could or could not stay in the United States. To enter, immigrants had to be healthy and show that they had money, a skill, or a sponsor to provide for them. Often the sponsor was an industrialist who needed workers. Most European immigrants arrived in New York Harbor. Beginning in 1892, they were processed at the busy, New York Harbor immigration station Ellis Island.
First and second-class passengers were inspected on the ship and released, unless they had obvious medical problems. All third-class, or steerage, passengers were sent to Ellis Island. There, immigration officers conducted legal and medical inspections. Since the shipowners did a preliminary screening before passengers boarded, only about 2 percent of immigrants were denied entry; the rest took a ferry to New York City. In 1907, 10-year-old Edward Corsi arrived with his family from Italy. Years later, when he had become an immigration official, he remembered his first impressions:

Chinese and other Asian immigrants crossed the Pacific Ocean, many arriving in San Francisco Bay. Chinese immigrants came in larger numbers in the 1850s to work in mines, on railroads, and on farms and fisheries. After 1882, Chinese immigrants were turned away unless they could prove that they were American citizens or had relatives living in America. Angel Island, a processing center for Chinese immigrants, opened in San Francisco Bay in 1910. If Ellis Island was welcoming to some, Angel Island was always formidable. It was designed to filter out Chinese immigrants. Officials often assumed that Chinese newcomers would misrepresent themselves in order to gain entry.
While most immigrants left Ellis Island within hours, Chinese immigrants at Angel Island were often held for weeks or even months in poor conditions waiting to find out if they would be allowed to stay in the United States. To pass the time and express their frustrations, many carved poems into the walls at Angel Island. One detainee wrote:
Lin, upon arriving in America,
Was arrested, put in a wooden building,
And made a prisoner.
I	was here for one autumn.
The Americans did not allow me to land.
I	was ordered to be deported.
—Taoist from the Tciwn of kon
In addition to San Francisco and New York, thousands of immigrants arrived during this period through other ports on the East Coast such as Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, southern ports such as New Orleans and Galveston, or western ports such as Los Angeles.
fel CHECK UNDERSTANDING What factors made the
trip to America difficult for many immigrants?
» The experience of Asian immigrants like these ones on the West Coast was often less welcoming than that of European immigrants in the East.
Social Issues Affecting Immigrants
Passing immigration inspections was just the first step. Once in America, immigrants immediately faced tough decisions such as where to settle and how to find work. On top of that, most had to learn a new language and new customs. Sometimes immigrants worked with an agent who spoke their language for help finding work and housing, but many agents took advantage of the newcomers to make money. Lucky immigrants had contacts through family and friends who could help them navigate a new and strange world.
Americanization Movement Most new immigrants stayed in cities, close to industrial jobs in factories. There, they often lived in ethnic neighborhoods with people who shared their native language, religion, and culture. Neighbors might have come from the same country, region, or even village.
By 1890, many cities had huge immigrant populations. In San Francisco and Chicago, immigrants made up more than 40 percent of the population. Four out of five inhabitants of New York City were foreign born or had foreign-born parents. While exclusionist policies forced some people to live in ghettoes, these neighborhoods also provided familiarity. Specialty

shops, grocers, and clothing stores provided a taste of the food and culture that immigrants had left behind.
In many cities, volunteer institutions known as settlement houses ran Americanization programs, helping newcomers learn English and adopt American dress and diet. At the same time, immigrants helped one another through fraternal associations, such as the Polish National Alliance and the Ancient Order of Hibernians (an Irish Catholic organization). These organizations, based on ethnic or religious identity, provided social services and financial assistance to encourage people to pursue economic opportunity while making them feel more at home in the United States. Many settlement workers and immigrants alike believed that American society was a “melting pot” in which white people of all different nationalities blended to create a single culture. The term came from the name of a play that opened in 1908. This model excluded Asian immigrants, who became targets of social and legal discrimination.
Despite the hopes of settlement workers, immigrants often held on to their traditions. Their children, however, became more Americanized, without memories of homes and families left behind. Some adults reported that they dreamed of returning to their homelands, but most immigrants did not return to their country

of origin. Instead, they established fraternal lodges and religious institutions that made them feel more comfortable in their new surroundings.
Catholics, in particular, established churches and parochial schools. In many cities, Irish Catholic churches stood side by side with Italian Catholic churches—each built to serve the needs of its own community. The immigrants’ churches, schools, and institutions reminded native-born Americans that new cultures were changing American society.
New Immigrants Face Hostility Accepting immigrants into American society was not always easy. Newcomers often faced nativism, which was a tendency towards preferring native-born, white Americans over “new” immigrants. During the economic recessions of the late nineteenth century, competition for jobs and housing fueled resentment. Many native-born workers worried that immigrants would work for lower pay. Nativist intellectuals backed up their beliefs with dubious scientific rhetoric that linked immigrants’ physical characteristics to criminal tendencies or lesser intellectual abilities. Social Darwinism also played a role in nativism.
Religious and cultural differences sparked suspicion between native-born Americans and immigrants, as well as between different immigrant ethnic groups. Many Irish, German, Italian, and Polish immigrants practiced Roman Catholicism, and some Protestants feared that Catholics’ first loyalty was to the Pope rather than to American ideals. Anti-semitism in the United States was nothing new—the U.S. Army had briefly expelled all Jews from Grant’s military department in 1862—and the arrival of Jews fleeing persecution in Eastern Europe only complicated the issue. Some native-born Jews worried that these Eastern European immigrants, who were culturally quite different than American or German Jews, would fuel anti-Jewish attitudes and that the newcomers would not be able to Americanize. Some native-born white Protestants would not hire, vote for, or work with Catholics or Jews. Some Americans even signed restrictive contracts agreeing not to rent or sell property to Catholics, Jews, African Americans, or other groups they considered “non-native.”
Policies Restrict Some Immigration Extreme hostility toward Chinese laborers had led Congress to pass the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. The act prohibited immigration by Chinese laborers, limited the civil rights of Chinese immigrants already in the United States, and forbade the naturalization of Chinese residents. The act had unintended negative consequences on the economy, especially in states

such as California that relied on cheap Chinese labor. Restricting the immigration of Chinese laborers made it difficult for large single-crop ranches to be profitable. The act also prevented many Chinese in the United States from visiting their families in China, fearing they would not be permitted to return. In 1898, a court case established that Chinese people born in America were United States citizens and could, therefore, come and go freely. However, many immigration officials ignored this ruling.
In the same year, Congress passed another act that prohibited the entry of anyone who was a criminal, immoral, a pauper, or likely to need public assistance. In practice, the law was used to bar many poor or handicapped immigrants. These acts marked the beginning of legislation restricting immigration in the United States. Until then, anti-immigrant activity had been episodic and often short-lived. Immigration became a constant topic of conversation throughout America.

Despite anti-immigrant sentiment, immigrants of many racial and ethnic groups transformed American society. They fueled industrial growth, acquired citizenship, participated in the democratic process, and made their traditions part of American culture. Mexican Americans in the Southwest developed effective ranching techniques, while Chinese, Irish, and Mexican laborers built the railroads. Equally important, immigrants labored in coal mines, steel mills, textile mills, and factories. Immigrant women worked in factories, as seamstresses, as laundresses, and doing piecework. Others became domestic servants. Though the conditions were harsh and immigrants received few benefits, their labor helped the United States become an economic world power.

them quickly became part of the American vocabulary European Jews introduced bagels; Italian immigrants popularized pasta dishes like spaghetti; German immigrants brought sausages called wieners and Frankfurters. The Chinese introduced a vast knowledge of how to use plants for medicinal purposes as well as foods such as chow mein.
Many individual immigrants made valuable contributions to American culture. Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish immigrant, turned to philanthropy following the sale of his steel empire. He donated some $288 million to social and educational causes in the United States. James Naismith, who moved from Canada to Massachusetts, invented the sport of basketball in the late 1800s. In addition, Alexander Graham Bell, also born in Scotland, revolutionized modern communications with his patent of the telephone in 1876. Belgian immigrant Leo Baekeland transformed technology with the development of modern plastics. Inventor Nikola Tesla, born in what is now Croatia, pioneered discoveries in the generation and transmission of electricity.

jobs in mines and factories. Increasingly, immigrants demanded a voice, becoming active in labor unions and politics. They lobbied for policies to protect the poor and powerless and used their votes to elect governments favorable to those goals. Some of the political leaders they supported became powerful.
Among these influential activists was Irish immigrant Mary Harris Jones, also known as Mother Jones. She fought for the union rights of coal miners. Samuel Gompers was a Jewish cigar maker from England who became an influential labor organizer and leader. Gompers’ leadership of the American Federation of Labor, through which he organized national unions comprised of local chapters, became the model for unionism in the United States. Union leaders like Gompers and Mother Jones demanded reforms that helped immigrants as well as all laborers. Immigrants expanded the definition of American.

1.4 The New Immigrants
As one historian has noted, America was bom on the farm and moved to the city. In 1860, most Americans lived in rural areas, with only 16 percent living in towns or cities with a population of 8,000 or more. By 1900, that percentage had doubled, and nearly 15 million Americans lived in cities with populations of more than 50,000. Migration to urban areas dining this time changed the demographics, or statistical characteristics, of the population of the United States. This period was the beginning of an upsurge in urbanization that both reflected and fueled massive changes in the way Americans lived.

Americans Migrate to Cities
In the late nineteenth century, America experienced a period of urbanization in which the number of cities and people living in them increased dramatically. Still, numbers and statistics do not tell the whole story of how Americans became city folk. Urban people lived differently from rural people.
People in the country lived and worked on farms, either owned by their family or rented from a larger landowner. Their work was driven by the growing cycle. They did a lot of their work outside when weather permitted. In contrast, many people in cities worked for large companies inside factory buildings or sweatshops, rode trolley cars or walked to work, and lived in apartment buildings. Unlike farming, factory work was a year-round, daily grind, and workers had no control over their schedules. Over time, this structured scheduling, combined with the urban way of life, became part of American culture.
City Life Beckons to Immigrants and Migrants America’s major cities were manufacturing and transportation centers clustered in the northeast, on the Pacific coast, and along the waterways of the midwest. Connected by the new railroad lines, cities became magnets for immigrants and rural Americans. The newcomers were attracted by jobs in factories or the service industries. Those with a little money

opened shops. The educated increasingly joined the new middle-class professions, working in downtown offices.
Women’s opportunities, in particular, were dramatically expanded in urban areas. In addition to factory work, they could take in boarders, do piecework, or become domestic servants. Educated women found work as teachers or in offices as secretaries and typists.
While many city jobs offered only hard work for little reward, cities offered variety, promise, and even a bit of glamour. By saving part of their wages, city workers might attain some comforts or perhaps even move into the growing middle class. At the least, they could increase their children's opportunities by sending them to school. While some laborers were trapped in an endless cycle of poverty, only the very poorest were unable to enjoy a somewhat higher standard of living in the late nineteenth century.
Life was hard in the city, but many Americans still loved it. Horace Greeley, a politician and New York City newspaper editor, wrote in the 1860s, “We cannot all live in cities, yet nearly all seem determined to do so.” City churches, theaters, social clubs, and museums offered companionship and entertainment.
Transportation out of the city and to other cities was easily accessible. In this period of growth and

expansion, some migrants moved from city to city, trying to improve their fortunes.
Cities Attract Immigrants The demographics of many cities changed very quickly as legal immigrants came to the country. By 1900, some urban areas had a population that was more than 40 percent foreign born. Some immigrants found their way to a city through happenstance, while others joined family members or were recruited by companies needing labor. In this way, neighborhoods, cities, regions, and industries often acquired a majority of workers from a particular locale. For example, employees at the steel mills of western Pennsylvania were predominantly Polish, while the textile factories of New York became a center for eastern European Jewish people. Domestic servants in the Northeast were primarily Irish women, while Scandinavians worked in the fish-packing industry of the Pacific Northwest.
Farmers Migrate to Urban Areas Demographic patterns also changed in response to the many rural-to-urban migrants who moved to cities in the 1890s. For many rural Americans, making a living on a farm had become increasingly difficult. In addition to unpredictable weather conditions, isolation, and limited opportunities, farmers faced economic struggles that hindered their livelihoods. New technologies enabled farmers to produce more crops, but the greater supply caused prices to drop. These factors, combined with the excitement and variety of city life, sparked widespread rural-to-urban migration. However, the move from farm to factory could be wrenching. Former agricultural workers often found themselves working in dim light and narrow confines. The pace of work was controlled by rigid schedules, with no slow seasons. However, factory work paid wages in cash, which was sometimes scarce on family farms.
Midwestern cities such as Minneapolis-St. Paul and Chicago exploded in the decade between 1880 and 1890. Many of the newcomers were immigrants or migrants from the rural West. They were attracted by land but also by economic opportunities.
African Americans moving out of the rural South were also part of the migration, although on a smaller scale. The majority of the migrating African Americans stayed in southern cities, but the few black migrants to northern and western cities paved the way for a much larger migration after World War I.

Technology Improves City Life
As cities swelled in size, politicians and workers struggled to keep up with the demands of growth to provide water, sewers, schools, and safety. American innovators stepped up to the task by developing new technologies to improve living conditions. The middle and upper classes benefited most from the innovations, but every city dweller was affected. Electric trolleys and subways, building codes, and other innovations increased the pace of urbanization and economic development in cities across the country.
Engineers Build Skyward with Steel The cities of the late nineteenth century began to take their modern form. For the first time, skylines became recognizable by their skyscrapers. Steel was first mass-produced to create railroad rails, but architects and engineers realized the possibilities of using this strong and resilient metal for the construction of buildings. Skyscrapers of ten stories and taller had steel frames and used artistic designs to magnify their imposing height. Inside, they provided office space in cities that had no room left on the ground. Increased office space in turn allowed more businesses to establish themselves and more people to live in closer proximity to each other, which further stimulated economic development in urban areas. But tall buildings were only realistic
because of other new technology. In the 1850s, Elisha Otis developed a safety elevator that would not fall if the lifting rope broke. Central heating systems were also improved in the 1870s. Technological innovations like these, dramatically improved the standard of living in the United States.
In these years, architecture emerged as a specialized career. The American Institute of Architecture was established in 1857 to professionalize the practice. Its members encouraged specific education and official licensing in order to become an architect. These professionals designed the buildings that were quickly becoming hallmarks of urban life: public schools, libraries, train stations, financial institutions, office buildings, and residences.
Electricity Powers New Industries and Economic Development In 1888, Richmond, Virginia, introduced a revolutionary invention: streetcars powered by overhead electric cables. Within a decade, every major city followed. It was the beginning of a transportation revolution. New industries revolving around mass transit—public systems that could carry large numbers of people fairly inexpensively—reshaped the nation’s cities. Commuter rail lines had carried people to areas in and around cities since the 1870s. However, they were powered by coal-driven steam engines, making them slow, unreliable, and dirty. Some cities used trolleys pulled by horses, which were slower and

left horse waste all over the streets. Electricity, on the other hand, was quiet, clean, and efficient.
Electric cars also ran on a reliable schedule and could carry many more people than horse-drawn carts. These advances in transportation were all made possible by the free enterprise system, which applied technological innovation to the needs of daily life.
Electric cable cars were not practical in every city however. Cables strung in narrow streets could block fire trucks, and traffic congestion often prevented streetcars from running on schedule. In 1897, Boston solved this problem by running the cars underground in the nation’s first subway system. New York City followed in 1904. Electric cable cars and subways allowed urban economies to expand even faster. These new industries efficiently moved people in and around cities, making it possible for urban populations to grow at an increasingly rapid pace.
Middle and upper class people who could afford transit fares moved away from the noise and dirt of the industrial city. They built housing in the cleaner, quieter perimeter, known as streetcar suburbs. From there, they rode mass transit into the center of the city to work, shop, or be entertained, returning to their homes in the evening. Poorer people remained in city centers so that they could walk to work.
City Planners Lay Out Cities As cities grew larger and more complex, architectural firms expanded to offer city-planning services designed to make cities more functional and beautiful, even as their populations skyrocketed. Architect Daniel Burnham designed his version of the ideal city for Chicago’s 1893 World’s Fair Columbian Exhibition, a fair held to commemorate Columbus’s arrival in the Americas on the event’s 400th anniversary. Called the White City, the integrated design included boulevards, parks, buildings, and even electric streetlights.
Mass transit allowed city planners to segregate parts of the city by zoning, or designating certain areas for particular functions. Through the 1890s, cities embraced designs that had separate zones for heavy industry, financial institutions, and residences. They also built public spaces, such as public libraries, government buildings, and universities.
Parks and recreational spaces were one of the most important aspects of city planning. Since the 1850s, cities had built parks as a solution to some of the problems of urban growth. Philadelphia purchased areas along the Schuylkill River to protect the city’s water supply from industrial pollution. They hired landscape engineer Frederick Law Olmsted to design Fairmount Park. Olmsted had also designed New York City s Central Park and similar parks in

Urban Living Creates
Social Issues
Urbanization led to many social issues caused by overcrowding and poverty. In 1890, New York’s Lower East Side had a population of more than 700 people per acre. As immigrants and rural migrants arrived, they crowded into neighborhoods that already seemed to be overflowing.
Housing Conditions Worsen As newcomers moved into urban areas, those who could not afford to ride mass transit had to live within walking distance of the industrial plants and factories where they worked. Housing in densely populated neighborhoods was often aging and usually overcrowded. Most urban workers lived in tenements: low-cost multifamily housing designed to squeeze in as many families as possible. Sometimes, several families lived in one apartment or even one room. They used the space for sewing clothes or doing other piecework to earn money. For those who had moved from rural areas, adapting to city life could be difficult. Typical rural areas had a small town or village with several small family farms located in the surrounding few miles. People had little contact with others from outside the community, but had daily access to acres of land and open air.
Tenement owners usually lived in the suburbs or in fashionable downtown areas, away from the industrial grime. However, they built apartments for desperate people who had little choice about where they lived. With few windows and little sanitation, tenements were unhealthy and dangerous. In 1890, journalist Jacob Riis drew attention to the plight of New York tenement dwellers:
Go into any of the ’respectable’ tenement neighborhoods . , . you shall come away agreeing [that] . , . life there does not seem worth living. . . - [T] he airshaft . . . seems always so busy

-Jacob Riis, II
Public Health Concerns Cities in the late 1800s were filthy. Unpaved streets were snarled with ruts and littered with trash and even dead horses that were left to rot. Alleys between tenements were clogged with food waste and trash. Only the newest urban dwellings had indoor toilets, and the shared toilets in tenements often overflowed. These conditions were perfect for breeding epidemics, posing danger to everyone. For example, cholera, a particularly dangerous illness, reached epidemic proportions several times in the United States in the 1800s, killing thousands.
Cholera spreads when people drink contaminated water. Fresh water supplies and less burdened sanitary systems in rural areas often prevented these epidemics from happening. In urban areas, governments and city planners began to take steps to improve living conditions.
During the 1880s, planners attempted to regulate housing, sanitation, sewers, and public health. They

century drew to a close, many cities developed professional firefighting teams.
At night, the streets were dangerous, yet many factory workers had to travel to and from work in the dark. In response to this challenge, professional, uniformed city police forces replaced the lone constable and the decentralized neighborhood watch. The new officers were civil servants who took exams and regularly patrolled city neighborhoods. They were aided in their task of ensuring safety by new electric streetlights.
However, the police were unable to overcome the challenge of tension between urban groups. In every big city, communities clashed along ethnic and racial fault lines. Police allowed immigrants to sleep in the station houses to avoid the violence in the streets. Even very young boys joined neighborhood gangs for safety.
Race, class, and neighborhood loyalties and conflicts continued to define neighborhood life for many generations.

began to take water from reservoirs that were separate from the polluted rivers and lakes. In the next decade, urban standards of living improved as a new filtration system improved water quality even more. Private companies competed for lucrative contracts to manage water distribution. Especially in the Southwest, where water was in short supply, questions of who should profit from water delivery sent city planners into a frenzy.
Safety in Cities In addition to public health concerns, cities also faced the dangers of fire, crime, and conflict. Even one careless act could have devastating consequences in crowded housing.
Open fireplaces and gas lighting started fires that quickly swept through a city. A fire destroyed Chicago in 1871, killing between 200 to 300 people. It also left more than 100,000 people homeless. As the nineteenth

Nation of Cities Novelist Mark Twain satirized American life in his 1873 novel, The Gilded Age. He depicted American society as gilded, or having a rotten core covered with gold paint. Most Americans were not as cynical. The dizzying array of things to do and buy convinced the growing middle class that modern America was in a true golden age.

New Ways of Life
Free Enterprise Improves Life
Still, Twain’s label stuck, and historians refer to the last decades of the nineteenth century as “the Gilded Age.” The new lifestyle that middle-class Americans adopted during this period—shopping, sports, and reading popular magazines and newspapers—contributed to the development of a commonly shared American culture that would persist for the next century.
Industrialization and urbanization changed the lives of American workers. The application of scientific discoveries and technological innovations by the free enterprise system improved the standard of living in the United States. Driven by entrepreneurs, American businesses were able to create products and services that made daily life easier and more fun for many people. Mass produced materials and products lowered the prices of many goods, enabling ordinary Americans to purchase items that previously had been out of reach.
In addition, more people began to work for wages —in offices, on public transportation systems, or in factories as laborers and foremen. Even some farmers found themselves with extra time and cash as machinery improved and they were easily able to grow and sell more crops. At the same time, more products were available than ever before and at lower prices. This led to a culture of conspicuous consumerism, in which people wanted and bought the many new products on the market. All but the very poorest working-class laborers

were able to do and buy more than they would have in the past.
New Ways of Shopping Expanding on a trend that was developing in Britain, France, Russia, and other countries, Rowland H. Macy opened what he called a department store in New York in 1858. It soon became the largest single store in America and served as a model for many more U.S. stores. Its sales methods— widespread advertising, a variety of goods organized into “departments,” and high-quality items at fair prices—became the standard in large urban stores. By the 1870s, many big cities had department stores: Jordan Marsh in Boston, Marshall Field in Chicago, and Wanamaker’s in Philadelphia.
John Wanamaker developed innovative ways to keep customers satisfied. He was the first to offer a money back guarantee. In addition, he placed large newspaper advertisements to attract customers. Later, Wanamaker became Postmaster General. In that position, he lowered the bulk shipping rates and began free delivery to rural areas, which led to a boom in the mail-order catalog business.
While department stores pioneered new marketing and sales techniques, companies began to create trademarks with distinctive logos that consumers would recognize. For the first time, consumers began

to notice and buy brand name goods. Long-distance shipping allowed consumers in Atlanta, Cincinnati, and San Francisco to purchase the same products.
Technology and Free Enterprise Lead to Higher Standards of Living After the Civil War, Americans began to measure success by what they could buy. Equating purchasing power with a higher social status, middle-class and some working-class consumers rushed to update their wardrobe with new clothing styles and to modernize their homes with new technologies, such as the carpet sweeper and the telephone. Technological innovations drove the development of new industries, which in turn created more jobs; wealth; and discretionary, or extra, income in consumers’ hands. The cost of living decreased in part because factory-manufactured products often cost less than old-style handmade goods. Scientific discoveries, including better sanitation and medical care, contributed to better health, causing life expectancy to climb. The result was more middle-class Americans with more money to spend and greater opportunities to spend it on things they chose rather than just on things they needed.
The end of the nineteenth century is sometimes called the Victorian Era, after the queen of England. The rich were richer than ever before, and the middle class tried to imitate their lifestyle. Factory-produced clothing and prepackaged food gave homemakers a break from some activities, but rising expectations of cleanliness and more complicated meals meant that they spent more time on those tasks.
Other luxuries, like indoor plumbing, also became common. On the other hand, many women had to work outside their homes to achieve a middle-class lifestyle.
Life changed for men, as well. Innovations in public transportation allowed families to live at a distance from the dirt, noise, and bustle of industry. However, it often meant that men became commuters, leaving home early in the morning and returning late in the evening. Still, their culture taught them that hard work would bring the reward of more discretionary income with which to purchase the exciting products newly available on the market.

Industry and Immigration 100	1.6 New Ways of Life
A
Mass Culture Develops One of the effects of the spread of transportation, communication, and advertising was that Americans all across the country became more and more alike in their consumption patterns. Rich and poor could wear the same clothing styles, although the quality of that clothing varied. Household gadgets, toys, and food preferences were often the same from house to house. This phenomenon is known as mass culture.
The Newspaper Industry Expands The newspapers of the Gilded Age both reflected and helped create mass culture. Between 1870 and 1900, the number of newspapers increased from about 600 to more than 1,600. No one knew more about newspapers than Joseph Pulitzer, a Hungarian immigrant who had fought in the Civil War. Active in Missouri politics in the 1870s, Pulitzer moved to New York in the 1880s, where he started a morning paper, the World. It was so successful that Pulitzer soon started publishing the Evening World. The papers were inexpensive because they were supported in part by businesses that placed advertisements in their pages.
The job of a newspaper, Pulitzer believed, was to inform people and to stir up controversy. His newspapers were sensationalistic, filled with exposes of political corruption, comics, sports, and illustrations. They were designed to get the widest possible readership, rather than simply to report the news. Pulitzer soon found a competitor in William Randolph Hearst, whose Morning Journal employed the same tactics. Their sensational styles sold many papers.
At the same time, ethnic and special-interest publishers catered to the array of urban dwellers, especially immigrants. The Philadelphia Tribune, begun in the 1880s, targeted the African American market. In New York, there were six Italian-language papers by 1910. Each sold more than 10,000 copies daily. The Yiddish-language daily paper, The Forward, sold 120,000 copies.
The Arts Reflect the Characteristics and Issues of the Times Mark Twain was not the only author to take a critical look at society during the Gilded Age. Novels that explored harsh realities were popular. Stephen Crane exposed the slums of New York in his Maggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893). He later wrote The Bed Badge of Courage, which explored the psychological aspects of war. Other novelists focused on moral issues. Horatio Alger wrote about characters who succeeded by hard work, while Henry James and Edith Wharton questioned a society based upon rigid rules of conduct. Playwrights such as John Augustin Daly mirrored Twain’s disapproval of the Gilded Age.
» Joseph Pulitzer’s Evening World enjoyed a large readership.
Musicians and songwriters, who explored the realities of everyday life, also flourished in the Gilded Age. A section of New York City, which would eventually be named Tin Pan Alley, became the center of the music publishing industry and the name of the style of popular music developed there. These music publishers provided sheet music that Americans throughout the country could enjoy in their homes. Ragtime, a forerunner to jazz music, was also gaining popularity. Developed by African Americans, ragtime was upbeat and highly rhythmic, which some people found disturbing.
The vitality of city life also inspired graphic artists. Philadelphia’s Thomas Eakins painted a larger-than-life illustration of a medical operation, complete with exposed flesh. Painter Robert Henri and his associates developed a style of painting known as the Ashcan School that dramatized the starkness and squalor of New York City slums and street life.
The Growth of Public Schools Newspapers and literature flourished, in part, because more Americans could read. Public education expanded rapidly. Slowly in the South and rapidly in the North, grade-school education became compulsory. Many locales provided public high schools, although only a small percentage of young people attended. In 1870, the nation had only

a few hundred high schools; in 1910, there were more than 5,000. Kindergartens also appeared as a way to help working-class mothers. As a result, the literacy rate climbed to nearly 90 percent by 1900.
Schools taught courses in science, woodworking, and drafting, providing skills that workers needed in budding industries. The curriculum also included civics and business training. Urban leaders counted on schools to help Americanize immigrants, teaching them English and shaping them into good citizens.
Teacher-training schools responded to the call. Not only did they grow in number, but they also developed more sophisticated ideas about teaching and learning. Reformer John Dewey sought to enhance student learning by introducing new teaching methods.
Institutions of higher education also began to provide specialized training for urban careers. Today’s liberal arts curriculum was largely designed during this era. A few of the new careers—teaching, social work, and nursing—were open to middle-class women. This led to an upsurge in women’s colleges, since women were barred from many men’s colleges. However, many state universities began to accept women into their classes.
Limited access to white institutions led to a growth in schools and colleges for African Americans. Across the South, the number of normal schools, agricultural colleges, and industrial-training schools mushroomed as the children of newly freed slaves set out to prepare to compete as free people.

Boom in Popular Entertainment
Urban areas with thousands of people became centers for new types of entertainment in the Gilded Age. Clubs, music halls, and sports venues attracted large crowds with time and money to spend. The middle class began to take vacations at this time, while the working classes looked for opportunities to escape from the busy city, even if just for a day.

Amusement Parks Attract City Dwellers In 1884, Lamarcus Thompson opened the world’s first roller
Industry and Immigration 102	1.6 New Ways of Life
coaster. At ten cents a ride, Thompson averaged more than $600 per day in income. The roller coaster was the first ride to open at Coney Island—the nation’s best-known amusement park—at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean in New York City. Soon, Coney Island added a hotel and a horseracing track. Similar amusement parks, located within easy reach of a city, were built around the country.
While earlier generations had enjoyed a picnic in the park, the new urbanite—even those with limited means—willingly paid the entry fees for these new, more thrilling, entertainments. Urban residents of all ethnicities and races could be found at these amusement spots, though each group was usually relegated to a particular area of the parks. The parks represented a daylong vacation for city laborers who could not afford to take the long seaside vacations enjoyed by the wealthy.
Audiences Flock to Outdoor Events In 1883, “Buffalo Bill” Cody threw a Fourth of July celebration near his ranch in Nebraska. He offered prizes for competitions in riding, roping, and shooting. So many people attended that Cody took his show on the road, booking performances at points along railroad lines. Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show toured America and Europe, shaping the world’s romantic notion of the American West. The show included markswoman Annie Oakley and the Sioux leader Sitting Bull, as well as displays of riding, roping, and horse-and-rider stunts.
Religious-inspired entertainment also grew in popularity. The Chautauqua Circuit, a kind of summer camp that opened in 1874, sponsored lectures and entertainment along New York’s Chautauqua Lake. It began as a summer school for Methodist Sunday school teachers but soon became—and remains today—something of a cross between community college and a country fair, with lectures on intellectual subjects, music, exotic food, and crowd-pleasing special attractions. Soon, Chautauqua leaders were transporting their tents to small towns all across America to deliver comic storytelling, bands and singers, and lectures on politics or morals. A family might stay at a camp for as long as two weeks. Many people saw their first “moving pictures,” or movies, in a Chautauqua tent. Theodore Roosevelt called Chautauqua “the most American thing in America.”
New Forms of Urban Entertainment Cities, with their dense populations, offered many glitzy shows and various types of entertainment. At first, vaudeville shows were a medley of musical drama, songs, and off-color comedy. In 1881, an entrepreneur named Tony Pastor opened a theater in New York, aiming to provide

families with a "straight, clean variety show.” By 1900, a few companies owned chains of vaudeville theaters, stretching all across the country.
Performance theater was not the only option. Movie theaters, called nickelodeons, soon introduced motion pictures, charging a nickel for admission. Films such as The Great Train Robbery became wildly popular. In music halls, ragtime bands created a style of music that would later evolve into jazz.
Some cities—including Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, Buffalo, and Omaha—hosted exhibitions of new technology and entertainment. These extravaganzas stretched Americans’ imaginations to see a future filled with machines and gadgets and other technological innovations that would continue to improve their lives. Millions of visitors saw everything from steam engines to typewriters and telephones. In many ways, the new amusements mirrored urban life, filled with variety, drama, bright colors, and a very fast pace.
Organized Sports Attract New Fans Baseball— America’s national sport—had been around for a number of years before the National League organized it into a business in 1876. After that, baseball soon became a public show. Major cities built stadiums that seated thousands, like Boston’s Fenway Park.
Industry and Immigration {103*1 1.6 New Ways of Life
» Pitcher Cy Young won 511 games over his career and helped the Boston Red Sox win the 1903 World Series.
Stadium billboards advertising everything from other sports to toothpaste and patent medicines helped pay for the extravaganza. There were even baseball songs. The most famous—Take Me Out to the Ball Game— was written in 1908. Until 1887, teams sometimes included African American players. After the Chicago White Stockings refused to play against a team that had a black player, separate African American teams emerged by 1900.
Like baseball, horse racing, bicycle racing, boxing, and football became popular spectator sports. University football clubs formed on campuses around the country, but they faced a public outcry at the violence of the game. Rule changes made it into the sport we know today. Meanwhile, James Naismith invented basketball at the Springfield, Massachusetts, YMCA in 1891. Heroes emerged in major sports, particularly in boxing, as immigrants and ethnic Americans rooted for the boxers who shared their background.

Enduring Understandings
•	As Americans continued to migrate, Native Americans and Mexican Americans already living in the West were pressured and pushed aside.
•	Mining, ranching, and farming drew people to settle in the Great Plains and other parts of the West, helped by the growth of the railroad.
•	Different groups of people in the West used land and resources differently, leading to conflict in some places.
•	Corruption and difficult conditions for farmers led to a push to reform.
PEARSON
Two Ogala chiefs, American Horse (left) and Red Cloud (right) led the resistance against the government's plans to build a road through Sioux hunting grounds.
In 1787, the Constitution granted sole power for regulating trade with the Native Americans to the federal government.
This began the long, strained relationship between the federal government and Native Americans. During the 1830s, the federal government forced Native Americans from the east to resettle west of the Mississippi River and promised them the land there forever. In the 1840s through the 1860s, pressure from white settlers weakened this promise. The conflicts between settlers and Native Americans continued during and after the Civil War. The interaction changed both cultures, but irrevocably damaged Native American cultures.

American Indians Under Pressure
Cultures Forced to Adapt
By the end of the Civil War, most Native Americans—about 250,000 of them—lived in the region west of the Mississippi River referred to as “The Great American Desert.” Although they were lumped together in the minds of most Americans as “Indians,” Native Americans embraced many different belief systems, languages, and ways of life.

Cultural Similarities and Differences Geography influenced the cultural diversity of Native Americans. In the Pacific Northwest, the Klamaths, Chinooks, and Shastas benefited from abundant supplies of fish and forest animals. Farther south, smaller bands of hunter-gatherers struggled to exist on diets of small game, insects, berries, acorns, and roots. In the arid lands of New Mexico and Arizona, the Pueblos irrigated the land to grow corn, beans, and squash. They built adobe homes high in the cliffs to protect themselves from aggressive neighbors. The more mobile Navajos lived in homes made of mud or in hogans that could be moved easily.
The most numerous and nomadic Native Americans were the Plains Indians, including the Sioux, Blackfeet, Crows, Cheyenne, and Comanches. Some of these groups included Indians from east of the

Appalachians, who had blended into the Plains Indian groups. The Plains Indians were expert horsemen and hunters. The millions of buffalo that roamed the Plains provided a rich source for lodging, clothing, food, and tools.
Indian cultures shared a common thread—they saw themselves as part of nature and respected the natural world. Many white people valued and respected nature, too. However, many also viewed the land as a resource that could be used to produce wealth. These differing views sowed the seeds of conflict.
American Settlers Move West In the early 1800s, the government carried out a policy of moving Native Americans out of the way of white settlers.
President Jackson moved the Cherokees off their land in Georgia and onto the Great Plains. To white settlers, Native Americans were welcome to what they called the Great American Desert as they thought it was uninhabitable. To limit conflict, an 1834 law regulated trade relations with Indians and strictly limited the access of white people to this Indian Territory. New European-American settlement generally paused at the eastern rim of the territory and resumed in the Far West.
By the 1850s, however, federal policy toward Native Americans was again challenged: gold and silver had been discovered in Indian Territory as well as settled
regions farther west. Americans also wanted a railroad that crossed the continent. In 1851, therefore, the federal government began to restrict Indians to smaller areas. By the late 1860s, many Indian peoples had been placed on reservations, specific areas set aside by the government for the Indians’ use. This change in their demographic patterns, a direct result of being forced to migrate to reservations, made their previous ways of life difficult if not impossible to sustain. Indians often faced poverty and the loss of their traditional ways of life on reservations.
Two more developments also threatened Native American civilizations: White settlers introduced diseases to which Indians had no immunity, and the vitally important buffalo herds were destroyed. In the 1870s, hunters would kill hundreds of buffaloes in a single day for their hides. They skinned the animals and left the meat to rot. In addition, trainloads of tourists arrived to kill buffaloes purely for sport. They left both the meat and the valuable hides behind.

Challenges in the Late 1800s	119	2.1 American Indians Under Pressure
Settlers and Native
Americans Collide
The rapid industrial development and economic expansion that followed the Civil War set Native Americans and white settlers on a path to conflict. Advances in communication and transportation that supported industrial growth also reinforced white Americans’ faith in manifest destiny. Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, encouraged the poor to move west.
If you strike off into the broad, free
West, and make yourself a farm from
Uncle Sam’s generous domain, you will crowd nobody, starve nobody, and neither you nor your children need evermore beg. . . .
—New York Tribune, February 5, 1867
Greeley, and many others, ignored the fact that Native Americans inhabited half of the area of the United States. Indians often fought to retain or regain whatever they could.
Conflict Throughout the Plains In 1862, while the Civil War raged in the East, a group of Sioux Indians
resisted threats to their land rights by attacking European-American settlements in eastern Minnesota. In several attacks, the Sioux killed more than 400 settlers, including many women and children. In response, the government waged a full-scale war against the Sioux, who then were pushed west into the Dakotas.
The Sioux rebellion sparked a series of attacks on settlements and stagecoach lines as other Plains Indians also saw their way of life slipping away. Each battle took its toll, raising the level of distrust on all sides. In the fall of 1864, a band of Colorado militia under commanding officer John Chivington came upon a camp of Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians near Fort Lyons at Sand Creek. The fort’s commander had given the Cheyenne leader permission to stay there temporarily. Chivington’s troops opened fire, killing between 150 to 200 Cheyenne and Arapaho men, women, and children.
The incident became known as the Sand Creek Massacre. It spawned another round of warfare as Plains Indians joined forces to repel white settlement.
Once the Civil War ended, regiments of Union troops—both white and African American—were sent to the West to bring peace to the plains. Recruitment posters for volunteer cavalry promised that soldiers could claim any "horses or other plunder” taken from

the Indians. The federal government asserted that the troops were needed to maintain order.
Efforts to Promote Peace Fail As the Plains Indians renewed their efforts to hold onto what they had, the federal government announced plans to build a road through Sioux hunting grounds to connect goldmining towns in Montana. Hostilities intensified. In 1866, the legendary warrior Red Cloud and his followers led Captain William Fetterman and his troops into an ambush, killing them all. The human costs of the struggle drew a public outcry and called the government’s Indian policy into question.
As reformers and humanitarians promoted education for Indians, European-American settlers sought strict controls over them. The government-appointed United States Indian Peace Commission concluded that lasting peace would come only if Native Americans settled on farms and reservations and adapted to the white way of life.
In an effort to pacify the Sioux, the government offered the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. The government agreed not to build the road through Sioux territory and to abandon three forts. The treaty included the Black Hills in the Sioux reservation, and it also promised a school and other communal buildings. The Sioux and other Indians who signed the treaty agreed to live on
a reservation under federal supervision with support from the federal government.
This type of promise of government support to Native Americans was part of many agreements between the government and Native American groups who were going onto reservations in various parts of the West.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs, established in 1824, handled affairs between Native Americans and the government. The agency appointed an agent who was responsible for distributing land and adequate supplies to anyone willing to farm as well as for maintaining peaceful relations between a reservation and its neighbors.
The government's plans and policies for peace did not always work out, however. Most Native Americans were disappointed with the reservations on which they were living and had little trust that government would keep its promises. Chief Piapot, an Indian leader in Canada facing a similar situation with the government there, offered his viewpoint:
In order to become sole masters of our land they relegated us to small reservations as big as my hand and make us long promises, as long as my arm; but the next year the promises

—Chief Piapot, 1895
Unfortunately, in the United States, many Indian agents were unscrupulous and stole funds and resources that were supposed to be distributed to the Indians. Even the most well-meaning agents often lacked support from the federal government or the military to enforce the terms of the treaties that were beneficial to Native Americans. Not unexpectedly, some Indians refused to live under such conditions.
H CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why did tensions exist between settlers and Native Americans?
The Indian Wars Conclude
The conditions facing Native Americans had all the ingredients for tragedy. Indians were confined to isolated areas, which were regularly ravaged by poverty and disease. The government, intentionally or not, failed to live up to many of the promises made to various groups of Native Americans. Frustration, particularly among young warriors, turned to violence. Guns replaced treaties as the government defeated Native Americans who were openly rebelling.
The Long Walk of the Navajos In 1863 the government sent the famous frontiersman Kit Carson to subdue the Navajos, who were fighting to protect their southwestern homeland. After Carson’s forces destroyed their homes, crops, and livestock, about two thirds of the 12,000 Navajos surrendered in 1864. Carson then sent them on a 300-mile forced march, known as the Long Walk, to a reservation in what is now eastern New Mexico.
The poor soil on the small reservation was not suited to the kinds of agriculture the Navajos practiced. In addition, they were forced to live alongside their Apache enemies. Finally, after four years of death, disease, and starvation, the government relented. The surviving Navajos were allowed to return to a new reservation in their homeland.
The Southern Plains Indians Surrender The Red
River War, a series of major and minor incidents, led to the final defeat of the powerful southern Plains Indians, including the Kiowas and Comanches. It marked the end of the southern buffalo herds and the opening of the western panhandle of Texas to white settlement.
Challenges in the Late 1800s	122	2.1 American Indians Under Pressure
At the heart of the matter was the failure of the United States government to abide by and enforce the terms of the 1867 Treaty of Medicine Lodge. White buffalo hunters were not kept off Indian hunting grounds, food and supplies from the government were not delivered, and white lawlessness was not punished. Hostilities began with an attack by Indians on a group of Texans near the Red River in June 1874. Hostilities ended a year later, after the last Comanche holdouts surrendered to U.S. troops.
Battle of the Little Big Horn It was the lure of gold that led to the defeat of the Indians on the northern Plains. The Black Hills Gold Rush of 1875 drew prospectors onto Sioux hunting grounds in the Dakotas and neighboring Montana. Some of this area was supposed to be protected by the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. When the Sioux, led by chiefs Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, assembled to drive them out, the U.S. Army sent its own troops against the Native Americans.
In June 1876, a colonel named George Custer rushed ahead of the other columns of the U.S. cavalry and arrived a day ahead of the main force. Near the Little Bighorn River, in present-day Montana, Custer and his force of about 250 men unexpectedly came upon a group of at least 2,000 Indians. Crazy Horse led the charge at what became known as the Battle of the Little Big Horn, killing Custer and all of his men.
Cries for revenge motivated army forces to track down the Indians. Sitting Bull and a small group of followers escaped to Canada. Crazy Horse and his followers surrendered, beaten by weather and starvation. By then, their will and the means to wage major resistance had been crushed.
The Fighting Concludes Further West Farther west, in Idaho, another powerful drama played out. In 1877, the federal government decided to move the Nez Perces to a smaller reservation to make room for white settlers. Many of the Nez Perces were Christians and had settled down and become successful horse and cattle breeders. They had a great deal to lose.
Trying to evade U.S. troops who had come to enforce their relocation, the Nez Perces’s leader Chief Joseph led a group of refugees on a trek of more than 1,300 miles to Canada. Stopped just short of the border, Chief Joseph surrendered with deeply felt words: “I will fight no more forever.” Banished with his group to a barren reservation in Oklahoma, he later traveled twice to Washington, D.C., to unsuccessfully appeal for his people’s return to their homeland.
» Sitting Bull was a famed fighter and Hunkpapa war chief. By the late 1860s, his reputation was so great that the Lakota Sioux chose him as the first-ever chief of all seven Lakota tribes.
Indian Resistance Comes to an End With the loss of many leaders and the destruction of their economy, Native Americans’ ability to resist diminished.
In response, many Indians welcomed a religious revival based on the Ghost Dance. Practitioners preached that the ritual would banish white settlers and restore the buffalo to the Plains. As the popularity of the movement spread, government officials became concerned about where it might lead.
In 1890, in an effort to curtail these activities, the government ordered the arrest of Sitting Bull. In the confrontation, he and several others were killed. In response, a group of Sioux left their reservation, hoping to hide out in the Badlands region. Troops then set out after the group of Indians as they fled. The cavalry finally caught up with them at Wounded Knee, in present-day South Dakota. Having been partially disarmed by U.S. troops, the Sioux were badly outgunned in the fight that followed. In the end, more than 100 men, women, and children died. The end of the Ghost Dance War at Wounded Knee also marked the end of major Indian resistance to white expansion and large-scale resistance to the Indian policies of the United States government.

Encourages
Assimilation
The reservation policy was a failure. Making Indians live in confined areas as wards of the government was costly in human and economic terms. Policy makers hoped that as the buffalo became extinct, Indians would become farmers and be assimilated into national life by adopting the culture and civilization of whites.
Critics Disagree with Indian Policies
A few outspoken critics defended the Indians’ way of life. In A Century of Dishonor, Helen Hunt Jackson decried the government's treatment of Native Americans. Susette La Flesche, the granddaughter of a French trader and an Omaha Indian woman, also used her writing and lecturing talents to fight for recognition of the Indians and Indian rights in the courts. Born on the Omaha reservation in Nebraska, she studied in the East and returned to the reservation to teach.
The Americanization Movement In
1871, Congress had passed a law stating that “no Indian nation or tribe within the United States would be recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty.” Indians were now to be dealt with as individuals. One reason for this change was to weaken Native Americans’ tribal cultures.
Reformers believed that Indians had to give up tribal loyalties and behaviors before they could adopt mainstream American values and assimilate into American society. The Americanization movement aimed at Native Americans was also aimed at new immigrants from other countries.
One way reformers thought assimilation and Americanization could be accomplished was with the passage
of the Dawes General Allotment
Act (sometimes known as the Dawes Severalty Act) by Congress in 1887, which encouraged Indians to become private
Challenges in the Late 1800s	124	2.1 American Indians Under Pressure
property owners and farmers. The Dawes Act ended the reservations' tribal landholding system. Each Indian family was allotted, or assigned, 160-acres of the tribe's reservation to own as a farmstead. The size of these allotments was based on the eastern experience of how much land was needed to support a family. In the arid West, however, the allotment was often not big enough.
To protect Indian landowners from unscrupulous land speculators, the Dawes Act specified that the land could not be sold or transferred from its original family for 25 years. Congress hoped that by the end of that time, younger Indians would embrace the values of farming and individual land ownership.
Traditional tribal feasts, dances, and even funeral practices were outlawed, and Native American religions were discouraged. To further speed assimilation, missionaries and other reformers established boarding schools, to which Indian parents were pressured to send their children. There Indian children were to learn and live by the rules, dress, customs, and culture of white America. Ultimately, the struggle to retain their homelands, freedom, and culture proved tragic. Although many Indian peoples faced these challenges with courage and determination, tens of thousands died in war or on poverty-stricken reservations. Only a small number were left to carry on their legacy.

The West was swept by enormous change after the Civil War. As railroads increased access, settlers, ranchers, and miners permanently transformed millions of acres of western land. Mining was the first great boom in the West. Gold and silver were the magnets that attracted a vast number of people. Prospectors from the East were just a part of a flood that included people from all around the world.

Mining Towns Expand Across the West From the Sierra Nevada to the Black Hills, there was a similar pattern and tempo to the development of mining regions. First came the discovery of gold or silver.
Then, as word spread, people began to pour into areas such as Pikes Peak in Colorado and the Yukon river near what is now Alaska. During the Klondike Gold Rush, mining camps sprang up quickly to house the thousands of people who flooded the region near the Yukon river. They were followed by more substantial communities. Miners dreamed of finding riches quickly and easily. Others saw an opportunity to make their fortune by supplying the needs of miners for food, clothing, and supplies.
The rough-and-tumble environment of these communities called out for order. To limit violence and administer justice in areas without judges or jails, miners set up rules of conduct and procedures for settling disputes. In extreme situations, self-appointed law enforcers known as vigilantes punished lawbreakers. As towns developed,

they hired marshals and sheriffs, like Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson, to keep the peace. Churches set up committees to address social problems.
Some mining towns—like Leadville, Colorado, and Nevada City, Montana—were “boomtowns.” They thrived only as long as the gold and silver held out.
Even if a town had developed churches and schools, it might become a ghost town, abandoned when the precious metal disappeared. In contrast, Denver, Colorado; Boise, Idaho; and Helena, Montana, were among the cities that diversified and grew.
Mining Becomes Big Business The first western mining was done by individuals, who extracted the minerals from the surface soil or a stream bed. By the 1870s, the remaining mineral wealth was located deep underground. Big companies with the capital to buy mining equipment took over the industry. Machines drilled deep mine shafts. Tracks lined miles of underground tunnels. Crews—often recruited from Mexico and China—worked in dangerous conditions underground.
The arrival of the big mining companies highlighted an issue that would relentlessly plague the West: water and its uses. Large-scale mining required lots of water pumped under high pressure to help separate the precious metals from silt. As the silt washed down the
mountains, it fouled water being used by farmers and their livestock.
Despite these concerns, the federal government continued to support large mining companies by providing inexpensive land and approving patents for new inventions. Mining wealth helped fuel the nation’s industrial development.
The Transcontinental Railroad Impacts the Frontier As industry in the West grew, the need for a railroad to transport goods increased as well. The idea of a transcontinental railroad, a rail link between the East and the West, was not new. Arguments over the route it should take, however, had delayed implementation. While the Civil War kept the South out of the running, Congress finally took action.
Unlike Europe, where railroads were built and owned by governments, in the United States, not all railroads were built with government support; they were built by private enterprise. However, Congress encouraged construction of the transcontinental railroad in two ways: It provided money in the form of loans and made land grants, giving builders wide stretches of land, alternating on each side of the track route.
Simultaneously in 1863, the Central Pacific started laying track eastward from Sacramento, California, while the Union Pacific headed westward from Omaha,

Nebraska. Construction proved to be both difficult and expensive.
The human cost of building the railroad was also high. Starved for labor, the Central Pacific Company brought recruits from China and set them to work under harsh contracts and with little regard for their safety. Inch by inch, they chipped and blasted their way through the granite-hard Sierra Nevada and Rockies. Meanwhile, working for the Union Pacific, crews of Irish immigrants crossed the level plains from the East. The two tracks eventually met at Promontory, Utah, in 1869, the same year that the Suez Canal was completed in Egypt. The continent and the world seemed to be shrinking in size.
Railroads Spur Settlement and Growth The
completion of the Transcontinental Railroad inspired a flurry of similar railroad building. By 1883, the Northen Pacific Railroad had connected St. Paul, Minnesota, with Seattle in Washington Territory.
Ten years later, James J. Hill completed a competing railroad line between St. Paul and Everett, Washington. Hill and his business partners built the Great Northern Railway without any government support. His low fares drew thousands of immigrants and other Americans to migrate west and settle along his tracks. His success allowed him to eventually gain control of the Northern Pacific, too.
The effects of the railroads were far reaching. They tied the nation together, moved products and people, and spurred industrial development. They brought western meat and farm products to the tables of eastern consumers. In turn, goods manufactured in eastern factories moved west by train and improved the lives
of settlers on the frontier. Once again, the application of technological innovation by the free enterprise system was clearly raising the standard of living in the United States.
The growth of railroads also stimulated the growth of towns and cities. Speculators vied for land in places where a new railroad might be built, and towns already in existence petitioned to become a stop on the western rail route. Railroads intensified the demand for Indians’ land and brought white settlers who overwhelmed Mexican American communities in the Southwest. The economic impact of the transcontinental railroads helped lead to the closing of the frontier in the late nineteeth century. There was no turning back the tide as waves of pioneers moved west. The arrival of masses of new residents led to changes in political boundaries, as territories became states.
The addition of states to the Union exemplifies the West’s growth. Requirements for statehood included a population of at least 60,000 inhabitants. Between 1864 and 1896, ten territories met those requirements and became states.

The Cattle Industry Boom
Cattle ranching fueled another western boom. This was sparked by the vast acres of grass suitable for feeding herds of cattle. Once the railroad provided the means to move livestock to eastern markets, the race was on for land and water.

» Ranching was an important economic activity throughout much of the West. Analyze Maps How might the physical geography of the West have affected where ranching most flourished?

Longhorns and Vaqueros Long before the arrival of eastern settlers in the West, Mexicans in Texas had developed an efficient system for raising livestock. The Texas longhorn, which originated in Mexico, roamed freely and foraged for its own feed. Each owner marked—or “branded”—the cattle so they could be identified. Under this open-range system, property was not fenced in. Though ranchers claimed ownership and knew the boundaries of their property, cattle from any ranch grazed freely across those boundaries. When spring came, the ranchers would hire cowboys to comb thousands of acres of open range, “rounding up” cattle that had roamed all winter.
The culture of the cowboy owed its very existence to the Mexican vaqueros who had learned to train horses to work with cattle and had developed the roping skills, saddle, lariat, and chaps needed to do the job.
Cowboys and Cattle Drives Once the cattle were rounded up, cowboys began the long cattle drive to take the animals to a railroad that would transport them to eastern markets. The trek from Texas, Colorado, or Montana to the nearest junction on the transcontinental railroad could take weeks or even months.
The cowboys’ work was hard, dangerous, low-paying, and lonely—often involving months of chasing cattle over the countryside. A band of cowboys
often included a mix of white, Mexican, and African American men.
Cow Towns Cattle drives concluded in such railroad towns as Dodge City, Kansas, where the cattle were sold and the cowboys were paid. These “cow towns” gave rise to stories about colorful characters, often outlaws, such as Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holliday, Wyatt Earp, and Jesse James. They were also the site of rodeos, competitions based on the cowboys' skills of riding, roping, and wrestling cattle. Bill Pickett, an African American cowboy, is credited with inventing bulldogging, in which a cowboy leaps from his horse onto a steer’s horns and wrestles the steer to the ground.
The Open Range Comes to a Close Open-range ranching flourished for more than a decade after the Civil War. During that time, several million cattle were driven from Texas north to railroad stops in Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas. However, by the mid-1880s, the heyday of open-range ranching came to an end.
Several factors contributed to the demise of the open range. The invention of barbed wire made it possible to fence in huge tracts of land on the treeless plains. The supply of beef exceeded demand, and the price of beef dropped sharply. Added to these factors

was a period of extreme weather in the 1880s—brutally freezing winters followed by summer droughts. As springs dried up, herds of cattle starved. The nature of cattle ranching changed as ranchers began to raise hay to feed their stock, and farmers and sheepherders settled on what had been open range.
B CHECK UNDERSTANDING
How did the railroad affect the cattle industry?
Farmers Settle the Plains
The Great Plains were the last part of the country to be heavily settled by white people. The region was originally set aside for Indians because it was viewed as too dry for agriculture. Yet, with the coming of the transcontinental railroad, millions of farmers moved into the West in the last huge westward migration of European Americans in the mid to late 1800s.
The push-and-pull factors that encouraged settlement were varied. Like the miners and cattle ranchers, farmers were looking for a better life.
Railroads advertised land for sale, even sending agents to Europe to lure new immigrants, especially from Scandinavia. Other immigrants fled political upheavals in their native lands.
Westward Migration and Settlement Throughout its history, the nation’s westward expansion had been marked by migrants settling on public land they did not own. These settlers, called “squatters,” pressured the government to allow them to gain ownership of this land. In 1841, Congress passed the Preemption Act, giving squatters the right to buy up to 160 acres for $1.25 per acre before the land was offered for sale to other buyers. This law set the stage for the Homestead Act, passed in 1862. Under the Homestead Act, the government offered farm plots of 160 acres to anyone willing to live on the land for five years, dig a well, and build a road. These two laws encouraged further settlement and farming in the West, eventually leading to the close of the frontier.
Opportunities in the West such as mining and cattle herding were generally male occupations, so much of the western migration was led by men. But as farming expanded, more women arrived, too. They all had a job to do, such as tending the family and farm or working as an entrepreneur running a boardinghouse, laundry, or bakery.
Some of the new settlers were former slaves who fled the South after the end of Reconstruction. Benjamin Singleton, a black businessman from Tennessee, helped organize a group of African Americans called the “Exodusters.” They took their name from the

biblical story of Moses leading the exodus of the Jews out of bondage and into a new life in the “Promised Land." The Exodusters’ “promised land” was in Kansas and Oklahoma, where they planted crops and founded several enduring all-black towns.
Homesteading the Plains Physical and human geographic factors made the lives of homesteaders on the Plains difficult. Windstorms, blizzards, droughts, plagues of locusts, and heart-rending loneliness tested their endurance. On the treeless plains, few new arrivals could afford to buy lumber to build a home. Instead, they cut 3-foot sections of sod and stacked them like bricks, leaving space for a door and one window. The resulting home was dark, dirty, and dingy.
Necessity is the mother of invention, and farmers on the Plains had many needs beyond housing. The development of barbed wire, a length of wire with twisted barbs, enabled a farmer to fence land cheaply to keep out wandering livestock. The development of a plow that could tackle the sod-covered land, the grain drill that opened furrows and planted seed, the windmill that tapped underground water, and dryfarming techniques were some of the innovations that enabled farmers to succeed. To spur development of better ways to farm, Congress passed the Morrill Act in

Nothing, however, prepared farmers for a series of blizzards and droughts in the 1880s and 1890s that killed animals and ruined harvests. Some of the discouraged and ill-prepared settlers headed back east. The farmers who remained became more commercial and depended more on scientific farming methods.

Minorities Encounter Difficulties
From the 1850s onward, the West had the widest diversity of people in the nation. With fewer than 20 percent of the nation’s total population, it was home to more than 80 percent of the nation's Asian, Mexican and Mexican American, and Native American residents. Almost all of the nation’s 100,000 Chinese immigrants lived in the West.

Challenges in the Late 1800s
Economic Issues Challenge Chinese Immigrants
During the same time that Jim Crow arose in the South, Chinese immigrants faced racial prejudice on the West Coast. In 1879, California barred cities from employing people of Chinese ancestry. Several years later, San Francisco established a segregated “Oriental” school. Elsewhere, mobs of whites attacked Chinese workers, saying they had taken “white” jobs. Congress responded to these attacks by passing the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, which prohibited Chinese laborers from entering the country.
Brave Chinese immigrants challenged discrimination. Saum Song Bo questioned why he should support a fund-raising drive to build the Statue of Liberty. “That statue represents Liberty holding a torch which lights the passage of those of all nations who come into this country,” Bo wrote in a letter published in American Missionary in 1898. “But are the Chinese allowed to come? As for the Chinese who are here, are they allowed to enjoy liberty as men of all other nationalities enjoy it?”
Chinese immigrants also turned to the federal courts to protect their rights but with mixed results. In 1886, in the case of Yick Wo v. Hopkins, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with a Chinese immigrant who challenged a California law that banned him and other Chinese from operating a laundry. In 1898, the Court ruled that individuals of Chinese descent, born in the United States, could not be stripped of their citizenship. Yet the Court upheld the Chinese Exclusion Act and several other discriminatory measures.
Land Ownership Proves Difficult for Mexican Americans Like African Americans and Asian Americans, Mexican Americans struggled against discrimination in the latter decades of the 1800s. One historian has described Mexican Americans as “foreigners in their own land.” At the center of their struggle stood land. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed at the end of the Mexican-American War, guaranteed the property rights of Mexicans who lived in the Southwest prior to the war. Still, four out of five Mexican Americans who lived in New Mexico lost their land, as did Mexican Americans in other southwestern states.
This land loss resulted from several factors. When Anglo Americans and Mexican Americans laid claim to the same land, U.S. courts put the burden of proof on Mexican Americans to show that they really owned the land. Differences in legal customs, and the fact that much of the land was held communally, not individually made it difficult for many Mexican Americans to do so.
In addition, Anglo Americans used political connections to take land away from Mexican Americans.
132	2.2 The West Is Transformed
The "Sante Fe Ring,” an association of prominent white businessmen and government officials, got the federal government to grant the group control of millions of acres of land in New Mexico. Thousands of Mexican Americans had lived on and farmed this land for many years. Since New Mexico was a territory, not a state, however, Mexican Americans, who comprised the majority of the population, had no representatives in Washington, D.C., to challenge this deal.
Mexican Americans Defend Property Rights
Throughout the Southwest—in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California—Mexican Americans fought to maintain their rights. Many especially resented the loss of their land. One group, Las Gorras Blancas, targeted the property of large ranch owners by cutting holes in barbed-wire fences and burning houses. The group declared: “Our purpose is to protect the rights and interests of the people in general; especially those of the helpless classes.” Supported by a national labor organization, the Knights of Labor, the group also had a newspaper to voice their grievances.
As anti-Mexican feelings increased, a group of Hispanic citizens in Tucson, Arizona, formed the Alianza Hispano-Americana in 1894 to protect the culture, interests, and legal rights of Mexican Americans. Within two years, new branches of the organization opened in other cities.

Struggles and Change Across the West
There is a sharp contrast between the picture of the West depicted in novels and movies and the reality of life on the Plains. The West was a place of rugged beauty, but it was also a place of diversity and conflict.
Tension Over Economic Resources The various ways that settlers sought to use western land were sometimes at odds with one another. Conflicts between miners, ranchers, sheepherders, and farmers led to violence and acts of sabotage. Grazing cattle ruined farmers’ crops, and sheep gnawed grass so close to the ground that cattle could not graze the same land. Although miners did not compete for vast stretches of grassland, runoff from large-scale mining polluted water that ran onto the Plains and everyone needed water. And no matter who won, Native Americans lost.
» Miners used a great deal of water in their mining operations, often with negative consequences for farmers and ranchers.
Early on, geologist John Wesley Powell recognized water as an important but limited resource. He promoted community control and distribution of water for the common good. Despite his efforts, water usage remained largely unregulated, a system that benefited some but disadvantaged others.
Prejudices and Discrimination Conflict came in many guises. For example, ranchers often belittled homesteaders, labeling them “sodbusters” to mock their work in the soil and their modest houses. Conflict also arose because the view of the ownership of natural resources varied. For many generations, Mexicans had mined salt from the salt beds of the El Paso valley. Mexicans viewed these areas as public property, open to all. However, when Americans arrived in the 1870s, they laid claim to the salt beds and aimed to sell the salt for profit. In 1877, in what became known as the El Paso Salt War, Americans and Mexicans clashed over access to this crucial commodity. When the battles ended, the salt beds were no longer communal property. Now, users would have to buy this natural product.
Ethnic tensions often lurked beneath the surface. Many foreign-born white people sought their fortunes on the American frontier, especially in the years following the mid-century revolutions in Europe. Their multiple languages joined the mix of several dozen

» Hopeful settlers gathered for the last great land rush in U.S. history, signaled by a cavalry bugle call at noon on April 22, 1889.
The following year, the 1890 national census revealed the extent of population growth in the West when it concluded that there was no longer a square mile of the United States that did not have at least a few white residents. The great American frontier was closed. This was in part due to completion of transcontinental railroads, which made it easier for people to migrate across the country. The country, the report said, no longer had a “frontier,” which at the time was considered an uninhabited wilderness where no white person lived. The era of free western land had come to an end.
However, the challenges and tensions were far from over. Controversies over Indians’ land rights were still to come. So, too, were more battles over water and over the mistreatment of minority citizens—especially Chinese and Mexican Americans. As African Americans migrated west and claimed places among the farmers, miners, railroad workers, entrepreneurs, inventors, and public servants, they indeed found new opportunities, but often these new opportunities were intertwined with discrimination.

Native American language groups. Differences in food, religion, and cultural practices reinforced each group’s fear and distrust of the others. But mostly it was in the larger cities or towns that discrimination was openly displayed. Chinese immigrants, Mexicans, and Mexican Americans were most often its targets.
Population Growth Ends the Frontier The last major land rush took place in 1889 when the federal government opened the Oklahoma Territory to homesteaders. On April 22, thousands of “boomers" gathered along the border. When the signal was given, they charged in to stake their claims. However, they found that much of the best land had already been taken by “sooners," who had sneaked into the territory and staked their claims before the official opening.

While Congress enacted many major reforms during Reconstruction, it passed very few measures between 1877 and 1900.

Former Civil War general Ulysses S. Grant proved unable to keep corruption and scandal from troubling his presidential administration.
Corruption Plagues the Nation
Political Power Proves Difficult to Keep
Party loyalties were so evenly divided that no faction or group gained control for any period of time. After Grant left office, only twice between 1877 and 1897 did either the Republicans or Democrats gain control of the White House and both houses of Congress at the same time. Furthermore, neither held control for more than two years in a row. This made it very difficult to pass new laws. Most of the elections were very close as well, allowing those who lost to block new legislation until they got back in power.
Political Corruption Under President Grant Ulysses S Grant was a popular war hero but a disappointing President. Allied with the Radical Republicans, he promised to take a strong stand against southern resistance to Reconstruction. But Grant s ability to lead was marred by scandal. He gave high-level advisory posts to untrustworthy friends and acquaintances who used their positions to line their own pockets.

Gould to corner the gold market actually included President Grant’s brother-in-law.
When Grant ran for reelection in 1872, some reform-minded Republicans withdrew their support and teamed up with some Democrats to create the Liberal Republican Party. The Liberal Republicans advocated civil service reform, removal of the army from the South, and an end to corruption in southern and national governments. Grant easily defeated their presidential candidate, the New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley.
Not long after the election, however, Americans sensed the aura of greed surrounding American politics. When scandal swirled around the members of his administration including his private secretary, the Secretary of War, and members of Congress, Grant seemed to look the other way. Even though he had stated, “Let no guilty man escape,” he seemed to lack the will to root out this corruption. Confidence in public officials plummeted.
Across the nation, local scandals came to light. Many city officials sold lucrative public construction contracts to their friends or diverted money from city accounts. The most notorious of these scandals involved a band of New York City Democratic politicians led by state senator William "Boss” Tweed. The “Tweed

Corruption Continues in Subsequent Administrations In comparison to Lincoln, Grant and the other Presidents of the Gilded Age that followed him appeared particularly weak. Although they, like Lincoln, won by slim margins that reflected the nation's diversity of opinion on important issues, these presidents differed from Lincoln in that, once in office, they lacked integrity. Rutherford B. Hayes owed his election in 1876 to a secret deal to end Reconstruction. Benjamin Harrison became only the second President in history to lose the popular vote but win the electoral college vote. Chester Arthur, who took the helm following James Garfield’s assassination, upset so many of his fellow Republicans that he failed to win his own party’s presidential nomination in 1884.
The most noteworthy President of the era was Grover Cleveland. In an era known for its corruption, Cleveland maintained a reputation for integrity. He once observed, "A Democratic thief is as bad as a Republican thief.” Cleveland enjoyed an extremely rapid rise to political prominence. In 1881, running as a reformer, he won the race for mayor in Buffalo, New York. A year later, he became the governor of New York, and in 1884, he became the first Democrat to win the White House in 24 years.
In 1888, even though he won the popular vote, Cleveland lost to Benjamin Harrison. But Cleveland came back to rewin the presidency in 1892.

workers, with little regard for their qualifications. Parties held elaborate rallies and parades to get out the vote. However, candidates for the presidency did not take part in the campaign. They felt it lowered the reputation of the presidency.
Parties developed sophisticated political machines that reached virtually into every ward, in every precinct, in many cities in the nation. In large cities, political machines were often run by “bosses” or a small group of people. These groups, like Tammany Hall in New York City or the Pendergast machine in Kansas City, controlled cities for decades. The political machines worked by winning the loyalty of large immigrant groups by promising, and in some cases, delivering, solutions to problems like poor sanitation or transportation. The spoils system also played a role, with political machines rewarding loyal organizers with city jobs. With voter loyalty secured, the political machine was assured of its political power and often became very corrupt.
The spoils system served as the glue that helped make the parties so powerful. The Postmaster General, who headed the U.S. Postal Service, for example, could reward thousands of supporters with jobs. Likewise, other officials could and did use federal contracts to convince people to vote for their candidates. Ironically, political participation probably got a boost from the spoils system and the fierce partisanship of the era.
About 75 to 80 percent of all those who could vote did vote in presidential elections during the Gilded Age.
Political Cartoons Alert the Public Though many Americans saw nothing wrong with politicians rewarding their friends, writers such as Mark Twain, political cartoonists, and others who thought about American politics expressed their concern about the damaging effects of corruption.
“The Bosses of the Senate,” one of the most famous political cartoons of the time, drawn by Joseph Keppler, showed a cluster of businessmen representing various trusts, glaring down on the chambers of the Senate.
Thomas Nast created a series of cartoons which exposed the illegal activities of Boss Tweed and the Tammany Hall political machine in New York City. Eventually, Tweed was arrested. He escaped and fled to Spain. While there, Tweed was identified through one of Nast’s cartoons. The Tammany Hall machine, however, lived on.
Civil Service Reform Efforts The feeling that the spoils system corrupted government, or at least made it terribly inefficient, prompted a number of prominent figures to promote civil service reform. The civil service is a system that includes federal jobs in the executive branch. In a reformed system, most government workers would get their jobs due to their

expertise and maintain them regardless of which political party won the election.
Reforming the spoils system did cause controversy. Without the spoils system, politicians felt they would not attract the people needed to run their parties. Independent attempts by politicians to change the system failed. For example, when Rutherford B. Hayes became President in 1877, he worked for civil service reform. He even placed well-known reformers in high offices. However, the Republican Party did not support his reform efforts. It took the 1881 assassination of President James Garfield by Charles J. Guiteau to make civil service reform a reality. Guiteau shot Garfield because he believed that the Republican Party had not fulfilled its promise to give him a government job.
The Pendleton Civil Service Act Chester A Arthur became President after the assassination of Garfield. While Arthur defended the spoils system, he supported the movement for civil service reform, which had been strengthened because of public indignation over Garfield’s assassination. Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Act in 1883. This act established a Civil Service Commission, which wrote a civil service exam. Individuals who wanted to work for the government had to take the exam, and getting a job depended on doing

The public’s discontent was worsened by economic turmoil and uncertainty. In the fall of 1873, one of the nation’s most influential banks failed, apparently as a result of overextended loans to the expanding railroad industry. A wave of fear known as the Panic of 1873 spread through the financial industry and across the nation. Bank failures, job losses, and the uncertain economy added to the array of the nation’s concerns. Events such as this prompted political leaders to debate the best ways to keep the economy moving forward.
The tariff and monetary policy were critical economic issues during this time. Leaders looked to these two areas for ways to stabilize the economy, but both issues were divisive. The tariff issue sharply split the Democrats and Republicans.
Monetary policy gave rise to independent political parties or movements that disagreed with the major parties’ commitment to the gold standard. Using the gold standard meant that the government would use gold as the basis of the nation’s currency. Paper money was backed by the government’s gold reserves, and could, in theory, be redeemed for actual gold
Americans Continue to Discuss Tariffs The debate over the tariff had deep roots in American history. The tariff, or the tax on imports of manufactured goods and some agricultural products, was created as early as 1810 to protect newly developed industries. Since then, the debate to lower or increase tariffs continued. Differences over the tariff had divided the Federalists and Jeffersonians and the Democrats and Whigs. During the Gilded Age, it divided the Republicans and Democrats. The tariff question became a major issue during the presidential election of 1888. The Republicans favored a high tariff, arguing that it would allow American industries to grow and promote jobs in manufacturing. Democrats countered that high tariffs

increased the costs of goods to consumers and made it harder for American farmers to sell their goods abroad.
Different Ideas About Monetary Policy Two
related factors turned monetary policy into a bitter issue during the Gilded Age. During the Civil War, the federal government issued paper money, known as greenbacks. The greenbacks were fiat money , or currency not backed by gold or silver. After the war, because the fiat money had contributed to wartime inflation (a rise in prices), the government retired, or got rid of, the greenbacks. Over the next century, the United States and other major world economies would edge towards going off a metallic standard and onto fiat money gradually, making the final move in the 1970s. However, in the 1870s, the debate centered on whether to use gold or gold and silver to back the paper money.
In 1873, Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1873. This law reversed the government policy of backing
money with both gold and silver. Using only gold meant that the money supply was smaller and each dollar would be worth more. Bankers and others involved in international trade favored the gold standard because it discouraged inflation and made dollars worth more overseas. In contrast, most farmers favored keeping silver to create inflation. Already struggling, they hoped the rise in prices would increase their income. Those who favored the minting of silver—in other words, considering silver as money—protested against what they termed the “Crime of 1873” and prompted Congress to mint silver dollars. The Bland-Allison Act, passed in 1878, specified that the U.S. Treasury make a certain amount of silver-backed dollars each month, but not as many as the Free Silver advocates would have liked. The debate over whether to consider silver as money alongside gold continued until the passage of the Gold Standard Act in 1900, which set gold as the only metal backing paper dollars.

Farmers Face Economic Difficulty
The farmers of the West and the South were willing to accept the difficulties of farm life. Yet farmers discovered that other enormous obstacles stood in the way of realizing their dreams.
They received low prices for their crops, but they had to pay high costs for transportation. Debts mounted while their influence on the political system declined.
Farm Issues Result in Rising Debt Between 1870 and 1895, farm prices plummeted. Cotton, which sold for about 15 cents a pound in the early 1870s, sold for only about 6 cents a pound in the mid-1890s. Corn and wheat prices declined nearly as rapidly. One study estimated that by the early 1890s, it was costing farmers more to produce corn than they could get by selling it, so they burned it to use as fuel. Planting more crops did not help. On the contrary, the more crops farmers produced, the more prices declined.
During the same time period, the cost of doing business rose. To pay for new machinery, seed, livestock, and other needs, farmers went into debt. An increasing number of farmers mortgaged their farms to

raise funds to survive and became tenant farmers— meaning they no longer owned the farm where they worked.
Big Business Practices Affect Farmers Farmers blamed big business, especially the railroads and the banks, for their difficulties. They protested that railroads, as monopolies, charged whatever rates they wanted. Likewise, they complained that banks set interest rates at unfairly high levels. Southern farmers, especially black sharecroppers, faced the added problem of having to deal with dishonest merchants and landlords who paid less for crops and charged more for supplies than promised.
In addition, farmers grew angry because they felt the nation had turned its back on them. The United States had a long tradition of electing leaders from farm states with agricultural backgrounds, like Thomas Jefferson. Yet it now appeared that most of the nation’s leaders came from urban industrial states. Moreover, farmers felt that they performed honest labor and produced necessary goods, while bankers and businessmen were the ones who got rich. One editor for a farmers’ newspaper explained:
There are three great crops raised in
Nebraska. One is the crop of corn, one a crop of freight rates, and one a crop of interest. One is produced by farmers who sweat and toil to farm the land.
The other two are produced by men who sit in their offices and behind their bank counters and farm the farmers.

Farmers created a network of organizations, first in the Midwest and then in the South and West, to address their problems. The Granger movement, also known as the “Patrons of Husbandry,” was the first.
The Courts Have Their Say Organized in 1867 by Oliver H. Kelley—a Minnesota farmer, businessman, journalist, and government clerk—the organization popularly known as the Grange attracted about a million members. The goals of the Grange included providing education on new farming techniques and

calling for the regulation of railroad and grain elevator rates.
In the mid-1870s, the states of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota enacted laws that set maximum rates for shipping freight and for grain storage. The railroad companies challenged these “Grange Laws” in the courts. The Supreme Court upheld some decisions and overturned others, depending on the context of individual cases. In one of the significant “Granger Cases,” Munn v. Illinois, the Court ruled against a Chicago grain-storage facility that challenged the constitutionality of an 1871 Illinois law setting maximum rates for shipping freight. This decision upheld the right of states to regulate private industries in some circumstances. However, in Wabash v. Illinois (1886) the Court ruled against state regulation. In this decision, the Court overturned an Illinois law by declaring that individual states did not have the power to regulate interstate commerce. Eventually, the Grangers helped to prompt the federal government to establish the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to oversee interstate transportation.
Farmers and the Railroads Disagree Although the Grange declined in the late 1870s, farm protest remained strong. Faced with serious difficulties, Texas farmers in the 1870s began to organize and to negotiate as a group for lower prices for supplies.
The idea spread. Local organizations linked together in what became known as the Farmers’ Alliance. These organizations soon connected farmers not only in the South but also in the West, and for a brief period farmers of all races and ethnicities banded together for their common cause. Because of regularly rising rates, the Alliances wanted the government to regulate the interest that banks could charge for loans. Farmers’ Alliance members also tried to convince the government to force railroads to lower freight prices so members could get their crops to markets outside the South at reduced rates.
The railroads, however, argued that their prices were justified by the expense of building the railroads to begin with and by intense competition between rail companies. They had to charge high prices to earn profits and create more jobs. Often railroads would offer rebates or other incentives to larger shippers who used their rails. In addition, they would charge more to ship freight short distances than they would for long trips because they had competitors for long hauls, but not for short hauls. This was known as the “short haul and long haul” practice.
The Interstate Commerce Act, passed in 1887, prohibited several of these practices, although it proved hard to enforce.

Alliances Encourage Reform Farmers’ Alliances, such as the Southern Farmers’ Alliance, became important reform organizations. They formed cooperatives to collectively sell their crops, and they called on the federal government to establish "sub-treasuries, or postal banks, to provide farmers with low-interest loans. They hoped the cooperatives would push the costs of doing business down and the prices for crops up. Some of the cooperative efforts succeeded. The Georgia Alliance led a boycott against manufacturers who raised the price of the special cord that farmers used to wrap bundles of cotton.
Farmers’ alliances organized across racial lines were short-lived. Soon, the Southern Farmers’ Alliance organized only white farmers.
There was also an Alliance network for African American farmers. R. M. Humphrey, a white Baptist minister, headed the Colored Farmers’ Alliance, which had been organized by African American and white farmers.
Nearly one million African American farmers joined the group by 1891. The Colored Farmers’ Alliance recognized that both white and African American farmers shared the same difficulties, but racial tensions prevented any effective cooperation between the groups.

The Beginnings of
Populism
The spread of the Farmers’ Alliances culminated with the formation of the Populist Party, or People’s Party, in 1892. These Populists sought to build a new political party from the grass roots up. They ran entire slates of candidates for local, state, and national positions. Like a prairie fire, the Populist Party spread rapidly, putting pressure on the two major political parties to consider their demands.
Populist Goals The Populist Party spelled out their views in their platform, which they adopted in Omaha, Nebraska, in July 1892. The platform warned about the dangers of political corruption, an inadequate monetary supply, and an unresponsive government. The Populist Party proposed specific remedies to these political issues. To fight low prices, they called for the coinage of silver, or "free silver.” To combat high costs, they demanded government ownership of the railroads. Mary Elizabeth Lease, a fiery Populist Party

spokesperson, also advanced the cause of women’s suffrage.
The Populist Party nominated James B. Weaver of Iowa as their presidential candidate and James Field of Virginia as his running mate. Both had risen to the rank of general in the United States and Confederate armies, respectively, and their nominations represented the party’s attempt to overcome the regional divisions that had kept farmers apart since the end of the Civil War. (Southern white voters had supported the Democrats; northerners, the Republicans.) The Populist Party also sought to reach out to urban workers, to convince them that they faced the same enemy: the industrial elite.
Early Impacts of the Populist Party For a new
political party, the Populists did quite well in 1892. Weaver won more than one million votes for the presidency, and the Populists elected three governors, five senators, and ten congressmen. In 1894, the Populist Party continued to expand its base, gaining seats in the state legislatures and prompting the major political parties to consider endorsing its ideas.
In the South, the Populist Party had to unite black and white voters if it hoped to succeed politically. Tom Watson, Georgia’s most famous Populist Party leader, made a strong case for casting aside racial prejudice in favor of a political alliance between the races. However,
the Democratic Party successfully used racist tactics, such as warning that a Populist victory would lead to “Negro supremacy,” to diminish the appeal of the Populist Party.

What did the Populist Party hope to accomplish? Populism’s Declining
Influence
In 1893, a four-year-long depression began that worsened conditions not only for already-suffering farmers but for other Americans as well. Labor unrest and violence engulfed the nation. The major parties failed to satisfactorily respond to the nation’s distress.
In the midst of national discontent, the Populist Party’s dream of forging a broad coalition with urban workers grew. The Populists' relative success at the polls in 1892 and 1894 raised their hopes further. The decision of the Democratic Party to nominate William Jennings Bryan as their presidential candidate put the election for the Populists on an entirely different plane, leading some to believe they could win the White House that year.

The Impact of William Jennings Bryan Born in Salem, Illinois, William Jennings Bryan moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, where he set up a law practice in 1887. He earned the nickname the “boy orator,” in part by displaying his strong debating skills during his successful run for the United States Congress in 1890. In 1896, Bryan addressed the national Democratic convention on the subject of the gold standard, attacking Grover Cleveland and others in the party who opposed coining silver. The audience listened and cheered as Bryan spoke for “the plain people of this country,” for “our farms,” and declared “we beg no longer.” The speech became known as the “Cross of Gold” speech because it ended with the following line: “You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.”
The speech so moved the Democratic delegates that they nominated Bryan as their party’s presidential candidate. He was just 36 years old and had not been a contender for the nomination until then. Bryan’s advocacy of “free silver,” or the coinage of silver as well as gold, and his support of a number of other Populist Party proposals, placed the Populists in a difficult situation.
Holding their convention after the Democrats, the Populists had to decide whether to nominate their own presidential candidate and continue to focus on building a broad-based movement from the bottom up or to endorse Bryan with the hope that they could capture the White House in 1896. They chose the latter course.
Bryan's campaign was like none other before. For the first time, a presidential candidate toured the nation, speaking directly to the people. In contrast, William McKinley, the Republican candidate, accumulated approximately $15 million, 30 times the amount Bryan had, and allowed party regulars to do the campaigning for him. Marcus Hanna, the political powerhouse who orchestrated McKinley’s run, cast Bryan and his Populist Party supporters as a potential dictator and a threat to the Republic. For instance, one cartoon published in the pro-Republican Los Angeles Times depicted the Democratic-Populist coalition as a collection of evil witches, who fed the fires of sectionalism, discontent, and prejudice in order to win the election.
Populism’s Long-Term Impact McKinley won the election of 1896 and went on to win reelection, again over Bryan, in 1900. Bryan’s emphasis on monetary reform, especially free silver, did not appeal to urban workers, and the Populist Party failed to win a state outside of the South and West. Moreover, the decision

to endorse Bryan weakened the Populists at the local and state levels, and the party never recovered from its defeat in 1896. The Populist Party lingered for nearly a decade. By the early 1900s, it had disappeared as a feasible alternative to the two major political parties. Most of the voters who supported the Populist Party returned to the Democratic Party in 1896.
Even though the Populist Party fell apart, its impact as a third party inspired other third parties, notably the Progressive Party in the early 1900s. Many of the specific reforms that it advocated became a reality in the early decades of the 1900s. The Progressives supported a graduated income tax, regulation of the railroads, and a more flexible monetary system. Moreover, populism had a lasting effect on the style of politics in the United States. For a brief time, there was even a coalition of whites and blacks in Texas. They were able to find a common political ground.
Increasingly, candidates campaigned directly to the people, and, like Bryan, they emphasized their association with ordinary Americans.

Industrialization, urbanization, and immigration brought many benefits to America, but they also produced challenging social problems. In response, a movement called Progressivism emerged in the 1890s. Progressives believed that new ideas and honest, efficient government could bring about social justice. Progressive ideas brought lasting reforms that still affect society today.

The Progressive Era Begins
The people who made up the Progressive Movement came from many walks of life. They came from all political parties, social classes, ethnic groups, and religions. Many Progressive leaders emerged from the growing middle class, whose power and influence was rapidly spreading. Dissatisfied industrial workers also joined the Progressive Movement. So did wealthy Americans driven by a desire to act for the good of society.
Progressive Beliefs and Influences What the Progressives shared in common was a belief that industrialization and urbanization had created troubling social and political problems. Progressives wanted to bring about reforms that would correct what they saw as problems and injustices. They encouraged their state legislatures and the federal government to enact laws to address the issues faced by the poor. Progressives wanted to use logic and reason to make society work in a more efficient and orderly way. Many, motivated by religious faith, sought social justice.
Progressivism was similar to the Populist Movement of the late 1800s. Both were reform movements that wanted to get rid of corrupt

government officials and make government more responsive to people’s needs. Both sought to eliminate the perceived abuses of big business. Still, the two movements differed. At the forefront of Progressivism were middle-class people. They believed that highly educated leaders should use modern ideas and scientific techniques to improve society. Leaders of the Populist Movement, on the other hand, consisted mostly of farmers and workers.
Progressive Goals Some Progressives thought that political reform was the most urgent need. For many women, the number one goal was winning the right to vote. Other Progressives considered honest government to be the most important goal.
Reformers targeted city officials who built corrupt organizations, called political machines. The bosses of these political machines used bribery and violence to influence voters and win elections. They counted on the loyalty of city workers who looked the other way when they took public money for themselves. Bosses also helped people solve personal problems, which often kept voters loyal.
Corrupt and ineffective government combined with the booming growth of cities produced other problems. The people living in America’s crowded cities needed paved streets, safe drinking water, decent housing, and adequate municipal services. The lack of adequate services led to wretched living conditions for the urban poor. Too often, dishonest business owners and politicians controlled municipal services. Bribes and shady deals made them rich while conditions for urban residents remained unsafe and little changed.
While some Progressives focused on government, others were worried about big business. As you have learned, wealthy industrialists built huge companies that limited competition and sometimes raised prices. Middle-class Progressives wanted the government to “bust the trusts” and so create more economic opportunities for smaller businesses. Progressives complained that the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was inadequate and ineffective in limiting the abuses of big business. Business leaders, in contrast, argued that big companies produced goods more efficiently and therefore consumers could buy them at lower prices. They feared that government regulation would hurt these efficiencies and the economy as a whole.
Other Progressive reformers focused on the class system. Often motivated by religious faith, they sought to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. They attacked the harsh conditions endured by miners, factory workers, children forced to work, and other laborers. They wanted to improve conditions in

The Impact of Muckrakers
Socially conscious journalists and other writers dramatized the need for reform. Their sensational investigative reports uncovered a wide range of ills afflicting America in the early 1900s. Even though Theodore Roosevelt agreed with much of what they said, he called these writers muckrakers because he thought them too fascinated with the ugliest side of things. (A muckrake is a tool used to clean manure and hay out of animals’ stables.) The writers were angry at first but in time took up Roosevelt’s taunting name as a badge of honor.
The muckrakers’ articles appeared in magazines and newspapers that entered millions of American homes. People across the nation were horrified by the conditions that muckrakers revealed. Muckrakers' accounts prompted Americans to push for reforms to correct these ills.
Journalists Uncover Injustices One leading muckraker was Lincoln Steffens. He was the managing editor at McClures, a magazine known for uncovering social problems. In 1903, Steffens published The Shame of the Cities, a collection of articles on political corruption in the nation’s cities. His reports exposed how the government of Philadelphia let utility companies charge their customers excessively high fees. He showed how corrupt politicians won elections by bribing and threatening voters, and revealed how political corruption affected all aspects of life in a city.
The visitor [to St. Louis] is told of the wealth of the residents, of the financial strength of the banks, and of the growing importance of the industries; yet he sees poorly paved, refuse-burdened streets, and dusty or mud-covered alleys; he passes a ramshackle firetrap crowded with the sick and learns that it Is the City Hospital. . . .

Finally, he turns a tap in the hotel to see liquid mud flow into [the] wash basin or bathtub.
—-Lincoln Steffens and Claude Wetmore, “Corruption and Reform in St. Louis,” McClure’s Magazine, October 1902
Another influential muckraker was Jacob Riis, a photographer for the New York Evening Sun. Riis turned his camera on the crowded, unsafe, rat-infested tenement buildings where the urban poor lived. Between 1890 and 1903, he published several works, including How the Other Half Lives, that shocked the nation’s conscience and led to reforms.
Other outraged writers joined Riis and Steffens. In The History of Standard Oil, Ida Tarbell reported that John D. Rockefeller used ruthless methods to ruin his competitors, charge higher prices, and thereby reap huge profits. Others proclaimed the need to improve schools or warned of the breakdown of family life because mothers had to work long hours in factories. John Spargo focused attention on the dangerous and difficult lives of child workers.
Novelists Highlight Social Issues Fiction writers put a human face on social problems. They developed a new genre — the naturalist novel — that honestly portrayed human misery and the struggles of common people. Theodore Dreiser, a midwesterner raised in poverty, published Sister Carrie in 1900. His provocative novel traces the fate of a small-town girl drawn into the brutal urban worlds of Chicago and New York.
Naturalist novels became very popular. Frank Norris’s The Octopus fascinated readers by dramatizing the Southern Pacific Railroad's stranglehold on struggling California farmers.
In The Jungle, Upton Sinclair related the despair of immigrants working in Chicago’s stockyards and revealed the unsanitary conditions in the industry. Sinclair’s account eventually prompted regulations to protect food safety. African American author Frances Ellen Watkins portrayed some of the struggles of black Americans in her 1892 novel Iola Leroy.

» Walter Rauschenbusch became the leading proponent of the Social Gospel movement with the publication of his 1907 work Christianity and the Social Crisis.
Reformers Impact Society
The work of the muckrakers increased popular support for Progressivism. Progressive activists promoted laws to improve living conditions, public health, and schools. They urged government to regulate businesses. They worked as volunteers living among the people they sought to help. They believed that careful social planning would make American life better.
Issues Affecting the Social Gospel Many reformers, like Walter Rauschenbusch, thought that Christianity should be the basis of social reform. A child of German immigrants, Rauschenbusch had become a Baptist minister. He blended ideas from German socialism and American Progressivism to form what he called the Social Gospel. By following Bible teachings about charity and justice, he explained, people could make society “the kingdom of God;” that is, make life on earth closer to the promised paradise of heaven by helping others and making the world more just.
Many Protestant leaders followed Rauschenbusch’s program. Many churches already provided community support and help. Issues such as child labor and long working hours led social Gospel adherents to call for the end of child labor and a shorter workweek. They
America Comes of Age 163	3.1 Progressives Drive Reform
also pushed for the federal government to limit the power of corporations and trusts.
Jane Addams Contributes to the Settlement House Movement An important goal of many Progressives, including those influenced by religious ideals, was to improve the lives of poor people in the cities. One approach was the settlement house, a community center that provided social services to the urban poor. Most settlement houses were privately funded and run by volunteers. Settlement house workers gave mothers classes in child care and taught English to immigrants. They ran nursery schools and kindergartens. They also provided theater, art, and dance programs for adults.
A woman named Jane Addams became a leading figure in the settlement house movement. While visiting Europe, she was inspired by the work at Toynbee Hall, a settlement house in London. In 1889, Addams opened Hull House, a settlement house in Chicago. Over the years, Hull House grew to include 13 buildings. Through Hull House’s programs, Addams made significant social and economic contributions to the lives of the people living in its poor Chicago neighborhood. By educating poor children and adults, these programs increased their earning power.
Furthermore, the success of Hull House inspired other college-educated, middle-class women to become social workers. By 1911, the country had more than
400 settlement houses. Addams was also politically active. She supported the Progressive party candidacy of Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and later helped found the American Civil Liberties Union. She worked closely with labor and other reform groups seeking to use political means to improve working conditions for the urban poor.
Using Hull House as a base, Addams also worked to accomplish political goals, including laws regulating labor and tenement houses. In addition, she worked for women’s suffrage and world peace, sharing the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.
Religious organizations such as the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) also provided services to the urban poor. In addition to its goal of promoting Christian values, the YMCA offered classes, dances, and sports.
Progressive-Era Issues Affecting Children
Progressives also tried to help children. Leading the effort was a lawyer named Florence Kelley. Kelley helped convince the state of Illinois to ban child labor, and other states soon passed similar laws. In 1902, Kelley helped form the National Child Labor Committee, which successfully lobbied the federal government to create the U.S. Children’s Bureau in 1912. This new agency examined any issue that affected the health and welfare of children. The agency still works to protect children today.

But progress in children’s rights had a long way to go. In 1916, Congress passed the Keating-Owens Act, which banned child labor in all states. However, two years later, the Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional. It was not until 1938 that Congress would end child labor for good.
Progressives also tried to better children’s lives by improving education. A number of states passed laws that required children to attend school until a certain age. However, there were heated debates about what children should learn and how they should learn. Some argued that they should be taught only work skills. Others said they should learn to appreciate literature and music. Most educators agreed that girls should learn different things from boys.
Educator John Dewey criticized American schools for teaching children to memorize facts but not to think creatively. Dewey wanted schools to teach new subjects such as history and geography, as well as practical skills like cooking and carpentry. His ideas were not adopted at once, but in later years, many states put them into effect.
Reforms in the Workplace In the early 1900s, the United States had the highest rate of industrial accidents in the world. Long hours, poor ventilation, hazardous fumes, and unsafe machinery threatened not only workers’ health but also their lives. Each year some thirty thousand workers died on the job, while another half a million were injured.
In March 1911, a fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City shocked Americans and focused attention on the need to protect workers. Workers in the factory had little chance to escape the raging fire because managers had locked most of the exits. The fire killed 146 workers, most of them young Jewish women. Many jumped from the windows in desperation. Inside the smoldering ruins, firefighters found many more victims, “skeletons bending over sewing machines.”
After the blaze, outraged Progressives intensified their calls for reform. New York passed laws to make workplaces safer, and other cities and states followed suit. Many states also adopted workers' compensation laws, which set up funds to pay workers who were hurt on the job.
Progressives also persuaded some states to pass laws limiting the workday to ten hours. However, their efforts suffered a blow in 1905 when the Supreme Court ruled in Lochner v. New York that such laws were unconstitutional. Until the 1930s, the court ruled

How did Progressives work to help the urban poor?
Progressive Reforms
Impact Government
Progressive reformers sought to reform the political process in order to reform society. They wanted to free government from the control of political bosses and powerful business interests. They wanted to give people more control over their government and make government more effective and efficient in serving the public.
Reformers Change City Government Just as the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire spurred reformers to action, so did another disaster. In 1900, a massive hurricane left the city of Galveston, Texas, in ruins. One of the greatest national calamities in American history, the hurricane killed more than 8,000 people. As an emergency measure, Galveston replaced its mayor and board of aldermen with a five-person commission. Each commissioner was an expert in a different area of

city affairs, such as public safety or streets and sewers, and headed the departments responsible for that area.
The commission form of government proved very efficient as the city carried out a tremendous rebuilding effort. The following year, Galveston decided to permanently adopt the commission form of government.
Known as the Galveston plan, many other cities decided to take up the commission form of government. By 1918, nearly 500 cities had adopted some form of the Galveston plan. Dayton, Ohio, and other cities modified the plan by empowering the city council or commission to hire a professional city manager to oversee all of city government. The new city governments curbed the power of bosses and their political machines. The reform governments purchased public utilities so that electric, gas, and water companies could not charge city residents unfairly high rates.
Progressive Reforms Impact Political Process
Progressives also pushed for election reforms, taking up some Populist ideas. Traditionally, party leaders picked candidates for state and local offices.
But in Wisconsin, reform governor Robert M. La Follette established a direct primary, an election in which citizens themselves vote to select nominees for upcoming elections. By 1916, all but four states had direct primaries.
Progressives also wanted to make sure that elected officials would follow citizens’ wishes. To achieve this goal, they worked for three other political reforms: the initiative, the referendum, and the recall. The initiative gave people the power to put a proposed new law directly on the ballot in the next election by collecting citizens’ signatures on a petition. This meant that voters themselves could suggest laws instead of waiting for elected officials to act. The referendum allowed citizens to approve or reject laws passed by a legislature. The recall gave voters the power to remove public servants from office before their terms ended.
Progressives won yet another political reform: They adopted the Populist call for the direct election of senators by voters, not state legislators.
Progressives believed that Americans should choose their own senators rather than allowing state legislatures to do so. Several states already held elections in which voters advised their legislature about which person to name, although states formally retained this decision under the U.S. Constitution. However, the proposed reform was not universally popular. Some members of Congress argued that direct election would weaken the states’ power to block actions of the federal government, an important constitutional check. With the support of 31 state legislatures, however, Congress passed a constitutional amendment to enact this

change in 1911. The states ratified the Seventeenth Amendment two years later.
States Lead the Progressive Movement Dynamic Progressives became the leaders of several states, and chief among them was Robert La Follette of Wisconsin. Elected governor in 1900, “Fighting Bob” won the passage of many reform laws. Under his leadership, the Wisconsin state government forced railroads to charge lower fees and pay higher taxes. La Follette helped his state to improve education, make factories safer, and adopt the direct primary. Progressives called Wisconsin the “laboratory of democracy.”
Hiram Johnson, governor of California, shattered the Southern Pacific Railroad’s stranglehold on state government. He put in place the direct primary, initiative, referendum, and recall. He also pushed for another goal of some Progressives—planning for the careful use of natural resources such as water, forests, and wildlife.
Other Progressive governors included Theodore Roosevelt of New York and Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey Roosevelt worked to develop a fair system for hiring state workers and made some corporations pay taxes. Wilson reduced the railroads power and pushed
for a direct primary law. Both Roosevelt and Wilson later became President and brought reforms to the White House.

In the early 1900s, a growing
number of women were no longer content to have a limited role in society. Women activists helped bring about Progressive reforms and won the right to vote. In the years ahead, women would continue the struggle to expand their roles and rights.
Women Gain Rights
Expanding Opportunities for Women
In the early 1900s, more and more middle-class women wanted to do more than fulfill their roles as wives and mothers. They were ready to do other tasks besides the important ones of raising children, cooking meals, keeping the home clean, and caring for family members. They wanted to expand their role in the community
Education helped many women achieve their goals. By the 1890s, a rising number of women’s colleges prepared them for careers as teachers or nurses. Some, such as Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania and the School of Social Work in New York, trained them to lead the new organizations working for social reform. The number of women attending college jumped. By 1900, one third of all college students, nationwide, were women. By attending college, women expanded their own economic opportunities. Armed with education and modern ideas, many middle-class white women began to tackle problems they saw in society.
Economic and Social Issues for Women Working-class women had worked outside of the home for decades. For these women, working outside the home meant difficult jobs, with long hours and dangerous conditions. And they were usually expected to hand over their wages
168
to their husbands, fathers, or brothers. Many women labored in factories that made cigars or clothing. Others toiled as laundresses or servants. Immigrants, African Americans, and women from rural areas filled these jobs, and most of them had little or no education.
As a result, they could easily be cheated or bullied by their employers. Without being able to vote, women had little influence on the politicians who could expand their rights and look after their interests.
Addressing Economic Issues A key goal of women reformers was to limit the number of work hours. They succeeded in several states. For example, a 1903 Oregon law capped women’s workdays at ten hours. Five years later, in Muller v. Oregon, the Supreme Court reviewed that law. Lawyer Louis D. Brandeis argued that long working hours harmed working women and their families.
The Supreme Court agreed with Brandeis. Based on their role as mothers, it said, women could be “properly placed in a class” by themselves. As a result, laws could limit their work hours, even if similar laws would not be allowed for men. At the time, Progressives viewed this decision as a victory for women workers. In later years, however, this ruling was used to justify paying women less than men for the same job.
Florence Kelley believed that women were hurt by unfair prices for goods they had to buy to run their homes. In 1899, she helped found the National Consumers League (NCL), which is still active today. The NCL gave special labels to “goods produced under fair, safe, and healthy working conditions” and urged women to buy them and avoid products that did not have these labels. The NCL pushed for other reforms as well. It backed laws calling for the government to inspect meatpacking plants, to make workplaces safer, and to make payments to the unemployed.
Florence Kelley also helped form the Women’s Trade Union League (WTUL), another group that tried to improve conditions for female factory workers. It was one of the few groups in which upper-class and working-class women served together as leaders. The WTUL pushed for federal laws that set a minimum wage and an eight-hour workday. It also created the first workers’ strike fund, which could be used to help support families who refused to work in unsafe or unfair conditions.
Women Address Social Issues A main goal of Progressive women was to improve family life. They pushed for laws that could help mothers keep families healthy and safe. One focus of this effort was the temperance movement led by the Womens Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The WCTU,
» Like their male counterparts, women workers, like these women in a cigar factory near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, struggled with unpleasant and sometimes unhealthy working conditions.
» Women protested the production and sale of alcohol to generate support for the Eighteenth Amendment.

3.2 Women Gain Rights
along with other groups such as the Anti-Saloon League promoted temperance, the practice of never drinking alcohol. Members felt that alcohol often led men to squander their earnings on liquor and neglect or abuse their families. Formed in the 1870s, the WCTU gained strength during the Progressive Era. The WCTU was led by the influential speaker Frances Willard from 1879 until her death in 1898. Her work contributed to the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919, which outlawed the production and sale of alcohol.
Temperance was Willard’s primary goal, but she also supported women’s suffrage—the right to vote. She argued that women needed the vote to prohibit the sale of alcohol. Like many WCTU members, Willard also promoted other social causes, such as public health and welfare reform.
Nurse Margaret Sanger thought that family life and women’s health would improve if mothers had fewer children. In 1916, Sanger, herself one of 11 children, opened the country's first birth-control clinic. Very controversial at the time, Sanger was jailed several times as a “public nuisance” for distributing information about birth control. But federal courts eventually said doctors could give out information about family planning. In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth

African American women also worked for social change. In 1896, Ida B. Wells, an African American teacher and journalist, helped form the National Association of Colored Women (NACW). Wells was well-known for leading an anti-lynching campaign through writing for several newspapers and speaking tours. The NACW’s goal was to help families strive for success and to assist those who were less fortunate. With money raised from educated black women, the NACW set up daycare centers to protect and educate black children while their parents went to work.

What steps did women take to win workers’ rights?
Women Seek Equal Political Rights
One of the boldest goals of Progressive women was suffrage. They argued that women participating in the democratic process through voting was the only way to make sure that the government would protect children, foster education, and support family life. As Jane Addams explained, women needed the vote because political issues reached inside people’s homes.
If the street is not cleaned by the city authorities no amount of private sweeping will keep the tenement free from grime; if the garbage is not properly collected and destroyed a tenement-house mother may see her children sicken and die of diseases from which she alone is powerless to shield them, although her tenderness and devotion are unbounded.
She cannot even secure untainted meat for her household, . . . unless the meat has been inspected by city officials.
—Jane Addams, Ladies Home Joinnai, 1.910
The Early Fight for a Constitutional Amendment Since the 1850s, reformers such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton had tirelessly struggled for the right for women to have a voice in political issues.

National Woman's Party Grown out of the NAWSA, the NWP used more militant methods to enfranchise women nationally. NAACP
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People The NAACP aims to educate citizens on civil rights, eliminate race prejudice, and ensure political, educational, social, and economic equality. » Hypothesize Why would an organization such as NAOWS oppose woman suffrage?
Although Anthony and other women's right activists had favored ending slavery, they felt betrayed when Radical Republicans did not include women in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments.
In 1869, Anthony and Stanton formed the National Woman Suffrage Association to fight for a constitutional amendment that would grant women the right to vote. They argued that just as the Constitution had been amended to extend the vote to African Americans, it should be amended to extend the vote to women.
In 1872, Anthony voted in an election in Rochester, New York, an illegal act for which she was tried and ultimately convicted in federal court. While awaiting trial, she toured the nation, delivering a speech titled "Is It a Crime for a Citizen of the United States to Vote?” Anthony declared, “Our . . . government is based on .
. . the natural right of every individual member ... to a voice and a vote in making and executing the laws.” However, her speech failed to convince the nation to enact a women’s suffrage amendment. An amendment was introduced in Congress and rejected in 1887. By the time of Anthony’s death in 1906, only four western states—Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and Idaho had granted women the right to vote.
Women Lobby for Expanded Rights In the 1890s, the national suffrage effort was reenergized by Carrie Chapman Catt. Catt had studied law and worked as one of the country’s first female school superintendents.
A captivating speaker, Catt traveled around the country urging women to join the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), created in 1890 by the merger of Anthony’s organization and a rival women’s suffrage group. In 1900, Catt became the president of the NAWSA. She promoted what became known as her "winning plan,” which called for action on two fronts to expand women’s right to participate in the democratic process. Some teams of women lobbied Congress to pass a constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote. Meanwhile, other teams used the new referendum process to try to pass state suffrage laws. The strategy at the state level eventually helped women win the right to vote in New York, Michigan, and Oklahoma.
Catt introduced a “society plan” to recruit wealthy, well-educated women. She and her army of workers signed on women from all levels of society, including African Americans, Mexican Americans, and Jewish immigrants. All these women, called “suffragettes,” helped promote suffrage in their own areas.
Activists Use Nonviolent Protests By 1910, as Progressivism was nearing its height, the women’s suffrage movement was growing stronger too. A new generation of leaders had emerged. Besides Catt, they included Jane Addams and Harriet Stanton Blatch, the daughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The movement’s new leaders expanded its goals to include
America Comes of Age 171	3.2 Women Gain Rights
calls for improvements in education, reforms of corrupt government, and labor reforms such as the passage of child labor laws. These activists presented suffrage as not only an expansion of the democratic process but also as a way to help solve many of society’s other ills. This strategy linked the women’s suffrage movement with the powerful wave of Progressive reform.
The suffrage movement’s new goals also helped it grow by making it more appealing to working women. The rising number of college-educated women flooded into the movement as well. Some women, known as social activists, took to the streets, organizing mass parades and rallies. Catt, while cautious about these new methods, added them to her tactics at the NAWSA. Some women social activists grew even more daring in their strategies to win the vote.
Alice Paul, their best known leader, was raised in a Quaker home where she was encouraged to be independent. Paul attended a Quaker college and the New York School of Social Work before earning a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1912. She believed that drastic steps were needed to win the vote. By 1913, she was organizing women to recruit others across the nation. They drew in women of many backgrounds, from Maud Younger, known as the “millionaire waitress” because she organized California’s first waitresses’ union, to Nina Otero-
Warren, a Hispanic woman who headed New Mexico’s State Board of Health.
By 1917, Paul had formed the National Woman’s Party (NWP), which used public protest marches. The NWP became the first group to march with picket signs outside the White House. Hundreds of women were arrested in these protests. Some went on hunger strikes, stating that they would not eat until they could vote. While in jail, some women, including Paul, were force-fed to end their hunger strikes. The NWP methods angered many people, including women in other suffrage groups. Nevertheless, they did help women the right to vote because the NWP’s actions drew attention to their cause and made less-radical groups like the NAWSA look tame by comparison.
The Nineteenth Amendment Expands Political Rights In the 1916 presidential election, both the Democratic and the Republican parties called for extending the right to vote to women. As the movement gained support, however, opposition to it also increased. The liquor industry strongly opposed women’s suffrage because of women’s support for temperance. The textile industry also opposed suffrage because it feared women would favor laws limiting child labor. Even some women worked against the movement. The National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (NAOWS) believed that the effort to

win the vote would take women’s attention away from family and volunteer work that benefited society in many ways. But as pressure for women’s suffrage grew, the NAOWS faded away.
When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed that “the world must be made safe for democracy.” Suffragists were astounded.
How could America be a democracy, they wondered, if women could not vote? Nevertheless, Carrie Catt and Florence Kelley led the NAWSA to support the war effort. Their actions and those of the NWP convinced a growing number of legislators to support a women’s suffrage amendment.
In June 1917, envoys from Russia visited President Wilson. Alice Paul and her activists saw a golden opportunity. The Russians had just overthrown their czar, established a republic, and granted women the right to vote. As the envoys neared the White House, the suffragists stunned an embarrassed Wilson by unveiling a banner that proclaimed America was not a democracy. In 1918, an amendment to extend the vote to women was once again considered by Congress. It passed in the House of Representatives but was narrowly rejected in the Senate.
The following year, the amendment was offered in Congress once again. In June 1919, Congress finally approved the Nineteenth Amendment, which stated that the right to vote “shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.”
On August 18, 1920, the Tennessee State House of Representatives passed the amendment by one vote. With Tennessee’s ratification, enough states had passed the amendment that it became official. Alice Paul and Carrie Catt both claimed responsibility for the victory. In fact, according to historian Nancy Cott, “neither the shocking militancy of the National Women’s Party nor the ladylike moderation of NAWSA was so solely responsible for victory as each group publicly claimed.” The rival groups both contributed to the triumph of the women’s suffrage movement, which also gave a boost to the budding civil rights movement of the twentieth century. The impact of the Nineteenth Amendment was felt immediately. On November 2,1920, Catt, Paul, and millions of other American women voted for the first time in a U.S. presidential election.

Prejudice arid discrimination against minorities continued even as the Progressive Movement got underway.

Their efforts paved the way for the era of civil rights that would follow decades later.
Striving for Equality E
Minorities Face Challenges in the Progressive Era
The Progressive Era was not so progressive for nonwhite and immigrant Americans. Most Progressives were white Anglo-Saxon Protestant reformers who were indifferent or actively hostile to minorities. They tried to make the United States a model society by encouraging everyone to follow white, middle-class ways of life.
The Americanization Movement Settlement houses and other civic groups played a prominent role in the Americanization efforts of many Progressives. While they taught immigrants English, their programs also tried to change how immigrants lived. They advised immigrants how to dress like white middle-class Americans and pushed them to replace the foods and customs of their homelands with Protestant practices and values. These reformers believed that assimilating immigrants into American society would make them more loyal and moral citizens.
Many Progressives found the immigrants’ use of alcohol especially alarming. In many European countries, it was customary for families to serve wine or beer with meals. Many reformers, however, believed that these practices showed moral faults. As a result, prejudice against immigrants was one of the forces behind the temperance movement.

Effects of Racism and Plessy v. Ferguson Many Progressives shared the same prejudice against nonwhites held by other white Americans of the time. They believed that some people were more fit than others to play a leading role in society. They agreed with invalid scientific theories that said that dark-skinned peoples had less intelligence than whites. In the late 1800s, southern Progressives used these misguided theories to justify the passage of laws that kept African Americans from voting.
Some southern Progressives urged an end to the violence and terrorism waged against African Americans but still did not advocate equal rights. Edgar Gardner Murphy, an Episcopal minister and a leading Alabama Progressive, advised that African Americans “will accept in the white man’s country the place assigned him by the white man, . . . not by stress of rivalry, but by genial cooperation with the white man’s interests.”
After the Supreme Court issued its Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which upheld Jim Crow laws, states across the North and the South had passed segregation laws. By 1910, segregation was the norm across the nation. After 1914, even the offices of the federal government in Washington, D.C., were segregated as a result of policies approved by President Woodrow Wilson, a Progressive.
B CHECK UNDERSTANDING
What attitudes did most Progressives hold about minorities and immigrant groups?
African Americans
Promote Civil Rights
In the face of these injustices, the nation's most visible African American leader urged patience. Booker T. Washington told blacks to move slowly toward racial progress. By working hard and waiting patiently, he believed, African Americans would gradually win white Americans’ respect and eventually would be able to exercise their full voting and citizenship rights.
Other African Americans rejected this view. The most outspoken among them were W.E.B. Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter. Both men had been raised in New England and educated at Harvard University. Both urged African Americans to demand immediately all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
A
New Civil Rights Organization Du Bois and Trotter were especially concerned that all across the South, black men were being denied the right to vote. In the summer of 1905, they and other leading African American thinkers met at Niagara Falls. They had to meet in Canada because no hotel on the New York side of the border would give them rooms. The Niagara Movement, as the group called itself, denounced the idea of gradual progress. Washington, they said, was too willing to compromise African Americans’ basic rights. They also condemned his notion of teaching only trade skills. This kind of education, Du Bois said, “can create workers, but it cannot make men.” Talented blacks should be taught history, literature, and philosophy, so they could think for themselves. DuBois had a significant impact on the ways African Americans and concerned white people thought about equality.

1868-1963 "[The Negro must] live peaceably with his white neighbors ... the Negro [must] deport himself modestly ... depending upon the slow but sure influences that proceed from the possessions of property, intelligence, and high character for the full recognition of his political rights."
Washington believed that African Americans had to achieve economic independence before civil rights. Black people must tolerate discrimination while they proved themselves equal to white people. Slowly, civil rights would come.

"We claim for ourselves every single right that belongs to a freeborn American ... and until we get these rights we will never cease to protest... How shall we get them? By voting where we may vote, by persistent, unceasing agitation, by hammering at the truth, by sacrifice and work."
Du Bois believed that black Americans had to demand their social and civil rights or else become permanent victims of racism. African Americans must fight every day for the rights given to them in the Constitution.

Still, despite its bold ideas, the Niagara Movement never grew to more than a few hundred strong. To make a difference, African Americans needed a more powerful voice.
NAACP
Promotes Civil Rights In the summer of 1908,	a white mob in Springfield, Illinois, attempted to lynch two African American prisoners in the city jail. Upon learning that the prisoners had been removed to safety, the rioters turned their anger against the city’s black residents, killing two people and burning 40 homes. The Niagara Movement members were outraged that such an attack could happen in Abraham Lincoln’s hometown.
The Springfield riot also got the attention of a number of white reformers. They now acknowledged the need to help African Americans protect their lives, win the right to vote, and secure their civil rights. In
1909,	several white reformers joined with leaders of the Niagara Movement to form the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The NAACP was a political organization that aimed to help African Americans be “physically free from peonage [forced, low-paid labor], mentally free from ignorance, politically free from disfranchisement, and socially free from insult.”
NAACP leaders included white and black Progressives who had worked in other areas of social reform. Among them were Jane Addams, Ray Stannard Baker, and Florence Kelley. Ida B. Wells, owner of a Tennessee newspaper, used her publication to make clear the horror of lynching at great risk to her own safety. She and the others planned the group’s strategy—to use litigation in the courts to challenge unfair laws and expand the right to participate in the democratic process. In the early 1900s, the NAACP focused on the battle for equal access to decent housing and professional careers like teaching. W.E.B. DuBois continued to have an impact on American society as editor of the NAACP’s magazine, The Crisis.
Urban League Seeks to Expand Economic Opportunities Across the country, African Americans were migrating from rural to urban areas during this period. Local black clubs and churches set up employment agencies and relief efforts to help African Americans get settled and find work.
In 1911, more than 100 of these groups in many cities joined into a network called the Urban League. While the NAACP helped middle-class blacks struggle for political and social justice, the Urban League focused on poorer workers. It helped families buy clothes and books and send children to school. It also helped factory workers and domestic servants find jobs. Both

the NAACP and the Urban League still aid African Americans today.
Ki RECALL Why did African Americans and others
decide it was time to organize against discrimination?
Protecting Rights for Ethnic and Religious Minorities
African Americans were not alone in seeking rights. Individuals and organizations of diverse ethnic and religious groups spoke out against unfair treatment and took action by creating self-help agencies. For example, in northern cities, Catholic parishes offered a variety of social services to immigrants. In Chicago, a network of Polish Catholic groups grew so strong that it earned the nickname American Warsaw.
Expanding Rights and Opportunities for Jews
Jews in New York had formed the B’nai B’rith in 1843 to provide religious education and to help Jewish families. In response to growing anti-Semitism, the group founded the Anti-Defamation League in 1913. Its goal was— and still is—to defend Jews and others
America Comes of Age

3.3 Striving for Equality
against physical and verbal attacks, false statements, and “to secure justice and fair treatment to all citizens alike. . . .” In this way, the group expanded political rights for Jews and others. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, some business refused to hire or serve Jewish people. The Anti-Defamation League led efforts to expand economic opportunities for Jews and other minorities by fighting this form of discrimination.
Expanding Rights and Opportunities for Mexican Americans Mexican Americans also organized to help themselves. Those living in Arizona formed the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM), which offered Mexican Americans many of the same services that the Urban League gave to African Americans. In several states, Mexican Americans formed mutualistas, groups that made loans and provided legal assistance. The mutualistas also had insurance programs to help members if they were too sick to work.
Many Mexican Americans were forced to sign unfair labor contracts that kept them in debt to people whose land they worked. In 1911, the Supreme Court struck down a law that enforced that system.
Native Americans Gain Citizenship Progressives did little to help Native Americans. The Dawes Act, passed in 1887, had divided reservations into plots for

individuals to farm. But the law also said that lands not given to individual Indians could be sold to the general public. By 1932, nearly two thirds of the lands held by tribes in 1887 were in the hands of whites.
Carlos Montezuma, a Native American from Arizona, helped establish the Society of American Indians in 1911, the first organization formed to promote Indian rights and protest federal Indian policy. A doctor, Montezuma treated Native Americans living on reservations. He urged Native Americans to preserve their cultures and avoid being dependent on the government. Many reformers, who hoped that Indians could be assimilated into American society like immigrants, found this position troubling.
The Dawes Act barred Native Americans from selling their plots of land for 25 years. The law provided that they would then get the title to the land and become citizens. This policy was intended to speed Native Americans’ assimilation into white society. By the 1920s, however, it was clear that the policy was not achieving this goal. So Congress tried another approach. The congressional act American Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 made all Native Americans citizens of the United States, with full voting rights. For Native Americans, this law was an important step toward political equality with other Americans.
The official reason for granting citizenship and voting rights was to reward Native Americans for their service in World War I. However, supporters also hoped that the reform would help the Americanization process.
Fighting for Rights and Opportunities for Asian Americans Asian Americans also had to protect themselves and struggled to expand their political rights. A 1913 California law said that only American citizens could own land. Because Japanese immigrants could not become citizens, the law forced them to sell their land. Japanese Americans found a way around this, however, by putting the land in their children’s names. Because their children had been born in the United States, they were American citizens. The law also affected immigrants from China and India, who were also not allowed to become citizens.
Japanese immigrant Takao Ozawa fought the law in court that blocked Asian Americans from becoming citizens. In 1922, however, the Supreme Court ruled against him. A newspaper read by Japanese Americans commented, “The slim hope that we had entertained . . . has been shattered completely.”

In 1901, when Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United States, he was only 43 years old.
However, he had packed quite a lot into those years, gaining a reputation for being smart, energetic, and opinionated. The sickly child of wealthy parents, he had used his family’s resources to develop both his strength and his mind. Observers said Theodore Roosevelt generated so much energy that if you met him, you left the event with bits of his personality “stuck to your clothes."
Roosevelt’s Path to the Presidency Roosevelt had graduated with honors from Harvard University in 1880. He spent only a few months studying law at Columbia University before being elected to the New York State Assembly. After three years’ service there, and after the deaths of both his mother and his wife, Alice, Roosevelt retired to a ranch in the West. There he developed a love of the wilderness.

Theodore Roosevelt could not remain long out of the spotlight, however. By 1889, he had returned to politics. As president of New York City’s Board of Police Commissioners, he gained fame by fighting corruption. President William McKinley noticed him and named him Assistant Secretary of the Navy. When the Spanish-American War broke out in 1898, Roosevelt resigned the post to form the Rough Riders, a volunteer cavalry unit that became famous during the war.
After the end of the conflict, the young war hero was elected governor of New York, where he pushed for Progressive reforms. His reform efforts annoyed Republican leaders in the state, however. They convinced McKinley to choose Roosevelt as his running mate so Roosevelt would leave New York— and them—alone. McKinley was reelected President in 1900, but within a few months he was assassinated, and Roosevelt became President. He soon dominated public attention. Journalists vied for interviews with him and children begged their parents for a teddy bear, the new stuffed animal named for him.
Progressive reformers were pleased to see the benefits of the ICC spreading, namely that the powerful railroads were finally under control. This pleased farmers as well, who had long sought such regulation. But the Elkins Act and the ICC in general had costs.
He called his program the Square Deal. Its goals were to keep the wealthy and powerful from taking advantage of small business owners and the poor. Roosevelt’s idea of fair government did not mean that everyone would get rich or that the government should take care of the lazy. He compared his Square Deal to a hand of cards.
When I say I believe in a square deal, I do not mean to give every man the best hand. If good cards do not come to any man, or if they do come, and he has not got the power to play them, that is his affair. All I mean is that there shall be no crookedness in the dealing.
—Theodore Roosevelt, 1905
Intervening Between Owners and Workers
Roosevelt often stepped in to labor disputes with the authority and power of the federal government. One example was in 1902, when Pennsylvania coal miners went on strike. The miners wanted a pay raise and a shorter workday Roosevelt sympathized with the overworked miners, but he knew that a steady supply of
coal was needed to keep factories running and homes warm. He wanted the strike ended quickly.
First, Roosevelt tried to get mine owners to listen to workers' concerns. When this failed, he threatened to send federal troops to take control of the mines and to run them with federal employees. His threat forced the mine owners to give the miners a small pay raise and a nine-hour workday. For the first time, the federal government had stepped in to help workers in a labor dispute.
This coal strike intervention was one of many steps Roosevelt took to control the power of corporations. Within a year, Roosevelt convinced Congress to establish the Department of Commerce and Labor to monitor businesses engaged in interstate commerce.
The ICC Takes on the Railroads The cost of shipping freight on railroads had been an issue since the 1870s. Railroad companies often could charge whatever they wanted. The railroads’ power was especially troublesome for western farmers. They had no other way to move their products to eastern markets.
In 1887, Congress had created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to oversee rail charges for shipments that passed through more than one state.

America Comes of Age
3.4 Reformers in the White House
The ICC was supposed to make sure that all shippers were charged the same amounts. By 1900, though, the Supreme Court had stripped away most of the ICC’s power. So Roosevelt pushed Congress to pass the Elkins Act in 1903, which imposed fines on railroads that gave special rates to favored shippers. In 1906, he got Congress to pass the Hepburn Act, which gave the ICC even greater powers. This law allowed ICC for the first time to set maximum shipping rates. The act also set maximum rates for ferries, toll bridges, and oil pipelines. Finally, it gave any ruling by the ICC the legal force of a court order.
Progressive reformers were pleased to see the powerful railroads finally brought under control. Farmers who had long sought such regulation especially felts its benefits. But the Elkins Act and the ICC in general had costs, as its critics pointed out. The ICC’s five commissioners were not elected to their positions. Once appointed by the President and approved by the Senate, they could not be removed during their term.
Some Americans found the ICC’s independence from the public will and from all three branches of government to be troubling. In addition, when the ICC exercised its new power and limited railroad rates, its action harmed the economy. The value of railroad stocks plummeted, which helped to bring on the financial panic that swept the nation in 1907.
A
Trustbuster Enforces Legislation It did not take long for the President and his administration to earn a reputation as "trustbusters.” In response to an
antitrust suit filed by Roosevelt’s attorney general, the Supreme Court ruled in 1904 that the Northern Securities Company—a big railroad company—was an illegal trust. The decision forced the company to split into smaller companies. The next year, the Court found that a beef trust and several powerful agricultural companies had broken antitrust laws.
Roosevelt was not interested in bringing down all large companies. He saw a difference between “good trusts” and “bad trusts.” Big businesses could often be more efficient than small ones, he believed. Big business was bad, he said, only if it bullied smaller companies or cheated consumers.
So he supported powerful corporations as long as they did business fairly. His supporters called him a “trust-tamer,” but some wealthy Progressives criticized his trustbusting. Other critics claimed that his good trust-bad trust distinction meant that antitrust laws were being applied unevenly and thus unfairly. This practice may even have been unconstitutional—a violation of the private property protections in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.
Despite such criticisms, most Americans were pleased with the antitrust prosecutions. However, they were also conflicted. They deeply distrusted and feared the big corporations’ huge concentrations of wealth and power. But at the same time, they treasured the consumer benefits the companies’ size often provided.

It provided federal agents with the power to inspect any meat sold across state lines and required federal inspection of meat-processing plants. Today, when we eat lunchmeat or grilled chicken, we trust that federal inspectors have monitored the plant where it is produced. If there is a serious problem, the government can force the meatpacker to pull the product off the shelves before many people become sick. This regulation is one lasting result of Progressives’ insistence that the government take responsibility for food safety.
The Pure Food and Drug Act benefited the public by placing the same controls on other foods and on medicines. Although there was some concern that here again the federal government was taking on too much of the states’ constitutional police power, most Americans felt like the benefits outweighed the costs. The act also banned the interstate shipment of impure food and the mislabeling of food and drugs. Today, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) still enforces this law and others. The FDA monitors companies to make sure people are not hurt by dangerous substances or dishonest labels. For example, before a drug can be sold, it must be tested and approved by the FDA.

Managing the
Environment
Roosevelt’s deep reverence for nature also shaped his policies. The books he published on hunting and the rugged West reflected his fascination with the competition between humans and the wilderness. He was pleased that the federal government had established Yellowstone National Park in 1872 to protect wildlife, and he admired California naturalist John Muir, whose efforts had led Congress to create Yosemite National Park in 1890.
Conservation or Preservation? In 1891, Congress had given the President the power to protect timberlands by setting aside land as federal forests. Following Muir’s advice, Roosevelt closed off more than 100 million acres of forestland. However, the President did not agree with Muir that all wild areas should be preserved, or left untouched. Some wild lands held

valuable resources, and Roosevelt thought those resources were meant to be used. This view became clear in his forest policy. In typical Progressive style, he called on experts to draw up plans for both conserving and using the forests.
Roosevelt drew on the "rational use” ideas of Gifford Pinchot, who led the Division of Forestry in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Pinchot recommended a different approach—that forests be preserved for public use. By this, he meant that forests should be protected so that trees would have time to mature into good lumber. Then the protected areas should be logged for wood to build houses and new areas placed under protection. “The object of our forest policy,” explained Pinchot, “is not to preserve the forests because they are refuges for the wild creatures of the wilderness, but rather they are the making of prosperous homes.”
Pinchot’s views came to dominate American policies toward natural resources. Conservation, or the planned management of natural resources, became government policy for managing public lands. But private ownership inspired conservation, too. In some cases, private ownership gave people the incentive to handle the natural resources on their land wisely so they would not damage the long-term value of their property.
In all, Roosevelt worked with Congress to establish five national parks and established 18 national
monuments or historical landmarks under the Antiquities Act of 1906. Together, these unique places formed the core of the National Park Service, which was established in 1916 and still works today to conserve and share many natural and historic landmarks in the United States.
Roosevelt’s views on land use went beyond the belief that public lands should, in some cases, be preserved or put to use for wider societal benefit. In 1908, the Supreme Court of the State of Maine handed down a decision saying, essentially, that the government could restrict the cutting of trees on private land in order to prevent erosion. Roosevelt backed up this governmental action, publicly stating his view that the needs of the community outweighed the private property rights of individuals or industries.
This was a controversial stance. The idea that private property, whether a person’s own personal property or that of his or her business, is protected by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution is one of the bedrock ideals of American society and industry. The Fifth Amendment states that no “private property [shall] be taken for public use, without just compensation.” Many individuals and busines owners felt that restrictions on the use of their property, such as those imposed by antitrust regulation or environmental protection regulation, violated this right. This tension

between private property rights and public use for the good of the community is still present today.
Changes in Population Affect Water Policy
Another highly controversial natural resource issue was water. Over centuries, Native Americans had used various irrigation methods to bring water to the arid Southwest. The situation changed in the late 1800s, when newcomers began mining and farming in Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, and California. Mining machinery required a great deal of water, and watersharing systems long used by those states’ Mexican American residents were challenged by the new people and businesses who arrived. Private irrigation companies came to the area, staked claims to sections of riverbeds, and redirected the water so farmers could revive—or “reclaim”— dried-up fields. As increases in population strained environmental resources, bitter fights developed over who should own water rights and how the water should be shared.
Roosevelt sprang into action on this issue. He listened to Nevada representative Francis Newlands, who wanted the federal government to help western states build huge reservoirs to hold and to conserve water. Roosevelt pushed Congress for a law that would allow it.
In 1902, Congress passed the National Reclamation Act, which gave the federal government the power to decide where and how water would be distributed. The government would build and manage dams that would create reservoirs, generate power, and direct water flow. This would make water from one state’s rivers and streams available to farmers in other states. The full effect of the Reclamation Act was felt over the next few decades, as water management projects created huge reservoirs and lakes where there had been dry canyons. Examples include the Salt Valley Project in Arizona and the Roosevelt Dam and Hoover Dam on the Colorado River.

New Direction In Presidential Politics
Roosevelt left the presidency after two terms in office, saying he wished to enjoy private life. He was still a powerful force in the Republican Party, however, and he used that power to help his Secretary of War William Howard Taft win the presidency in 1908. Roosevelt expected Taft to continue his programs of managing business and natural resources. Political cartoonists
» Analyze Political Cartoons What clues in this cartoon reveal what type of policies the author believes Taft will enact as president?
made caricatures of Roosevelt handing over what he called “my policies” to Taft, who seemed to have no ideas of his own.
Taft’s Agenda Differs But Taft soon set his own agenda. He approved the Payne-Aldrich Act (1909), which did not lower tariffs as much as Roosevelt had wanted. He also pushed Congress to pass the Mann-Elkins Act (1910), which gave the government control over telephone and telegraph rates. He encouraged Congress to propose an income tax. Perhaps most importantly, he dropped Roosevelt’s distinction between good trusts and bad trusts.
Taft’s Justice Department brought lawsuits against twice as many corporations as Roosevelt’s had done. One result was that in 1911, the Supreme Court “busted” the trust built by the Standard Oil Company. But Taft also supported what the Court called its “rule of reason,” which relaxed the hard line set by the Sherman Antitrust Act. The rule of reason allowed big monopolies so long as they did not “unreasonably” squeeze out smaller companies. Roosevelt publicly criticized these decisions. Then Taft’s attorney general sued to force U.S. Steel to sell a coal company it had bought. Roosevelt, who had earlier approved the purchase of the company, fumed.

Taft further infuriated Roosevelt and other Progressives in the Republican Party when he fired Gifford Pinchot for publicly criticizing Secretary of the Interior Richard Ballinger. Pinchot charged that Ballinger, who opposed Roosevelt’s conservation policies, had worked with business interests to sell federal land rich in coal deposits in Alaska. Although a congressional investigation later cleared Ballinger of these charges, the damage had been done.
Roosevelt’s Response Roosevelt began traveling the country speaking about what he called the New Nationalism—a program to restore the government’s trustbusting power. Declaring himself as “strong as a bull moose,” Roosevelt vowed to tackle the trusts in a third presidential term. The Taft-Roosevelt battle split the Republican Party as an election neared. Progressives bolted from the Republican party and set up the Progressive Party. Reformer Jane Addams nominated Roosevelt as the Progressive Party’s candidate for the 1912 presidential election.
The Republicans nominated Taft. The question was whether a third party like the Progressive Party could have an impact in a national election. A bitter election loomed.
Wilson Takes Advantage of Republican Discord
The split created an opportunity for the Democrats and their candidate, Woodrow Wilson, to win the White House. Wilson’s ideas had caught the attention of William Jennings Bryan, who helped Wilson win
the Democratic nomination. As a student and later as a professor, Wilson had thought a great deal about good government. His doctoral thesis, Congressional Government,had launched him on a career teaching in college before he became the reforming governor of New Jersey.
Wilson shaped his ideas into a program he called the New Freedom. His plan looked much like Roosevelt’s New Nationalism. It, too, would place strict government controls on corporations. In a speech on the New Freedom, Wilson outlined his aim to provide more opportunities—more freedom—for small businesses.
The man with only a little capital is finding it harder and harder to get into the field, more and more impossible to compete with the big fellow. Why? Because the laws of this country do not prevent the strong from crushing the weak.
— Woodrow Wilson, “The New Freedom, ” 1913
Though he did not win the majority of the popular vote, Wilson received more than four times the number of Electoral College votes that went to Roosevelt or to Taft. The Progressive Party had indeed had an impact on the election. By splitting the Republican vote, the Progressive Party helped the Democrat Wilson to win the White House.

Wilson Endorses Further Regulation
Republicans Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft introduced the country to forceful Progressive Presidents. Democrat Woodrow Wilson used the expanded power of the presidency to promote a far-reaching reform agenda. Some of Wilson’s economic and antitrust measures are still important in American life today.
President Wilson attacked what he called the “triple wall of privilege”—the tariffs, the banks, and the trusts—that blocked businesses from being free. Early in his first term, he pushed for new laws that would bring down those three walls and give the government more control over the economy.
A
New Tax on Income First, Wilson aimed to prevent big manufacturers from possibly charging unfairly high prices to their customers. One way to do this was to lower the tariffs on goods imported from foreign countries so consumers could buy foreign goods if American companies’ prices were too high. Wilson called a special session of Congress and convinced its members to pass the Underwood Tariff Bill, which cut tariffs.
Tariffs had been one of the main sources of revenue, or money coming in, for the federal government. To make up for the loss of tariff revenue, the Underwood Tariff Act of 1913 included a provision to create a graduated income tax. The recently passed Sixteenth Amendment gave Congress the power to collect an income tax without restrictions. A graduated income tax means that wealthy people pay a higher percentage of their income than do poor people. The revenue from the income tax more than made up for the money the government lost by lowering tariffs on imports.
Taxing incomes proved to be a very controversial reform. Both Republicans and conservative Democrats strongly opposed ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, as did prominent business leaders. The graduated tax became and continues to be the battleground between those who favor lower rates to stimulate economic growth and those who view it as a means to further public investment.

3.4 Reformers in the White House
Regulation of Commercial Banks Next, Wilson tried to change the banking system. At the time, the country had no central authority to supervise banks and establish monetary policy, which is control of the supply of money in circulation at any given time. Monetary policy, carried out by a central authority, helps to influence and control interest rates with the goal of promoting economic growth and stability and controlling inflation and deflation. Without such a central authority, interest rates for loans could fluctuate wildly, and a few wealthy bankers had a great deal of control over national, state and local banks’ reserve funds. This meant that a bank might not have full access to its reserves when customers needed to withdraw or borrow money.
Wilson pushed Congress to pass the Federal Reserve Act (1913). This law placed commercial banks under the control of a Federal Reserve Board, which set up regional banks to hold the reserve funds from those commercial banks. This system, still in place today, helps protect the American economy from having too much money end up in the hands of one person, bank, or region.
The Federal Reserve Board also sets the interest rate that banks pay to borrow money from other banks, and it supervises banks to make sure they are well run.
The financial community bitterly opposed passage of the Federal Reserve Act. Critics claimed that it
gave the federal government too much control over the nation’s economy and banking system, a point of view that some Americans still hold today. However, some historians have called the Federal Reserve Act the most important piece of economic legislation before the 1930s.
Wilson and Congress Strengthen Antitrust Regulation Like Presidents before him, Wilson focused on trusts. He agreed with Roosevelt that trusts were not dangerous as long as they did not engage in unfair practices.
In 1914, Wilson persuaded Congress to create the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Members of this group were named by the President to monitor business practices that might lead to monopoly. The FTC was also charged with watching out for false advertising or dishonest labeling. Congress also passed the Clayton Antitrust Act (1914), which strengthened earlier antitrust laws by spelling out those activities in which businesses could not engage.
These laws are still in effect today, protecting both businesses and consumers from abusive business activities. In recent years, the FTC has prosecuted companies that traded stocks dishonestly and fined companies that published false ads. The FTC also regulates buying on the Internet. Some Americans argue, however, that such government regulation

Workers Gain Rights The Clayton Antitrust Act also ushered in a new era for workers by protecting labor unions from being attacked as trusts. Now, workers could organize more freely. Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) praised the new law as the “Magna Carta” of labor.
On the heels of these protections came the Workingman’s Compensation Act (1916), which gave wages to temporarily disabled civil service employees. That same year, Wilson pushed for the Adamson Act to prevent a nationwide railroad strike, which would have stopped the movement of coal and food, leaving millions of Americans cold and hungry. Railroad union leaders insisted on the eight-hour day, but railroad managers would not accept it. Wilson called many company leaders to the White House, pleading with them to change their minds and avert a strike. When those efforts failed, he worked with Congress to pass the Adamson Act, which limited railroad employees’ workdays to eight hours.
However, Wilson did not always support organized labor, as a tragic incident known as the Ludlow Massacre showed. In the fall of 1913, coal miners in Ludlow, Colorado, demanded safer conditions, higher pay, and the right to form a union. When the coal company refused, they walked off the job. Evicted from company housing, the miners and their families set up in a tent city near the mines. The strike continued through the winter. Then, on April 20,1914, the Colorado National Guard opened fire on the tent city and set fire to the tents, killing some 26 men, women, and children. In the end, Wilson sent federal troops to restore order
and break up the strike. The miners’ attempt to form a union had failed.

The Progressives’ Legacy
The political reforms of the Progressives had a lasting effect on the American political system. The initiative, referendum, and recall and the Seventeenth and Nineteenth amendments expanded voters’ influence. Progressive reforms also paved the way for future trends. Starting in this period, the federal government grew to offer more protection to Americans, but at the same time gaining more control over people’s lives.
The American economy today showcases the Progressives’ legacy. Antitrust laws, the Federal Reserve Board, and the other federal agencies watch closely over the economy. Controls that Roosevelt and Wilson put in place continue to provide consumer protections. In later years, the government, for better or worse, built on those actions to extend regulation over other aspects of business.
The Progressive years also greatly expanded the government’s role in managing natural resources. However, federal action on dams, national parks, and resource use remain major areas of debate, especially in the West. Those debates and decisions affect people in other regions as well. For example, while farmers
America Comes of Age 189	3.4 Reformers in the White House
in California, Arizona, or New Mexico worry about getting enough water to grow crops, the rest of the nation awaits the delivery of the food they grow.
It is true that many of the problems identified by the Progressives still plague us today. There are still dishonest sellers, unfair employment practices, and problems in schools, cities, the environment, and public health. However, the Progressive reformers passed on the idea that government can take action to help people and private enterprise fix those problems.

For most of its early history, America played a small role in world affairs, mostly by choice. But in the late 1800s, this began to change.
With leading spokesmen calling for the United States to join the ranks of the world’s major powers, the United States began to acquire influence and territories outside its continental borders. The United States was abandoning isolationism and emerging as a new power on the global stage.
American Influence Grows
America on the World Stage
During the Age of Imperialism, from the mid-1800s through the early 1900s, powerful nations engaged in a mad dash to extend their influence across much of the world. European nations added to colonies they had established during the Age of Exploration by acquiring new colonies in Africa and Asia.
Following European success, Japan and the United States also began to consider the benefits of imperialism, the policy by which strong nations extend their political, military, and economic control over weaker territories. Although imperialism would prove an awkward fit for the United States, the nation’s desire to take its place on the world stage spurred some territorial expansion and a larger increase in influence.
Economic Causes of Imperialism One reason why Europeannations and Japan rushed to grab colonies was the desire for raw materials and natural resources. They sought colonies to provide tea, rubber, iron, petroleum, and other materials for their industries at home. These colonial economies were examples of extractive economies. The imperial country extracted, or removed, raw materials from the colony

and shipped them to the home country. Possession of colonies gave nations an edge in the competition for global resources. In contrast to those other world powers, however, the resource-rich United States had fewer concerns about shortages of raw materials in the nineteenth century.
For Americans, the problem was not a shortage of materials, but a surplus of goods. The booming U.S. economy of the late 1800s was producing more goods than Americans could consume. Farmers complained that excess production resulted in declining crop prices and profits. Industrialists urged expanding trade into new overseas markets where American commodities could be sold. Otherwise, they warned, American factories would close and unemployment would rise. Senator Albert J. Beveridge, a Progressive and friend of Theodore Roosevelt, explained why the United States needed to become a world power:
Today we are raising more [crops] than we can consume. Today we are making more than we can use. . . . Therefore we must find new markets

capital, new work for our labor.
—Senator Albert J. Beveridge, “The March of the Flag,” 1898
Alfred T. Mahan Stresses U.S. Military Strength
To expand and protect their interests around the world, nations built up their military strength. Alfred T. Mahan, a military historian and an officer in the United States Navy, played a key role in transforming America into a naval power. In The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, Mahan asserted that since ancient times, many great nations had owed their greatness to powerful navies. Mahan believed strongly that control of the seas during wartime was crucial to a nation’s success. He called upon America to build a modern fleet. Mahan also argued that the United States would need to acquire foreign bases where American ships could refuel and gather fresh supplies.
Influenced by the ideas of Mahan and others, the United States expanded and modernized its navy by building new steel-plated, steampowered battleships such as the USS Maine. By 1900, the United States had the third-largest navy in the world. Leaders such as U.S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, a strong supporter of American expansionism, continued to encourage a naval build-up into the early twentieth century. Lodge and others believed that the a strong navy was vital to the protection of U.S. interests both at home and abroad.
Social Darwinism, Missionaries, and National Superiority European and Japanese imperialists used ideas of racial, national, and cultural superiority to justify taking over colonies. One of these ideas was Social Darwinism, the belief that life consists of competitive struggles in which only the fittest survive. Social Darwinists felt that certain nations and races were superior to others and therefore were destined to rule over inferior peoples and cultures. Some prominent Americans embraced these ideas and began to worry that if the United States remained isolated while European nations gobbled up the rest of the world, America would not survive.
One reason that these Americans embraced Social Darwinism was that they had long believed that God had granted them the right and responsibility to settle the frontier. They spoke of America’s “Manifest Destiny” to expand all the way to the Pacific Ocean. In a best-selling work titled Our Country Josiah Strong picked up on this theme. A religious missionary, Strong argued that Americans had a responsibility to spread their Western values. “God is training the

Anglo-Saxon race,” he asserted, "for its mission [to civilize] weaker races.” Influenced by Strong, many American missionaries journeyed to foreign lands to gain converts to Christianity. Although missionaries were often motivated by a sincere desire to spread their faith, the linking of missionary work to the concept of U.S. expansionism strengthened American presence in these territories.
In The Significance of the Frontier in American History, historian Frederick Jackson Turner noted that the frontier had been closed by gradual settlement in the nineteenth century. Throughout American history, he continued, the frontier had traditionally supplied an arena where ambitious Americans could pursue their fortunes and secure a fresh start. It had thus served as a “safety valve,” siphoning off potential discontent.
Now that America had spanned the continent, advocates of Turner's thesis urged overseas expansion as a way to keep the "safety valve” open and avoid internal conflict.

America Begins to Expand
Beginning in the mid-1800s, with little fanfare, America focused more and more on expanding its trade and acquiring new territories. One of America’s first moves toward world power came before the Civil War.
American Expansionism in the Pacific Begins In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry sailed a fleet of American warships into present-day Tokyo Bay, Japan. Prior to Perry’s arrival, Japan had denied the rest of the world access to its ports. In fact, because most Japanese people had never seen steamships before, they thought the ships in Perry’s fleet were "giant dragons puffing smoke.” Perry cleverly won the Japanese emperor's favor by showering him with lavish gifts. Japanese leaders also realized that by closing off their nation to the outside world, they had fallen behind in military technology. Within a year, Perry negotiated a treaty that opened Japan to trade with America.
Perry’s journey set a precedent for further expansion across the Pacific Ocean. In 1867, the United States took possession of the Midway Islands. Treaties in 1875 and 1887 increased trade with the Hawaiian Islands and gave the United States the right to build a naval base at Pearl Harbor.
The Klondike Gold Rush In 1867, Secretary of State William Seward bought Alaska from Russia for
$7.2 million. Journalists scoffed at the purchase and referred to Alaska as "Seward’s Folly” and “Seward’s Icebox.” They wondered why the United States would want a vast tundra of snow and ice 1,000 miles north of its border. But Seward’s purchase almost doubled the country’s size, and the “icebox” turned out to be rich in timber, oil, and other natural resources. Alaska also greatly expanded America’s reach across the Pacific. Scholars today see Seward’s purchase as a key milestone on America’s road to power.
By the mid-1880s, gold had been discovered in several locations near Alaska, sparking the Klondike Gold Rush. The stampede to the Klondike goldfields in British Columbia and Yukon territory led to the development of new towns in Alaska. However, the human geography challenges of sparse settlement and lack of transportation routes and the physical geography challenges caused by nearby mountains and a frigid climate ended the rush by 1899.

business leaders saw Latin America as a natural place to expand their trade and investments. Secretary of State James Blaine helped them by sponsoring the First International Pan-American Conference in 1889. Blaine preached the benefits of economic cooperation to delegates of 17 Latin American countries. The

conference also paved the way for the construction of the Pan-American Highway system, which linked the United States to Central and South America.
In 1895, tensions rose between America and Great Britain because of a border dispute between British Guiana and Venezuela. Claiming that Britain was violating the Monroe Doctrine, President Cleveland threatened U.S. intervention. After some international saber-rattling, the British accepted a growing U.S. sphere of influence in Latin America. Relations between Britain and the United States soon improved.

The Acquisition of Hawaii
By the 1890s, the Hawaiian Islands had been economically linked to the United States for almost a century. Since the 1790s, American merchant ships had stopped at Hawaii on their way to East Asia. Missionaries had established Christian churches and schools on the islands. Americans had also established sugar cane plantations there. In 1887, American planters convinced King Kalakaua (kah LAH kah oo ah) to amend Hawaii’s constitution so that voting rights were limited to only wealthy landowners, who were, of course, the white planters.
Influence of Dole and Other Americans in Hawaii
In the early 1890s, American planters in Hawaii faced two crises. First, a new U.S. tariff law imposed duties on previously duty-free Hawaiian sugar. This made Hawaiian sugar more expensive than sugar produced in the United States. The sugar growers in Hawaii therefore feared that they would suffer decreasing sales and profits.
The other problem was that in 1891, Kalakaua died and his sister Liliuokalani (lih lee oo oh kah lah nee) was his successor. A determined Hawaiian nationalist, Queen Liluokalani resented the increasing power of the white planters, who owned much of Hawaiian land. She abolished the constitution that had given political power to the white minority.
With the backing of U.S. officials, the American planters responded quickly and forcefully. In 1893, they overthrew the queen. John Stevens, U.S. minister to Hawaii, ordered United States Marines to help the rebels seize power. The new government, led by influential lawyer Sanford B. Dole, asked President Benjamin Harrison to annex Hawaii to the United States.
Dole, born in Hawaii of missionary parents, was a well-respected lawyer and jurist who was connected to
America Comes of Age 194	3.5 American Influence Grows
Hawaii’s planter elite. His cousin, James Dole, moved to Hawaii in 1899 and helped build a pineapple company that still exists today.
The United States Annexes Hawaii After Liluokalani's overthrow, President Harrison signed the treaty of annexation but could not get the required Senate approval before Grover Cleveland became President. Cleveland ordered a full investigation, which revealed that the majority of the Hawaiian people did not approve of the treaty. Cleveland refused to sign the agreement and apologized for the “flagrant wrong” done by the “reprehensible conduct of the American minister.”
However, American sentiment for annexation remained strong, especially on the West Coast, where California business interests had close ties with the planters in Hawaii. In 1897, a new President entered the White House. William McKinley’s administration favored annexation, and in 1898, after the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, Congress proclaimed Hawaii an official U.S. territory with Sanford B. Dole as its first governor.

Sympathies for Cuban Rebels At the end of the nineteenth century, Spain was an imperial nation in decline. Its formerly vast empire had dwindled to a small number of possessions, including the Philippine Islands in the Pacific and the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and Cuba. By 1897, American entrepreneurs had invested $50 million in sugar cane plantations and other ventures in Cuba, which lay just 90 miles off the Florida coast. These businessmen saw Cuba as a growing market for American products. However, the island was very unstable. Yearning for freedom, the Cubans repeatedly rebelled against Spanish rule.
In 1895, Cuban patriot Jose Marti launched a war for independence from Spain. With cries of “Cuba Libre!” (“Free Cuba!”), rebel fighters used guerrilla tactics of hit-and-run raids against Spanish forces. In response, Spanish General Valeriano Weyler devised a plan to deprive the rebels of food and recruits. He herded the rural population into reconcentration camps, where tens of thousands died from disease

and starvation. Meanwhile, the Cubans and Spanish destroyed American property.
Many Americans favored the Cubans, whose struggle for freedom and democracy reminded Americans of their own revolutionary heritage. The brutality of Spanish tactics intensified American affection and sympathy for the rebels. But other Americans, especially business people, were worried about U.S. economic interests in Cuba and hoped that Spain would quickly put down the rebellion.
Influence of Mass Media Rival newspaper publishers Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst heightened the public’s dislike of the Spanish government. Their publications were called the Yellow Press because they featured a popular comic-strip character called The Yellow Kid. To boost readership, Pulitzer’s New York World, Hearst’s New York Journal, and similar newspapers pasted sensational headlines and pictures on their front pages. Their stories exaggerated Spanish atrocities and compared Cuban rebels to the patriots of the American Revolution.
President William McKinley warned the Spanish to quickly establish peace, or the United States would take whatever steps it “should deem necessary to procure this result.” Spain recalled General Weyler and offered the Cuban rebels some reforms. But the rebels insisted on independence, which Spain refused to grant. McKinley ordered the battleship Maine to Havana harbor to protect American citizens in Cuba.
Then, in February 1898, the Journal published a private letter written by Enrique Dupuy de Lome, Spain’s ambassador to Washington, D.C. The letter, stolen by Cuban rebels and leaked to Hearst, called McKinley a weak and stupid politician. Hearst published the letter under the sensational headline, “Worst Insult to the United States in Its History.” The letter fueled American jingoism, or aggressive nationalism, and inflamed relations with Spain.
The Explosion of the Maine Soon after the Journal published de Lome’s letter, the Maine exploded in Havana harbor. Of the 350 officers and crew on board at the time, 266 died. The Yellow Press promptly accused Spain of blowing up the battleship. One Journal headline even declared: "War? Sure!”
But President McKinley did not ask Congress to declare war just yet. Instead, he ordered a special naval board of inquiry to investigate the cause of the explosion. On March 28, 1898, the board concluded that a mine had destroyed the battleship. Years later, follow-up investigations raised doubts about the naval board’s findings, but, at the time, most people blamed Spain.

The Spanish-American War Begins War fever gripped the nation. In newspapers, speeches, and songs, patriotic Americans implored their fellow citizens to “Remember the Maine\” In response to American demands, Spain agreed to abolish the reconcentration camps and make other concessions, but it was too little too late. On April 11, 1898, McKinley asked Congress for the authority to use force against Spain to end the fighting in Cuba “in the name of humanity, in the name of civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests."
Eight days later, Congress enacted four resolutions that amounted to a declaration of war on Spain. The fourth resolution—the Teller Amendment—stipulated that the United States had no intention of annexing Cuba. The navy quickly blockaded Cuban ports, and McKinley called for more than 100,000 volunteers to join the army. In response, Spain declared war on the United States.

Americans responded enthusiastically to the war. About 200,000 men enlisted in the army, up from the 25,000 that enlisted at the beginning of 1898. In early May, as the United States Army prepared to attack, Americans heard news of a great naval victory over Spain. But, surprisingly, the victory was not in Cuba. Rather, it was in the Pacific Ocean, on the opposite side of the world.
Acquiring the Philippines On May 1, 1898, Commodore George Dewey steamed his squadron of vessels into Manila Bay, in the Spanish-held Philippines. The Americans completely surprised the Spanish fleet that was stationed in the bay.
Upon issuing the order to “fire when ready,” Dewey watched his ships quickly destroy the Spanish force. While no Americans died during the naval battle, nearly 400 Spanish sailors lost their lives. American gleefully received news of the victory and proclaimed Dewey a hero.
While Dewey was winning an astounding victory over the Spanish navy, Filipino nationalists led by Emilio Aguinaldo (ahg ee nahl doh) were defeating the Spanish army. Like the Cubans, the Filipinos were fighting for freedom from Spain. In August, after some

15,000 U.S. soldiers had landed on the islands, Spanish troops surrendered to the United States.
Victory in the Philippines Meanwhile, American troops landed in Cuba in June 1898. U.S. Marines captured Guantanamo Bay, and a force of 17,000 soldiers under U.S. Army General William Shafter stormed ashore east of Santiago.
In spite of their excitement for the war, the troops faced deplorable conditions. They were poorly trained and supplied.
As they assembled for duty around Tampa, Florida, the soldiers were issued obsolete weapons and heavy wool uniforms that were unsuitable for Cuba's tropical climate. Corrupt and inefficient officials provided the men with rotting and contaminated food.
General Shafter’s army consisted of state National Guard units and regular army units, including the African American Ninth and Tenth Cavalry regiments from the western frontier. Another cavalry unit was organized and commanded by the future President Theodore Roosevelt. His Rough Riders consisted of rugged westerners and upper-class easterners who relished what Roosevelt called the "strenuous life.”
The Rough Riders and Roosevelt gained fame for the role they played in the battles for Kettle and San Juan hills outside Santiago, Cuba. Joined by African
American soldiers from the Ninth and Tenth Cavalries, the Riders stormed up those hills to secure high ground surrounding Santiago. One war correspondent described a charge of the African American soldiers:
[T]hey followed their leader up the terrible hill from whose crest the desperate Spaniards poured down a deadly fire of shell and musketry. They never faltered. . . . [T]heir aim was splendid, their coolness was superb. . . . The war had not shown greater heroism.
—War correspondent, 1898
Two days after the battle of San Juan Hill, the Spanish navy made a desperate attempt to escape from Santiago’s harbor. U.S. forces, which had blockaded the harbor, destroyed the Spanish fleet as it tried to break out. Surrounded, outnumbered, and dispirited, Spanish forces in Santiago surrendered. Although a few battles followed when U.S. forces occupied the island of Puerto Rico, another Spanish possession, the fighting had come to an end. Although almost 3,000 Americans died during the war, only around 380 died in combat. Disease, especially malaria and yellow fever, caused most of the deaths.

America Comes of Age 199	3.6 The Spanish-American War
The War as a Turning Point
Secretary of State John Hay referred to the conflict with Spain as a “splendid little war” because of the ease and thoroughness of America’s victory. Although the war may have been “splendid,” it created a new dilemma for Americans: What should the United States do with Spain's former possessions?
Pros and Cons of the Treaty of Paris Signed by Spain and the United States in December 1898, the Treaty of Paris officially ended the war. Spain gave up control of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Pacific island of Guam. It also sold the Philippines to the United States for $20 million.
The Teller Amendment, passed by Congress when it declared war on Spain, prevented the United States from taking possession of Cuba. The amendment did not, however, apply to the Philippines. Americans disagreed over whether to grant the Philippines independence or take full control of the Pacific nation.
Guam, with its excellent harbor and mid-Pacific location, was desired as a coaling station to fuel U.S. Navy and merchant ships traveling to the Far East. Between 1898 and 1950 (aside from the period of its occupation by Japan during World War II), Guam’s governor was an American naval officer appointed from Washington, D.C.
Differing Views on U.S. Expansionism In an 1899 interview, President McKinley explained, “We could not give [the Philippines] back to Spain—that would be cowardly and dishonorable.” He believed that America had no choice but to “take them all, and to educate the
Filipinos, and uplift and civilize . . . them.” McKinley's imperialist supporters presented similar reasons for maintaining control of the Philippines. They argued that the United States had a responsibility to govern the Filipinos. They reasoned that the islands represented a valuable stepping stone to trade in China. They warned that if the United States gave up the Philippines, other nations would take control of them.
Anti-imperialists, including William Jennings Bryan and Mark Twain, rejected these arguments. In 1899, a large group of anti-imperialists formed the American Anti-Imperialist League. The league condemned imperialism as a crime and attacked it as “open disloyalty to the distinctive principles of our government.”
The debate reached its climax in the U.S. Senate, where senators had to consider ratifying the Treaty of Paris. In February 1899, the Senate voted 57 to 27 in favor of the treaty. By a single “yes” ballot, the vote met the two-thirds majority necessary to ratify the treaty.
Although the military conflict had been expensive, its economic effects on the United States were mainly positive. There was much more agreement about the war’s effects among the U.S. business community than in Congress.
The acquisition of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines gave the U.S. Navy secure bases and coaling stations for its ships. The westward move of American power and influence was desired by farmers and industrialists who saw Asia, and China especially as an untapped market for their goods.
After the war, tropical agriculture, mostly in sugar, became big business for U.S. companies in Puerto Rico and Cuba. By 1895, U.S. interests already had more than $50 million invested in Cuba, and trade with the

island, mostly in sugar, was worth twice that. These interests certainly welcomed the increased American intervention and control after the Spanish-American War. In 1901, U.S. legislation known as the Platt Amendment put the internal, external, and economic affairs of Cuba under the control of the United States. It also established the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay The amendment was mostly repealed in 1934, but the naval base remains even today.
B CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Why did American leaders think it was important to keep the Philippines?
Effects of U.S.
Expansionism in the
Philippines
America’s decision to keep the Philippines reflected a desire to expand its influence, compete with European colonial powers, and gain new trade in Asia.
The Filipino nationalist leader Emilio Aguinaldo had thought that the United States was an ally in the Filipino struggle for independence. His forces had fought side by side with the Americans against the Spanish. However, after the United States decided to maintain possession of the Philippines, Aguinaldo grew disillusioned with America. He helped organize an insurrection, or rebellion, against U.S. rule. The rebels believed they were fighting for the same principle of self-rule that had inspired America's colonial patriots during the American Revolution.
Guerrilla War Erupts in the Philippines Outgunned by American troops, Filipino insurgents relied on guerrilla warfare, a form of nontraditional warfare generally involving small bands of fighters attacking behind enemy lines. In turn, the American military used extraordinary measures to crush the rebellion. Like the Spanish in Cuba, U.S. soldiers gathered civilians into overcrowded concentration camps. General Jacob Smith ordered his soldiers not to take prisoners. “I wish you to kill and burn, the more you kill and burn the better you will please me,” he commented. A California newspaper defended such actions:
Let us all be frank. WE DO NOT
WANT THE FILIPINOS. WE WANT

. The more of them killed the better.
It seems harsh. But they must yield before the superior race.
-—San Francisco Argonaut, 1902
In the spring of 1901, the Americans captured Aguinaldo. Although the fighting did not end immediately, his capture marked the beginning of the end of the insurrection. The war in the Philippines took more lives than the Spanish-American War. Nearly 5,000 Americans and 200,000 Filipinos died in the fighting. The U.S. government sent more than 100,000 troops to fight in the war and spent upwards of $400 million to defeat the insurgency. The conflict highlighted the rigors of fighting against guerrilla insurgents.
The Philippines Begin Limited Self-Rule In 1901, William Howard Taft—a future President of the United States—became governor of the Philippines. Taft had large ambitions for helping the islands recover from the rebellion. He censored the press and placed dissidents in jail to maintain order and to win the support of the Filipino people. At the same time, he began several policies to improve the situation of the Filipinos. He extended limited self-rule, with the Philippine Assembly convening in Manila in 1907. He alsoordered the construction of roads, bridges, and
schools. He established a public health system to care for Filipinos.
In 1916, Congress passed the Jones Act, which pledged that the Philippines would ultimately gain their independence. Thirty years later, after U.S. forces liberated the islands from Japanese occupation at the end of World War II, the Philippines finally became an independent nation.
Growing U.S. Position as a World Power In
1900, William Jennings Bryan ran against William McKinley for the presidency. To bolster his chances of winning reelection, the Republican McKinley named Theodore Roosevelt, the “hero of San Juan Hill,” as his vice-presidential running mate. Emphasizing the overwhelming U.S. victory over Spain, McKinley soundly defeated Bryan. The President’s reelection signaled America’s continuing faith in his expansionist policies.
The Spanish-American War was a significant event in the emergence of the United States as a world power. As a result of the war, the United States had an empire and a new stature in world affairs. The war marked a turning point in the history of American foreign policy.

As the United States emerged as a world power following the Spanish-American War, American leaders looked to strengthen economic and military interests in Latin America and East Asia. In East Asia, American leaders devised policies to open China and other Asian markets to U.S. producers. Meanwhile, Americans called for a more substantial role in Latin America, viewing the region as the nation’s backyard. Increasing influence in both regions brought economic benefits, but also increased international tensions.
The United States Emerges as a World Power
U.S.
Trade and Intervention in China By 1899, once-mighty China had fallen into political, economic, and military disarray. Its huge population, however, was a tempting target for other nations’ imported goods. Rather than compete for Chinese trade, Britain, France, Germany, and Russia carved China into distinct spheres of influence. Within its zone, each power had privileged access to Chinese ports and markets. Japan also expanded its regional influence, grabbing territory in China and Korea. Since the United States did not have a zone, this system of “special privileges" threatened to limit American trade in China.

impact on the actions of European nations or Japan. However, it served as a guiding principle of American foreign policy in Asia for years to come.
The U.S. Intervenes in the Boxer Rebellion In
response to the growing influence of outsiders in their country, some Chinese joined secret societies. One such society, the Righteous and Harmonious Fists, won the nickname “Boxers” from Europeans because its members trained in martial arts. The secret societies celebrated traditional Chinese customs and criticized Western ways. They also condemned Chinese converts to Christianity. Over time, simmering anger exploded into an outright rebellion against the “foreign devils.”
In May 1900, the Boxers killed foreign missionaries and besieged the foreign diplomats’ district in Beijing. A multinational force of European, American, and Japanese troops was sent to the Chinese capital to quash the Boxer Rebellion. An initial force of 2,100 soldiers grew to more than 20,000, including 2,000 Americans. After putting down the rebellion, European powers compelled China’s imperial government to pay an indemnity, or money to repair damage caused by the rebellion. This poured more fuel onto the nationalist fire. Chinese nationalists would eventually revolt and overthrow the emperor in 1911.
The Open Door Policy As the Boxer Rebellion engulfed China, Secretary of State Hay reasserted America’s Open Door Policy, which argued for equal privileges among countries trading with China. In a second note to European powers, Hay stated that the United States wanted to “preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity.” In other words, America did not want colonies in China; it just wanted free trade there. As an act of goodwill, the United States used some of the indemnity money it received from China to fund scholarships for Chinese students to study in America. Hay and others strongly believed that access to the markets in China was crucial to rebounding from an economic depression in the 1890s. The goal of the Open Door Policy was to bring American businesses the new foreign markets they needed.

in Manchuria, a region of China that bordered Russia. In February 1904, without a declaration of war, Japan attacked and bottled up Russia’s Pacific fleet stationed at Port Arthur, China. The Japanese followed up on this victory with a series of major land engagements in Manchuria that caused more than 100,000 Russian casualties. However, Japan also suffered heavy losses in the fighting.
Resolving the Russo-Japanese War In 1905, representatives from Russia and Japan met in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to negotiate an end to the Russo-Japanese War. When the talks stalled, Theodore Roosevelt, now President, intervened and convinced the two sides to sign a peace treaty. For his efforts, Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize. The President's intervention—and his receipt of the famous award—prominently displayed America’s growing role in world affairs.
Racial Prejudice Affects Foreign Relations Despite Roosevelt’s achievement, America entered troubled waters in its relations with Japan. A root cause of this trouble was anti-Asian sentiment on the West Coast of the United States. In the fall of 1906, the San Francisco

School Board banned Japanese, Chinese, and Korean children from attending public schools with white children. The incident drew Japan’s immediate wrath. One Tokyo journal demanded that Japan retaliate. “Stand up Japanese nation! Our countrymen have been HUMILIATED on the other side of the Pacific,” the newspaper cried out.
Roosevelt disapproved of the decision to segregate Asian children in the San Francisco schools. He understood Japan’s anger with America. To calm tensions, he negotiated a “Gentlemen’s Agreement” with Japan. According to the pact, the school board pledged to end its segregation policy. In return, Japan agreed to limit the emigration of its citizens to the United States.
The Great White Fleet Shows Naval Power While Roosevelt used diplomacy to ease tensions with Japan, he also promoted military preparedness to protect U.S. interests in Asia. Expressing rising concerns about Japan’s territorial expansion at the expense of China, Korea, and Russia—the President won congressional support for a new force of navy ships, known as the Great White Fleet. In 1907, Roosevelt sent this armada of 16 white battleships on a “good will cruise” around the world. The voyage of the Great White Fleet demonstrated America’s increased military power to the world.
SUMMARIZE
What conditions led to the Russo-Japanese War? American Foreign Policy in Latin America
As the United States tentatively asserted its interests in East Asia, Americans called for a more aggressive role in Latin America. American entrepreneurs and government leaders wanted the region to be a sphere of influence from which other great powers were excluded. American influence in Latin America brought obvious benefits to the United States, but it also contributed to anti-American hostility and instability in the region.
America’s victory over Spain liberated the Puerto Rican and Cuban people from Spanish rule. But victory left the fates of these islands unresolved. Would Puerto Rico and Cuba become independent nations? Or would they become colonies of the United States? As questions lingered in the aftermath of war, the United States assumed control in Puerto Rico and Cuba.

America’s new acquisition of Puerto Rico remained under direct U.S. military rule. In 1900, Congress passed the Foraker Act, which established a civil government in Puerto Rico. The act authorized the President of the United States to appoint a governor and part of the Puerto Rican legislature. Puerto Ricans could fill the rest of the legislature in a general election.
Whether Puerto Ricans could enjoy citizenship rights in the United States, however, remained unclear. This unusual situation led to a series of court cases, known as Insular Cases, in which the Supreme Court determined the rights of Puerto Ricans. One case examined whether the U.S. government could assess taxes on Puerto Rican goods sold in the United States. The Supreme Court ruled the taxes legal and determined that Puerto Ricans did not enjoy the same rights as U.S. citizens.
In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Jones-Shafroth Act. It granted Puerto Ricans more citizenship rights and gave the islanders greater control over their own legislature. Still, many Puerto Ricans expressed their discontent because they did not enjoy all of the same rights as Americans.
Relations with Cuba Although the Treaty of Paris granted Cuban independence, the United States Army did not withdraw from the island until 1902. But
before the U.S. military left, Congress obliged Cuba to add to its constitution the Platt Amendment. The amendment restricted the rights of newly independent Cubans and effectively brought the island within the U.S. sphere. It prevented Cuba from signing a treaty with another nation without American approval. It also required Cuba to lease naval stations to the United States. Additionally, the Platt Amendment granted the United States the “right to intervene” to preserve order in Cuba.
Many Cubans strongly disliked the Platt Amendment but soon realized that America would not otherwise end its military government of the island. The United States, for its part, was unwilling to risk Cuba’s becoming a base for a potentially hostile great power.
Cuba thus added the Platt Amendment to its constitution as part of a treaty with the United States. The treaty made Cuba a protectorate of the United States and governed their relationship for decades.

Why did Cuba add the Platt Amendment to its constitution?

“Big Stick” Diplomacy
Upon assuming the presidency after McKinley’s assassination, Theodore Roosevelt promoted a new kind of diplomacy based on America’s success in the Spanish-American War. Beyond determining what would happen to Puerto Rico and Cuba, Roosevelt developed a broader policy for U.S. action in Latin America. Historians have called this Roosevelt’s “big stick” diplomacy since it depended on a strong military to achieve America’s goals. “Big stick” stemmed from the President’s admiration for an old African saying, “Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.”
Roosevelt’s view that America needed to carry a big stick during the Age of Imperialism flowed from his adherence to balance-of-power principles and from his view of the United States as a special nation with a moral responsibility to “civilize,” or uplift, weaker nations. In this sense, the new President held beliefs similar to those of imperial powers in Europe and Asia. Roosevelt also felt that America’s elite—its statesmen and captains of industry—had to accept the challenge of international leadership.
Physical and Human Geographic Factors Impact the Panama Canal One of Roosevelt’s biggest dreams was to create a passage from the Caribbean Ocean to the Pacific Ocean through Central America. He did not
originate the plan, but he played a crucial role in making it happen. But first, Roosevelt and the American team of engineers worked to overcome a number of human and physical geographic challenges.
In the late 1800s, a French company had tried to link the Atlantic to the Pacific across the Isthmus of Panama but failed. Afterwards, some suggested building a canal through Nicaragua. However, those plans came to nothing.
Eventually, an agent from the French company that had abandoned its canal attempt convinced the United States to buy the company’s claim. In 1903, the U.S. government bought the Panama route for $40 million.
Before it could build a canal through Panama, however, the United States needed the consent of the Colombian government. At the time, Panama was part of independent Colombia. American efforts to negotiate a purchase of land across the isthmus stalled when Colombia demanded more than the United States was willing to provide.
So Roosevelt stepped in. The President dispatched U.S. warships to the water off Panama to support a Panamanian rebellion against Colombia. The appearance of the United States Navy convinced the Colombians not to suppress the uprising. Panama soon declared its independence from Colombia. The new nation immediately granted America control over the “Canal Zone.” To secure this land for its vital trade link,

America agreed to pay Panama $10 million and an annual rent of $250,000.
More than 35,000 workers helped dig the Panama Canal. The physical geography and climate of the region were both factors that impacted the enormous project. Workers built a series of locks to raise ships to the level of Gatun Lake, 85 feet above sea level, to cross the isthmus. Completion of the canal depended on scientific breakthroughs by doctors as they learned how to combat tropical diseases. Still, more than 5,000 canal workers died from disease or accidents while building the canal. When the finished waterway opened in 1914, it cut some 8,000 nautical miles off the trip from the west coast to the east coast of the United States.
American Expansionism Requires an Updated Monroe Doctrine In the early 1900s, the inability of Latin American nations to pay their debts to foreign investors raised the possibility of European intervention. In 1903, for example, Germany and Britain blockaded Venezuelan ports to ensure that debts to European bankers were repaid. Roosevelt concluded: “If we intend to say hands off to the powers of Europe, then sooner or later we must keep order ourselves.” So in a 1904 message to Congress, he announced a new Latin American policy.
The President’s Roosevelt Corollary updated the Monroe Doctrine for an age of expansionism and
economic influence. In the case of “chronic wrongdoing” by a Latin American nation—the kind that Europeans might use to justify military intervention—the United States would assume the role of police power, restoring order and depriving other creditors of the excuse to intervene. This change, Roosevelt argued, merely reasserted America's long-standing policy of keeping the Western Hemisphere free from European intervention.
The Latin American Response Many Latin Americans resented America’s role as the hemisphere’s police force. They disagreed with Roosevelt’s belief that Latin Americans could not police themselves. Francisco Garcia Calderon, a Peruvian diplomat, contended that the Monroe Doctrine had taken on an “aggressive form with Mr. Roosevelt.” Like Calderon, Nicaraguan spokesman Augusto Sandino felt that the United States threatened the “sovereignty and liberty” of his people. Sandino eventually led an army of guerrillas against U.S. Marines in Nicaragua in the 1920s.
Taft’s Foreign Policies Lead to “Dollar Diplomacy”
Roosevelt handpicked William Howard Taft to succeed him as the Republican candidate for President in 1908. Taft shared Roosevelt’s basic foreign policy objectives. After defeating William Jennings Bryan in the general election, Taft wanted to maintain the Open Door Policy
America Comes of Age 209 : 3.7 The United States Emerges as a World Power
in Asia and ensure ongoing stability in Latin America. The new President pursued both goals with the aim of affecting economic issues such as expanding American trade through foreign policy.
Taft hoped to achieve these ends by relying less on the "big stick” and more on “dollar diplomacy.” As Taft commented in 1912, he looked to substitute “dollars for bullets.” The policy aimed to increase American investments in businesses and banks throughout Central America and the Caribbean. Americans busily invested in plantations, mines, oil wells, railways, and other ventures in those regions. Of course, “dollar diplomacy” sometimes required a return to the “big stick” and military intervention. Such was the case when President Taft dispatched troops to Nicaragua in 1909—and again in 1912—to protect the formation of a pro-American government there.

How did “dollar diplomacy” affect American foreign policy?
Wilson’s “Moral
Diplomacy”
During the 1912 presidential election campaign, Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson criticized the foreign policies of his Republican predecessors
Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. After his election victory, Wilson appointed the anti-imperialist William Jennings Bryan as Secretary of State, which sent a strong message to the American people.
A
New Emphasis on Foreign Policy The new President intended to take U.S. foreign policy in a different direction. He promised that the United States would "never again seek one additional foot of territory by conquest” but would instead work to promote "human rights, national integrity, and opportunity.” Wilson spelled out his new “moral diplomacy” in a message to the American people:
We must prove ourselves [Latin America’s] friends and champions upon terms of equality and honor. . . .
We must show ourselves friends by comprehending their interest, whether it squares with our own interest or not. . . . Comprehension must be the soil in which shall grow all the fruits of friendship. ... I mean the development of constitutional liberty in the world.
—Woodrow Wilson, October 27, 1913

America Comes of Age 210	3.7 The United States Emerges as a World Power
In spite of his stated preference for “moral diplomacy” over “big stick” or “dollar diplomacy,” Wilson used the military on a number of occasions to guide Latin Americans in the directions that he thought proper. In 1915, Wilson sent marines to Haiti to protect American investments and to guard against the potential of German or French aggression in the nation. Wilson prodded the government of Haiti to sign an agreement that essentially gave the United States the right to control its financial and foreign affairs. The marines did not leave until 1934. Under Wilson, U.S. soldiers and sailors also intervened in the Dominican Republic and in Mexico.
Revolution Grips Mexico For decades, Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz had followed policies that benefited his country’s small upper class of wealthy landowners, clerics, and military men. With Diaz’s encouragement, foreign investments in Mexico grew. As a result, American business leaders owned large portions of Mexico’s industries. While foreign investors and Mexico’s artistocracy grew rich, Mexico’s large population of farmers struggled in poverty.
In 1911, Francisco Madero led the Mexican Revolution that toppled Diaz. Madero was committed to reforms but was a weak administrator. In 1913, General Victoriano Huerta seized power and executed Madero. Under “dollar diplomacy,” Taft likely would have recognized Huerta as the leader of Mexico because Huerta pledged to protect American investments. But under “moral diplomacy,” Wilson refused to do so, declaring that he would not accept a “government of butchers.” Instead, Wilson favored Venustiano Carranza, another reformer, who had organized anti-Huerta forces.
Intervention in Mexico In 1914, the President used the Mexican arrest of American sailors as an opportunity to help Carranza attain power. Wilson sent marines to occupy the Mexican port of Veracruz. The action caused Huerta’s government to collapse, and Carranza assumed the presidency.
Huerta’s fall from power cheered many Mexicans and appeared to validate Wilson’s “moral diplomacy.” However, Wilson soon discovered that he faced more trouble in Mexico. The new Carranza government was slow in bringing about reforms, and rebels again rose up, this time under the leadership of Francisco “Pancho” Villa. For a while, Wilson courted Villa. After American support disappeared in 1916, Villa’s forces crossed into New Mexico and raided the town of Columbus, leaving 18 Americans dead. President
» The United States supported Mexican rebel leader Pancho Villa’s insurrection against the Mexican government until his forces conducted an attack in the United States in 1916.
Wilson responded by sending General John J. Pershing and more than 10,000 troops on a “punitive expedition” to Mexico.
Pershing’s forces chased Villa for several months but failed to capture the rebel leader. Wilson eventually withdrew American troops from Mexico in 1917, mostly because of his concerns about World War I raging in Europe.
Not long afterward, the United States declared war on Germany. Free from hunting Villa, Pershing took command of the American Expeditionary Force in France.
A generation earlier, few would have believed it possible that more than one million American troops would engage in a large-scale war in Europe. But the triumph over Spain and U.S. actions in Asia and Latin America demonstrated that America had emerged as a world power. Now, World War I would test that new global strength.

In 1914, nationalism, militarism, imperialism, and entangling alliances combined with other factors to lead the nations of Europe into a brutal war. The war quickly spread around the globe. The United States remained neutral at first but ended up abandoning its long tradition of staying out of European conflicts.

The Causes of World War I
Until 1914, there had not been a large-scale European conflict for nearly one hundred years. However, bitter, deep-rooted problems simmered beneath the surface of polite diplomacy. Europe was sitting on a powder keg of nationalism, regional tensions, economic rivalries, imperial ambitions, and militarism.

Zimmermann note
Nationalism Escalates Tension in Europe Nationalism, or devotion to one’s nation, kick-started international and domestic tension. In the late 1800s, many Europeans began to reject the earlier idea of a nation as a collection of different ethnic groups. Instead, they believed that a nation should express the nationalism of a single ethnic group.
This belief evolved into an intense form of nationalism that heightened international rivalries. For example, France longed to avenge its humiliating defeat by a collection of German states in 1871 and regain Alsace-Lorraine, the territory it lost during that conflict. Nationalism also threatened minority groups within nation states. If a country existed as the expression of "its people,” the majority ethnic group, where did ethnic minorities fit in?

' The spread of the theory of Social Darwinism did not help soothe the competitive instinct. Social Darwinism applied biologist Charles Darwin’s ideas of natural selection and “survival of the fittest” to human society. Social Darwinists believed that the fittest nation would come out ahead in the constant competition among countries.
Nationalism also destabilized old multinational empires such as Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. This was particularly true in the Balkan region of southeastern Europe.
For example, when Serbia emerged as an independent nation in 1878, it challenged the nearby empire of Austria-Hungary in two ways: by trying to gain territory controlled by the empire, where Serbs lived, and by the example it offered to Austria-Hungary’s diverse peoples.
The nationalist sentiments of the period sometimes spilled over into the economic goals of each nation. Industrial output, trade, and the possession of an overseas empire were the yardsticks of wealth and greatness. The leading industrial nations competed for lands rich in raw materials as well as for places to build military bases to protect their empires. Britain already had a large empire, and France commanded a smaller one. But Germany, Italy, Belgium, Japan, and the United States also rushed to join the race to expand. Together, industrialized nations jostled among themselves as
they carved colonies out of Africa, claimed islands in the Pacific, and began to nibble away at China.
Militarism Increases Arms Production For some European leaders, the question was not so much if a. great war would start but when.To prepare, leaders increased the size of their armies and stockpiles of weapons. No nation readied its war machinery more than Germany. By 1914, it had a huge standing army and the largest, deadliest collection of guns in the world. It also built up its navy enough to rival Britain’s, the world’s strongest at that time. To keep up, Britain, too, increased the size of its navy. A spirit of militarism, or glorification of the military, grew in the competing countries and fueled this arms race even more.
The contest between Germany and Britain at sea and between Germany, France, and Russia on land guaranteed one important thing: The next major war would involve more troops and more technologically advanced weapons than ever before. Machine guns, mobile artillery, tanks, submarines, and airplanes would change the nature of warfare.
Alliances Between Nations increase the Potential for War European leaders also prepared for war by forming alliances. Before 1914, two major ones emerged.

World War I and the 1920s	227	4.1 America Enters World War I
Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy joined together in the Triple Alliance (although Italy never fought with it). Opposed to the Triple Alliance was the Triple Entente, made up of France, Russia, and Great Britain. Alliances emboldened leaders to act recklessly. They knew that if they did declare war, powerful allies were obligated to fight along with them. No country wanted to be seen as an unreliable partner. As years passed, European leaders thought less of the advantages of peace and more of the possible benefits of war. Some also hoped that a foreign war would help to smooth over domestic problems.
A
Significant Assassination On June 28, 1914, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, and his wife Sophie left for what they thought would be a routine visit to Sarajevo (sar uh YAY voh), the capital city of the Austro-Hungarian province of Bosnia. But a handful of young Bosnians had other plans for the archduke and his wife. These men were ethnic Serbs who believed that Bosnia rightfully belonged to Serbia, and they saw Francis Ferdinand as a tyrant. After the archduke’s driver made a wrong turn, Gavrilo Princip, one of the conspirators, noticed the couple in the car, pulled a pistol from his pocket, and fired it twice. First Sophie and then Francis Ferdinand died. People around the world were shocked by the
senseless murders. But no one expected that they would lead to a great world war.
B RECALL
What countries formed the Triple Entente? The Great War Begins
Everything was in place for a great conflict—nationalist ambitions, large armies, stockpiles of weapons, alliances, and military plans. The nations of Europe were hurtling like giant trains toward a great collision. Archduke Francis Ferdinand’s assassination was the incident that triggered this conflict.
Alliances Cause a Chain Reaction Soon after the assassination, Kaiser William II, the German emperor, assured Austria-Hungary that Germany would stand by its ally if war came. Confident in Germany’s support, Austria-Hungary then sent a harsh ultimatum to Serbia demanding Serbia’s total cooperation in an investigation into the assassination. When Serbia did not agree to all of the demands, Austria-Hungary declared war on July 28,1914.
Because of the alliance system, what otherwise might have been a localized quarrel quickly spread. In early August, Russia mobilized for war to help its ally Serbia against Austria. This caused Germany to declare war against Russia.
France, Russia’s ally, promptly declared war against Germany. The very next day, Germany declared war

against neutral Belgium, so that it could launch an invasion of France through that small country. Great Britain, which had treaties with France and Belgium, immediately declared war against Germany. In less than one week, the Central Powers of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria were at war against the Allied Powers of Britain, France, Russia, and Serbia. The Ottoman Empire later joined the Central Powers.
German soldiers fought through Belgium and moved southwest into France, toward Paris. Then in September, with the German advance only 30 miles from Paris, the French and the British counterattacked and stopped the German forces near the Marne River.
Technological Innovations Lead to Stalemate
After the Battle of the Marne, the Germans settled onto high ground, dug trenches, and fortified their position. When the French and British attacked, the German troops used machine guns and artillery to kill thousands of them. The French and British then dug their own trenches and used the same weapons to kill thousands of counterattacking Germans.
Soon, 450 miles of trenches stretched like a huge scar from the coast of Belgium to the border of Switzerland. Although fighting went on in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and in other parts of the world, this Western Front in France became the critical battle front. The side that won there would win the war.
The war dragged on for years, and it was hideously deadly—much more so than anyone had expected. The primary reason for the length of the war and its deadly nature was the simple fact that the defensive weapons of the time were better and more devastating than the offensive ones. Generals on each side threw their soldiers into assaults against the enemy without fully considering the new technology. Charging toward trenches that were defended by artillery, machine guns, and rifles was futile. In virtually every battle on the Western Front, the attacking force suffered terribly.
Even the use of poison gas did nothing to benefit the offense, despite its horrifying effects. Airplanes and tanks were both first used during World War I, but neither broke the stalemate.
Airplanes were mostly used for reconnaissance, or observing an area for military purposes. The torn-up ground caused by endless shelling created a need for a new military technology—the tank. Military leaders hoped tanks could plow through devastated battlefield areas, but the first tanks weren’t able to ride over such uneven terrain and often broke down during crucial battles. Ineffective offensives and effective defenses produced only a deadly stalemate.
The Reality of Trench Warfare The stalemate led to gruesome conditions for the men in the trenches of the Western Front. The soldiers battled the harsh
World War I and the 1920s ; 229	4.1 America Enters World War I
conditions of life often as fiercely as they attacked the enemy. They developed “trench foot" from standing for hours in wet, muddy trenches. They contracted lice from the millions of rats that infested the trenches. Dug into the ground, the soldiers lived in constant fear, afraid to pop their heads out of their holes and always aware that the next offensive might be their last.
Even on a quiet day, soldiers could be killed by snipers or a surprise gas attack, like the one described by French officer Paul Truffaut at Verdun:
The special shells the men call
“shells on wheels" [shells filled with poison gas] are whizzing by continuously They explode silently and have no smell but can be deadly. They killed several men yesterday. One of my men refused to put his mask on because he couldn’t smell anything.
All of a sudden, he was dizzy, foaming at the mouth and his skin went black, then he went rigid and died,
—Paul Truffaut. Mascn 5. 1917
In between enemy lines was an area known as “no man’s land.” Artillery barrages had blasted no
man’s land until any fields, trees, or homes, that had once existed there, were charred beyond recognition. Soldiers went "over the top” of their trenches into this muddy, nearly impassable wasteland when they attempted to attack the entrenched enemy.
Casualties—or soldiers killed, wounded, or missing—mounted first in thousands, then hundreds of thousands, and finally in millions. Almost one million French soldiers were killed or wounded in just the first three months of the war. The Germans lost only slightly fewer. In two battles in 1916—Verdun (ver duhn) and the Somme (suhm)—the British, French, and Germans sustained more than 2 million casualties. The British suffered 60,000 casualties on the first day alone at the Somme and achieved virtually nothing. And still the stalemate dragged on.

World War I and the 1920s	230 ; 4.1 America Enters World War I
to make Americans of peoples from diverse origins, Wilson did not want to see the war set Americans against one another. At first, most Americans viewed the conflict as a distant European quarrel for land and influence. Unless the nation’s interests were directly threatened, Americans wanted no part of it. They preferred to maintain what they viewed as traditional American isolation from European disputes. Still, many Americans felt the war's effects and few were truly impartial in thought. Most held a preference for one or another combatant, and many businesses benefited from the increased demand by warring nations for American goods.
Many Americans Choose Sides In 1914, one third of Americans were foreign-born. Many still thought of themselves in terms of their former homelands— as German Americans, Irish Americans, Polish Americans, and so on. With relatives in Europe, many people supported the nation in which they were born.
Some German Americans in the Midwest and some Irish Americans along the East Coast felt strongly that the Central Powers were justified in their actions. Many Americans had emigrated from Germany or Austria-Hungary. Millions of Irish Americans harbored intense grudges over the centuries of Great Britain’s domination of their homeland. They hoped that Ireland would gain its independence as Britain became entangled in the war. Many Jewish Americans who had fled Russia to escape the Czarist regimes’ murderous pogroms against Jews hoped for Russia’s defeat.
Most Americans, however, sided with Britain and France, both of which had strong historic ties with the United States. America’s national language was English, its cultural heritage was largely British, and its leading trading partner was Britain. France had aided the American cause during the Revolutionary War.
U.S.
Opinion Solidifies No event at the beginning of the war swayed American opinion more than the vicious German invasion of neutral Belgium. German soldiers marching through Belgium committed numerous atrocities, killing unarmed civilians, and destroying entire towns. British journalists and propagandists stressed, and sometimes exaggerated, the brutality of the Germans’ actions. Americans might have only dimly understood the causes of the war, but they clearly perceived the human cost of the war for Belgium. Eventually, three distinct positions on the war crystallized among Americans. One group, the isolationists, believed that the war was none of America’s business and that the nation should isolate itself from the hostilities. A second group, the

interventionists, felt that the war did affect American interests and that the United States should intervene in the conflict on the side of the Allies. A third group, the internationalists, occupied the middle ground. Internationalists believed that the United States should play an active role in world affairs and work toward achieving a just peace but not enter the war.
Q CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Into what three positions did U.S. opinion generally fall? Reasons for U.S. Entry into the War
An internationalist, President Wilson sincerely desired peace in his country and around the world. Between the start of the war in 1914 and America’s entry into it in 1917, Wilson attempted to use his influence to end the conflict among the warring countries. He failed in this great effort. Ultimately, he also failed to keep the United States out of the war.
Britain Blockades German Ports Early in the war, British leaders decided to use their navy to blockade Germany to keep essential goods from reaching the other country. International law generally allowed contraband goods, usually defined as weapons and other articles used to fight a war, to be confiscated legally by any belligerent nation. Noncontraband goods, such as food, medical supplies, and other nonmilitary items, could not be confiscated. Britain, however, contested the definition of noncontraband articles. As the war continued, Britain expanded its definition of contraband until it encompassed virtually every product, including gasoline, cotton, and even food—in spite of international law.
Passenger Ships Fall Victim to the War at Sea
Germany responded by attempting to blockade Britain—even though it lacked the conventional naval forces to do so. Instead, in February 1915, Germany began sinking Allied ships using its U-boats, or submarines. The reality of the German blockade struck America on May 7, 1915, when a German U-boat sank the British passenger liner Lusitania off the coast of Ireland.
Nearly 1,200 people perished. German officials correctly claimed that the ship was carrying ammunition and other contraband. Americans protested that an unarmed and unresisting ship should not be sunk without first being warned and provided with safety for its passengers. President Wilson was stunned but still wanted peace. “There is such a thing

as a man being too proud to fight,” he told his fellow citizens. “There is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right.”
Germany helped to keep the United States out of the war by eventually promising not to sink any more passenger ships. But in 1916, Germany violated that promise by sinking the unarmed French passenger ship Sussex. Another storm of protest erupted in America. Again, Germany pledged not to sink unarmed ships. This promise, called the Sussex Pledge, would not last long.
Preparations for War President Wilson wanted to remain at peace, but even he must have realized the futility of that hope. At the end of 1915, Wilson began to prepare the nation for war.
Many believed that “preparedness” was a dangerous course that could actually provoke war. Even so, Congress passed two pieces of legislation in 1916 to prepare for the possibility of U.S. involvement. The National Defense Act expanded the size of the army, and the Naval Construction Act ordered the building of more warships.
Still, Wilson hoped to avoid conflict. In 1916, he ran for reelection with the slogan “He kept us out of war.” It
was a close election, but Wilson won a narrow victory over Republican Charles Evans Hughes.
The United States Is Neutral No Longer Wilson did not have much time to enjoy his victory. In early 1917, two events occurred that helped to push the United States into the war. Both events showed Germany’s increasing aggression, the main reason why the United States ultimately entered the war.
American trade with the Allies had sustained Britain and France in the war, while the British blockade of Germany had stopped the flow of American goods to the Central Powers. As far as Germany was concerned, desperate times demanded desperate measures.
In January 1917, suffering severe supply shortages due to the blockade, Germany took action. First, German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann sent a telegram to Mexico. The Zimmermann note proposed an alliance with Mexico, stating that if the United States declared war on Germany, Mexico should declare war on the United States. In return, after a German victory, Mexico would get back the states of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, which it had lost in 1848 after its defeat in the Mexico-American War. The telegram was intercepted by the British, who gave it to American authorities. Next, Germany once again

4.1 America Enters World War I
Before the war, the federal government played a minor role in the daily lives of most Americans. But during World War I, the government assumed new powers. It regulated industrial and agricultural production, worked to shape public opinion, and established a new military draft. While war required sacrifice, it also brought new economic opportunities, and many Americans migrated to other parts of the country in search of these opportunities. The war permanently changed Americans’ relationship with their government.

During World War 1
Mobilizing for War
War affects many things, but its greatest impact is on the lives of ordinary people. People fight, sacrifice, and sometimes die in war. People work to produce the food that soldiers eat and the guns that soldiers fire. People shape the information that others receive about the war. War may be the result of conflicts between nations, but it touches the lives of millions of individuals.
Expanding the Army When the United States entered World War I, the U.S. Army was only a small fraction of the size of European armies. To build the army, President Wilson encouraged Americans to volunteer for service and pushed Congress to pass the Selective Service Act. The act, which Congress passed in May 1917, authorized a draft of young men for military service in Europe. On the first day of its enactment, June 5, 1917, more than 9.6 million Americans registered for the draft and were assigned a number. The government held a “great national lottery” in July to decide the order in which the first draftees would be called into service. Blindfolded, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker pulled number 258 out of a jar. The group of men assigned that number became the very first draftees.

Over the course of the war, more than 24 million Americans registered for the draft. Of these, about 2.8 million were actually drafted into the armed forces. Including volunteers, the total number of American men in uniform during World War I reached nearly 4.8 million. More than 4 million of these were sent to help the Allies in France.
Managing Economic Effects The economic effects of the international military conflict of World War I on the United States were significant. While the Selective Service Commission raised an army, President Wilson worked to shift the national economy from peacetime to wartime production. This process proved slow and frustrating. First, the Council of National Defense, which was formed in August 1916, created an array of new federal administrative agencies to oversee different phases of the war effort. Individual agencies regulated food production, coal and petroleum distribution, and railway use. In practical terms, this meant that the government determined what crops farmers grew, what products industries produced, and how supplies moved around on the nation’s trains.
Problems and administrative overlap soon led to the creation of the War Industries Board (WIB). The WIB eventually became independent of the Council of National Defense. Headed by Bernard Baruch(buh rook), an influential Wall Street investment broker who
reported directly to the President, the WIB regulated all industries engaged in the war effort. Baruch’s agency determined what products industries would make, where those products went, and how much they would cost. The system of free enterprise was curtailed to fulfill the nation’s acute need for war materials. Americans decided to cooperate rather than compete in order to defeat the Central Powers.
What Baruch did for industry, future U.S. president Herbert Hoover achieved for agriculture. As head of the Food Administration, he set prices high for wheat and other foodstuffs to encourage farmers to increase production. He also asked Americans to conserve food as a patriotic gesture. If the American people ate less, then more food could be shipped to American and other Allied soldiers fighting the war overseas. To this end, Hoover instituted wheatless Mondays and Wednesdays, meatless Tuesdays, and porkless Thursdays and Saturdays.
Convincing the American People Hoover's efforts would have been fruitless if the American people did not believe in supporting the war. Most Americans did not understand the reasons for the war in 1914, and many questioned why the United States became involved in 1917. It was the job of the Committee on Public Information (CPI) to educate the public about the causes and nature of the war. The CPI had

to convince Americans that the war effort was a just cause.
Wilson appointed George Creel as the director of the CPI. A former journalist and a passionate admirer of American institutions, Creel combined education and a widespread advertising campaign to “sell America.” The CPI distributed 75 million pamphlets and 6,000 press releases, and it assembled an army of 75,000 speakers who gave lectures and brief speeches on America's war aims and the nature of the enemy. In addition, the CPI designed, printed, and distributed millions of posters that dramatized the needs of America and its allies. The CPI also stressed the cruelty and wickedness of the enemy, particularly Germany, which in some cases aggravated resentment toward German Americans. Still, using these methods, Creel and the CPI earned widespread support for the American war effort.

Read aloud the first two paragraphs with a partner. Look at the phrase played a minor role, and discuss its meaning. Where have you heard or used the phrase to play a role? Opposition to the War
The CPI’s work was important because Americans did not always peacefully agree with one another about the war. Members of two large ethnic groups, German Americans and Irish Americans, tended to oppose the Allies for different reasons. Swept up in patriotic fervor, some people treated German Americans with prejudice, or intolerance. Other Americans were pacifists who opposed war for any reason. One major issue raised by U.S. involvement in World War I was that the government acted in ways that sometimes trespassed on individual liberties to quiet dissent, or differing opinions.
Opposition to the Draft Without a doubt, the draft created controversy. Some Americans believed it was an illegal intrusion of the federal government into their private lives. Some men refused to cooperate with the Selective Service process.
They were often court-martialed and imprisoned. Others simply tried to avoid the draft. Perhaps as many as 12 percent of men who received draft notices never responded to them.
Many Americans were conscientious objectors, people whose moral or religious beliefs forbid them
» Some citizens showed their opposition to the war and the draft by staging protests.

to fight in wars. In theory, the Selective Service Act exempted from combat service members of “any well recognized religious sect or organization... whose existing creed or principles forbid its members to participate in war.” In practice, this policy was widely ignored. This was a constitutional issue, because the First Amendment guarantees freedom of religion. In addition, some conscientious objectors were treated badly by their local draft boards, and others were humiliated in training camps. As America’s participation in the war increased, however, the government improved its treatment of conscientious objectors.
Women Oppose the War Some American women also opposed the war. Before the war, a number of leading American feminists, including reformer Jane Addams, formed the Women’s Peace Party and, with pacifist women from other countries, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Jeannette Rankin, the first woman to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the declaration of war. After America joined the Allies, some women continued to oppose the war, but most supported American war efforts. For example, the influential National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) dropped its initial peace initiatives and supported America’s war
World War I and the 1920s	237	4.2 The Home Front During World War I
objectives. After adopting this new policy, NAWSA doubled in size.
The Federal Government Stifles Dissent
Constitutional issues raised by federal government policy during World War I also centered on the First Amendment rights of free speech. The work of the CPI created a mood in America that did not welcome open debate. Some felt the CPI stifled the free expression of controversial opinions and worried about the impact of a rigorous military campaign on democracy. They did not want the freedoms that Americans held most dear to become victims of the conflict. Americans treasured their Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
And were not U.S. soldiers fighting for freedom? At the same time, since so much depended on individuals doing their part in the military or on the home front, retaining national unity was vital to America’s success in the war. As in previous and future wars, the government navigated a difficult path between respecting and restricting individual rights. Authorities tended to treat harshly individuals who worked against U.S. participation in the war.
In June 1917, Congress passed the Espionage Act, allowing postal authorities to ban treasonable or seditious newspapers, magazines, or printed materials from the mail. Thus, another First Amendment freedom, the freedom of the press, was compromised. It also
enacted severe penalties for anyone engaged in disloyal or treasonable activities. Anyone found obstructing army recruiters, aiding the enemy, or generally interfering with the war effort could be punished with up to a $10,000 fine and 20 years of imprisonment.
In 1918, Congress limited freedom of speech even further with the passage of the Sedition Act. The act made it unlawful to use “disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language” about the American form of government, the Constitution, or the military forces. The government employed the Sedition Act to prosecute socialists, political radicals, and pacifists. Eugene V. Debs, the leader of the Socialist Party in America, was imprisoned under the act. For his crime—giving a mildly antiwar speech to a convention of socialists in Canton, Ohio—he was sentenced to a 10-year term in a federal prison.
The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Sedition Act in the case of Schenck v. United States (1919). The Court ruled that there are times when the need for public order is so pressing that First Amendment protections of speech do not apply. The Debs case and others like it show that the war did lead the federal government to follow policies that raised important constitutional issues about the suppression of personal freedoms and individual rights.

Prejudice Against German Americans Sometimes, the war enthusiasm created by the CPI and other groups took an ugly turn. Some German Americans were treated harshly during the war. Largely because of CPI efforts, Americans regarded Germany’s kaiser as arrogant, its generals as ruthless, and its soldiers as spike-helmeted brutes. Germany was seen as the primary foe among the Central Powers. Popular movies, such as The Kaiser, the Beast of Berlin, as well as some CPI posters and speeches intensified this feeling by portraying Germany as a cruel enemy. Some Americans wrongly generalized that if Germany was cruel, then all German people were cruel.
As a result, Americans stopped teaching German in public schools and discontinued playing the music of Beethoven and Brahms. They renamed German measles “liberty measles,” cooked “liberty steaks” instead of hamburgers, and walked their “liberty pups” instead of dachshunds.
German Americans were pressured to prove their loyalty to America by condemning the German government, giving up speaking German and reading German-language newspapers, and participating enthusiastically in any patriotic drive. Occasionally, hatred of the German enemy boiled over into violence against German Americans. Some German Americans were harassed, others were beaten, and a few were killed for no other reason than they were born in Germany or spoke with a German accent.

The War Changes
American Society
The war was not only a turning point in the economic and political lives of Americans, but it also brought substantial social changes. New opportunities opened up for women, African Americans, and Mexican Americans. Some left their homes to seek new ones where they could take advantage of these opportunities.
Women Welcome New Opportunities Before the war, some American women campaigned for women’s suffrage. They won the vote in several western states and still hoped to gain the franchise nationally. Many feared that the war would draw attention away from their efforts. In fact, the war gave women new chances and won them more support for the right to vote.
As men entered the armed forces, many women moved into the workforce for the first time. Women

filled jobs that were vacated by men who had gone to fight.
They worked in munitions factories, on the railroads, as telegraph operators and trolley conductors, and in other jobs that were previously open only to men. Others labored on farms. Some joined the Red Cross or the American Women’s Hospital Service and went overseas. They worked as doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers, and clerks. Thousands enlisted when the Army Corps of Nurses was created in 1918. Women proved that they could succeed in any type of job, regardless of difficulty or risk.
By their efforts and sacrifices during the war, women convinced President Wilson to support their suffrage demands. He contended that granting the vote to women was “vital to winning the war.” If women could do the work of men, they certainly deserved the same voting privileges as men. Finally, in 1919, Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment giving the vote to women. The required two thirds of states ratified the amendment in the summer of 1920, a victory more than 70 years in the making.
African Americans and the Great Migration The
war similarly presented new opportunities to African Americans.
4.2 The Home Front During World War I
World War I and the 1920s
From the outset, most African American leaders supported the war. “If this is our country, then this is our war,” wrote African American leader W.E.B. Du Bois. He viewed the struggle as an excellent opportunity to show all Americans the loyalty and patriotism of African Americans. Thousands of them enlisted or were drafted into the army and sailed for the battlefields of France. On the battlefield, they fought in segregated units under the command of white officers. Altogether, 367,000 African Americans served in the military. Hundreds died for their country.
Meanwhile, a great movement of African Americans from the rural South to the industrial North was taking place. This movement to the “Land of Hope,” as many African Americans referred to the North at that time, is called the Great Migration. A migration is a movement of a group people to a new place. Migrations are often described as being caused by “push-pull” factors: people migrate because some factors “push” them away from where they have been living while other factors “pull” them toward their destination.
For African Americans during the Great Migration, factors that “pushed” them out of the South included Jim Crow segregation laws, lynching and other racial violence, and few economic opportunities other than as servants, sharecroppers, or tenant farmers. Many raised cotton, and the arrival in 1910 of an insect pest called the boll weevil ruined their crops, providing yet another push out of the South.
At the same time, the North “pulled” them with the chance of economic opportunities to be found in prosperous cities and wartime factories. As more African Americans moved North, they themselves became pull factors for family and friends back in the South. Newspapers in the North, such as the Chicago Defender, an African American newspaper that was widely read in the South, encouraged the migration:
I	beg you, my brother, to leave the benighted land. . . .Get out of the South. . . . Come north then, all you folks, both good and bad. . . .The Defender says come.
—Chu a; to Defended
African Americans moved to Chicago, as the Defenderencouraged, where they found work in meatpacking plants. They migrated to Detroit, where they obtained jobs in auto factories. They traveled to smaller industrial towns in the Midwest and to the giant cities of the Northeast. Between 1910 and 1930, more than 1.2 million African Americans moved to the North. Millions more eventually made the journey. Although they did not entirely escape discrimination in the North, many did find more opportunity. The Great Migration was one of the most dramatic demographic, or population, shifts in American history.

The effects of this change in demographic pattern are still with us today. For example, in 1910, about one percent of Detroit’s population was African American. In 2010, 83 percent of the residents were African American. Similarly, other large cities across the North—Chicago, Philadelphia, New York—have high concentrations of African Americans as a direct result of the Great Migration.
Mexicans Move North Some of the same factors that pushed African Americans out of the South and pulled them to the North caused Mexicans to cross the border into the United States. Because of the ongoing Mexican Revolution, many Mexicans faced violence and desperate poverty.They also wanted better economic opportunities. Most immigrated to the American West, where they sought work on large ranches and farms in Texas and along the Pacific Coast. Increased wartime demands for food and a decrease in American farmworkers (since many were serving in the army) created jobs that Mexican migrants filled.
Some of the Mexican migration was seasonal. Many workers crossed the border to harvest fruits or grains or to pick cotton while each crop was in season, then crossed back into Mexico. But others stayed and made the United States their home. Some Mexican workers migrated first to the Southwest and then to the northern states in search of factory jobs, but a large population stayed in California. They formed barn'os(BAHR ee ohz), or Hispanic neighborhoods, in Los Angeles and in smaller cities in California's Imperial Valley, a farming region just north of the Mexican border. California had always had a rich Hispanic heritage, but these new immigrants added an important economic dimension to that heritage.

When the United States entered World War I in the spring of 1917, the conflict had become a deadly, bloody stalemate. The war would be won or lost on the Western Front in France. Since 1914, both sides had tried desperately to break the stalemate there—and failed. The American entry into the war would play a key role in the Allied victory.

America Joins the Fighting
To European leaders, the United States was a great unknown. Ethnic divisions in the United States raised questions about how committed American troops would be in combat. Some doubted that the United States could raise, train, equip, and transport an army fast enough to influence the outcome of the war. Desperate German military leaders renewed unrestricted submarine warfare, hoping to end the conflict before the Americans could make a difference.
The Convoy System The Allies immediately felt the impact of the renewed unrestricted submarine warfare. German U-boats sank merchant ships in alarming numbers, faster than replacements could be built. As one merchant ship after another sank to the bottom of the sea, the Allies lost crucial supplies.
Together, the Allies addressed the problem of submarine warfare by adopting an old naval tactic: convoying. In a convoy, groups of merchant ships sailed together, protected by warships. The arrangement was designed to provide mutual safety at sea. Convoys made up of British and American ships proved to be an instant success.

Shipping losses from U-boat attacks fell as sharply as they had risen. Germany’s gamble had failed.
The War Ends on the Eastern Front Meanwhile, the situation on land began to swing in favor of the Central Powers. The Allies were exhausted by years of combat. Russia was torn by revolutions. In March 1917, a moderate, democratic revolution overthrew Czar Nicholas II but kept Russia in the war. In November 1917, radical communists led by Vladimir Lenin (lehn ihn) staged a revolution and gained control of Russia.
Russia stopped fighting in mid-December, and on March 3, 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk ended the war between Russia (soon to become the Soviet Union) and Germany. The end of the war on the Eastern Front allowed Germany to send more soldiers to the Western Front.
General John J. Pershing and the AEF In the spring of 1918, Germany launched an all-out offensive on the Western Front. A series of five offensives threatened to break through Allied defenses and open a path to Paris. The hard-pressed Allies organized a joint command under French General Ferdinand Foch (fawsh).
General John J. Pershing, the commander of U.S. forces in Europe, arrived in France with a small force in mid-1917. However, it was not until early 1918 that U.S. troops began arriving in larger numbers. The forces under Pershing’s command were called the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). By the end of the war, more than two million men would serve overseas in the AEF. Although the Allies wanted to use U.S. soldiers to replenish their armies, Pershing was adamant about keeping U.S. forces independent.
At about the time of Pershing’s arrival, the first German offensive began to stall. By the end of March 1918, Allied counterattacks and German exhaustion ended the first great German offensive. Germany had gained miles rather than yards of land but failed to end the war before American troops could arrive in force. Both sides lost hundreds of thousands of men, but the Allied forces were being bolstered by American troops.
More fighting followed, and with each passing week, American troops made more and more contributions on the battlefield, driven forward by Pershing's leadership. Germany launched several more offensives. Allied defenses buckled and stretched but did not break. Each failed offensive weakened Germany more and raised Allied hopes. A British volunteer nurse working near the front described the arrival of new American troops:

American Troops in Battle American troops, called "doughboys,” saw significant action in the late spring and summer of 1918. Americans fought on the defensive along with the French at the Second Battle of the Marne and on the offensive at the Battle of Cantigny (kahn tee nyee), where they dislodged a large German force from fortified positions. They battled valiantly at Chateau-Thierry (sha toh tir ee) and Belleau (beh loh) Wood, Meuse-Argonne (myooz ahr gahn) and Saint-Mihiel (mee yehl). Although it took some time, American troops learned quickly and fought bravely.
One of America’s greatest war heroes was Alvin York of Tennessee. On October 8, 1918, York was one of thousands of Americans fighting in the Meuse-Argonne region of northeastern France. Trapped behind enemy lines, York and 16 other Americans took cover from blistering machine-gun fire. As half of the
American force fell to German bullets, York took aim with his rifle and silenced a nearby German machine-gun nest. He then dodged a flurry of bullets to attack several other machine gunners and even charged one German position with only a pistol! When the firefight died down, York and the surviving Americans had taken the German position against amazing odds. York’s battlefield heroics earned him a Congressional Medal of Honor.
Alvin York was only one of thousands of heroes, many of whom died and most of whom were never recognized for their deeds. They followed orders, fought bravely, and made great sacrifices. Although African American soldiers often faced discrimination in the United States Army, they demonstrated their patriotism in dozens of engagements. For example, an entire African American unit, the 369th Infantry Regiment, received the Croix de Guerre, a French award for bravery, for its members’ actions in the Meuse-Argonne region.
The fighting in the Meuse-Argonne region is also called the Meuse-Argonne campaign. The campaign was a widespread attack along the Western Front launched in September of 1918. The AEF under General Pershing were tasked with advancing through the thick, tangled Argonne Forest. The dense trees and rocky ridges gave the advantage to the German defenses, but the Americans persisted. After weeks of heavy fighting, they had driven the Germans from

the forest. The American victory in the Battle of the Argonne Forest was a devastating defeat for Germany that hastened the end of the war.
Germany Surrenders The American troops, added to those of France, Britain, and Italy, gave the Allies a military advantage. By the fall of 1918, the German front was collapsing. Both the German and Austro-Hungarian armies had had enough. Some men deserted, others mutinied, and many refused to fight. Their leaders faced little choice but to surrender. On November 11, 1918, Germany surrendered to the Allies in a railway car in Compiegne (kohn pyehn), France.
The war was over.
Of the millions of soldiers who mobilized to fight, almost 5 million Allied and 8 million Central Power troops were dead. Nearly 6.5 million civilians were also dead, victims of the terrible conflict. Of the 2 million U.S. soldiers sent to Europe, about 1.4 million served on the front. More than 50,000 lost their lives, and about 230,000 were wounded. It was left to the peacemakers to determine whether the results would justify the costs.
B GENERATE EXPLANATIONS
What contributions did the U.S. military make to World War I?
Wilson Wants “Peace Without Victory”
Vladimir Lenin, leader of the communist revolution in Russia, maintained that the entire war was nothing more than an imperialistic land-grab. Once in power, he exposed secret treaties that Russia had made with the other Allies in which they agreed to divide among themselves the empires of their enemies. These revelations undercut the morality of the Allied cause in the war.
For President Woodrow Wilson, however, the war was not about acquisitions and imperialism—it was about peace and freedom. In January 1917, Wilson had introduced the idea of a “peace without victory” in an address to Congress:
Only a tranquil Europe can be a stable Europe. . , .[There] must be a peace without victory . . . .Victory would mean peace forced upon the loser, a victor’s terms imposed upon the vanquished. It would be accepted in humiliation....and would leave a

\	v,	>	U tip t b dtOl\ 'hi tag
The Fourteen Points In another address to Congress in January 1918, Wilson answered Lenin’s charges about the nature of the conflict by outlining America’s war aims in what became known as the Fourteen Points. At the heart of the Fourteen Points was his idea of “peace without victory.” Wilson proposed a peace inspired by noble ideals, not greed and vengeance.
The Fourteen Points raised some major issues. They sought to fundamentally change the world by promoting openness, encouraging independence, and supporting freedom. Critical of all secret treaties, Wilson called for open diplomacy. He insisted on freedom of the seas, free trade, a move toward ending colonialism, and a general reduction of armaments.
He also championed national self-determination, or the right of people to choose their own form of government. This would lead to the creation of several new, independent states but also raised many questions of which populations would achieve statehood and under what circumstances. Finally, he asked for a
League of Nations to secure “mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.”
Wilson Travels to Paris In early 1919, the victorious Allies held a peace conference in Versailles (ver si), a suburb of Paris, in the former palace of Louis XIV. President Wilson believed that the peace conference was too important to be left to career diplomats and lesser politicians, so he crossed the Atlantic Ocean himself to represent the United States at the conference, something no president had ever done.
Wilson did not invite any leading Republicans to join him in his peace delegation. Wilson’s decision angered Republicans,who had won control of Congress in the 1918 elections.
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, a leading Republican foreign policy expert, was especially angry. Wilson left Lodge behind because Wilson disliked him intensely, but the feeling was mutual. Lodge and Wilson had fundamentally different views about America’s place on the world stage. Lodge was suspicious of Wilson’s progressivism and idealism, which he viewed as dangerously naive. Whereas Wilson spoke of “peace without victory” and “mutual guarantees,” Lodge, keen to move the United States into the position of a world power, spoke unabashedly about putting American interests first:
Wilson's Fourteen Points, 1918
1.	Make no secret diplomatic agreements.
2.	Allow freedom of the seas in peace and war.
3.	Remove as many economic trade barriers as possible between countries.
4.	Reduce stockpiles of military armaments to lowest point needed for domestic safety.

The decision to leave Lodge behind would come back to haunt Wilson.
However, when the American president arrived in France, adoring crowds greeted him. “Never has a king, never has an emperor received such a welcome,” wrote one journalist.
H IDENTIFY CENTRAL IDEAS
What was the central idea behind Wilson’s “peace without victory” proposal?
The Paris Peace
Conference
Wilson’s idealism did not inspire the other Allied leaders at the peace conference. They blamed Germany for starting the war, reminded Wilson that they had suffered more in the war than the United States, and insisted that Germany make reparations, or payment for war damages. They wanted to weaken Germany so that it would never threaten Europe again.
Allied Leaders Reject Wilson’s Ideas British prime minister David Lloyd-George and French premier Georges Clemenceau (klay mahn soh) knew that the citizens of their countries expected both peace and victory. Lloyd-George insisted on protecting the existing colonial status quo and punishing Germany. Clemenceau wanted to make Germany pay dearly for what it had done to France. In addition to reparations, he demanded the return of Alsace-Lorraine and several key German colonies. Besides Britain and France, other Allies also had goals of their own and were skeptical of Wilson’s grand vision.
Once the Versailles conference began, Clemenceau, Lloyd-George, Italian Premier Vittorio Orlando, and other Allied leaders started to chip away at Wilson’s Fourteen Points. Onto the scrap heap of failed proposals they piled freedom of the seas, free trade, the liberation of colonial empires, a general disarmament, and several other ideas.

The League of Nations Wilson lost a number of battles but kept fighting to salvage a League of Nations, a world organization where countries could gather and peacefully resolve their quarrels. On this point, Wilson refused to compromise. The other delegates finally voted to make the League of Nations part of the treaty.
Problems With the Peace In the end, the various peace treaties created almost as many major issues as they solved. The changes in political boundaries that resulted from the international conflict were not always driven by self-determination or the best interests of the people living there. In the new map that emerged from the Paris Peace Conference, national self-determination was violated almost as often as it was confirmed. In Europe, several populations of Germans found themselves attached to non-German nations. The same was true of several Austrian populations.
Furthermore, in the Middle East, the breakup of the Ottoman Empire led to new political boundaries in which ethnic groups were clustered together randomly. To form Iraq, for example, the Versailles peacemakers threw together three provinces of the defeated Ottoman Empire—Basra, Baghdad, and Mosul. But Basra had natural links to the Persian Gulf and India, Baghdad to Persia, and Mosul to Turkey and Syria. The various regions had no sense of Iraqi nationalism. In addition, Iraq, like other holdings in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, was not allowed to practice self-determination. It was attached to Britain as a mandate, or territory overseen by another nation.

America Rejects the
Treaty of Versailles
When Wilson left Versailles to return to the United States, he knew the treaty was not perfect. But he believed that over time the League could correct its problems. He still thought that a lasting peace could emerge.
The Flu Pandemic The movement from war to peace would have been difficult even in the best of times. But the end of 1918 and 1919 were not the best of times. In September 1918, an unusually deadly form of the influenza, or flu, virus appeared. Research in recent years shows that the 1918 influenza virus was originally a bird flu that mutated to spread to humans. Many historians now believe that the virus originated

in the United States, then traveled around the world, thus becoming a pandemic.
As many as 50 million people died—among them, about 675,000 Americans. The Great Influenza pandemic, also called the Great Pandemic or the Flu Pandemic of 1918, coming on the heels of the Great War, gave a sense of doom and dread to people around the globe.
The pandemic may have even reached Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference. He fell seriously ill, and his temperature reached 103 degrees. Wilson’s physician diagnosed the president as suffering from the flu. Although there is some doubt that it was actually the flu, there is no doubt that Wilson’s sickness kept him from participating in many meetings. His illness may have been factor in Wilson not achieving all he had hoped to.
Wilson Faces Opposition at Home Much as Wilson faced opposition to his ideas at the Paris Peace Conference, he faced opposition in the United States to the Treaty of Versailles he had negotiated—but for different reasons. German Americans thought the treaty was too harsh toward Germany, especially the “war guilt clause” that suggested that Germany had caused the war. Irish Americans criticized the failure to create an independent Ireland.
Most important, however, the treaty would need to be submitted to the Republican-controlled Senate Foreign Relations Committee and then ratified, or approved, by the Republic-controlled Senate. In both
bodies, as well as in his own Democratic Party, Wilson faced stiff opposition.
A handful of senators believed that the United States should not get entangled in world politics or involved in world organizations at all. Known as “irreconcilables,” these isolationist senators opposed any treaty that had a League of Nations folded into it. They particularly disliked Article 10 of the League covenant. Article 10 called for mutual defense by the signers of the treaty, a pledge that each nation would “respect and preserve . . . the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all the Members of the League.”
A larger group of senators, led by Henry Cabot Lodge and known as “reservationists,” were opposed to the treaty as it was written. Some wanted only small changes, while others demanded larger ones.
For example, many felt Article 10 could lead the United States into a war without the consent of Congress, which was unconstitutional. Reservationists believed that the language of the article was too vague and demanded that it not contradict the power of Congress to declare war. But with some changes, the reservationists were prepared to vote for the Treaty of Versailles. They knew that polls indicated that the American people favored the League of Nations.
Wilson had compromised in Versailles, but he was not ready to compromise in Washington, D.C. When the Senate delayed its ratification vote, Wilson took his case directly to the people. The League of Nations had become his personal crusade, and convincing the

American people of its worth would test his leadership. The qualities of effective leadership, for a president of the United States, include the ability to appeal to a wide variety of people and persuade them that certain ideas are in the best interest of the country. Even though he was ill and weak, he set himself the grueling task of crossing the country and giving 32 addresses in 33 days. But his health failed on September 25,1919, in Pueblo, Colorado. He was rushed back to Washington, D.C., but suffered a debilitating stroke a few days later. As the Senate prepared to vote on the treaty, Wilson lay close to death, barely able to speak.
The United States Fails to Approve Treaty of Versailles In November 1919, one year after the war ended, a treaty revised to eliminate the complaints of the reservationists reached the Senate for a vote. Wilson would not compromise and told his Democratic supporters to vote with the irreconcilables against it. They did, and it was defeated. Next, the Senate voted on the treaty without any changes. The Democrats voted for it, but the combined strength of the irreconcilables and reservationists defeated it. Once more it was voted on, this time with only modest changes. Again, Wilson told his followers to vote against it. Although
some Democrats voted for it, the combination of Wilson Democrats and irreconcilables defeated the treaty.
The problem was not that most of the Senate was isolationist. Except for the irreconcilables, most senators wanted the United States to participate in world affairs. They differed slightly on what form that participation would take.
However, at a moment that demanded compromise, Wilson and his opponents refused to put aside personal and political differences for the good of the country. The tragedy of the failed votes was that without full American support, the League of Nations would prove unable to maintain peace among nations.
It was the League of Nations that U.S. opponents of the Treaty of Versailles most objected to. In evaluating the pros and cons of U.S. participation in the international organization and treaty, opponents judged that the cons outweighed the pros. They were especially concerned that the League would entangle the United States in conflicts that would not advance U.S. interests. Supporters, in contrast, thought the pros outweighed the cons. They thought the United States would benefit by being part of an international organization in which other countries could come to the aid of the United States. They also wanted the United States to have a voice in international politics—before a huge conflict broke out.

“Return to Normalcy,” meaning a return to normal life as it was in prewar times. Yet the election itself was not “normal.” For the first time, women voted in a presidential election. For the first time, election returns were reported by radio. A return to “normalcy” in a rapidly changing world would prove elusive.
Women and African Americans Confront New Realities Women and African Americans had made significant advances during the war. However, the end of the war also spelled the end of wartime economic opportunities for both groups. A postwar recession, or economic slowdown, created a competitive job market. By 1920, there were fewer women in the workforce than there had been in 1910.
In northern industrial cities, African American workers vied with returning soldiers for jobs and housing, causing tense race relations. During the hot summer of 1919, race riots erupted in cities throughout the country. The worst, in Chicago, was triggered by the drowning of a young African American man by whites, and went on for 13 days. In 1921, violence erupted in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when armed African American men—many of them returning veterans— tried to protect a young African American man from lynching. By the time the Tulsa race riots were over, at least 10 whites and 26 African Americans were dead.
» Rioters burned the homes of African Americans in Tulsa, Oklahoma, during race riots in 1921.
In one African American neighborhood, white rioters burned 35 city blocks to the ground.
Inflation and Labor Unrest During the war, inflation, or rising prices, had been held in check. After the conflict, Americans rushed to buy consumer goods rather than war bonds. The scarcity of these goods, coupled with widespread demand, caused inflation. On the other hand, during the war, the price of corn, wheat, cotton, cattle, and other agricultural goods had risen, with help from Hoover’s policies. After the war, prices fell sharply, making it difficult for farmers to pay their mortgages or buy what they needed for the next growing season. This began a long period of tough times for farmers.
Another economic effect of the postwar inflation was felt by industrial workers when their wages did not buy as much as they had during the war. In 1919, more than 4 million workers, or 20 percent of the workforce, went on strike at one time or another. Demanding rewards for their wartime patriotism, workers struck for higher wages and shorter workdays. In Boston, even the police force struck.
The workers won some of the strikes, but they lost far more. When some strikes turned violent, the promanagement press blamed the presence of radicals among the strike leaders.
The United States Grows as a World Power
Despite Harding’s election and some Americans’ desire to return to what life was like before the war, the United States did not plan to totally withdraw from world affairs. By 1920, even with postwar economic problems, the United States was an economic giant. It was the richest, most industrialized country in the world. Even before the war, America led all other nations in industrial output. The war was a turning point for the nation economically. Now, British and French demands for American goods created an immense trade imbalance. Europeans had to borrow money from American bankers and obtain lines of credit with American business firms to pay for the goods.
This situation fundamentally changed America’s economic standing in the world. The United States was now the largest creditor nation in the world, meaning that other countries owed the United States more money than the United States owed them. World War I shifted the economic center of the world from London to New York City. The United States embraced its new role as a quiet giant. A world without America playing

a major economic role had become simply impossible to conceive.

What was a significant cause of inflation after the war?
The Impact of Henry Ford and the Automobile
In the decade after World War I, the American economy experienced tremendous growth. Using revolutionary mass production techniques, American workers produced more goods in less time than ever before. The boom fundamentally changed the lives of millions of people and helped create the modern consumer economy.
The decade got off to a rocky start, however. There was a mild recession in 1918 to 1919 and a more serious one in 1920 to 1921. These were partly due to converting wartime production back to domestic production and the return of soldiers into the workforce. Once the economy did take off, the prosperity was not shared by everyone. Still, there is no doubt that the U.S. economy in the 1920s roared.
Rarely, if ever, has the nation enjoyed such an economic boom as it did during this decade. The recession that had followed World War I quickly ended. All signs pointed to economic growth. Stock prices rose rapidly. Factories produced more and more goods and, with wages on the rise, more and more people could afford to buy them.
Much of this explosive growth was sparked by a single business: the automobile industry. Carmaker Henry Ford introduced a series of technological and management innvoations to his fledgling automobile business. Ford’s methods and ideas revolutionized production, wages, working conditions, and daily life.
Ford, Mass Production, and the Model T Ford did not originate the idea of mass production, the rapid manufacture of large numbers of identical products. It had been used, for example, to make sewing machines and typewriters. But such products involved only hundreds of parts—not the thousands that go into the production of cars. Ford brought mass production to new heights.
Early in the century, only wealthy city dwellers could afford cars. The automobile was often seen as a symbol of the class divisions in the country. City drivers who ventured out onto country roads frightened horses and cows, coated crops with dust, and rutted dirt roads. "To the countryman,” said Woodrow Wilson in 1906, cars “are a picture of the arrogance of wealth.”
» Entrepreneurs like Henry Ford, pictured with his son Edsel, ushered in the age of the automobile and helped create an economic boom after the war.

Interactive Illustration
Ransom Olds had introduced a less expensive car, the Oldsmobile, in 1901. But it was Henry Ford who truly brought the automobile to the people. In 1908, he introduced the Model T, a reliable car the average American could afford. The first Model T sold for $850. Soon after, Ford opened a new plant on the Detroit River. The Detroit location gave Ford easy access to steel, glass, oil, and rubber manufactured in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.
Ford hired scientific management experts to improve his mass-production techniques. Scientific management was a relatively new method of improving efficiency, in which experts looked at every step of a manufacturing process to find ways to reduce time, effort, and expense. Studying a process to minimize the time it takes to do a task is called time-study analysis. Studying a process to minimize the motion it takes to do a task is called motion-study analysis. Together, they are often known as “time and motion study.” The idea was pioneered by Frederick Winslow Taylor in his book, The Principles of Scientific Management. Scientific management is sometimes called Taylorism.
Ford also studied the techniques of Chicago meatpacking houses, where beef carcasses were moved on chains past a series of meat cutters, each of whom cut off a specific part of the carcass. Ford reversed the process. He put his cars on moving
World War I and the 1920s	253	4.4 The Postwar Economy Booms
assembly lines. At each step, a worker added something to construct the automobile. In two years, the application of assembly line techniques showed huge productivity enhancements, reducing the time it took to manufacture a Model T from more than 12 hours to just 90 minutes.
The efficiency of the assembly line allowed Ford to keep dropping the sale price. The cost of a Model T fell to $350 by 1916 and to $290 by 1927. It was slow, dull, and available only in black. But the Model T was the first car that ordinary people could afford. In 1919, only 10 percent of American families owned an automobile. By 1927, 56 percent did.
When it came to managing the men who made up his labor force, Ford also proved that he was not afraid of innovation. In 1914, he more than doubled the wages of a large number of his workers, from $2.35 to $5 a day. He also reduced their workday from 9 hours to 8 hours. In 1926, he became the first major industrialist to give his workers Saturday and Sunday off. Before Ford, the idea of a "weekend” hardly existed. Ford shrewdly realized that if workers made more money and had more leisure time, they would become potential customers for his automobiles. The combination of the Model T and the “five-dollar day, forty-hour week” made Ford not only a very rich man but also one of the shapers of the modern world.
The Automobile Changes America The boom in the automotive industry, caused in part by Ford’s production efficiencies, caused economic growth in other industries related to car manufacture or use. The steel, glass, rubber, asphalt, wood, petroleum, insurance, and road-construction industries all benefited. For example, one seventh of all steel output was used to make automobiles. The need for gasoline prompted a nationwide search for petroleum deposits. Oil discoveries in California, Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma brought vast numbers workers and money to the Southwest. Petroleum-based industries boomed, increasing employment and tax revenues. Thus, energy in the form of gasoline had a major impact on the American way of life.
Road construction also boomed, especially when the federal government introduced the system of numbered highways in 1926. The millions of cars on American roads led to the rapid appearance of thousands of service stations, diners, and motor hotels (a term later shortened to motels). The growth in all these industries created new and often better-paying jobs, spurring national prosperity.
The automobile caused additional economic effects. Other forms of ground transportation, such as railroads and trolleys, suffered a decline in use. With cars, people could go where they wanted, when they wanted. They did not have to travel along set tracks on set schedules.
» Analyze Maps How did the creation of an affordable car affect the development of roads in the United States?
World War I and the 1920s ; 254	4.4 The Postwar Economy Booms
The automobile prompted a new sense of freedom and prosperity. Never had Americans been so mobile. Entire families crowded into their cars for cross-country vacations or Sunday drives to the country. Ownership of an automobile came to symbolize participation in the American dream of success and high standard of living.
Finally automobiles altered residential patterns. The ability to drive to work permitted people to live farther from their places of employment. This led to the development of suburban communities linked to cities by arteries of highways and roads. Los Angeles, one of the first cities whose growth was influenced by the automobile, developed in a sprawling, haphazard fashion. It became, according to one observer, “a series of suburbs in search of a city.”
H IDENTIFY SUPPORTING DETAILS
What effect did increased automobile production have on other industries?
Economic Growth in the 1920s
The 1920s saw what has been called a consumer revolution, in which a flood of new, affordable goods became available to the public. The widespread availability of electrical power supported the consumer revolution. Electric washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and irons made housekeeping easier and less time-consuming. Accessible electricity also contributed to radio and refrigerator sales.
Advertising and Installment Buying The growing advertising industry also played its part. Using new “scientific” techniques and psychological research, advertisers were able to sell more products to more Americans than ever before. Magazine and newspaper ads often focused on the desires and fears of Americans more than on what people really needed.
Advertisers celebrated consumption as an end in itself, convincing people that they could be the person they wanted to be just by buying the right products. From Kleenex to Listerine, Americans bought products that years earlier they could never have imagined they needed.
Finally, new ways of buying fueled the consumer revolution. People who did not have enough ready cash could buy what they wanted on credit. Installment buying, in which a consumer would make a small down payment and then pay off the rest of the debt in regular monthly payments, allowed Americans to own

The Bull Market Consumers were not the only Americans buying and selling in a big way. During the 1920s, the stock market enjoyed a dizzying bull market, a period of rising stock prices. More and more Americans put their money into stocks in an effort to get rich quick. By 1929, around 4 million Americans owned stocks.
The desire to strike it rich often led investors to ignore financial risks. As the market soared, people began buying on margin—another form of buying on credit. By purchasing stock on margin, a buyer paid as little as 10 percent of the stock price upfront to a broker. The buyer then paid the broker for the rest of the stock over a period of months. The stock served as collateral, or security, for the broker’s loan. As long as the price of the stock rose, the buyer had no trouble paying off the loan and making a profit. But if the price fell, the buyer still had to pay off the loan. Buyers gambled that they would be able to sell the stock at a profit long before the loan came due. Buying stocks on the hope that their price will rise is called stock market speculation.
In truth, this big bull market stood on very shaky ground. But most people ignored the dangers. By the

Science, Technology, and the Free Enterprise System Science, technology, and the free enterprise system combined to boost the economic development of the United States in the 1920s. The science was not just in scientific management, but in the growing knowledge of many aspects of the world. Scientists conducted research on everything from rubber plants to electronics. This scientific knowledge enabled engineers to create the technologies—automobiles, for example, or radios—that were useful to people.
These new technologies would not have been widespread without the free enterprise system. The profit motive gave business owners a reason to turn technology into products to sell. Competitive markets encouraged innovation. The free enterprise system also created the jobs that provided workers with the money to purchase the many new products that came to market. Thus, the prosperity of the 1920s was boosted by a mix scientific advances, inventive technologies, and the free enterprise system.

People Migrate to Cities In the 1920s, the movement of people was toward cities. Immigrants settled in cities. Farmers left their fields for cities. The direction of the African American Great Migration was toward northern cities. Many Mexicans crossing the border relocated to southwestern cities.
As in the late nineteenth century, cities grew and changed shape. In addition, the adoption of skyscraper technology caused cities to stretch skyward. Steelframed skyscrapers with light coverings of masonry and glass began to dominate the skylines of the nation’s cities. New York’s Empire State Building, finished in 1931, symbolized the power and majesty of the United States.

expand outward. More urban workers moved to the suburbs. Western and southern cities, developed after the automobile revolution, encompassed suburban areas as well as inner cities. Suburbs mushroomed, growing much faster than inner cities.
Slowly at first, but more rapidly as the century progressed, suburbs drained people and resources from the cities, causing the demographic patterns of both types of places to change. Catering to middle-and upper-class residents, suburbs tended to be more conservative and Republican. Meanwhile, one effect of this migration was that the inner cities at the heart of older urban areas began a slow but steady decline.
Many Americans Face Challenges In the cities and suburbs, Americans enjoyed prosperity and the fruits of growth. They participated in the consumer economy and in the joys of automobile ownership. The wealthiest urban residents—owners and managers of businesses—reaped fabulous rewards, which they often pumped back into the bull market. But there were problems looming ahead. America’s wealth was poorly distributed. Industrial wages rose at a much slower rate than corporate salaries.
Even worse, farm incomes declined during the decade. Many people living in the country did not participate in the consumer benefits and economic gains of the decade. They formed part of another America—poorer and outside the economic boom. In particular, farmers suffered from growing debt and falling farm prices. A protest song of 1928 expressed their frustration:

Woodrow Wilson hoped that the presidential election of 1920 would prove that Americans supported both the League of Nations and his vision of the role the United States should play in the world. He suggested that electing Democratic presidential candidate James M. Cox of Ohio would show support for the League. However, the election of Republican candidate Warren G. Harding of Ohio would serve as a final rejection of U.S. support for the League.

The Harding Administration
Harding had a different view of the presidential race. He knew that national elections seldom turned on a single issue. Harding campaigned for a rejection of Wilsonian idealism. He was tired of Progressive reforms and foreign crusades, and he was betting the American public was, too. Harding won in a landslide, and Republicans won control of Congress, as well. Americans had decisively rejected Wilson’s ideas.
What exactly did Harding’s election signal? Some interpret it as Americans’ desire to retreat from involvement in world affairs, others as a rejection of Progressive reform efforts or a swing back to laissez-faire economics. No matter how it was interpreted, however, it was clear that Harding and his successor, Calvin Coolidge, favored conservative policies that aided the growth of business rather than pursuing reform as the Progressives had done. This pattern—a period of activism followed by a more laissez-faire approach—would repeat itself in the 1950s and 1980s.

believed that prudent economic policy meant supporting legislation that advanced business interests. He disliked the relatively new income tax, favoring instead low taxes on individuals and corporations. Mellon also cut the fat from the budget. By 1925, Congress had reduced spending from a wartime high of $18 billion to $3 billion. Instead of sinking deeper into debt, the Treasury actually showed a surplus.
Harding signed a bill raising protective tariff rates by about 25 percent. The tax on imports made it easier for American producers to sell goods at home. However, in retaliation, European nations also hiked tariffs, making American goods harder to sell overseas. This tariff war weakened the world economy and would have ramifications in the 1930s.
Under the Progressive leadership of Roosevelt and Wilson, the federal government had passed laws to break up monopolies, protect workers, and restrict the absolute freedom of business leaders. By contrast, Harding favored a return to a more traditional laissez-faire approach. He and Mellon worked to reduce government regulation of business. Harding’s Return to Normalcy, including reducing taxes and reducing government regulation, helped to cause the economic growth and prosperity of the 1920s.
Still, the Harding administration did not abandon social goals. Harding’s thoughtful and energetic Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover worked with business and labor leaders to achieve voluntary advancements.
What the Progressives hoped to achieve through legislation, Hoover attempted to attain with the
cooperation of interest groups. He enjoyed great successes at getting people to work together instead of battling one another.
Some Officials Betray the Public Trust Harding was a kind, likable man, but he was not especially intelligent. Perhaps no President was friendlier, and few had less sense of what was expected of a President. Faced with a tax issue, Harding lamented, “I listen to one side and they seem right ... I talk to the other side, and they seem just as right, and here I am where I started. . . . What a job!”
Rather than struggle to master the complexities of the job, Harding trusted others to make decisions. Many were his close friends, men he enjoyed relaxing and gambling with at late-night poker games. Known as the Ohio Gang, they were not honest public servants like Mellon and Hoover. They were mostly greedy, small-minded men who saw government service as a chance to get rich at the expense of the very citizens they were supposed to serve.
Charles Forbes, head of the Veterans’ Bureau, practiced graft on an immense scale and wasted hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars. For example, his department bought $70,000 worth of floor cleaner— enough to last 100 years—at more than 24 times the fair price. Another Harding pal, Attorney General Harry Daugherty, used his position to accept money from criminals.

Fall. In 1921, Fall arranged to transfer oil reserves in Elk Hills, California, and Teapot Dome, Wyoming, from the Navy Department to the Interior Department. The oil reserves were intended for the navy’s use in times of emergency. Harding signed the transfer.
Once Fall had control of the oil, he forgot about the needs of the navy He leased the properties to private oilmen in return for “loans”—which were actually bribes. Rumors of the deal led to a Senate investigation, and, by 1924, the entire sordid affair was revealed to the public. Later, the oil reserves were returned to the government. Fall was sentenced to a year in prison, but those accused of bribing him were acquitted.
Harding himself never saw the full extent of the Teapot Dome scandal. In fact, he only had a growing suspicion that his friends were up to no good. But that was enough, as he said, to keep him “walking the floor nights.” In July 1923, he visited Alaska during a speaking tour. On his return voyage, he suffered a heart attack and died on August 2. Americans mourned Harding as they had mourned no other President since Lincoln. When the full extent of the scandals emerged, however, the public formed a different opinion of him. The Teapot Dome scandal hurt U.S. citizens’ trust in the federal government and its leaders, especially the Executive Branch. But the calm and assured manner in

H RECALL
What policies did Andrew Mellon pursue when he became Secretary of the Treasury?
Economic Prosperity Under Coolidge
News of Harding’s death reached Vice President Calvin Coolidge during a visit to his father’s Vermont farm. Almost immediately, the elder Coolidge, a justice of the peace, used the family Bible to swear in his son as President.
In personality, Coolidge was far different from the outgoing, back-slapping Harding. Known as Silent Cal, he was quiet, honest, and frugal—a man who measured his words carefully. He placed his trust in business and put his administration in the hands of men who held to the simple virtues of an older America. Political sharpies out to make a quick buck had no place in the Coolidge administration. Neither did Progressives who believed in an activist government bent on sweeping reforms.
Business Leaders Have the Support of the White House Coolidge admired productive business leaders. “The man who builds a factory,” Coolidge once said, “builds a temple.” He believed that the creation of wealth benefited the nation as a whole. In 1925, he expressed this view in his best-known speech:
The chief business of the American people is business. They are profoundly concerned with producing, buying, selling, investing, and prospering in the world. . . .We make no concealment of the fact that we want wealth, but there are many other things that we want very much more. We want peace and honor, and that charity which is so strong an element of all civilization. The chief ideal of the American people is idealism.

Coolidge’s statement of values and principles has often been oversimplified as “the business of America is business.” However, in his approach to the economy, Coolidge continued to follow the goals of Secretary of the Treasury Mellon by reducing the national debt, trimming the federal budget, and lowering taxes to give incentives for businesses. Collectively referred to as the “Mellon Income Tax Cuts,” the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926 successively lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and corporations. Although tax rates on high-income earners were significantly reduced, the total amount paid by those earners increased as incomes rose. In response to the Revenue Acts as well as other factors, the unemployment rate fell from over 6 percent to approximately 3 percent between 1922 and 1929, benefiting workers in all income brackets.
Coolidge thus oversaw increasing tax revenues and a spectacular boom in the national economy. For almost six years, the economy soared, generating industrial profits, spectacular growth in the stock market, and general prosperity, especially for urban Americans.
Some Problems Remain Yet, there were grave problems breeding in the nation. Farmers struggled to keep their land as the prices of their goods fell.
Labor unions demanded higher wages and better working conditions. African Americans faced severe discrimination, especially in the South, where Jim Crow laws made enforced segregation a way of life. African
American leaders urged Congress to pass an antilynching law. In the Southwest, Mexican Americans confronted shamefully low wages and efforts to force them to return to Mexico.
To all of these concerns, Silent Cal remained silent. Like Harding, he mistrusted the use of legislation to achieve social change. Unlike Progressive Presidents, he believed that it was beyond the federal government’s role to help create an ideal nation.

Changed World
World War I had caused sweeping changes around the globe. An old order five hundred years in the making had collapsed in just a few years. It was as if the world’s compass was out of whack and no one knew where to turn for directions. German and Russian monarchies toppled, and new forms of government were created. The Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires ceased to exist. Britain and France emerged from the war victorious but economically and politically weakened. In contrast, the victorious United States came out of the war strong, confident, and prosperous.
World War I and the 1920s
261	4.5 Government in the 1920s
Seeking Stability After World War I While World War I was a turning point for the United States in the realm of foreign affairs, the nation was still unsure of the requirements of its new status. Could America retreat from the political affairs of other countries yet continue to expand its economic reach across the globe? Under both Harding and Coolidge, America continued to play an increasingly important role in world business and trade. Beyond economic interests, U.S. foreign policy was largely shaped by reaction to World War I. No previous war had been as deadly. Citizens of all nations agreed: It must never happen again. But how could this goal be achieved?
One solution was to avoid another arms race, such as the naval rivalry between Germany and Britain that had contributed to the outbreak of the war. In 1921 and 1922, diplomats gathered in Washington, D.C., to halt another naval arms race before it got out of control. World leaders agreed to limit construction of large warships and hammered out a settlement on several problems between Japan and the West. This Washington Naval Disarmament Conference did not end the world’s naval problems, but it raised hopes that nations could solve disagreements without resorting to war.
A later attempt to prevent war was the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand (bree ahn) drew up a treaty to "outlaw” war "as an instrument of national policy.” Eventually, 62 nations ratified the pact. But, in reality, the pact was unenforceable. Kellogg knew it, Briand knew it, and so did the rest of the diplomats. No sooner was the ink dry than everyone involved forgot about it.
Although Congress applauded the useless Kellogg-Briand Pact, it refused to join the World Court, an international body which at least promised to help mediate international disputes. As much as possible, most American leaders in the 1920s hoped to avoid another war by keeping the rest of the world at arm’s length.
Collecting Reparations After the War Money issues were another matter. The United States insisted that Britain and France repay their huge war debts to the United States. For this to happen, though, Germany had to make the reparation payments to Britain and France imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. The complex financial issue threatened to undermine the international economy. Some statesmen suggested reducing or even canceling both war debts and reparations. But the frugal Coolidge insisted that a debt was a debt and had to be paid.
In 1924, an agreement known as the Dawes Plan arranged U.S. loans to Germany. By enabling Germany to make reparation payments to Britain and France, the Dawes Plan helped Britain and France to repay their debts to the United States. Of course, the entire scheme was financed by U.S. money.
After the stock market crash of 1929, however, the well of U.S. money went dry. Germany stopped reparation payments, and Britain and France ended war-debt payments to the United States.
In the end, the war-debt situation damaged America’s reputation in the eyes of the world. People from Britain and France thought that it was heartless for American bankers and politicians to insist on repayment of debts and not to take into account the

Americans Debate New Ideas and Values
The 1920 census reported that, for the first time in American history, more people lived in urban areas than in rural regions. This simple fact had profound consequences. The nation had been divided before, but usually along north-south or east-west lines. In the 1920s, however, the split was between urban America and rural America. On virtually every important social and cultural issue, the two groups differed.
Urban Americans enjoyed new consumer products and a wide array of leisure activities. They generally showed an openness toward social change and the new discoveries of science. The growing trend to emphasize science and secular values over traditional religious beliefs became known as modernism.
By contrast, rural Americans did not participate fully in the consumer bonanzas, and they missed out on many of the new forms of leisure. People in the country generally embraced a more traditional view of religion, science, and culture.
An Evolving Job Market Emphasizes Education Rural and urban Americans differed in their attitudes toward formal education. In rural America, prolonged formal education had not seemed vital. Farmers expected their children to master the “Three R’s”—reading, writing,

and arithmetic. But beyond that, having a formal education was not vital to the many farm tasks that needed to be done. Muscle, endurance, and knowledge of crops and animals seemed more important to farmers than abstract knowledge learned from books.
Formal education took on more importance in urban America. Mental ability, not muscular fitness, was seen as the essential ingredient for success. Mastery of mathematics and language could spell the difference between a low-paying, unskilled job and a higherpaying position as an office worker. By 1930, more American teens were graduating from high school, and more Americans than ever before went to college.
Some Embrace Religious Fundamentalism In
the 1920s, many devout Americans believed that Christianity was under siege throughout the world. They pointed to Soviet communist attacks on the Orthodox Church in Russia and to the Mexican revolutionary assaults on the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico.
At home, a growing number of Christians were upset by what they saw as secular trends in religion and culture. They reaffirmed their belief in the fundamental, or basic, truths of their religion. This approach, often called fundamentalism emphasized Protestant teachings and the belief that every word in the Christian Bible was literal truth. Fundamentalists believed that the answer to every important moral and scientific question could be found in the Bible. Their ideas took root all over the country but were especially strong in rural America.
Bryan and Darrow Clash Over Evolution
Fundamentalism and modernism clashed head-on in the Scopes Trial of 1925. At issue was the theory of evolution, developed by English scientist Charles Darwin. Darwin believed that complex forms of life, such as human beings, had developed gradually from simpler forms of life. According to fundamentalists, this theory clashed with the description of creation in their Bible.
In 1925, Tennessee passed a law making it illegal to teach Darwin’s theory in the state’s public schools. The American Civil Liberties Union convinced John Scopes, a high school biology teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, to challenge the law. When Scopes taught evolution in his classroom, he was promptly arrested.
The Scopes Trial drew nationwide attention. Journalists flocked to Dayton to cover the emotionally charged event, which many dubbed the “Monkey Trial” because of the mistaken belief that Darwin claimed that human beings descended from monkeys.
» The rise of modernism, with its emphasis on urbanism, intellectualism, and individualism, threatened traditionalists who believed America’s social foundations were deteriorating.
» Clarence Darrow (left) and William Jennings Bryan have a conversation during the Scopes Trial.
World War I and the 1920s	265	4.6 An Unsettled Society
Clarence Darrow, the most celebrated defense attorney in America, traveled from his home in Chicago to defend Scopes. Darrow was well-known for defending labor union leaders like Eugene V. Debs and William Haywood, in addition to other famous cases. A talented speaker, he did not always win his cases, but he often revealed key issues to the public during the well-publicized trials. Three-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, a long-time defender of rural values, served as an expert for the prosecution. Bryan, considered one of the greatest orators of his day, was charged with defending what many fundamentalists thought of as the literal truth of divine creation found in their Bible.
Both men had a significant impact on the trial by drawing national attention to it. The highlight of the trial came when Darrow called Bryan to the stand as an expert on the Bible. Bryan affirmed that the Bible stated the literal truth. He testified that he believed that God created Adam and Eve and that Joshua made the sun stand still. Darrow tried to use science to cast doubt on such beliefs, but Bryan firmly stated, "I accept the Bible absolutely.”
Scopes was found guilty of breaking the law—a fact that was never in question—and fined $100. The public, however, was paying closer attention to a more essential issue. The trial was a public confrontation between fundamentalism and modernity, between a literal and a liberal interpretation of scripture. While the Scopes Trial showcased a major cultural and religious division, it did not heal the conflict or answer its central questions. When the trial was over, each side
still believed in the truth of its position. The conflict over evolution continues today.
H rfcall How does modernism contrast with more traditional ideas about religion?
The Red Scare
As Americans continued to grapple with the ideas of modernity, the emergence of the Soviet Union as a communist nation challenged other essential U.S ideals. In contrast to capitalism and the free enterprise systems, which emphasized the right to own private property, communist ideology called for public ownership of property and an international workers’ revolution as a prelude to the death of capitalism. To this end, Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin encouraged and supported revolutions outside of his country. In Central and Eastern Europe, a series of communist revolts did break out, making it seem like the worldwide revolution was starting.
Fear of a Potential Revolution This revolutionary activity abroad, coupled with labor strikes across the United States following the end of World War I, caused the first American Red Scare, a wave of widespread fear of suspected communists and radicals thought to be plotting revolution within the United States. Real revolutionary activity inside America gave substance to the scare. Authorities discovered bombs mailed to important industrialists and government officials, including Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. Suspected anarchists, members of a radical political movement, exploded bombs in cities across America,

including one that killed about 40 people on Wall Street in 1920.
As the leading law-enforcement official, Palmer mounted a broad offensive against radicals in the United States in 1919 and 1920. In a series of raids in early 1920, known as the Palmer Raids, police arrested thousands of people, some who were radicals and some who were simply immigrants from southern or Eastern Europe. Most were never charged or tried for a crime. The government then deported hundreds of radicals or suspected radicals.
To many, these actions seemed to have the effect of attacking the liberties that Americans held most dear. A group of people in New York City formed the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in 1920 to protect these liberties. The ACLU tried to do this by becoming involved in important court cases. To this end, the ACLU became involved in one of America’s most controversial court cases: the trial of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti.
A
Questionable Conviction Nicola Sacco (sah koh) and Bartolomeo Vanzetti(van zeht ee) were Italian immigrants and known anarchists. They were charged with shooting and killing two men during a holdup at a shoe factory in a town near Boston. Eyewitnesses of the event said the robbers “looked Italian.” Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested and charged with the crime. Even though the ACLU provided defense counsel, the two men were found guilty in a swift and decisive trial, despite the fact that there was little hard evidence against them. Some prominent legal scholars, intellectuals, and liberal politicians charged that the convictions were based more on Sacco and Vanzetti’s ethnicity and political beliefs than on the facts of the crime. Nevertheless, on August 23, 1927, the two men were put to death in the electric chair. At its worst, hysteria accompanied by violence characterized the Red Scare. Mobs attacked suspected radicals, abused immigrants, and committed crimes in the name of justice. By the summer of 1920, the height of the Red Scare had ended. Americans saw that democracy and capitalism were more powerful in the United States than Lenin’s call for worldwide revolution. But, as shown by the Sacco and Vanzetti trial, the effects of the great fear would linger throughout the 1920s in negative feelings towards immigrants, labor unions, and, to some extent, the reforms pushed by Progressives before World War I.

Immigration in the 1920s
As the trial of Italian immigrants Sacco and Vanzetti came to a close, another social issue involved the ongoing boom in immigration continued. As in the past, nativists, or those who preferred native-born Americans to immigrants, argued that the new arrivals took jobs away from native-born workers and threatened American religious, political, and cultural traditions.
Eugenics and Social Darwinism Influence the Perception of Immigrants Although nativist politicians had been able to restrict immigration from China in 1882, they had failed to push through laws to restrict immigration from southern and eastern Europe. On the eve of U.S. entry into World War I, however, Congress did pass a law requiring immigrants to take a literacy test.
Immigrants who could not read or write their own language were prohibited from entering the United States. President Wilson vetoed the law, but Congress overrode Wilson’s veto. Immigration dropped during

the war, worsening labor shortage problems during the war.
During the postwar Red Scare, fear that communists and socialists from eastern Europe were traveling to the United States with their revolutionary doctrines caused the debate to heat up once again. On one side were nativists who disagreed with traditional immigration policy. On the other side were many Americans who viewed the immigration experience as part of what made an American an American. Nearly all Americans who could trace their ancestry back far enough discovered foreign origins.
Nativists were concerned that immigrants would diminish America’s political and economic power. They believed that many immigrants had undesirable physical and social traits and would therefore be unproductive members of society.
These views were partly based on eugenics, the since-discredited idea that intelligence and other favorable social traits were inheritable characteristics passed on by one’s parents and more frequently found in some races than others. Eugenics was related to Social Darwinism, the idea that life was a competition in which only the fittest survive. The rise of both Social Darwinism and eugenics was caused in part by Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection. Both were also motivated by ethnic or racial prejudice to some degree. Those who believed in both theories wanted the United States to be that fittest nation that survived, and to ensure that it was, sought to exclude those they thought of as weaker and undesirable.
Many nativists who believed in eugenics thought the human race could be improved by controlling which people had children. Therefore, they thought it best to restrict immigration to those whom they deemed to have desirable traits that would in turn be passed on to future generations of Americans.
Congressional Legislation Restricts Immigration
In addition to eugenics and Social Darwinism, other events such as World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the Red Scare strengthened the nativist position and affected congressional legislation. Two subsequent laws— the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the National Origins Act of 1924— established a quota system to govern immigration from specific countries.
The National Origins Act set up a simple formula: The number of immigrants of a given nationality each year could not exceed 2 percent of the number of people of that nationality living in the United States in 1890. The year 1890 was chosen because it was before the great wave of immigration from southern and eastern Europe. For example, the act permitted about 65,721 immigrants from England and Northern Ireland to

come to America every year, but it allowed only about 5,802 immigrants from Italy. The act also continued to exclude most Asian immigrants. The effect of eugenics, Social Darwinism, and nativist sentiment in general was that America closed its "golden door” to many of the people trying to enter.
More Mexicans Arrive for Economic Opportunity
The quota system did not apply to Mexico, which was still reeling from the 1910 revolution. Settling in sparsely populated regions of the Southwest, Mexican immigrants made significant contributions to local economies. Many found work harvesting crops in California and Texas. A smaller number sought jobs in the factories and farms of the North or Midwest.
Many Mexican immigrants faced discrimination and hostility in their new homes. They often competed with native-born Americans for jobs and were frequently subjected to brutality and violence.

Origins Act?
The Ku Klux Kian in the Early 1900s
Immigration restriction was an attempt to turn back the clock to what many saw as a simpler, better time. Many lashed out against symbols of change. Some even turned to organizations that supported doctrines of hate and employed violence and terror to achieve their ends.
The Kian Reorganizes In 1915, on Stone Mountain in Georgia, a revived Ku Klux Kian was formally organized. The original Kian had been formed in the South during Reconstruction largely to terrorize African Americans who sought to vote. Although the new Kian continued to promote hatred of African Americans, it was also aimed at the new America taking shape in the cities. It targeted Jews, Catholics, and immigrants. In the wake of postwar labor unrest, the Kian opposed labor unions—especially because many union members were immigrants or political radicals. The Kian also claimed to stand against lawbreaking and immorality.
At its height, the Kian’s “Invisible Empire” had perhaps 4 to 5 million members. Most were in the South, but there were also branches in the Midwest, Northeast, and West—in both rural areas and in small industrial cities. One center of Kian strength was Indiana, where Kian leader David Stephenson ruled
World War I and the 1920s	269 t 4.6 An Unsettled Society
with an iron fist and controlled numerous politicians. There were special women’s branches of the Kian as well. However, some male Kian leaders were strongly opposed to women taking an active role in politics.
Kian members boycotted businesses owned by anyone who was Jewish, Catholic, or African American. The Kian terrorized citizens in the night, often by burning crosses outside their homes. Klansmen usually wore masks to conceal their identities, met to wave flags and preach hate, and followed leaders with such titles as Grand Dragon and Imperial Wizard. But behind the Kian’s confident facade were Americans fearful of change.
Many Americans Oppose the Kian’s Values
Organizations such as the NAACP and the Jewish Anti-Defamation League, battled against the Kian and its values. The NAACP continued its anti-lynching crusade, supporting legislation in 1922 that passed in the House of Representatives but not in the Senate. The Anti-Defamation League worked to reduce anti-Semitic slurs in newspapers and break down barriers in higher education and the job market. Individuals also embraced the idea of racial, ethnic, religious, and cultural diversity. For them, the notion of the “melting pot” was as old as America itself, and they drew strength from American traditions and saw hope in the American future. Journalist William Allen White noted:
» A group photo of the twentieth annual session of the NAACP in Cleveland, Ohio in 1929.
To make a case against a birthplace, a religion, or a race is wickedly un-American and cowardly. The whole trouble with the Ku Klux Kian is that it is based upon such deep foolishness that it is bound to be a menace to good government in any community.
—William Allen White, letter to the editor of the New
York YVorlck 1921
The Kian itself became thoroughly corrupt.
Its leaders bribed politicians, stole from its members’
dues, and lied to its members. Stephenson ended up going to prison for assault and second-degree murder. By the late 1920s, the Kian stood exposed. Although the organization never disappeared, it became less significant.

What actions did Kian members take to accomplish their goals?
Prohibition Divides
Americans
Another divisive issue was Prohibition, the banning of alcohol use. Since the early 1800s, temperance reformers had crusaded against alcohol. Temperance was a cause held dear by many Progressives. By 1917, some 75 percent of Americans lived in “dry” counties that had banned liquor. World War I increased support for temperance. It seemed unpatriotic to use corn, wheat, and barley to make alcohol when soldiers overseas needed bread.
The Eighteenth Amendment Bans Alcohol In 1919, the states ratified the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. It forbade the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcohol anywhere in the United States. The amendment had been passed largely on the strength of rural votes. Many Progressives felt that its passage was one of the greatest impacts of the whole Progressive reform movement. Congress then passed the Volstead Act, a law that officially enforced the amendment.
Advocates of Prohibition, known as “drys," called it a “noble experiment.” They argued that the impact of Prohibition would be improved individuals, strengthened families, and better societies. In fact, drinking—as well as alcoholism and liver disease caused by drinking—did decline during the first years of Prohibition but soon rose again to near pre-Prohibition levels.

Opponents of Prohibition, dubbed “wets,” countered that the ban on alcohol did not stop people from drinking. Instead, they argued, Prohibition’s impact was to help create an atmosphere of hypocrisy and increased organized crime.
Many Americans Ignore the Volstead Act As the
wets noted, the Volstead Act did not stop Americans from drinking, but it did prevent them from purchasing drinks legally. The gap between the law and individual desires was filled by a large illegal network. People made alcohol in homemade stills or smuggled it in from other countries.
Bootleggers sold illegal alcohol to consumers. In cities, secret drinking establishments, known as speakeasies, attracted eager customers.
Government agents worked tirelessly to stop the flow of illegal liquor. However, they were short-handed, and the demand for alcohol was too great. There were millions of dollars to be made by both organized and unorganized criminals. Particularly in cities, policemen and politicians tended to look the other way when liquor was involved. They rationalized their actions by saying that if people wanted to drink, they would drink.
A1
Capone, a Chicago gang leader, was the most famous criminal of the Prohibition era. He defended his illegal actions: I make my money from supplying a public demand. If I break the law, my customers, who number hundreds of the best people in Chicago, are as guilty as I am. The only difference between us is that I sell and they buy. Everybody calls me a racketeer. I call myself a businessman.
—A1 Capone, quoted in Era of Excess (Sinclair)
The problem was that under the guise of providing a glass of beer or scotch, organized crime spread into other areas of society. Capone’s other “businesses” included prostitution, drugs, robbery, and murder. Thus, one effect of Prohibition was to contribute to the growth of organized crime in America.
The Constitution Is Amended Again By the mid-1920s, most city politicians clamored for the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment. But to many rural Americans, liquor and crime were tied to other divisive cultural issues of the day. Thus, like immigration and evolution, the debate over Prohibition became part of a battle over the future of America.
In the culturally divided 1920s, Americans could not reach a satisfactory settlement on the issue. However, illegal economies that thrived on the production
I

and distribution of alcohol continued to thrive and legal enforcement of Prohibition was oftentimes lax. As popular dissatisfaction with the Eighteenth Amendment grew, Congress finally repealed Prohibition with the passage of the Twenty-First Amendment in 1933. It was ratified by the states later that same year.

The Roaring
Twenties
Popular American Culture in the 1920s
The 1920s was in many respects the first decade of our modern era. Even as cultural issues divided Americans from different regions or economic levels, technology was beginning to break down other barriers. Nowhere is this more evident than in the leisure interests of the American people.
Americans Enjoy More Leisure Time The growth of cities changed leisure patterns. On farms, people worked from dawn to dusk, with little time to spare. In the evenings, a farm family might play games, read, or sing together around the piano. Occasionally, they joined other farm families and townsfolk for picnics or a game of baseball. They did not have the time or the money for more extensive leisure pursuits.
City life was different. The average workweek in all industries fell from 70 hours in 1850 to 55 in 1910 to 45 by 1930. The workweek itself also changed from seven days a week to six and at last to five. At the same time, salaries and wages were on the rise.

Innovation in the Motion Picture Industry
With more free time and disposable income, urban and suburban Americans looked to new sources of entertainment. Motion pictures helped supply that demand.
The technology to make motion pictures had been around for a generation, but the movie industry rose to new heights in the 1920s. A handful of huge studios in Hollywood, California, established monopolies that controlled the production, distribution, and exhibition of movies. During the 1920s, from 60 to 100 million Americans went to the movies each week. Ornate movie palaces or small local theaters became America’s cultural classrooms.
For most of the decade, the studios made silent pictures. They were an ideal entertainment at a time when millions of immigrants spoke little English. Motion pictures transcended languages and even literacy, treating universal themes in familiar ways that allowed any viewer to follow the stories. Motion pictures became America’s democratic art. Unlike theatrical productions or classical concerts, movies were available to anyone with a few cents to spare. In addition, the fact that movies were silent made it easier for them to cut across geographical boundaries. Hollywood’s biggest movies and stars became nearly as popular in far corners of the globe as they were at home. By 1926, Hollywood movies accounted for a majority of the British and French film markets. Film was one of
the first mediums to diffuse popular American culture to the rest of the world.
Many stars of the silent era portrayed ordinary folks, and films often portrayed the social issues and characteristics of the time in which they were made. Comedian Charlie Chaplin, the most popular silent film star, played the Little Tramp in many films. In The Immigrant, Chaplin played a penniless immigrant on a voyage across the Atlantic to the United States. Although the film belonged to the genre of comedy, it depicted some of the challenges and uncertainties that many immigrants of the time faced as they made their own way to America’s shores. Chaplin’s character was equal parts hobo, dreamer, and poet but an eternal optimist in his ability to charm his audience and continually reinvent himself. Other stars played more romantic types. Adorable Mary Pickford was known as “America’s Sweetheart” for her girlish roles in light romances. Douglas Fairbanks played handsome, athletic adventurers. In the western genre, William S. Hart was a steely-eyed cowboy who came into town to restore law and order.
In 1927, film history changed, suddenly and forever, with the release of The Jazz Singer, the first movie with sound synchronized to the action. Audiences were amazed when A1 Jolson said—not pantomimed—“You ain’t heard nothin’ yet” and then launched into a song. Silent pictures quickly faded out, replaced by “talkies.” But whether silent or with sound, movies spoke directly

to the desires, needs, fears, and fantasies of millions of people in the United States and around the world.
The Radio Impacts American Society Like the movies, the phonograph and the radio also became powerful instruments of mass popular culture. Each was the result of both technological advances and business enterprise. Millions of radios and phonographs (as well as phonograph records) were marketed in the 1920s. On a deeper level, the phonograph and radio helped produce a standardized culture. Americans in the East and West and North and South listened to the same songs, learned the same dances, and shared the same popular culture as they never had before.
The radio, or wireless, was developed in the 1890s by Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi. Before the 1920s, the radio was an innovation used by a small group of military technicians, telephone operators, and amateur “wireless” operators. Then, in 1920, an executive of the Westinghouse company started radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was an immediate success. Within three years, there were almost 600 licensed stations broadcasting to more than 600,000 radio sets. Americans listened to music, educational lectures and religious sermons, and news and weather reports. They also heard commercials for a wide variety of consumer products.
Radios brought distant events into millions of homes in a way unmatched by newspapers or magazines. In 1927, much of America listened to a championship boxing match between Gene Tunney and Jack Dempsey. That night, theaters and movie houses played to empty seats as Americans huddled next to their sets. Even the men on death row at Sing Sing prison listened to the broadcast. Before the 1920s, such coverage of an event had been impossible. Although radio programs and music occasionally broadcast racial or cultural stereotypes as well, such as the radio show Amos 'n Andy in the 1920s, the radio allowed Americans to keep up with current events around the country as they occurred.
Americans Share Music With the Phonograph
The phonograph allowed people to listen to the same music they heard on the radio, but whenever they wanted. Early phonographs employed difficult-to-use wax cylinders and suffered from poor sound quality. In the 1920s, grooved disc recordings and superior sound reproduction improved the sound of the earlier machines, and production of phonographs rose to approximately five million in 1929. There was also a corresponding rise in record sales. The first country-western album to sell over one million copies was produced in 1924.

As the popularity of country-western music rose, one positive impact was that the uniquely American symbol of the cowboy and life on the the western frontier was mythologized throughout the country. A negative impact was that stereotypes of westerners and country-dwellers sometimes also spread. Recordings helped bring country and western music from the South and West to the North and East, while pop tunes from New York City’s Tin Pan Alley traveled in the other direction, creating national markets for different genres of music. As they listened to the same songs, Americans also learned the same fashionable dances, from the fox trot to the Charleston.

American Role Models
Hollywood’s chief rivals for the creation of heroes were the nation’s baseball parks, football fields, and boxing rings. Before the 1920s, there were relatively few nationally famous athletes, such as boxer John L. Sullivan and all-around athlete Jim Thorpe. Most sports stars were local heroes. This changed by the 1920s, often called the Golden Age of Sports.
» With the help of increased newspaper readership and radio coverage, sports figures like Babe Ruth became national heroes and symbols of American culture.
Media Coverage Creates Sports Heroes Thanks to increased newspaper readership and the rise of radio coverage, every major sport boasted nationally famous performers. Perhaps the leading sports hero was baseball home-run king Babe Ruth. Others included Red Grange in football, Jack Dempsey in boxing, Bobby Jones in golf, and Bill Tilden in tennis. Women athletes, too, contributed to the hero culture, from tennis player Helen Wills to Gertrude Ederle, the first woman to swim the English Channel.
Why did athletes reach such heights of popularity? Part of the answer is that the Golden Age of Sports was also the Golden Age of the Sportswriter. Such journalists as Damon Runyon and Grantland Rice captured the excitement of sports events in their colorful prose. Turning the finest athletes into seemingly immortal gods, the sportswriters nicknamed Babe Ruth the Sultan of Swat and dubbed Notre Dame's football backfield the Four Horsemen.
The other part of the answer is that the decade needed heroes. World War I had shattered many Americans’ faith in progress, making the world seem cheap and flawed. Athletic heroes reassured Americans that people were capable of great feats and lofty dreams. If in our heroes we see our idealized selves, the sports heroes of the 1920s gave Americans a sense of hope.
A
Transatlantic Flight Even the biggest sports stars could not match the adoration given to aviators. In the 1920s, the airline industry was in its infancy. Flying aces had played a role in World War I, and a few small domestic airlines carried mail and passengers. But airplanes were still a novel sight to most Americans. The pilot became a new breed of hero, a romantic daredevil who risked death with every flight. As aviation technology improved by leaps and bounds in the early twentieth century, many dreamed of flying across the Atlantic Ocean. These dreams were made possible by innovators such as Glenn Curtiss, who designed an aircraft engine capable of just such a flight. As flight crews were successfully flying longer distances across the Atlantic, daring aviators wondered if they could accomplish the same feat alone.
Then aviator Charles Lindbergh attempted the long journey alone. In May 1927, he took off from Long Island, New York, in his tiny single-engine plane, the Spirit of St. Louis, and headed east— to Paris, France. Other pilots had flown across the Atlantic Ocean before, but Lindbergh was the first to do it solo and non-stop. The flight took more than 33 hours, and the lone pilot had to stay awake the entire time. He also recalled, "In the daytime I knew where I was going, but
World War I and the 1920s
276	47 The Roaring Twenties
in the evening and at night it was largely a matter of guesswork.”
When Lindbergh landed in Paris, he became an instant media celebrity, dubbed Lucky Lindy and the Lone Eagle. The radio reported on his landing, and movie newsreels showed his triumphant return home. The modest young man from the Midwest made an impact as the greatest hero of his time.

The Role of Women
Changes
In a 1931 book, Only Yesterday, journalist Frederick Lewis Allen attempted to make sense of the fads, heroes, and problems of the 1920s. Featured prominently was the New Woman. During the decade, many women challenged political, economic, social, and educational boundaries to prove that their role was as vital outside the home as inside it. Women’s roles began to change in many ways, caused by the overall changes that society was undergoing, as well as the passage of the Nineteeth Amendment in 1920. The effect of these changes was that women made more and more contributions to shape American culture.
Flappers Push Back Against Expectations During the Victorian Age of the late 1800s and early 1900s, middle-class women had been expected to center their lives on the home and family. The New Woman of the 1920s, noted Allen, was more liberated. She wore dresses with shorter hemlines, put on more makeup, danced to the latest crazes, and generally assumed that she had the same political and social rights as any man.
Popular magazines, sociological studies, novels, and movies all echoed Allen’s observations. The rejection of Victorian morality seemed so total and the New Woman so novel that the change amounted to a “revolution in manners and morals.” The symbol of all these changes was the flapper, a young woman with short skirts and rouged cheeks who had her hair cropped close in a style known as a bob.
There was only a germ of truth in the various observations. The Victorian code of separate spheres for men and women was disappearing but not as rapidly or as completely as Allen indicated. The flapper was undoubtedly more publicized than imitated. Still, the image of the flapper underscores an important aspect of the decade. Not all women aspired to be flappers, but many wanted more control over their lives and got it.
» The individualism and modernism of the early 1920s prompted many women to see themselves as equals to men, deserving the same political and social rights.
Women’s Political Rights The great fight for suffrage had been won with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. Soon women looked for a way to use their political rights to make an impact. But what was the next step? Some groups, such as the National American Woman Suffrage Association, called on women to work in reform movements, run for office, or fight for laws to protect women and children in the workplace. Some women had success in public life. In 1925, Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming and Miriam Ferguson of Texas became the first women to take office as elected state governors.
The National Women’s Party took a more militant position, demanding complete economic, social, and political equality with men. Their primary goal was the passage of an Equal Rights Amendment. Many women, though, believed that a new constitutional amendment was premature. They set more achievable goals and made significant strides in employment. The efforts of these political organizations and women elected to public office redefined the role of women in American culture and opened doors through which others would walk in the decades to come. Although most working women continued to toil in domestic service and manufacturing, others moved into clerical, sales, and management positions. Women also won
World War I and the 1920s	277	4.7 The Roaring Twenties
jobs in journalism, aviation, banking, and the legal and medical professions.
Life at Home Changes Perhaps the most widespread revolution taking place in women’s lives was a quiet one. During the decade, women tended to live longer, marry later, and have fewer children, freeing their time to pursue other interests. Some entered the workforce, others devoted more time to charitable work, and still others joined clubs that discussed books and ideas. All these pursuits enlarged the intellectual world of women.
The consumer economy of the 1920s benefited women. Electric vacuum cleaners and irons took some of the labor and drudgery out of household chores. Of course, not all women shared in the blessings of technology. Many homes in rural America had no access to electricity. For women in these regions, household labor continued to involve intense, even painful, work. They drew and carried water from wells, heated irons on stoves, and washed clothes by hand. Here again, the split between urban and rural Americans was distinct.

Social Issues Are Reflected in Art and Literature
No area of American life, however, reflected the impact of World War I more than literature and the arts. The war altered the way writers and artists viewed the world, changed the way they approached their craft, and inspired them to experiment with new forms and fresh ideas.
Postwar Uncertainty During the Victorian era, most poets and novelists had expressed a belief in progress, placing boundless faith in human potential. But World War I called the notion of progress into question.
How could a society ruled by the idea of progress embark on a war that killed millions of people, destroyed monuments of civilization, and left survivors hungry, homeless, and hopeless? This was not an action of a rational people, a new generation of writers argued, but the irrational exploits of civilization without a sense of direction.
This pessimistic, skeptical worldview sparked an artistic movement known as modernism. Modernism in both art and literature to some extent also reflected some of the issues and characteristics of American society in the 1920s, from the renewed interest in new technology to the uncertainty of many in a rapidly changing world.
The theories of Jewish-Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud(siHG muhnd froid) also contributed to literary and artistic modernism. Freud argued that much of human behavior is driven not by rational thought but by unconscious desires. To live in society, people learn to suppress these desires. But the tension between outward behavior and the subconscious, said Freud, could lead to mental and even physical illness. Freud’s theories led writers and artists to explore the subconscious mind.
Modern Art Moves in New Directions Modernism clashed head-on with traditionalism most dramatically in the field of modern art. Since the late 1800s, European painters had led the way in seeking a fresh visual idiom, or language. They moved away from representational paintings that simply reproduced real life and experimented with more abstract styles.
Most Americans got their first real glimpse of the new European approach at a major art show at New York's 69th Infantry Regimental Armory in 1913. Traditionalists were outraged by the Armory Show, and Theodore Roosevelt said that most of it represented the “lunatic fringe” of the art world. But many American painters and sculptors were inspired by the bold new styles. They began their own search for artistic

honesty in abstract patterns. In the 1920s, paintings by Edward Hopper, Man Ray, Joseph Stella, and Georgia O’Keeffe demonstrated the richness and varied styles of American artists. At the same time, the works of artists such as Archibald Motley and William H. Johnson portrayed African American perspectives on modern life.
Postwar American Literature Flowers American writers of the 1920s are often referred to as the “Lost Generation” because they no longer had faith in the cultural guideposts of the Victorian era. But many were inspired by their “lost” condition to search for new truths and fresh ways of expressing those truths. Never in American history had one decade seen the emergence of so many great literary talents. A list of writers who rose to distinction in the 1920s includes F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Edith Wharton, Sinclair Lewis, William Faulkner, Gertrude Stein, Eugene O’Neill, and T. S. Eliot. Each of these writers remains today on any list of distinguished American authors.
Novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald explored the reality of the American dream of wealth, success, and emotional fulfillment. In This Side of Paradise, he wrote that his generation had “grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, and all faiths in man shaken.” In The Great Gatsby(1925), his most accomplished work, Fitzgerald showed the American dream ending in nightmare.
In the novel, through hard work and careful planning, James Gatz re-creates himself as Jay Gatsby, a successful tycoon. Gatsby fills his home with wild parties, dancing, bootleg liquor, and endless activity:
In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another. By seven o’clock the orchestra had arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones. . . .People were not invited—-they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door.
-—F, Scott Fitzgerald.	Op, , ’ r'-'h
» American writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda, visited the French Riviera often in the 1920s. In many ways, their turbulent life together mirrored Fitzgerald’s stories of striving and tragedy.
But in the end, Gatsby is destroyed by the very things he hoped to achieve. His lofty dreams end in a violent, meaningless death.
Fitzgerald’s fellow novelist and good friend Ernest Hemingway explored similar themes but in a new idiom. Hemingway felt betrayed, not only by the American dream, but also by literary language itself. In A Fareweil to Arms, his 1929 novel about World War I, Hemingway’s narrator says:
1 was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice.
. . .1 had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. .
. .Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of

In his short stories and novels, Hemingway worked to develop a writing style that reflected his insights. He wrote in unadorned sentences, stripped of vague adjectives and adverbs. He created a style that was as concrete and as powerful as a rifle shot.
Influenced by Freud, other writers explored the subconscious mind. Playwright Eugene O’Neill experimented with techniques that put the subconscious right on stage. In The Emperor Jones, the title character gets lost in a jungle and is attacked by imaginary beings called Little Formless Fears. In Strange Interlude, characters turn away from their conversations with other people on stage and speak their thoughts directly to the audience.
Certainly, many poets and novelists of the decade were disillusioned. Like Hemingway and Fitzgerald, they wrestled with the meaning of the war and life itself. But in the end, their efforts resulted in the creation of literary masterpieces, not worthless products of aimless despair.

V
As a result of World War I and the Great Migration, millions of African Americans relocated from the rural South to the urban North. This mass migration continued through the 1920s and contributed to a flowering of music and literature. Jazz and the Harlem Renaissance made a lasting impact, not only on African Americans but on the culture all Americans share.
The Harlem
Renaissance
Support for Black Nationalism in Urban Areas
Like the immigrants who traveled from Europe and Asia, African Americans who left the South dreamed of a better future. They had heard stories of economic opportunity, social advancement, and greater political rights. The South, they reasoned, was a dead end. Locked into low-paying rural jobs, barred from decent schools, faced with the reality of Jim Crow oppression and the threat of lynching, they pointed their compasses north.
Migration Creates Opportunities and Challenges Most African American migrants to the north probably found a better life. Wages in a Detroit auto plant or a Pittsburgh steel mill were far better than what a sharecropper earned in the South. In such cities as New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland, African Americans had a growing political voice. In those towns, there also existed black middle and upper classes. African American ministers, physicians, lawyers, teachers, and journalists practiced their professions and served as role models to the younger generation.

» Marcus Garvey, an African American nationalist, promoted the idea that African Americans should separate themselves from whites and support their own communities.
» The African American population of Harlem, New York continued to grow after World War I and in the 1920s.
But in coming North, African Americans had certainly not escaped racism and oppression. On average, they were forced to live in the worst housing and labor in the lowest paying jobs. In addition, as the race riots of the summer of 1919 demonstrated, violence was a threat to African Americans north as well as south of the Mason-Dixon line. After World War I, African Americans increased their demand for a real solution to the country’s racial problems.
New York City’s Harlem became the focal point for the aspirations of hundreds of thousands of African Americans. Some 200,000 blacks settled in Harlem. Migrants from the South mixed with recently arrived immigrants from Caribbean islands, such as Jamaica. This dynamic blend of different cultures and traditions bred new ideas.
The Impact of Marcus Garvey The most prominent new African American leader to emerge in the 1920s was Marcus Garvey. Born in Jamaica, Garvey traveled widely before immigrating to Harlem in 1916. From his travels, Garvey drew one important conclusion: Blacks were exploited everywhere. To combat the problem, he promoted the idea of universal black nationalism and organized a “Back to Africa” movement. Unlike Booker T. Washington or W.E.B. Du Bois, Garvey did not call for blacks and whites to work together to improve America. Instead, Garvey advocated the separation of the races.
Garvey’s message found willing converts in American cities. By the mid-1920s, his Universal Negro Improvement Association boasted almost 2.5 million members and sympathizers. His advocacy of black pride and black support of black-run businesses won considerable support.
Garvey’s movement fell apart in the second half of the decade. The federal government sent him to prison for mail fraud and then deported him to Jamaica. Without his powerful leadership, the Universal Negro Improvement Association lost its focus and appeal.
Although Garvey’s movement died, his ideas did not fade. The nationalist and separatist aspects of the Nation of Islam and the Black Power movement in the 1960s borrowed from Garvey’s ideas. So, too, did later appeals to black pride, self-reliance, and cultural ties to Africa. Harlem’s major newspaper, the Amsterdam News, later wrote, “In a world where black is despised, he taught [African Americans] to admire and praise black things and black people.”

The Evolution of Jazz
» Analyze Charts How is the development of jazz related to modern musical genres such as hip-hop and rap?
The Jazz Age
It was F. Scott Fitzgerald who called the 1920s the “Jazz Age.” However, it was African Americans who contributed the jazz. A truly indigenous American musical form, jazz is a musical form based on improvisation. Jazz musicians creatively recombine different forms of music, including African American blues and ragtime, and European-based popular music. Jazz music was fast, free, loud, rebellious, and fun, so in many ways, it reflected the characteristics and issues of the 1920s.
A
Unique Musical Style Jazz emerged in the South and Midwest, particularly New Orleans, where different cultures and traditions came together and influenced each other. Early jazz artists won fame playing in Storyville, a section of New Orleans known for its night life. From the South, it spread north with the Great Migration of African Americans. Trumpet player Louis Armstrong became the unofficial ambassador of jazz. After playing with King Oliver’s band in New Orleans and Chicago and with Fletcher Henderson’s orchestra in New York, Armstrong began to organize his own groups. His ability to play the trumpet and his subtle sense of improvisation made him a legend and influenced the development of jazz. After Armstrong, all jazz bands featured soloists.
Many also began to feature vocal soloists, such as Bessie Smith, the “Empress of the Blues.”
Jazz Wins Worldwide Popularity Jazz was more than a musical style. It was also a symbol of the Roaring Twenties.
It was part of the Prohibition era, played in speakeasies and nightspots in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and Los Angeles. It was the sound of the Cotton Club, one of Harlem’s most famous attractions, where African Americans played African American music to all-white audiences. Phonograph records and radio spread the influence of jazz across the country and beyond. By the end of the decade, the popularity of jazz had spread to Europe as well.
But jazz was still more. It was a demonstration of the depth and richness of African American culture. Many musicians, such as Armstrong, introduced rhythms and themes with clear African roots into their music to better convey the African American cultural experience. Gerald Early, a modern scholar of English and African American studies, predicted that, in the future, America will be best remembered for three great contributions—the Constitution, baseball, and jazz. All three enriched lives, opened windows to new possibilities, and lifted the human spirit. Jazz announced that the United States was a land of shared cultures and traditions, a place where people came

together and created something greater than their parts.
The jazz movement was then a reflection of an evolving African American identity born of shared historical experience, including the contemporary experiences of the Great Migration and continuing troubled race relations.
Jazz quickly bridged the races. Trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke (Bi der behk) became the first white musician to contribute to the styles and popularity of jazz. Jazz sounds influenced such white songwriters and composers as Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, and George Gershwin, whose jazz-inspired orchestral work Rhapsody in Blue premiered in 1924. The title of a song by African American bandleader Duke Ellington best captures how jazz changed popular music: “It Don’t Mean a Thing If It Ain’t Got That Swing.”
B IDENTIFY SUPPORTING DETAILS
What effect did the Great Migration have on the popularity of jazz?

» African American music legends, including Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway, played regularly at Harlem’s many nightclubs.
The Harlem Renaissance
Jazz and blues were expressions of the African American experience. The pain of the African American experience can be heard in the blues, and the joy of that experience in the soaring notes of jazz. The range of such African American musicians as Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway speaks to the varieties of African American life. But in the 1920s, there were other expressions of African American culture. Novelists, poets, and artists celebrated their culture and explored questions of race in America. This flowering of African American culture became known as the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance helped give a new vocabulary and dynamic to race relations in the United States.
Cultural Movements in Literature and Art In the
1920s, the term the “New Negro” entered the American vocabulary. It suggested a radical break with the past. No longer would African Americans silently endure the old ways of exploitation and discrimination. The new mood was most vividly expressed in Harlem, which attracted African American artists and writers from all over the country and beyond. In their work, these artists and writers explored the pains and joys of being black in America, leaving a legacy that spoke to all Americans of all times.
Artists such as Aaron Douglas created paintings with stylized art that reflected African Americans’ racial pride and collective historical experience, while other artists such as Jacob Lawrence and Archibald J.

4.8 The Harlem Renaissance

Motley, Jr., expressed similar sentiment in their colorful paintings of urban life.
Many writers communicated the same themes. Jean Toomer's Cane (1923) set the literary tone for the Harlem Renaissance. A collection of short stories, poems, and sketches, Cane presented African American life and folk culture in all its richness. It was not a blueprint for where African Americans needed to move politically in the future, but a plea to remember and preserve the past.
Soon, other African American writers joined Toomer at the forefront of the Harlem Renaissance. Jamaican immigrant Claude McKay was the most militant of these writers. In his novels and poems, McKay showed ordinary African Americans struggling for dignity and advancement in the face of discrimination and economic hardships. A poem that McKay wrote after Chicago was stricken by violent race riots captured his sense of anger and militancy:
If we must die—let it not be like hogs,
hunted and penned in an inglorious spot.
While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,
Making their mock at our accursed lot.
What though before us lies the open grave?
Like men we will face the murderous, cowardly pack,
Pressed to the wall, dying but fighting back!
—Claude McKay, "If We Must Die”
McKay represented the political and ideological left wing of the Harlem Renaissance. More in the center was Langston Hughes, probably the most powerful African American literary voice of his time. For Hughes, the force of the movement was not politics but a celebration of African American culture and life. In more than 50 works of fiction, poetry, journalism, and criticism, he captured the remarkable diversity of

» Zora Neale Hurston’s works voiced many women’s desire, both African American and white, for greater independence, and it explored the rich cultural heritage of African Americans.
everyday African American life. In the last line of his autobiography The Big Sea, Hughes wrote, “Literature is a big sea full of many fish. I let down my nets and pulled. I’m still pulling.”
Another powerful voice was Zora Neale Hurston. Hurston traveled the rural back roads of her native Florida, collecting folk tales in books such as Mules and Men. But Hurston also looked to the future. Her 1937 novel Their Eyes Were Watching Godexpressed the new longing for independence felt by many women, black and white.
The Lasting Impact of the Harlem Renaissance
The Harlem Renaissance gave a voice to African American culture, just as jazz and blues gave it a tune. It altered the way many white Americans viewed African American culture, and even the way African Americans viewed themselves. James Weldon Johnson, poet and secretary of the NAACP, noted:
A great deal has been accomplished in this decade of ‘renaissance’. . .
.Today, one may see undesirable stories, but one may also read stories
about Negro singers, Negro actors,
Negro authors, Negro poets. The connotations of the very word Negro have changed. A generation ago many Negroes were half or wholly ashamed of the term.
Today, they have every reason to be proud of it.
—James Weldon Johnson, article in Harpersmagazine, 1928
The movement was not, however, without its critics. Some, for example, dismissed the quality of literature produced during the period. Others, such as Langston Hughes, expressed a degree of disillusionment with the movement’s inability to improve the political status and economic opportunities of African Americans throughout the country. However, the artistic forms and cultural debates associated with the Harlem Renaissance continue even today.
Although the Harlem Renaissance came to a close as the nation fell into economic difficulty in the late 1920s, the sense of group identity and African American solidarity that it created would become part of the bedrock on which the later civil rights movement would be constructed.

Depression
Hidden Economic Problems in the Roaring Twenties
At first, some Americans saw this contraction as a regular contraction of the nation’s business cycle, which explains the periodic growth and contraction of the economy. It most certainly was not regular. Production, employment, and income will normally expand, contract, and expand again over time in a cyclical way. However, a number of factors combined in the 1920s to turn the normal, cyclical expansions and contractions of the nation’s economy into an economic collapse in the 1930s. Millions of Americans suffered hardships and despair as a result.
For most of the 1920s, however, Republican leaders exuded confidence about both their party and their country. The Roaring Twenties had been a Republican decade. In 1920, Americans sent Warren G. Harding to the White House, and four years after that, they sent Calvin Coolidge. Neither election had been close.
Once in office, both Presidents watched the country grow increasingly prosperous. As the decade passed, consumption went up, the gross national product went up, and the stock market went up.

No matter what index an economist chose to consult, the conclusion was always the same: Times were good in America and they were getting better. Republicans took credit for the bullish economy, and most Americans heartily agreed.
Hoover Sweeps to Victory When the Republicans met at their 1928 nominating convention, they chose Herbert Hoover—an accomplished public servant— to run for the White House. Born in Iowa, Hoover was orphaned as a child. But he overcame this personal tragedy and eventually graduated from Stanford University with a degree in geology. He became a mining engineer and worked all over the world. By 1914, after amassing a vast fortune, he retired from engineering and devoted himself to public service.
Herbert Hoover came to the attention of Americans during World War I, first as the brilliant coordinator of the Belgium relief program and then as head of the Food Administration. During the Harding and Coolidge administrations, Hoover served as Secretary of Commerce. His philosophy was simple but effective.
He stressed the importance of competition, but he also believed in voluntary cooperation between labor and management. American greatness showed itself, Hoover maintained, when owners, workers, and government officials converged on common goals.
With a solid record of accomplishments behind him and seemingly endless prosperity in front of him, Hoover was a formidable presidential candidate in 1928. While his campaign ads noted how Republicans had “put the proverbial ‘chicken in every pot,”' Hoover spoke glowingly of ending poverty in America:
By adherence to the principles of decentralized self-government, ordered liberty, equal opportunity, and freedom, to the individual, our American experiment in human welfare has yielded a degree of well-being unparalleled in all the world. It has come nearer to the abolition of poverty, to the abolition of fear of want, than humanity has ever reached before.
—Herbert Hoover, campaign speech, 1928
Hoover’s contest with Democratic nominee Alfred E. Smith of New York was, in the end, no contest at all. Americans voted overwhelmingly for Hoover, prosperity, and the continuation of Republican government. When the new President took office in March 1929, America was awash in a sea of confidence. Few imagined that

an economic disaster lay just seven months in the future.
But even as Hoover delivered his victory speeches, economic troubles were beginning to worry some Americans. The prosperity of the 1920s was not as deep or as sturdy as Hoover claimed. Throughout the U.S. economy, there were troubling signs.
Farmers Face Challenges After World War I
American farmers faced difficult times during the 1920s. Farmers made up one fourth of the American workforce during the decade.
To meet the unprecedented crop demands created by World War I, they had increased harvest yields and bought more land to put under the plow. They also bought costly tractors and other mechanized farm equipment to help them meet demand. Farmers amassed huge debts doing this, and the additional mortgage payments followed them into the 1920s.
After the war, the demand for American crops fell sharply. Despite this drop, postwar production remained high because of increasingly mechanized farm equipment and more intensive farming methods. Farms were getting bigger and yielding bumper crops at harvest. However, farmers were failing to sell off their huge crop surpluses and to pay the debts they owed banks and other institutions.
The result was a rural depression that affected millions of Americans. Hard-pressed to pay their debts, forced to sell their goods in a glutted and competitive world market, and confronted by several natural disasters, farmers did not share in the boom times of the 1920s. They did not have the cash to buy the new consumer goods produced by American industries.
They lived largely on credit from month to month, often teetering on the brink of financial ruin. Any downward slide in the economy was likely to hit America’s struggling farmers first and hardest.
A
Significant Gap Between the Rich and the Poor Unlike farmers, industrial workers participated in the great national success story. During the 1920s, their wages rose steadily, as did their disposable income. Many purchased Model T Fords along with a variety of other consumer products. Though they were certainly not wealthy, industrial laborers were in a better financial position than their fathers had been a generation before. But the problem was that while wages rose gradually worker productivity increased astronomically. Between 1923 and 1929, output per person-hour jumped 32 percent, but workers’ wages inched up only 8 percent. During that same period, corporate profits from worker output skyrocketed 65 percent. All these figures

5.1 Causes of the Depression
Income Distribution, 1929
» Analyze Graphs Based on the information in the pie chart, what share of total income earned in 1929 did the top 5 percent of income earners account for?
pointed to the fact that during the 1920s, the rich became much, much richer, while industrial workers simply became less poor.
In few periods of the country's history have so small a number of rich Americans dominated such a large percentage of the country's total wealth. In 1929, for example, the wealthiest 1 percent of the population earned about the same amount of money as the bottom 42 percent.
Uneven Distribution of Wealth Creates Problems
This uneven distribution of the nation’s wealth created economic problems. More than 60 percent of all American families had yearly incomes of less than $2,000 per year. In contrast, 24,000 of the country’s wealthiest families enjoyed annual incomes of more than $100,000, which was 50 times more than what most families were earning. But these wealthy families did not eat 50 times more food than lower-income families. The wealthiest households did not purchase 50 times more automobiles or radios or ovens. The rich undoubtedly spent a lot on consumer products. The problem was that the wealthiest few could not buy enough to keep the economy booming.
A healthy economy needs more people to buy more products, which in turn creates even more wealth. In this way, a healthy economy avoids underconsumption that can limit economic growth. The uneven distribution of wealth in the 1920s pointed to an uncertain future for the American economy.
From the overproduction of the struggling farmer to the underconsumption of the lower-income industrial worker, deep-seated problems created economic instability. Too many Americans did not have enough money to buy what they needed or wanted.
Americans Rely on Credit For a time, the expansion of credit partially hid this problem. Americans bought automobiles, appliances, radios, and other goods on credit. Using the installment plan, they paid a small percentage down and the rest over a period of months or years. By the end of the decade, 80 percent of radios and 60 percent of cars were purchased on installment credit. Americans even bought stock on credit, making such stock purchases on margin. Every year, Americans accumulated more debt. In the past, they had feared debt and put off buying goods until they had all of the cash to pay for those items.
Easy credit changed this behavior during the 1920s. But the growing credit burden could mask the problem of Americans living beyond their means for only so long before the economy imploded.

» Dazed investors gathered outside the New York Stock Exchange as the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929.
» Despair gripped many Americans following the stock market crash. Some people who were hardest hit by the crash had to sell their belongings just to pay their bills.

The Stock Market Hits Bottom
By 1929, some economists were observing that soaring stock prices were based on little more than confidence. The prices had no basis in reality. Although other experts disagreed, it became clear that too much money was being poured into stock speculation, as investors gambled (often with money they did not even have) on high-risk stocks in hopes of turning a quick profit. If the market’s upward climb suddenly reversed course, many investors would face economic devastation.
On September 3, 1929, the stock market began to sputter and fall. Prices peaked and then slid downward in an uneven way. At the end of October, however, the slide gave way to a free fall.
After the Dow Jones average dropped 21 points in one hour on October 23, many investors concluded that the boom was over. They had lost confidence—the very thing that had kept the market up for so long.
The next day, October 24, came to be known as Black Thursday. With confidence in the stock market failing, nervous investors started to sell. Stock in General Electric that once sold at $400 a share plunged to $283. Across the United States, investors raced to pull their money out of the stock market. On October 29, Black Tuesday, the bottom fell out. More than 16 million shares were sold as the stock market collapsed in the Great Crash. Billions of dollars were lost. Whole fortunes were wiped out in hours. Many speculators who had bought stock on margin lost everything they had. President Hoover tried to soothe Americans by insisting that the “business of the country is on a sound and prosperous basis.” But by November 13, the Dow Jones average had dropped like a brick from its September high of 381 to 198.7. The Great Crash represented a rare extreme in the nation’s business cycle and a turning point for the American economy. feJI IDENTIFY What is stock speculation?
The Great Depression Begins
The stock market crash marked the beginning of the Great Depression, a period lasting from 1929 to 1941 in which the economy faltered and unemployment soared. Though it did not start the depression by itself, the crash sparked a chain of events that quickened the collapse of the U.S. economy.

crash was the country's banking system. The crisis in confidence continued as frightened depositors feared for their money and tried to withdraw it from their banks. Few banks could survive a sustained “run” of requests by depositors for their money. In 1929, some 641 commercial banks failed. A year later, 1,350 failed. And a year after that, 1,700 went under. By 1932, many Americans feared that no banks would be left standing.
Another cause of many bank failures was misguided monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. During the 1920s, the Federal Reserve, which regulates the amount of money in circulation, cut interest rates to stimulate economic growth. But in 1929, worried about investors speculating too much with borrowed money, the “Fed” limited the money supply to discourage lending. As a result, there was too little money in circulation to help the economy after the stock market crash. When plummeting stock prices sent investors to the banks to secure whatever hard money they had left, the banks were cleaned out of currency and forced to close.
Decreasing Demand Proves Challenging for Businesses Banks were not the only institutions to face the harsh financial realities of the depression. The collapse of stock prices, combined with reduced consumer spending, spelled trouble for American business. Business leaders believed that the survival
of their companies depended on production cutbacks, to maintain price levels, and layoffs, to reduce payroll. While their stocks were still falling, companies began closing plants and forcing workers onto the growing ranks of the unemployed. In August 1931, Henry Ford closed several of his Detroit automobile factories, putting nearly 75,000 people out of work.
Like a snowball rolling downhill, the problem of production cuts kept getting bigger and bigger. As businesses closed plants and fired workers to save money, consumers spent less. So businesses cut production even more, closing more plants and firing more workers. By 1933, nearly 25 percent of all American workers had lost their jobs.
The Impact of Tariffs New tariffs compounded the nation’s woes and helped to spread the depression. Intending to reverse the downward slide, the government moved to protect American products from foreign competition by raising tariffs, the taxes on goods imported from other countries. In June 1930, Congress passed the Hawley-Smoot Tariff. President Hoover signed the bill into law. The Hawley-Smoot Tariff raised taxes on foreign imports to such a level that the foreign goods could not compete in the American market. The tariff inspired European countries to retaliate and enact protective tariffs of their own.
The Great Depression and the New Deal 305	5.1 Causes of the Depression
Far from solving the problems of the depression, the Hawley-Smoot Tariff added to them. At a time when American manufacturers and farms had a glut of unsold products, the international move toward high protective tariffs closed markets. This closure was not just harmful to American producers. It was equally disastrous to the global economy. The ripple effect caused by the Hawley-Smoot Tariff helped to damage international trade.
Other Nations Endure Economic Hardship
The Hawley-Smoot Tariff was one of the causes of a depression spreading across the globe. As we saw earlier, the European problems of reparation payments, war debt payments, and international imbalance of trade had already created a shaky economic structure. In the early 1930s, the structure collapsed. Germany ceased their reparation payments, and the United States agreed to suspend France and Britain’s war debt payments. The international economy had largely been funded by American loans to Europe, but the crisis in the United States drastically curtailed those loans. As a result, European nations experienced the same cycle of business failures, bank collapses, and high

B DESCRIBE
As the Great Depression progressed, how did one wave of job losses lead to further job losses?
The Causes of the Great Depression
Historians and economists struggle to identify the exact causes of the Great Depression. Some have stressed a single root cause in their explanations of the financial crisis. The economist Milton Friedman believed that the depression resulted from the contraction in the money supply. The twin events of the stock market crash in 1929 and the run of bank failures in 1930, added to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions, left too little money in circulation for the nation’s economic needs.
John Maynard Keynes was one of the most influential economists of the depression. He argued that the lack of government interference in the economy led to the depression. Critical problems in money supply, distribution of wealth, stock speculation, consumer spending, productivity, and employment could have been controlled, he said, by proactive government policies.
Keynes’s work points to a fundamental difference between many economists regarding the depression. While Keynes recommended that governments spend more money to keep people employed when the economy slows, other noted economists like Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek criticized centralized economic planning and management.
There will never be a fully accepted answer to the question of what caused the Great Depression. But clearly, problems in consumption contributed heavily to it. Economic hardships before 1929 in Europe and rural America, coupled with an uneven distribution of wealth and over-speculation in the stock market, created dangerous economic conditions. When this was combined with poor or misinformed economic decisions by Congress and President Hoover, the Great Depression resulted.

The stock market crash signaled the end of boom times and the beginning of hard times. As investors mourned their losses, Americans watched the economy stagger into the Great Depression. In the cities and on the farms, desperate poverty gripped the nation. Even after prosperity returned, those who lived through the crisis would remember the pain and worries of the depression. Tested by extreme hardship, this generation of Americans forged a character and will strong enough to overcome economic ruin and restore prosperity.
Americans Suffer
Economic Hardship Shakes the Cities
The Great Depression had a deep and lasting impact on the lives of the people who lived through it.
Few Americans grasped the underlying problems of the 1920s economy or the subtle reasons for the stock market crash. Fewer still comprehended how the crash led to the Great Depression. But they did understand the effects of the economic crisis. Workers understood having a job one day and being unemployed the next. Whole families knew the fear and shame of losing their homes.
The Great Depression touched most Americans because many Americans either experienced or knew someone who experienced the hardships and loss caused by the economic catastrophe. For many, their lives were never the same again.
Unemployment Leaves Families Struggling The threat of widespread unemployment and destitution effected workers in cities and towns across the United States. Between 1921 and 1929, annual average unemployment rates had never risen above 3.7 percent. But then the depression hit, and the rate shot up. By 1933, it had climbed to a shocking 24.9 percent.
308
Despite this high rate, millions of workers were able to keep their jobs. However, most had their wages or hours cut. Many workers brought home paychecks that were 10, 20, sometimes 30 percent less than their predepression checks.
Yet statistics tell only part of the story. The human drama of unemployment unfolded over and over again, in city after city across the nation. For a man employed as a factory worker, the 1920s had promised a chance at upward economic mobility. He had been able to provide for his family, enjoy a decent standard of living, and save something for retirement. Then the depression hit. The man saw his hours cut and his workweek shortened. Eventually, he was laid off. Looking for another job, he trudged from one factory to the next. “No help wanted here” or “We don’t need nobody” greeted him at every turn. The man’s clothes began to look worn. His collars and cuffs became frayed, and his pants became shiny at the knees. He said less, stared more, and moved slower.
Maybe his wife was able to find work washing and ironing clothes or laboring as a maid. But those jobs were hard to find, too. At home, children ate smaller meals. Water replaced milk. Meat disappeared from the table.
Hunger lurked about the home like an unwanted guest. Sometimes the parents and children received free meals in public soup kitchens. Often the only place for the family to get a free scrap of food was in a bread line, where people lined up for handouts from charities or public agencies.
Poverty Becomes a Reality for Many Men like the factory worker just described moved from unemployed to unemployable. Whole families descended into hunger and homelessness. Their dreams of success and prosperity turned into nightmares of failure and poverty.
The Challenges of Homelessness As Americans lost their jobs and ran through their savings, they had to scrounge wherever they could to keep from going hungry. They sold furniture, pawned jewelry, and moved to cheaper lodgings—anything to keep their pantries stocked and rents paid. In many cities, they ran out of money, were evicted from their homes, and ended up on the streets.
Homeless people slept on park benches, in empty railway cars, or in cardboard boxes. Many grouped together in Hoovervilles, makeshift shantytowns of tents and shacks built on public land or vacant lots. Homeless people, some of whom had worked as skilled carpenters before the crisis, cobbled houses together out of lumber scraps, tar paper, tin, and glass. One of

the largest Hoovervilles in the country sprang up in the middle of Central Park in New York City. There, the homeless covered themselves with newspapers, called Hoover blankets, to stay warm at night. They walked around looking for jobs with their empty pants pockets turned inside out, a sign of poverty known as Hoover flags.
Despite the difficulties of life during the depression, many Americans did what they could to boost morale and help their neighbors. During a New York City newspaper strike, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia read comic strips to children over the radio. In Reading, Pennsylvania, members of the Taxpayers Protection League staged nonviolent protests to thwart evictions. Nevertheless, thousands of other Americans found no such escapes from their misery.

What was a Hooverville? Rural America Struggles with Poverty
In cities and towns across the nation, Americans faced a terrible plight. The numbers of the unemployed, homeless, and hopeless increased like a casualty list in some great war. In rural America, people fared no
better. In fact, sometimes their condition was even worse. Farmers had been suffering even before the Great Depression. Falling commodity prices and accumulating debt had made it a struggle for farmers to keep their heads above water. Many failed to stay afloat and sank so deep that they lost their farms.
Crop Prices Fall But then the bottom fell out of the economy and the depression added more woes. Crop prices fell even further, and new debts were added to old debts. To make matters even worse, the Great Plains was suffering through a choking drought, an ecological disaster that lasted for years. As a result, many more farmers lost their farms and moved. They traveled about the country, looking for work and fighting for survival.
The basic reality of farm life was the low prices paid to farmers for crops they grew for market. In 1919, a bushel of wheat sold for $2.16; in 1932, it sold for 38 cents. A pound of cotton fetched 35.34 cents in 1919; the same pound fetched 6.52 cents in 1932. The sharp fall in prices was evident with other farm products— corn and beans, cattle and hogs. The income farmers generated was not enough to allow them to continue farming. They could not pay their debts, purchase more seed, repair equipment, and buy what their families needed to survive. Overburdened by the diminishing returns for their labor, some farmers buckled under the stress.

In Sioux City, Iowa, in 1932, the Sioux City Milk Producers Association threatened to strike if its members did not see higher profits for their milk. When the association’s threats were ignored by local storeowners, farmers dumped 1,000 gallons of milk on a road outside the city. Despite such a drastic—and for many Americans unthinkable—action, farmers everywhere feared losing everything.
Losing the Family Farm Between 1930 and 1934, nearly one million farmers failed to pay their mortgages and lost their farms. Banks foreclosed on their lands and houses and repossessed their farming equipment. The bankers sold what they could at public auctions. Some farmers remained on the land as tenant farmers, working for bigger landowners rather than for themselves. But another effect was that many people drifted away from their rural communities, and migrated to cities to look for some other kind of work.
Cesar Chavez, who later became a well-known labor organizer, recalled the troubles his proud father had during the depression. A California bank repossessed his father’s small ranch, and the family was evicted from their house. Chavez remembered how it felt to lose his home:
We had been poor, but we knew every night there was a bed there, and this was our room. . . . But that all of a sudden changed. When you're small, you can’t figure these things out. You know something’s not right and you don’t like it, but you don't . . . let that get you down.
You sort of just continue to move.
—Cesar Chavez
Like the Chavez family, other farmers moved on after their losses. But for those who remained, Mother Nature dealt a cruel blow to already cruel times.
The Dust Bowl Farmers who survived the tumble in prices were still not safe. Through the mid-1930s, a drought in the Great Plains added to their problems. Water was a constant problem in the region. Normal rainfall seldom exceeded the 20 inches a year that traditional American agricultural practices demanded. As a result, droughts on the Great Plains were often more devastating than those in the East and Midwest. In the years before America’s western rivers were

dammed and irrigation practices became widespread, there were few answers to the drought threat.
New farming methods made drought conditions worse. Intensive farming came to prominence throughout the region in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Farmers then had moved onto the plains and plowed under much of the natural grasses in order to plant oceans of winter wheat. And after 1909, there were many more farmers, too. In that year, the federal government expanded the acreage allotted in the Homestead Act to 320 acres per settler. So a new wave of transplants decided to try farming on the often marginal lands that were still available on the Great Plains. All this intensive farming reduced the amount of grassland available to graze livestock, causing overgrazing on what was left. In addition, new tractor-pulled disk plows pulverized the soil, making it more vulnerable to wind erosion. Population growth and shifts in population distribution, along with new methods of farming, tipped the ecological balance of the region. In the past, plains grasses prevented the topsoil from blowing away during periods of drought. By the early 1930s, that dwindling grassy safety net could no longer do the job.
In 1932, the combination of the human geographic factor of loose topsoil caused by overfarming and grazing and the physical geographic factors of drought
and high winds resulted in disaster on the Great Plains. The winds kicked up towering dust storms that began to blow east.
These gigantic clouds of dust and dirt could rise from ground level to a height of 8,000 feet. The dust storms moved as fast as 100 miles per hour and blotted out the sun, plunging daylight into darkness.
Most of the dust storms started in the southern Great Plains, especially the high plains regions of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado. This swath of parched earth became known as the Dust Bowl. For people living in these hardest hit regions, depression and dust storms defined the misery of the "dirty thirties.”
Those unfortunate enough to be caught in a dust storm were temporarily choked and blinded by the swirling dirt. The storms killed cattle and birds, blanketed rivers, and suffocated fish. Dirt seeped into houses, covering everything with a thick coat of grime. Some dust clouds blew east as far as the Atlantic coast, dumping acres of dirt on Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C. Altogether, dust storms displaced twice as much dirt as Americans had scooped out to build the Panama Canal.
Moving Wherever Work Can Be Found Many farm families trapped in the Dust Bowl had little choice but to leave the region. They had lost their farms to

the banks and had nowhere to live. Dust storms had destroyed most remaining opportunities in their locale. They were low on everything except despair. Although only some came from Oklahoma, Dust Bowl refugees were generally referred to as Okies, regardless of their states of origin.
Okie families packed onto rickety trucks and headed toward California or Oregon or Washington, any place where a job might be found. Before the pace slowed, 800,000 people migrated out of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas alone.
The collapse of agriculture and the Great Plains Dust Bowl caused millions of other Americans to leave the midwestern and southern regions where they were born. Many migrated to California, lured by the promise of jobs, but were crushed when that promise too often proved empty. In reality, the migrants faced fierce competition from Mexican American, Filipino, and other farm laborers who were also seeking work. Many of them gave up farming and headed for nearby cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego, hoping to find factory work or to join the military.
Other farm families headed north or east to the cities of the Northeast and Midwest, again looking for jobs, shelter, and relief. One of the irreversible effects of this massive migration—some 2.5 million people left the Plains states alone—was that rural states lost population while states with large cities gained population. It was one of the largest migrations in the nation’s history, once again changing the nation’s demographic patterns.
The Dust Bowl had other effects as well. The farmers best able to survive the Great Depression were the ones with the biggest operations. They often bought repossessed land at rock-bottom prices and expanded their holdings into large commercial farms. The Dust Bowl also motivated the government to help Great Plains farmers. After the initial crisis, immense federal projects dammed western rivers. Dams eventually provided irrigation that made farm profits possible on the Great Plains.

severe than the other terms. But before long, Hoover’s “depression” gave way to the “Depression” and then the “Great Depression.” The term described not only a state of mind, but also an economic reality. It showed a despondent America, filled with people overwhelmed by seemingly inescapable poverty. Not only did the depression make victims of the men and women who lost jobs, it also was an economic and emotional crisis that profoundly affected U.S. society.
Families Suffer During the Depression For millions of Americans, the depression was an intensely personal affair. Men who lost their jobs and could not find other work often felt that they had betrayed their families. They had been the "breadwinners,” the providers, the ones whose paychecks fed and clothed the family and kept a roof over everyone’s head. The loss of a job meant a reduction in status. Different men reacted differently to unemployment. Many labored tirelessly to find a new job, while others sank into shame and despair. Some even deserted their families.
The unemployed were not the only ones who suffered. Men lucky enough to have jobs lived in constant fear that the next paycheck would be their last. They often felt guilty for being employed while so many of their relatives and friends were suffering. Few Americans were spared from the crisis.

Wives and children experienced the pain of their husbands and fathers. Birthrates plummeted to the lowest levels in American history—a sure sign of family distress. Mothers worked constantly to stretch meager family incomes.
They sewed clothes, searched for odd jobs, and valiantly tried to meet their families’ needs. With both parents preoccupied with making something out of nothing, family discipline often declined. Some children quit school. Others ran away from home. Families coped with the depression as best they could. Some huddled together, working to survive the hard times. Others broke apart, making those times even harder and lonelier.
Poor Minorities Suffer Disproportionately The
depression affected everyone, but it did not affect them equally. Americans on the bottom rung of the economic ladder—the poorest of the poor, often minorities with no financial resources—felt the sting of the depression the keenest. A Howard University sociologist noted early in the crisis that African Americans were “the last to be hired and the first to be fired." In the South, landowners threw African American sharecroppers off the plots they had been farming. Many of these workers migrated to northern cities, but there were no jobs waiting there. Only more poverty greeted them. In 1932, unemployment among African Americans hovered around 50 percent, nearly double the national rate.
However, African Americans had long stood firm against the challenges of poverty. They relied on the emotional resources of family and religion to cope with grim times. During his interview with a depression historian, an African American man explained what the depression meant to African Americans:
The Negro was born in depression.
It didn’t mean too much to him, The
Great American Depression, as you call it. There was no such thing. The best he could be was a janitor or a porter or shoeshine boy. It only became official when it hit the white man.
—Clifford Burke, quoted in Hard Tunes , 1970
Hard times came upon Mexican Americans and others as well. As more Okies headed west out of the Dust Bowl, the competition for jobs between those migrants and Mexican American and Asian American farmworkers in states like California heated up. A flood tide of workers struggled to find and keep farm jobs. Often, Mexican Americans and Asian Americans
The Great Depression and the New Deal 314	5.2 Americans Suffer
faced the additional burden of discrimination when competing with white farmhands for those jobs.
In the Southwest, many white Americans clamored for Asian American and Mexican American repatriation. Repatriation involved efforts by local, state, and federal governments to encourage or coerce immigrants and their naturalized children to return to their country of origin. Hundreds of thousands of people of Mexican ancestry—many of them U.S. citizens—were pushed out of the United States. Some were deported, others pressured to leave voluntarily. Even so, many more remained. By the end of the 1930s, Mexican Americans were working in most economic sectors of the Southwest, including farming, ranching, and industry.
Compared to the exit of Mexican Americans, the number of Europeans departing was small. Still, nearly 200,000 European immigrants left the United States between 1931 and 1934, the peak years of repatriation. How many of these departures were involuntary is impossible to know.
What is known, however, is that the United States severely restricted all immigration during the depression. Tragically, this policy included denying
entrance to thousands of German Jews who were fleeing Nazi persecution in their homeland.

Hoover's Response Fails
Hoover did not cause the Great Depression. But Americans looked to him as their President to solve the crisis. He tried. Hoover was an intelligent man, familiar with business methods and economic theory. He labored long hours, consulted a wide range of experts, and tried to marshal the resources of the country to solve the problems of the depression. As the effects of the Great Depression on the U.S. economy worsened, he tried several different approaches. In the end, although he failed to discover the right formula, it was not because of a lack of effort.
At the start of the economic downturn, Hoover followed a hands-off policy. Like most economists of the day, Hoover viewed the upswings and downswings of business cycles as natural occurrences. He felt that government should not interfere with such events. Periodic depressions were like storms. They could not be avoided, but strong businesses could weather them without the support of the government.
Relying on Volunteerism A policy of doing nothing, however, was no policy at all. Hoover soon recognized this fact and turned to a policy he had used in the past. As Secretary of Commerce during the

1920s, Hoover had encouraged business and labor to voluntarily work toward common goals. To address the current crisis, he asked business and industrial leaders to keep employment, wages, and prices at current levels. He simultaneously called for the government to reduce taxes, lower interest rates, and create public-works programs. The plan was to put more money into the hands of businesses and individuals to encourage more production and consumption. This, Hoover said, would reverse the cycle that led to the depression.
Lastly, Hoover requested that wealthier individuals give more money to charity. Millions of Americans did give money, clothing, and food to private and religious charities, which then distributed the goods to those in need. The idea was for all Americans to voluntarily join forces to combat the depression.
Voluntary Cooperation Fails Although the plan was well-intentioned, Hoover’s program relied too much on voluntary cooperation. The President believed he could persuade Americans to act in the best interests of the country as a whole, rather than in their own best interests. He took care to encourage, not legislate, America’s recovery. But volunteerism did not work. Businesses cut wages and laid off workers because business owners thought they had to do so to keep their businesses afloat. Farmers boosted production because they thought that producing more crops would help them keep their family farms. Most Americans followed individual, not cooperative, courses.
Hoover had also asked state and local governments to provide more jobs and relief measures. He had faith in localism, the policy whereby problems could best be solved at local and state levels. However, in this severe situation, towns and states simply did not have the financial or human resources to successfully combat the crisis. Making matters worse, the President strongly resisted using federal resources to provide direct relief to individuals. Believing it to be unconstitutional, Hoover opposed public assistance and instead favored “rugged individualism” which allowed people to better themselves through their own efforts. Yet as the months wore on, unemployment increased, charities ran low on money, and local and state governments could no longer plug the leaks in the economy. Some critics began to argue that the crisis demanded decisive federal action.
Hoover Reverses Course With Hoovervilles and homelessness on the rise, it became evident that the President’s policies were not working. Poor Americans called trucks pulled by horse or mule “Hoover wagons, campfires “Hoover heaters,” and cardboard boxes “Hoover houses.” The association of the Presidents

name with suffering and want indicated Americans’ negative feelings about their leader and his failed policies.
Faced with growing and increasingly harsh criticism, Hoover finally decided to reverse course and use federal resources to battle the depression. Believing the economy suffered from a lack of credit, he urged Congress to create the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). Created by Congress in early 1932, the RFC gave more than a billion dollars of government loans to railroads and large businesses. The agency also lent money to banks so that they could extend more loans to struggling businesses. Hoover believed that if the government lent money to bankers, they would lend it in turn to businesses. Companies would then hire workers, production and consumption would increase, and the depression would end. This theory, known as trickle-down economics, held that money poured into the top of the economic pyramid will trickle down to the base.
Although the RFC put the federal government at the center of economic life, it did not work well under Hoover’s guidance. The RFC lent out billions, but all too often bankers did not increase their loans to businesses. Additionally, businesses often did not use the loans they received to hire more workers. In the end, the money did not trickle down to the people who needed it the most.
Despite the failings of the RFC, Hoover succeeded with one project that made a difference. During the 1920s, Secretary of Commerce Hoover had called for the construction of a dam on the Colorado River. By the time Hoover became President in 1929, Congress had approved the project as part of a massive public-works program. Workers broke ground on Boulder Dam (later renamed Hoover Dam) in 1930. Construction brought much-needed employment to the Southwest during the early 1930s.

the rejection of capitalism and the acceptance of socialism or communism. They argued that capitalism created great inequities of wealth and an unhealthy atmosphere of competition in society. In fact, they saw the depression as a sign that capitalism was about to collapse. Looking at the Soviet Union, they maintained that a state-run economy was the only avenue out of the depression. However, even during the worst of the crisis, most Americans were unmoved by communist calls for revolution. Communism’s appeal proved no match for Americans’ guarantees of individual freedom and dreams of progress and opportunity.
Fascist appeals from the political right also failed to hold any attraction. Economic troubles in Europe contributed to the rise to power of fascist leaders like Benito Mussolini in Italy and Adolf Hitler in Germany. Despite this political shift abroad, fascists failed to gain power in the United States. Although some questioned the ability of America’s capitalistic and democratic institutions to overcome the crisis, most Americans never lost faith in their country.
The Bonus Army Marches on Washington Although most Americans did not want a revolution, many did desire substantial changes. In 1932, thousands of World War I veterans marched on Washington, D.C., demanding a solution to their particular problem. They became known as the Bonus Army.
In 1924, Congress had passed the Adjusted Compensation Act, which provided for a lump-sum payment to veterans of World War I in 1945. But in 1931, many veteran groups began to call for an early payment of the bonus, arguing that out-of-work vets needed the money to support their families. In May and June of 1932, almost twenty thousand veterans arrived in the capital, setting up camps and occupying empty government buildings. The House of Representatives agreed with their aims and passed a bill to provide early payment of the bonuses. However, the bill was defeated in the Senate in mid-June.
Some of the Bonus Army marchers left, discouraged. Others stayed to continue to lobby for the bill. A riot broke out in July when police tried to evict the marchers from government buildings.
The Protests End Badly Although President Hoover sympathized with the marchers, he called for General Douglas MacArthur and federal troops to "[sjurround the affected area and clear it without delay.” MacArthur exceeded his order, deciding to move the marchers out of the city altogether. He ordered his troops to ready tear gas and fix bayonets.

While Eisenhower regretted the use of the Army to solve a political problem, Patton ordered his troops to brandish their sabers in a show of force. Force was exactly what MacArthur used. More than one thousand marchers were tear-gassed, and many were injured, some very badly.
After the removal, MacArthur said that the marchers were a gang of revolutionaries bent on taking over the government:

stomachs grumbling from hunger, and the number of homeless increasing every day, the depression had taken its toll. Most Americans felt that their President had failed completely, and they were ready for a change. In July of 1932, the governor of New York, Franklin D. Roosevelt accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for President.
Political Success and Personal Challenge
Strangely enough, Democrats had chosen a presidential candidate who had never known economic hardship. As a child, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had enjoyed all the privileges of an upper-class upbringing, including education at elite schools and colleges. From his parents and teachers, FDR gained a great deal of self-confidence and a belief that public service was a noble calling.
In 1905, Franklin married his distant cousin Eleanor Roosevelt. President Theodore Roosevelt, Eleanor’s uncle and Franklin’s fifth cousin gave the bride away. In time, Eleanor would also become deeply involved in public affairs.
Like Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin rose quickly through the political ranks. After election to the New York State Senate, he served as Woodrow Wilson’s Assistant Secretary of the Navy. In 1920, Roosevelt was the Democratic Party’s vice presidential candidate. Although the Democrats lost the election, many considered him the rising star of the party. Then, in the summer of 1921, tragedy struck.
While vacationing, FDR slipped off his boat into the chilly waters of the North Atlantic. That evening, he awoke with a high fever and severe pains in his back and legs. Two weeks later, Roosevelt was diagnosed with polio, a dreaded disease that at the time had no treatment. He never fully recovered the use of his legs.
FDR did not allow his physical disability to break his spirit. With Eleanor’s encouragement, he made a political comeback. In 1928, he was elected governor of New York and earned a reputation as a reformer. In 1932, he became the Democrats’ presidential candidate, pledging “a new deal for the American people.”
Roosevelt Becomes President When FDR pledged a “New Deal,” he had only a vague idea of how he intended to combat the depression. Believing that the federal government needed to play an active role in promoting recovery and providing relief to Americans, he experimented with different approaches to see which ones worked best.

Roosevelt believed that the depression required strong action and leadership by the federal government. As Hoover correctly noted, “This campaign is more than a contest between two men. ... It is a contest between two philosophies of government.”
Hoover’s popularity declined as the Great Depression worsened. Even longtime Republicans deserted him. FDR—with the support of those who embraced his ideas as well as those who opposed Hoover’s approach—won a landslide victory, winning the electoral votes of all but six states.
Americans had to wait four long months between Roosevelt’s election, in November 1932, and his inauguration, in March 1933. Meanwhile, they watched
helplessly as thousands of banks collapsed and unemployment soared. What would Roosevelt do to combat the depression? Even the experts did not know what to expect.
Forming the Brain Trust To help him plan the New Deal, FDR sought the advice of a diverse group of men and women. Among the most influential was a group of professionals and academics whom the press nicknamed the “Brain Trust.” Roosevelt, a Democrat, displayed his bipartisan openness by nominating two Republicans, Henry Wallace and Harold Ickes (ihk uhs), to serve as his Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Interior. Roosevelt also nominated Frances Perkins, a social worker, to serve as his Secretary of Labor. She became the first woman Cabinet member in U.S. history.
Throughout his presidency, FDR depended heavily on his wife, Eleanor. She traveled widely, interacting with the American people and serving as FDR’s “eyes and ears.” For example, in 1933, the Bonus Army, which had marched on Washington, D.C.,
in 1932, returned to the capital, once again seeking an early payment of its bonus for World War I service. Like Hoover, FDR informed the marchers that the government could not afford to pay them their bonus. But unlike Hoover, who had sent the army to evict the Bonus Army, FDR sent Eleanor. She sang songs with

The New Deal Begins
During his first hundred days in office, which became known as the Hundred Days, Roosevelt proposed and Congress passed 15 major bills. These measures had three goals: relief, recovery, and reform. Roosevelt wanted to provide relief from the immediate hardships of the depression and achieve a long-term economic recovery. He also instituted reforms to prevent future depressions.
Restoring the Nation’s Confidence Roosevelt wasted no time dealing with the nation’s number one crisis. Late in 1932, banks had begun to fail in great numbers. A banking panic gripped the nation as frightened depositors lined up outside banks, trying to withdraw their savings.
» President Roosevelt talked directly to the American public through his “fireside” radio broadcasts. He used these broadcasts as an opportunity to calm the fears of the American people.
The day after his inauguration, Roosevelt called Congress into a special session and convinced them to pass laws to shore up the nation’s banking system. The Emergency Banking Bill gave the President broad powers—including the power to declare a four-day bank “holiday.” Banks all over the country were ordered to close. The closings gave banks time to get their accounts in order before they reopened for business.
Eight days after becoming President, Roosevelt delivered an informal radio speech to the American people. This was the first of many presidential fireside chats. They became an important way for Roosevelt to communicate with the American people. In the first fireside chat, FDR explained the measures he had taken to stem the run on banks. His calming words reassured the American people. When the bank holiday ended, Americans did not rush to their banks to withdraw their funds. Roosevelt had convinced them that the banks were a safe place to keep their money.
Reforming the Financial System A number of Roosevelt's proposals sought to reform the nation’s financial institutions.
One act created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insured bank deposits up to $5,000. In the following year, Congress established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the stock market and make it a safer place for investments.
These financial reforms helped restore confidence in the economy. Runs on banks ended, largely because Americans now had confidence that they would not lose their lifetime savings if a bank failed. Therefore, more Americans trusted their money to a bank, where it could be lended out to individuals and businesses, helping to ensure an adequate money supply. The stock markets also stabilized as regulated trading practices reassured investors. Today, both organizations continue to affect the lives of U.S. citizens. The FDIC continues to insure bank deposits so Americans can trust their money to banks. The SEC continues to regulate trading practices so Americans feel comfortable investing in the stock market.
To further solve the banking crisis, FDR took action to combat the currency shortage. In April 1933, Roosevelt ordered individuals and businesses to turn in any gold they owned worth more than $100 to the Federal Reserve and stopped U.S. banks from exporting and redeeming gold. The Federal Reserve began to accumulate and hold on to gold reserves, which it pegged to a certain value. Then in June 1933, a joint resolution of Congress cut the tie between gold and paper money. Americans could no longer redeem their paper money for its value in gold. With these actions,

FDR’s administration took another step in the shifting trend from a gold standard to fiat money, or money that is not backed by gold or silver, only a government decree. The move had the advantage of making the money supply more flexible and controllable. However, many experts, even some of Roosevelt’s advisers, believed that devaluing the dollar was risky and dangerous and would have long-term negative effects.
Reforming Agriculture A number of New Deal programs were aimed at easing the desperate plight of American farmers. For years, the supply of crops grown by American farmers had far exceeded demand. Prices dropped to the point where it was no longer profitable to grow some crops. To counter this, Congress passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), which sought to end overproduction and raise crop prices. To accomplish these goals, the AAA provided financial aid, paying farmers subsidies to cut production and forego planting on some of their land. Some farmers Plowed under crops and killed off excess livestock. Many Americans believed it was immoral to kill livestock or destroy crops while people went hungry. By 1934, however, farm prices began to rise.
These governmental actions to help farmers proved a mixed blessing for the nation, however. Some farmers didn’t qualify for the program.
The increase in farm prices also raised the price of food. In addition, the AAA left many tenant farmers unemployed when large landowners took the land they were farming out of production.
Creating the TVA Americans living in the Tennessee River valley of the rural South were among the poorest in the nation. Few had electricity, running water, or proper sewage systems. In 1933, Congress responded by creating a government agency called the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The TVA built a series of dams in the Tennessee River valley to control floods and to generate electric power. The agency also replanted forests and built fertilizer plants. These projects created jobs and attracted industry with the promise of cheap power.
Despite its accomplishments, the TVA attracted a host of critics. Some labeled it “socialist,” because it gave government direct control of an industry. Private power companies complained that they could not compete with the TVA, because the agency paid no taxes. However, the TVA’s successes in improving life in the Tennessee Valley have ensured its survival to the present.
Relief and Recovery During the Hundred Days, Roosevelt proposed and Congress enacted numerous other relief measures. To counter the depression’s
The Great Depression
and the New Deal 323	5.3 Two Presidents Respond
devastating impact on young men, FDR created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The CCC
provided jobs for more than 2 million young men. They replanted forests, built trails, dug irrigation ditches, and fought forest fires. As time went on, programs such as the CCC became more inclusive, extending work and training to Mexican American and other minority youth, as well as to whites. FDR called the CCC his favorite New Deal program.
Congress passed a number of other relief acts. The Federal Emergency Relief Act (FERA) granted federal funds to state and local agencies to help the unemployed. The short-lived Civil Works Administration (CWA) provided jobs on public-works projects. On another front, Congress created the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC), which loaned money at low interest rates to homeowners who could not meet mortgage payments. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured bank loans used for building and repairing homes.
These New Deal measures marked a clear break from the policies of the Hoover administration, which had avoided direct relief to individuals. The $500 million appropriated for FERA represented the largest peacetime expenditure by the federal government to that time.
The centerpiece of the early New Deal’s recovery program was the National Industrial Recovery

Act, which established the National Recovery Administration (NRA). Roosevelt called the NRA “the most important and far-reaching legislation ever enacted by the American Congress." Working with business and labor leaders, the NRA developed codes of fair competition to govern whole industries. These codes established minimum wages for workers and minimum prices for the goods that businesses sold. The idea behind these codes was to increase the wages of workers so they could buy more goods and raise prices so companies could make a profit.
Another major piece of New Deal legislation was the Public Works Administration (PWA), which built bridges, dams, power plants, and government buildings. The PWA was responsible for building many important structures that are still in use today, such as New York City’s Triborough Bridge, the Overseas Highway linking Miami and Key West, Florida, and the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest. These public-works projects improved the nation’s infrastructure and created millions of new jobs for workers.

chats?
Critics of the New Deal
While Roosevelt had little difficulty gaining support from Congress for his proposals, a minority of Americans expressed their opposition to the New Deal. Critics on the political right thought the changes the New Deal brought were too radical. Critics on the left thought that they were not radical enough. Several of FDR’s critics attracted mass followings and made plans to challenge him for the presidency in 1936.
Too Much or Not Enough? The chief complaint of conservatives against the New Deal was that it made the federal government too powerful. Critics contended that the government was telling business how to operate, spending large sums of money, and piling up a huge national debt.
To many conservatives, the New Deal was destroying free enterprise and undermining individualism. In a 1934 book entitled The Challenge to Liberty, former President Herbert Hoover described the New Deal as “the most stupendous invasion of the whole spirit of liberty” in the nation’s history. Robert Taft, the son of former President William Howard Taft and a leading Republican in Congress, believed that Roosevelt’s programs threatened individual freedom.
In 1934, these critics formed the American Liberty League. Supporters included prominent business
The Great Depression and the New Deal 324	5.3 Two Presidents Respond
leaders, such as Alfred Sloan and William Knudsen of General Motors. Leading Democrats, such as John W. Davis, the Democrats’ presidential nominee in 1924, and A1 Smith, the nominee in 1928, joined the Liberty League because they felt Roosevelt had deserted the Democratic Party’s principles of a limited federal government.
While conservatives accused FDR of supporting socialism, some leading socialists charged that the New Deal did not do enough to end the depression. Norman Thomas, the Socialist Party’s presidential candidate, claimed that FDR’s only concern was saving the banking system and ensuring profits for big business. The American Communist Party described the New Deal as a “capitalist ruse.”
Populist Critics Gain a Following The most significant criticism of FDR came from a cluster of figures whose roots were in the Populist movement. They saw themselves as spokesmen for poor Americans, challenging the power of the elite. Roosevelt’s strongest and most popular critics were Francis Townsend, Father Charles Coughlin, and Huey Long.
Townsend, a doctor from California, had a simple approach to resolving the economic effects of the Great Depression. It called for the federal government to provide $200 a month to all citizens over the age of 60. These funds, he argued, would filter out to the rest of society and produce an economic recovery. To promote this plan, he established “Townsend Clubs" and held meetings that resembled old-time church revivals.
Father Charles Coughlin presented an even bigger challenge to FDR. Coughlin, a Roman Catholic priest, had attracted millions of listeners to his weekly radio show.
At first, Coughlin supported the New Deal, but in time he broke with FDR, accusing him of not doing enough to fight the depression. Coughlin said that Roosevelt had “out-Hoovered Hoover” and called the New Deal “the raw deal.”
Coughlin mixed calls for the nationalization of industry with anti-Semitic remarks and attacks on “communists” who, he charged, were running the country. By the early 1940s, Coughlin’s views became so extreme that Roman Catholic officials forced him to end his broadcasts.
Canadian by birth, Coughlin could not run against FDR in the 1936 election. However, he threatened to throw his support behind an even more popular New Deal critic, Senator Huey Long of Louisiana. Long was an expert performer whose folksy speeches delighted audiences. Long’s approach to solving the depression was his "Share Our Wealth” program that proposed

high taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, and the redistribution of their income to poor Americans.
God invited us all to come and eat and drink all we wanted. He smiled on our land and we grew crops of plenty to eat and wear. . . . [But then] Rockefeller, Morgan, and their crowd stepped up and took enough for 120,000,000 people and left only enough for 5,000,000 for all the other 125,000,000 to eat. And so the millions must go hungry and without those good things God gave us unless we call on them to put some of it back.
■—Huey Long radio broadcast, 1934
Roosevelt viewed Long as a serious political threat. Indeed, a poll taken in 1935 estimated that, under the right circumstances, Long could have attracted up to 4 million votes in the 1936 presidential election. Although not enough votes to win the election, his candidacy could have drawn votes from Roosevelt,
The Great Depression and the New Deal 325	5.3 Two Presidents Respond
damaging the President’s chances. But Long never got that opportunity.
For years he had ruled Louisiana as if he owned the state, wresting control of nearly every facet of governance from local and other state officials. On his way to achieving this dominance, he made many enemies. In 1935, a political enemy assassinated Long, ending the most serious threat to Roosevelt’s presidency.

The Great Depression and the New Deal
5.3 Two Presidents Respond
FDR’s goals for the first phases of the New Deal were relief, recovery, and reform. Progress had been made, but there still was a long way to go. Beginning in early 1935, Roosevelt launched an aggressive campaign to find solutions to the ongoing problems caused by the Great Depression. This campaign, sometimes known as the Second New Deal, created Social Security and other programs that continue to have a profound impact on the everyday lives of Americans.

Expanding New Deal Programs
In his fireside chats, press conferences, and major addresses, Roosevelt explained the challenges facing the nation. He said that the complexities of the modern world compelled the federal government to “promote the general welfare" and to intervene to protect citizens’ rights. Roosevelt used legislation passed during the second phase of the New Deal to try to accomplish these goals. This second wave of legislation addressed the problems of the elderly, the poor, and the unemployed; created new public-works projects; helped farmers; and enacted measures to protect workers’ rights. It still focused on relief, recovery, and reform, but with more of a longer-term focus. It was during this period that the first serious challenges to the New Deal emerged.
New Jobs Programs In the spring of 1935, Congress appropriated $5 billion for new jobs and created the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to administer the program. Roosevelt placed his longtime associate, Harry Hopkins, in charge. The WPA built or improved a good part of the nation’s highways, dredged rivers and harbors, and promoted soil and water conservation.

The WPA even provided programs in the arts for displaced artists, writers, and actors. As Hopkins explained, artists “have to eat just like other people.”
By 1943, the WPA had employed more than 8 million people and spent about $11 billion. Its workers built more than 650,000 miles of highways and 125,000 public buildings. Among the most famous projects funded by the WPA were the San Antonio River Walk and parts of the Appalachian Trail.
All of these programs were expensive, and the government paid for them by spending money it did not have. The federal deficit—$461 million in 1932— grew to $4.4 billion in 1936. The enormous expenditures and growing debt led many to criticize the government’s public-works projects as wasteful. Some economists disagreed. British economist John Maynard Keynes argued that deficit spending was needed to end the depression. According to Keynes, putting people to work on public projects put money into the hands of consumers who would buy more goods, stimulating the economy.
Keynes called this theory pump priming. Critics also argued that FDR was using the program to build voter loyalty to the Democratic party.
» Social Security was established to help retirees. Retired bookkeeper Ida Fuller of Ludlow, Vermont, displayed her monthly check here. It was for $41.30.
Aiding Older Americans The United States was one of the few industrialized nations in the world that did not have some form of pension system for the elderly. During the depression, many elderly people had lost their homes and their life savings and were living in poverty. On January 17, 1935, President Roosevelt unveiled his plans for Social Security.
The Social Security Act, passed by Congress in 1935, established a pension system for retirees. It also established unemployment insurance for workers who lost their jobs. In addition, the law created insurance for victims of work-related accidents and provided aid for poverty-stricken mothers and children, the blind, and the disabled. It was funded by a payroll tax on employers and workers.
The Social Security Act had many flaws. At first, it did not apply to domestic workers or farmworkers. Since African Americans were disproportionately employed in these fields, they were not eligible for many of the benefits of Social Security. Widows received smaller benefits than widowers, because people presumed that elderly women could manage on less money than elderly men. Despite these shortcomings, Social Security proved the most popular and significant of the New Deal programs.
Social Security continues today to provide basic economic security to millions of Americans. Its programs act as a safety net for senior citizens, the poor, and others in financial need. Popular support for Social Security continues, although concern mounts over the program’s long-term funding and ability to keep making payments.
Supporting American Farms Another New Deal program that passed in 1935 included further help for farmers. When the depression began, only 10 percent of all farms had electricity, largely because utility companies did not find it profitable to run electric lines to communities with small populations. To bring farmers into the light, Congress established the Rural Electrification Administration (REA). The REA loaned money to electric utilities to build power lines, bringing electricity to isolated rural areas. This program had a tremendous, beneficial effect on rural communities. The REA was so successful that by 1950, about 80 percent of American farms had electricity.
New Deal programs changed the relationship of the federal government to the American farmer. The government was now committed to providing price supports, or subsidies, for agriculture. Critics attacked price supports for undermining the free market. Others observed that large farms, not small farmers, benefited most from federal farm programs. Even during the 1930s, many noticed that tenant farmers

Labor Unions Thrive
Even before the Great Depression, most industrial workers labored long hours for little pay. Few belonged to labor unions. During the Great Depression, however, there was an upsurge in union activity. New unions enlisted millions of workers from the mining and automobile industries.
A
New Relationship Between Workers and Business Owners Roosevelt believed that the success of the New Deal depended on raising the standard of living for American industrial workers. This, he believed, would improve the entire economy. The National Labor Relations Act was the most important piece of New Deal labor legislation.
Also called the Wagner Act, it recognized the right of employees to join labor unions and gave workers the right to collective bargaining. Collective bargaining meant that employers had to negotiate with unions about hours, wages, and other working conditions. The law created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to look into workers’ complaints.
The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 provided workers with additional rights. It established a minimum wage, initially at 25 cents per hour, and a maximum workweek of 44 hours. It also outlawed child labor. The minimum wage remains one of the New Deal’s most controversial legacies. In the years ahead, the minimum wage would be gradually raised. Today, whenever a raise in the minimum wage is proposed, economists and political leaders debate the wisdom of such an increase. Supporters say such raises are necessary for low-paid workers to keep pace with the rising cost of living. Opponents counter that some producers will pass the wage increases on to consumers in the form of higher prices. They also fear that minimum wage increases will increase
The Great Depression and the New Deal 329	5.4 The New Deal Expands
unemployment if some employers cut jobs to keep their labor costs the same.
Workers Organize for Gains The upsurge in union activity came at the same time as a bitter feud within the major labor federation, the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The AFL represented skilled workers— such as plumbers, carpenters, and electricians—who joined trade or craft unions. Few workers in the major industries belonged to the AFL, and the AFL made little effort to organize them.
Fed up with the AFL’s reluctance to organize these workers, John L. Lewis, the president of the United Mine Workers, and a number of other labor leaders established the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The workers targeted by the ClO-organizing campaigns tended to be lower paid and ethnically more diverse than those workers represented by the AFL.
In December 1936, members of the CIO’s newly formed United Automobile Workers (UAW) union staged a sit-down strike, occupying one of General Motors’s most important plants in Flint, Michigan. In a sit-down strike, workers refuse to leave the workplace until a settlement is reached. When the police and state militia threatened to remove them by force, the workers
informed Michigan governor Frank Murphy that they would not leave.
We fully expect that if a violent
effort is made to oust us many of us
will be killed and we take this means
of making it known to our wives, to our
children, to the people of the State of
Michigan and the country, that if this
result follows from the attempt to eject
us, you are the one who must be held
responsible for our deaths!
—Auto workers sit-down committee, Flint, Michigan, January 1936
The strike lasted for 44 days until General Motors, then the largest company in the world, agreed to recognize the UAW. This union success led to others.
By 1940, 9 million workers belonged to unions, twice the number of members in 1930. Just as important, union members gained better wages and working conditions.

Opposition to the New Deal
Franklin Roosevelt won an overwhelming victory in the presidential election of 1936. He received 61 percent of the vote, compared to just 37 percent for his Republican challenger, Alfred M. Landon. Roosevelt carried every state but Maine and Vermont. FDR entered his second term determined to challenge the group that he considered the main enemy of the New Deal—a Supreme Court that had struck down many of his programs.
Some New Deal Policies Face Judicial Scrutiny
A year before the 1936 election, the Supreme Court had overturned one of the key laws of Roosevelt's first hundred days. In the case of Schechter Poultry v. United States, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that since the President has no power to regulate interstate commerce, the National Industrial Recovery Act was unconstitutional. The power to regulate interstate commerce rests with Congress and cannot be delegated to the Executive branch.
One pro-New Deal newspaper captured the mood of many Democrats: “AMERICA STUNNED; ROOSEVELT’S TWO YEARS’ WORK KILLED IN TWENTY MINUTES.”
Not long afterward, the Court ruled a key part of the Agricultural Adjustment Act unconstitutional. Roosevelt charged that the Court had taken the nation back to “horse-and-buggy” days. He expected the Court
to strike down other New Deal measures, limiting his ability to enact new reforms.
Roosevelt’s Court-Packing Scheme On February 5, 1937, in a special address to Congress, FDR unveiled a plan that would dilute the power of the sitting Justices of the Supreme Court. He called for adding up to six new Justices to the nine-member Court. He justified his proposal by noting that the Constitution did not specify the number of judges on the Court. He added that many of the Justices were elderly and overworked. Critics, recognizing that Roosevelt’s new appointees would most likely be New Deal supporters, called his plan court packing. They accused him of trying to increase presidential power and upsetting the delicate balance between the three branches of the federal government.
Some critics urged Americans to speak out.
If the American people accept this last audacity of the President without letting out a yell to high heaven, they have ceased to be jealous of their liberties and are ripe for ruin.
—Dorothy Thompson, newspaper columnist, 1937
Given Roosevelt’s enormous popularity, he might have convinced Congress to enact his plan but he did not have to because the Court began to turn his way. On March 29, 1937, the Court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of a
The Great Depression and the New Deal 331	5.4 The New Deal Expands
minimum wage law. Two weeks later, again by a vote of 5 to 4, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Wagner Act. In both cases, Justice Owen J. Roberts provided the deciding vote. Pundits called it the “switch in time to save nine,” because Roberts had previously voted against several New Deal programs. Roberts’s two votes in support of the New Deal removed FDR’s main reason for packing the Court.
Shortly after this switch, Judge Willis Van Devanter, who had helped strike down several New Deal programs, resigned from the Court. This enabled FDR to nominate a Justice friendlier to the New Deal. With more retirements, Roosevelt nominated a number of other new Justices, including Felix Frankfurter, one of his top advisers.
Indeed, 1937 marked a turning point in the history of the Court. For years to come, the Court more willingly accepted a larger role for the federal government. Yet the court-packing incident had the impact of weakening FDR politically. Before the courtpacking plan, FDR’s popularity prevented critics from challenging him. FDR’s attempt to force a change to the relationship among the executive and judicial branches of government was off-putting to many Americans, even those who had supported him since 1932. Now that Roosevelt had lost momentum, critics felt free to take him on. And even though after 1937 the Court did not strike down any more laws, Roosevelt found the
public much less willing to support further New Deal legislation.
Economic Setbacks Help Conservative Candidates The turmoil over the Supreme Court had barely faded when the Roosevelt administration faced another crisis.
During 1935 and 1936, economic conditions had begun to improve. Unemployment had fallen 10 percent in four years. With the economy doing better, FDR cut back on federal spending in order to reduce the rising deficit. But he miscalculated.
While Roosevelt reduced federal spending, the Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates, making it more difficult for businesses to expand and for consumers to borrow to buy new goods. Suddenly, the economy was in another tailspin. Unemployment soared to more than 20 percent. Nearly all of the gains in employment and production were wiped out.
Largely because of the downturn, the Democrats suffered a setback in the 1938 congressional elections. Republicans picked up 7 Senate and 75 House seats. Although Democrats still maintained a majority in both houses of Congress, Roosevelt’s power base was seriously weakened because many southern Democrats already were only lukewarm supporters of the New Deal. Needing their support for his foreign policies, FDR chose not to try to force any more reforms through Congress. In addition, the President’s attention was

As the first African American female to head a federal agency and special adviser on minority affairs, Mary McLeod Bethune worked to promote educational opportunities for African Americans.
The New Deal provided desperately needed relief from the depression and enacted reforms that guarded against economic catastrophe. It did not end the depression. World War II, with its massive military spending, would do that. Yet, the New Deal mattered enormously because it brought fundamental changes to the nation. It changed the role of the federal government in the economy, the power of the presidency, and the relationship of the American people to their government.

Significant Political Roles
The New Deal provided some women with the opportunity to increase their political influence and to promote women's rights. Foremost among them was Eleanor Roosevelt, who transformed the office of First Lady from a largely ceremonial role to a position of action and deep involvement in the political process. In fact, her more prominent role would set a precedent of increasing involvement in social and political affairs that many subsequent First Ladies would follow. Eleanor Roosevelt made numerous political, social, and economic contributions to American society. Representing the President, she toured the nation. She visited farms and Indian reservations and traveled deep into a coal mine. She helped FDR on his campaigns and offered advice on policy issues. In her newspaper column, “My Day, she called on Americans to live up to the political and social goal of equal justice for all.
Eleanor Roosevelt is the First Lady of Main Street,” explained magazine writer Margaret Marshall. "She occupies the highest social position in the land. Yet she makes friends on a plane or a train even as you and I.” Mrs. Roosevelt’s causes included advancing public health

and education, promoting the arts in rural areas, and even addressing flood control. She exhibited boundless energy, traveling more than 60,000 miles in two years.
Molly Dewson, head of the Women’s Division of the Democratic Party, observed that Eleanor Roosevelt provided women with an unprecedented access to the President. “When I wanted help on some definite point, Mrs. Roosevelt gave [me] the opportunity to sit by the President at dinner and the matter was settled before we finished our soup.”
The Roosevelt Administration included the first female Cabinet member, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. She played a leading role in establishing Social Security. Perkins also helped win approval of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which ended child labor and established a minimum wage.
However, the New Deal did not fight to end gender discrimination in the workplace. Indeed, some historians have argued that a number of New Deal programs reinforced traditional gender differences. The WPA and other relief programs employed women but made a much greater effort to provide work to men first. For example, women were not eligible to work for the CCC. Domestic workers, a category of jobs held primarily by women, were exempted from Social Security and the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Stronger Political Voice for African Americans When the depression hit, African American workers were often the first to lose their jobs. By 1934, the unemployment rate for African Americans was almost 50 percent, more than twice the national average. Eleanor Roosevelt and others urged the President to improve the situation of African Americans.
As the New Deal progressed, Eleanor Roosevelt increasingly used her position to protest against racial discrimination. At a meeting held by the Southern Conference on Human Welfare, a biracial group that sought to promote racial reforms, the First Lady sat with the black delegates—a daring move in segregated Birmingham, Alabama. When a white police officer told her that she was violating local segregation laws, Mrs. Roosevelt moved her chair to the space between the black and white sides. She then delivered a rousing and provocative keynote address in favor of racial reform.

world that democracy is possible and capable of living up to the principles upon which it was founded. The eyes of the world are upon us, and often we find they are not too friendly eyes.
—Eleanor Roosevelt, November 22, 1938
The President invited many African American leaders to advise him. These unofficial advisers became known as the Black Cabinet. They included Robert Weaver and William Hastie, Harvard University graduates who rose to high positions within the Department of the Interior. Hastie later served as a federal judge, and Weaver became the first African American Cabinet member in the 1960s.
Mary McLeod Bethune was another member of the Black Cabinet. The founder of what came to be known as Bethune Cookman College, she was a powerful champion of racial equality. In her view, the New Deal had created a “new day” for African Americans. She noted that African Americans gained unprecedented access to the White House and positions within the government during Roosevelt’s presidency.
Nevertheless, Roosevelt did not always follow the advice of his Black Cabinet. Racial discrimination and injustice continued to plague African Americans.
» The New Deal benefited Native Americans as well as other minority groups. It provided funds for the Navajo to open a new hospital in Fort Defiance, Arizona in 1938.
When the NAACP launched an energetic campaign in favor of a federal antilynching law, the President refused to support it. FDR told black leaders that he could not support an antilynching law, because if he did, southern Democrats “would block every bill I ask Congress to pass.” Hence, no civil rights reforms became law during the 1930s.
Several New Deal measures also unintentionally hurt African Americans. Federal payments to farmers to produce fewer crops led white landowners to evict unneeded black sharecroppers from their farms. Even though they benefited from the WPA and other relief measures, African Americans often did not receive equal wages. Social Security and the Fair Labor Standards Act exempted domestic workers and farm laborers, two occupations in which African Americans were employed in great numbers.
bi RECALL What role did the Black Cabinet play in the
Roosevelt Administration?
New Deal Legislation for Native Americans
Attempting to improve the lives of Native Americans, the Roosevelt administration made major changes in long-standing policies. The 1887 Dawes Act had divided tribal lands into smaller plots. By the early 1930s, it was clear that the act had worsened the condition of the people it was designed to help. Of the original 138 million acres American Indians had owned in 1887, only 48 million remained in American Indian hands, and much of it was too arid to farm. John Collier, the New Deal’s Commissioner of Indian Affairs, warned that the Dawes Act was resulting in “total landlessness for the Indians."
To prevent further loss of land and improve living conditions for Native Americans, Collier developed the Indian New Deal, a program that gave Indians economic assistance and greater control over their own affairs. Collier got funding from New Deal agencies for the construction of new schools and hospitals and to create an Indian Civilian Conservation Corps. In addition, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in a reversal of previous policies, encouraged the practice of Indian religions, native languages, and traditional customs. Collier also convinced Congress to pass the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, considered the centerpiece of the Indian New Deal. This law restored tribal control over Native American land.
Although it did not immediately improve their standard of living, the Indian Reorganization Act gave Native Americans greater control over their destiny.

But some New Deal measures actually hurt Native Americans. For example, federal authorities determined that large herds of sheep tended by the Navajos were causing soil erosion on the Colorado Plateau.
As a result, the federal government enacted a Navajo Livestock Reduction program, which mandated that the Navajo sell or kill thousands of sheep. The Navajo deeply resented this act. They did not believe that their sheep threatened the soil and they did not trust the motives of government agents.

New Political Coalition Emerges By the time he died in 1945, Roosevelt had been elected to four terms as President. His legendary political skills had united an unlikely alliance of Americans into a strong political force called the New Deal coalition. This coalition brought together southern whites, northern blue-collar workers—especially those with immigrant roots—poor midwestern farmers, and African Americans.
African American voting patterns show the importance of the New Deal coalition. Before the New
Deal, most African Americans voted Republican, the party of Abraham Lincoln. Responding to the efforts of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, African Americans began to vote Democratic during the 1930s. This trend was strongest in the West and the North. For example, in 1934, Arthur W. Mitchell, an African American Democrat, defeated Oscar De Priest, an African American Republican, to represent the largely black south side of Chicago. Mitchell became the first African American Democrat elected to Congress.
The New Deal coalition gave the Democratic Party a sizable majority in both houses of Congress. Before FDR’s election, the Democrats had been the minority party in the House of Representatives for all but eight years since 1895. But from 1932 to 1995, the Democrats controlled the majority of seats in the House of Representatives for all but four years. The coalition that elected Roosevelt in 1932 went on to secure the White House for the Democrats in six of the next eight presidential elections.
Besides forging a powerful political coalition, Roosevelt and the New Deal helped to unify the nation. Social and ethnic divisions, so much a part of the 1920s, diminished significantly during the 1930s. Immigrant communities, in particular, gained a greater sense of belonging to the mainstream. Programs such as the CCC and WPA allowed individuals of varied backgrounds to get to know one another, breaking

down regional and ethnic prejudices. As one CCC worker observed:
The Civilian Conservation Corps is a smaller melting pot within the big one. We are thrown together in such a way that we have to get acquainted whether or not we want to. . . .
Different races and nationalities look each other in the face, work and eat together for the first time. And it is a safe bet, we think, that this process many times results in the elimination of traditional prejudices based on ignorance and misinformation.

New Deal Legislation Expands the Historical Role of Government
New Deal programs greatly increased the size and scope of the federal government. “For the first time for many Americans,” writes historian William Leuchtenburg, “the federal government became an institution that was directly experienced. More than the state and local governments, it came to be the government.” Moreover, the government began to do things it had never done before, from withdrawing taxes directly from workers’ paychecks to distributing benefits to the elderly.
Though the New Deal did not end the depression, it did help restore the American economy. It created the foundation for sustained and stable growth. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David Kennedy, “the unparalleled economic vitality of the post-1940 decades was attributable to many factors. But the [economic expansion] . .. owed much to the New Deal.”
An Increasingly Significant Role Promoting Economic Growth With the New Deal, the federal government broke from the tradition of laissez-faire, or leaving the economy alone, which had characterized most of American history. This changed the relationship

between government and private business. Instead of being hands-off, now the federal government accepted responsibility for spurring economic growth, or pump priming. For the first time, the government had acted as an employer of the unemployed and a sponsor of work projects. FDR accepted the idea that the federal government had to do something to get the economy going again, and Democrats and many Republicans agreed.
FDR’s rejection of laissez-faire policies led a number of New Deal critics to accuse him of promoting socialism. However, many New Deal measures actually strengthened capitalism and helped make possible the economic boom of the post-World War II era.
The FDIC and SEC restored Americans’ trust in banks and the stock market, and the significant gap between the rich and the poor remained relatively lower for several decades. The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) provided low-interest loans, increasing home ownership.
The New Deal affected millions of individual workers and their families. The Wagner Act boosted union membership, which continued to grow after World War II. Minimum wage increases improved the purchasing power of minorities and those at the bottom rung of the economic ladder. New Deal legislation created child labor laws, workers’ compensation laws, and unemployment insurance, programs that had important and enduring impacts on the U.S. economy.
The New Deal had a great impact on rural Americans. Regional public-works projects, such as the TVA and Bonneville Dam, reduced flooding and provided water for irrigation. Along with the Rural Electrification Administration, these dams brought electricity to farmers in the Southeast and the Northwest. Rose Dudley Scearce of Shelby, Kentucky, recalled what the REA meant to her farm family:
The first benefit we received from the REA was light, and aren’t lights grand? My little boy expressed my sentiments when he said, ‘Mother, I didn’t realize how dark our house was until we got electric lights.’ . . . Like the rest of the people, we changed our storage-battery radio into an electric radio. . . . Next we bought an electric refrigerator. . . .

Federal Safety Net for Those in Need “We are going to make a country in which no one is left out,” Franklin Roosevelt once told Frances Perkins. The many programs he enacted to realize this goal led to the rise of a welfare state in the United States, a government that assumes responsibility for providing for the welfare of children and the poor, elderly, sick, disabled, and unemployed.
The creation of the American welfare state was a major change in government policy. With the exception of military veterans, most Americans had never received any direct benefits from the federal government. State and local governments, private charities, and families had long served as the safety net for needy Americans. True, the New Deal did not achieve FDR’s goal of “a country in which no one is left out,” because it exempted many Americans from Social Security and other programs. Still, New Deal legislation changed the historical roles of state and federal governments. It established the principle that the federal government, not state or local government,

was responsible for the welfare of all Americans. In the latter half of the twentieth century, the reach of federal government programs would grow greatly.
New Deal reforms provided the framework for the debate over the proper role of the federal government in the private lives of Americans. It energized liberals who would push for an even greater role for the federal government in future years. But it troubled conservatives who would argue that the expansion of the federal government limited American rights. For example, many argued that New Deal legislation increasing the strength of unions and raising the minimum wage infringed on the rights of business owners and limited job creation and economic growth. Many also did not support federal welfare programs, because they felt that the federal government was assuming responsibilities that were otherwise granted to the states by the Tenth Amendment. Indeed, this very debate over the role of the federal government in the lives of its citizens divides liberals and conservatives to this day.
Conservation Efforts Produce Mixed Results
Reared in New York State’s beautiful Hudson River valley, Franklin Roosevelt had a great love of nature. As a child, FDR also loved outdoor sports and became an expert swimmer and sailor. A number of his New Deal programs, such as the CCC, aimed at restoring forests and preserving the environment.
Other federal agencies started soil conservation efforts. Perhaps most visibly, New Dealers worked hard to end the Dust Bowl, a symbol of the degraded state of the land at the beginning of the depression.
Franklin Roosevelt also continued the conservation work of his cousin, President Theodore Roosevelt. Although funds were short, the government set aside about 12 million acres of land for new national parks, including Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, Kings Canyon National Park in California, and Olympic National Park in Washington State.
However, not all New Deal programs helped the environment. Several of the large public-works projects, such as the TVA and the string of dams along the Columbia River, had a mixed impact. The dams controlled floods, generated electric power, and provided irrigation, but they also upset the natural habitats of some aquatic life. Massive reservoirs created by these projects also displaced some people and destroyed some traditional Native American burial, hunting, and fishing grounds.
An Expansion of Executive Power In no area did FDR have a greater impact than on the office of the President itself. The expanding role of the government, including the creation of many new federal agencies, gave the executive branch much more power. New Deal administrators, such as Harry Hopkins, head of the WPA, commanded large bureaucracies with massive budgets and little supervision by Congress. Their authority increased Roosevelt’s influence. Indeed, some commentators even began to speak of the rise of an imperial presidency, an unflattering comparison to the power exercised in the past by rulers of great empires.
FDR also affected the style of the presidency. His mastery of the radio captivated Americans. His close relations with the press assured a generally popular

response to his projects from the major media. Because he served for such a long time and was such an outstanding communicator, FDR set a standard that future Presidents had a hard time fulfilling.
Later, during World War II, FDR’s presidential power grew even greater. As commander in chief of the nation’s armed forces, he exercised enormous authority over many aspects of life.
Most Americans accepted the President’s increased authority as a necessary condition of wartime. But after the war, they sought to protect the delicate balance between the different branches of government and between the federal and state governments. The debate over the increasing power of the Executive branch relative to other branches is another New Deal legacy that lives on today.
One way that Americans sought to guard against the growing power of the President was by amending the Constitution. When Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented third term in 1940, he knew that he had broken an unwritten rule, established by George Washington, that Presidents should serve only two terms. He won that election and then ran and won again in 1944. But after Roosevelt’s death in 1945, there was a growing call for limiting a President’s term in office. In 1951, the Twenty-second Amendment was ratified, limiting the President to two consecutive terms.

The big movie studios churned out the popular genres of musicals, romantic comedies, and gangster films. Children marveled at the colorful animation of Walt Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. For a good scare, teens and young adults flocked to Frankenstein. Adults watched dancers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers glide effortlessly across the ballroom floor in Top Hat. And millions wept as they watched the stormy love affair between characters played by Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in the Civil War epic Gone With the Wind.
Depression-Era Films Reflect Social Issues In the
early 1930s, many films reflected the public’s distrust of big business and government. Gangster movies, such as Public Enemy starring James Cagney, were very popular. These films showed a declining faith in government and law enforcement, with characters turning to crime to survive the depression. But as the New Deal restored confidence, the government regained its glow, and movies began portraying government officials as heroes. In 1935, Cagney portrayed an FBI agent who captured the bad guys in G-Men.
Other films reflected the struggle against hardship that many Americans were waging by focuing on the strength of average Americans. Director Frank Capra was a leader of this genre. The characters in his films were everyday people struggling with the hardships of the time. In Capra’s Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, actor James Stewart plays a junior senator who fights against the greed and corruption he finds in the nation’s capital. Depression-era audiences cheered Capra’s films, which celebrate American idealism and the triumph of the common man over the forces of adversity.
Radio’s Increasing Popularity The success of the movie industry was matched by that of radio. The national radio networks broadcast popular shows starring comedians such as Bob Hope and Jack Benny. Americans avidly followed soap operas, variety shows, and humorists, such as Will Rogers. Dramatic shows were also popular. The Lone Ranger started its run in 1933 and ran for more than 20 years. The detective serial The Shadow began each thrilling episode with the haunting line, “Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?”
In addition to providing entertainment, the family radio provided information. FDR used his fireside chats to explain and promote his New Deal programs. Newscasters delivered the daily news and political commentary.

entertainment. It happened on the night of October 30, 1938, when millions of Americans tuned in to a drama called War of the Worlds, directed by Orson Welles. The Mercury Theatre broadcast was so realistic that many people believed that Martians were actually invading. Panic gripped areas of the country until announcers insisted that it was all make-believe.
The Sounds of an Era Like films and radio shows, various genres of music provided a diversion from hard times. Whether listening to the radio at home or dancing in nightclubs, Americans enjoyed the popular music of the day. "Swing” music played by “big bands” topped the charts. Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, and Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey were some of the top swing musicians, a term probably derived from Ellington’s tune “It Don’t Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing.” Your Hit Parade and Make Believe Ballroom—the program that introduced disc jockeys—were just two of the radio shows that brought the latest tunes to listeners. The most popular vocalist of the era was Bing Crosby.
Latin music was very popular. The rhythms of the rumba and the samba had a special appeal for dancers, and Latin bands were prominently featured in films and on the radio.
» Not all popular music in the 1930s described happier days. American blues musician Huddie Ledbetter, better known as “Leadbelly,” played music that reflected the harsh experiences of African Americans.
Some genres of music were more somber, reflecting the issues of the time, including folk and ethnic music. Black singers focused on the harsh conditions faced by African Americans.
Huddie Ledbetter, a folk singer known as “Leadbelly,” described experiences of African Americans with the songs “Cotton Fields” and “The Midnight Special.” Folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote ballads about the Okies, farmers who fled Dust Bowl states and headed to California. Guthrie’s song “Dust Bowl Refugee” helped listeners understand the Okies’s plight.

Increased Funding for the Arts
During the New Deal, the federal government provided funding for the arts for the first time in American history. Recognizing that many artists and writers faced dire circumstances, WPA administrator Harry Hopkins established a special branch of the WPA to provide artists with work. Programs such as the Federal Art Project, the Federal Writers’ Project, and the Federal Theatre Project offered a variety of job opportunities to artists.
In federally funded theaters, musicians and actors staged performances that were often free to the public. In a series of new state guidebooks, WPA writers recorded the history and folklore of the nation.
Artists painted huge, dramatic murals on public buildings across the nation. These paintings celebrated the accomplishments of the workers who helped build the nation. Many of the murals can still be seen in public buildings today.
Photographers also benefited from federal arts programs. The Resettlement and Farm Security Administration (FSA) sought to document the plight of America’s farmers. Roosevelt’s top aide, Rexford Tugwell, told the head of the FSA, "Show the city people what it’s like to live on the farm.” Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange were among the FSA photographers who created powerful images of impoverished farmers and migrant workers, including Lange’s famous photo “Migrant Mother."

Some members of Congress warned of negative impacts of the Federal Art, Writers’ and Theatre programs, fearing that they promoted radical values. Congressman J. Parnell Thomas described the Federal Writers’ and Theatre projects as “a hotbed for Communists.” Eleanor Roosevelt and others defended the programs on the grounds that they did not “believe in censoring anything.” Nonetheless, congressional support for the programs declined. Although the Federal Art, Writers’ and Theatre programs ceased to exist in the late 1930s and early 1940s, they set a precedent for further federal funding of the arts and humanities in the 1960s.

The Depression Era
Reflected in Literature
The literature of the 1920s, from authors such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, sometimes overshadows the literature of the 1930s. Still, the depression era produced some memorable works in multiple genres of literature that reflected some of the issues and characteristics of their unique time.
American Society Under the Microscope During the depression, many writers drifted to the left and crafted novels featuring working-class heroes. They believed that the American economic system no longer worked and they blamed this failure on political and business leaders. Many artists of the 1930s saw “ordinary Americans” as the best hope for a better day.
The most famous novel of the 1930s was John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath. Steinbeck follows the fictional Joad family from their home in Oklahoma, which has been ravaged by Dust Bowl conditions, to California, where they hope to build a better life. But instead of the Promised Land, the Joads encounter exploitation, disease, hunger, and political corruption.
African American writers captured the special plight of blacks, facing both the depression and continuing prejudice. Richard Wright’s Native Son explored racial prejudice in a northern urban setting. Wright was an outspoken critic of racial discrimination.
» The Federal Art Project employed artists to create colorful murals—such as this one at the Coit Tower, in San Francisco, California—in buildings throughout the nation.
» Like many other authors of the 1930s, John Steinbeck, author of The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men, wrote works that focused on the struggles of America’s poor and working class.

Playwrights Champion Women and the Working Class In New York, some important playwrights had their first successes during the New Deal period. Lillian Heilman, a New Orleans native, wrote several plays featuring strong roles for women. Heilman’s plays The Children's Hour, The Little Foxes, and Watch on the Rhine are also notable for their socially conscious subject matter that reflected some controversial issues of the time.
Clifford Odets was another dramatist who achieved prominence in the 1930s. His plays Waiting for Lefty and Awake and Sing! chronicle the struggles of the working class during the Great Depression.
Comics Entertain and Inspire On a lighter note, many Americans devoured comic strips and comic books during the 1930s. Among the most popular comic strips were Flash Gordon, a science-fiction saga; Dick Tracy, a detective story; and Superman, the first great “superhero" comic. The success of Superman, which began in 1938, quickly led to a radio show and later to a popular television series and several feature films. Superman reassured Americans that ordinary citizens, like mild-mannered Clark Kent, could overcome evil.

Why would mass meetings and marches be important in a totalitarian state?
|roj Interactive Flipped Video
The effects of World War I and the Great Depression touched almost every corner of the world. In some countries, these upheavals led to the rise of a new kind of brutal dictatorship—the totalitarian state. These states were led by absolute dictators, leaders willing to use acts of aggression to invade other nations in order to enhance their own power. Their actions would destroy the peace established after World War I and spark a new, even deadlier, global conflict.

In November 1918, World War I ended when Germany surrendered to the Allies. In 1919, delegates from 27 nations met in Versailles to hammer out a peace agreement, but only Britain, France, and the United States had a real say in most of the important decisions. Germany and Russia were not even present. From the first, many Germans resented the resulting Treaty of Versailles. Other nations also grumbled over the peace settlements.
Italy and Japan, both World War I Allies, had expected far more land for their sacrifices. The war that American President Woodrow Wilson had called “a war to end all wars" had left behind a mountain of bitterness, anger, frustration, and despair, often capped by a burning desire for revenge.
During the 1920s many nations, new and old, moved steadily toward democracy and freedom. Others, however, took the opposite direction, embracing repressive dictatorships and totalitarianism, a government in which a single party or leader controls the economic, social, and cultural lives of its people. Throughout history there have been dictatorships, countries ruled by one person or small groups of people. But totalitarianism, emerging as a twentieth-century

phenomenon, controls all aspects of life. It is more extreme than a simple dictatorship. At the head of the government is a strong, charismatic leader who uses terror, spies, and police force to impose the will of the state upon the citizens. Unlike democracies, people living in totalitarian states have no individual rights. The government controls the media and uses propaganda to indoctrinate people. Schools and youth organizations foster the state ideology. The government crushes opposition and censors any political rivals or divergent ideas.
Why did totalitarian regimes take hold in the years leading up to World War II? Historians lay much of the blame on the destruction and bitterness left behind by World War I and the desperation caused by the Great Depression.
B PREDICT CONSEQUENCES
How do you think totalitarian regimes will affect the peace following World War I?
Strict Regimes in the
Soviet Union and Italy
The 1917 communist revolution in Russia inaugurated the first totalitarian state. The communist leader Vladimir Lenin created the beginnings of a totalitarian system of control to maintain power. His programs resulted in civil war, starvation, famine, and the death of millions of Russians.
Stalin Rules the Soviet Union After Lenin’s death in 1924, Joseph Stalin took Lenin's place as the head of the Communist Party. In Russian, Stalin means "man of steel,” and it is an apt description of the dictator’s personality. Stalin was suspicious, cruel, ruthless, and tyrannical. He did not think twice about killing rivals or sentencing innocent people to death. His efforts to transform the Soviet Union into an industrial power and form state-run collective farms resulted in the deaths of at least 10 million people.
In what became known as the Great Terror, Stalin purged the Communist Party of real or suspected traitors in the 1930s, ordering the deaths or imprisonment of up to a million people. The purge also included most of the higher officers of the Red Army, among many others. Political prisoners and criminals were sent to dreaded forced labor camps, known as the Gulag.
A combination of fear and massive propaganda kept Stalin in power. Publicity about Stalin was designed to create an idol, encouraging a cult of personality in which he was credited for all good things. In newspapers, billboards, and schools, the public was

fed a constant diet of communist success. Soviet art was censored; only positive images of Stalin and soviet life were permitted. Images showing Stalin as a kindly father figure masked the reality of labor camps and the consequences of any resistance to his rule.
Mussolini Establishes an Italian Dictatorship
Italian totalitarianism was in many ways a direct result of World War I and the peace treaties that ended it.
Although Italy was on the winning side, it did not get the land along the Adriatic coast it had hoped to obtain from the division of Austria-Hungary. Added to this frustration, the postwar economic depression made it difficult for returning veterans to find jobs. The country began to tumble into chaos. The communist movement grew. Peasants began seizing land and workers went on strike or took over control of factories. Trade declined and taxes increased. New immigration laws limited immigration to the United States. Law and order broke down as competing groups fought each other in the streets. The government, weak and inept, was unable to restore stability.
It was during this period that Benito Mussolini entered the world stage. In 1919, Mussolini founded the Fasci di Combattimento (fah shee dee kohm ba tee MEHN toh), or Fascist Party, a right-wing organization that promised to restore efficiency and order and make Italy great again. Fascism appealed to many looking for strong leadership and restored national pride. Followers of Mussolini, known as Black Shirts, fought in the streets against socialists and communists.
Fearing revolution, in 1922 Italian King Victor Emmanuel III asked Mussolini to form a government. Calling himself II Duce (ihl DOO chay), or “the leader," Mussolini consolidated his control over the government and the army within a few years. He outlawed political parties, took over the press, created a secret police, organized youth groups to indoctrinate the young, and suppressed strikes. He opposed liberalism and socialism. Still, his hold over Italy was never as powerful as Stalin’s grip on the Soviet Union.
H COMPARE AND CONTRAST
What did Stalin and Mussolini have in common? In what ways did they differ?
Germany and Japan Change Leadership
After World War I, Germany became a democracy. The Weimar (vi mahr) Republic (named after the town of Weimar where the government was created) struggled throughout the 1920s to establish a functional
World War II 362	6.1 Rise of Aggressive Dictators
democracy. However, Germany was beset by severe economic troubles in the 1920s, including runaway inflation. Anger over the Treaty of Versailles and internal disunity also plagued the young government. The Weimar Republic’s ship of state was slowly sinking.
Emergence of Nazis In the early 1930s, the worldwide Great Depression hit the Weimar Republic hard, worsening the problems that already existed. Increasingly, antidemocratic parties on the right, especially the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, or Nazi (naht see) Party, threatened the republic.
Regardless of the party's name, Nazis were not socialists. They bitterly opposed socialism, communism, or any other ism that promoted class interests or workers’ rights above German ethnic solidarity. Adolf Hitler led the Nazi Party. The son of a minor Austrian civil servant, Hitler was a failed artist, a wounded and decorated World War I soldier, and a person who teetered on the brink of madness.
Hitler joined the small Nazi Party after the war and soon gained control of it. While in prison after the party attempted a rebellion, Hitler dictated the book Mein Kampf (“My Struggle”), in which he stated his explanations for the problems facing Germany. He criticized many people, political programs, and ideologies, but his sharpest assaults were against communists and Jews. Hitler was violently anti-Semitic, or prejudiced against Jewish people.
Anti-Semitism had troubled Europe for centuries, mainly motivated by religious intolerance and economic resentment. In the late nineteenth century, new pseudo-scientific theories about Jews as a race, along with the rise of nationalism, caused Jews to be marginalized as ethnic outsiders. Hitler believed and spread this type of thinking. He preached that the greatest threat confronting Germany was the Jewish people who lived there. In Mein Kampf, which quickly became a national bestseller, Hitler presented a blueprint of his hatreds and plans for world domination.
Hitler Rules a German Dictatorship The
shattered German economy—with its widespread unemployment, homelessness, and hunger—played into the Nazis’ hands as they promised that Germany would rise again from the quagmire of reparations and the economic depression. Recognizing the power of Hitler’s party, in January 1933 the president of the Weimar Republic appointed Hitler chancellor of Germany. Over the next two years, Hitler became president as well as chancellor, consolidated his power, and ruled unchecked by the Reichstag (riks tahg), or the German parliament.
» Inflation ruined the Weimar Republic. Presses ran day and night printing paper money. By 1923, one dollar was equal to one trillion Marks. Here children play with stacks of worthless money.
» Both civilians and military personnel welcomed Hitler to a rally in Nuremberg, 1933. Rallies were held yearly as grand propaganda events lasting several days.

World War II 363	6.1 Rise of Aggressive Dictators
By 1935, the democratic institutions of the Weimar Republic were silenced, and Hitler spoke alone as the voice of Germany. Like Stalin and Mussolini, Hitler was the symbol of his totalitarian regime. Aided by a secret police that crushed all opposition, a state-controlled press that praised his accomplishments, and a state-controlled educational system that indoctrinated the young, Hitler assumed a godlike aura.
By the late 1930s, Hitler’s economic policies, including rearmament and massive public-works projects, had ended the depression in Germany. Many Germans followed his lead and cheered for him at Nazi rallies. For many, his promises came true. "Once Hitler came to power, it was wonderful. Everybody had a job and there weren't any more unemployed people,” remembered one German citizen.
However, Hitler’s leadership had dark undertones of oppression, based on extreme anti-Semitism and the rejection of democracy. Hitler maintained his power by alternately brainwashing the public with lies and propaganda drives or terrifying them into silence through ruthless violence.
He openly attacked Jewish people, communists, and socialists. Hitler rejected freedom for the people and defined his rule like so in a speech in 1937:
» Girls experienced military life by marching in formation. Students were taught obedience and self-sacrifice for the good of the nation.
For everyone has to obey orders. We have obeyed orders. . . . And I must demand this of every German: You, too, must be able to obey orders, . . .
We shall educate our People to do this and ignore the obstinacy or stupidity of individuals. Bend or break—one or the other. We cannot permit this authority, the authority of the German People, to be challenged...
—Adolf Hitler, May 1, 1937
Militarism Gains Support in Japan In Japan, as in Germany, the 1920s was a period of increased democracy and peaceful change. The Japanese government reduced the power of the military, passed laws to give all men the right to vote, legalized trade unions, and allowed several diverse political parties to be established. This period ended when the Great Depression discredited Japan’s civilian leaders in the 1930s.
Reasserting their traditional powers, military leaders argued that expansion throughout Asia would gain natural resources and new markets. This would solve Japan’s economic troubles and guarantee future security. Throughout the 1930s, the military played a significant role in shaping Japanese civilian and military policy. Japan, however, did not become a true totalitarian dictatorship. No charismatic leader like Stalin or Hitler emerged. Japan continued as a nominal constitutional monarchy headed by a mainly aloof emperor, but with the military high command assuming dictatorship-like powers over the masses. As with Germany and Italy, Japanese military leaders had strong control over the life of the people and ended many democratic freedoms. Opposition was suppressed, media was censored, and schools instilled obedience to the nation.
The Japanese Empire Expands As the power shifted toward military control, Japan started on a course of aggressive military expansion. Extreme nationalists encouraged Japanese domination of the region. In 1931, Japan attacked Manchuria (man CHUR ee uh), a region in northeastern China, and established a puppet state. The new nation was named Manchukuo (man choo kwoh). Japan controlled its domestic and foreign policies, as well as its abundant natural resources. In 1937, Japan moved against China, gaining control over major Chinese railroad links and coastal areas. In the then capital city of Nanjing, Japanese soldiers acted

B IDENTIFY CAUSE AND EFFECT
How did the Great Depression affect political life in Germany and Japan?
Dictators Move to Gain Territory
In the 1930s, the Italian and German dictatorships resorted to acts of aggression similar to those of Japan in Asia. Throughout the decade, neither the League of Nations nor democratic nations succeeded in stopping the aggression. It was a time that recalled a line from Irish poet William Butler Yeats: "The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity.”
Weakness of the League of Nations In many ways, the League of Nations never recovered from America’s refusal to join it. The League was also handicapped by its own charter.
It had no standing army and no real power to enforce its decrees. It was only as strong as its members’ resolve, and during the worldwide depression of the 1930s, those members lacked resolve. When aggressive
nations began to test the League, they discovered that the organization was long on words and short on action.
Hitler and Mussolini Challenge the Peace From the first, Hitler focused on restoring Germany’s strength and nullifying the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. From 1933 to 1936, he rebuilt the German economy and dramatically enlarged the army, navy, and air force in direct defiance of the Treaty of Versailles. In the mid-1930s, Hitler began to move toward his goal of reunifying all Germanic people into one Reich, or state. He spoke often of the need for Germany to expand to gain Lebensraum (lay buhns rowm), or living space, for its people. In 1935, he reclaimed the Saar (sahr) region from French control.
In 1936, in another direct challenge to the League, Hitler sent German troops into the Rhineland. This region was part of western Germany and under German political control.
However, under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, it was demilitarized; Germany was forbidden to have troops in the region. Reoccupation was a test. Would France or the League defend the terms of the Treaty? The answer was no. To all these actions, the League failed to respond.
Meanwhile, Mussolini commenced his own imperial plans. In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia, an independent country in east Africa. Its emperor, Haile Selassie (Hi

Dictators Support War in Spain Fascists were also victorious in a bloody conflict that raged from 1936 until 1939, know as the Spanish Civil War. The Nationalists, who had fascist tendencies, rebelled against Spain’s democratic Republican government.
Both Hitler and Mussolini sent military and economic aid to the Nationalist leader, General Francisco Franco, using the conflict to test some of their new military technology. Though the Soviet Union provided some support for the Republican side, France, Britain, and the United States remained largely on the sidelines, deploring the bloodshed but refusing to provide weapons to the Republican forces.
H EXPRESS PROBLEMS CLEARLY
Why did the League of Nations fail to halt German and Italian aggression?
Aggression Meets
Appeasement
The policy that France and Britain pursued against aggressive nations during the 1930s is known as appeasement. It is a policy of granting concessions to a potential enemy in the hope that peace can be maintained. Unfortunately, appeasement only spurred the fascist leaders to become more bold, adventurous, and aggressive.
Why did France and Britain appease the fascist powers? There were a number of reasons. World War I was so horrible that some leaders vowed never to allow another such war to break out. Other leaders believed that the Soviet Union posed a greater threat than Nazi Germany. They maintained that a strong Germany would provide a buffer against the Soviet menace. Still other leaders questioned the resolve of their own people and their allies—particularly the United States.
The United States played an important role in this appeasement policy. Worried about the rise of dictatorships in Europe and Asia, Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted to mend fences with America’s neighbors. In the 1930s, he pursued a Good Neighbor policy with Latin American nations. The program emphasized trade and cooperation, not military force, as the basis for a stable relationship with Latin American nations. The United States withdrew troops from several nations. It agreed not to intervene in Latin America and to consult with other nations if faced with danger. Roosevelt also improved relations with

the Soviet Union by restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet government, although he remained wary about allying too closely with the communist nation. However, he did not take a forceful line against German aggression. Instead, the country concerned itself with its own economic troubles and embraced a policy of isolationism.
Hitler took advantage of the lack of commitment and unity among France, Britain, and the United States. In the spring of 1938, he brought Austria into his Reich.
Austria was given little choice but to accept this union, called the Anschluss (ahn shloos). In the fall, Hitler turned toward the Sudetenland, a portion of western Czechoslovakia that was largely populated by ethnic Germans.
Many people expected the conflict over the Sudetenland to lead to a general war. But once again, Britain and France appeased Germany. At the Munich Conference with Hitler, British prime minister Neville Chamberlain and French premier Edouard Daladier sacrificed the Sudetenland to preserve the peace. On his return to London, Chamberlain told a cheering crowd that the Munich Pact (myoo nihk), the agreement reached at the conference, had preserved "peace for our time.’’ He was wrong. It merely postponed the war for 11 months.

Roosevelt Criticizes Acts of War
The unrestrained, violence of the 1937 Japanese attack on China shocked Americans, even before the notorious Rape of Nanjing in December 1937. Japan attacked without a declaration of war. Its planes rained terror on Chinese cities, especially Shanghai and Nanjing. The Japanese had even killed three American sailors when Japanese warplanes sank the United States gunboat Panay on the Chang River.
In the midst of these bloody events, President Franklin Roosevelt criticized Japan’s aggression in a speech in Chicago on October 5,1937. He lamented the “reign of terror and international lawlessness,” the bombing of civilian populations, and the horrible acts of cruelty. Speaking in a city where American isolationist sentiments were strong, Roosevelt suggested that no part of the world was truly isolated from the rest of the world. He warned:

We are determined to keep out of war,
yet we cannot insure ourselves against
the disastrous effects of war and the
dangers of involvement.
—President Franklin Roosevelt, Quarantine speech, October 5, 1937
Roosevelt’s solution for stopping aggression involved an informal alliance of the peace-loving nations, but he did not suggest what steps the peaceful nations should take in quarantining the aggressive ones. Americans, unhappy with the failure of World War I to make the “world safe for democracy,” were not ready for another attempt at peacekeeping in Europe.
Roosevelt’s speech was widely criticized, and for a time, the President backed away from his more interventionist stance. “It’s a terrible thing to look over your shoulder when you are trying to lead—and find no one there.” Roosevelt remarked to a speechwriter. The speech did, however, alert some Americans to the threat Japan posed to the United States.
INTERPRET
Why do you think Roosevelt compared war to a disease in his Quarantine speech?
War Breaks Out in Europe
Roosevelt’s words failed to prevent Japan from extending its control over much of China. Similarly, France and Britain’s efforts to appease Hitler in Europe failed to limit the dictator’s expansionist plans. By the end of 1938, even the leaders of France and Britain realized that Hitler’s armed aggression could only be halted by a firm, armed defense. The urgency of the situation grew in the spring of 1939 when Hitler violated the Munich Pact by absorbing the remainder of Czechoslovakia into his German Reich.
Hitler was open about his view of war and conquest. He believed that there was no morality in war, only victory and defeat. Just one month before the attack on Poland, he instructed his generals to be ruthless and merciless. “When starting and waging a war it is not right that matters, but victory. Close your hearts to pity. Act brutally. Eighty million people [Germans] must obtain what is their right. . . . The stronger man is right.”

Poland Falls to German Blitzkrieg Finally, British and French leaders saw the need to take action. They vowed not to let Hitler take over another country without consequences. Poland seemed the next likely target for Hitler, so Britain and France signed an alliance with Poland, guaranteeing aid to the Poles if Hitler attacked.
Hitler, however, was more concerned about war with the Soviet Union than with Britain and France. Not wanting to fight a war on two fronts, Germany signed the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact with the Soviets on August 23, 1939. The two former rivals publicly promised not to attack one another. Secretly, they agreed to invade and divide Poland and recognize each other’s territorial ambitions. The public agreement alone shocked the West and guaranteed a German offensive against Poland.
A new world war that would be a turning point in world history came to Europe in the early hours of September 1,1939, when a massive German blitzkrieg (blihts kreeg), or sudden attack, hit Poland by surprise from three directions. Blitzkrieg means "lightning war.”
It was a relatively new style of warfare that emphasized the use of speed and firepower to penetrate deep into the enemy’s territory. The newest military technologies made it devastatingly effective. Using a coordinated assault by tanks and planes, followed
by motorized vehicles and infantry, Germany broke through Poland’s defenses and destroyed its air force.
The situation became even more hopeless on September 17 when the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east, taking control of the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania soon after. Although France and Britain declared war against Germany, they did nothing to help save Poland. By the end of the month, a devastated Poland fell in defeat.
Axis Powers Overwhelm Western Europe Europe was at war, just as it had been 21 years earlier. The Axis Powers eventually included Germany, Italy, Japan, and several other nations. The Allies included Britain, France, and eventually many other nations, including the Soviet Union, the United States, and China.
But after the Polish campaign, the war entered an eight-month period of relative quiet, known in Britain as the “phony war.” Things would not remain quiet for long, however.
The next storm erupted with raging fury in the spring of 1940. Germany’s nonaggression pact with the Soviet Union freed Hitler to send his army west. On April 9,1940, Germany attacked Denmark and Norway. The two countries fell almost immediately. On May 10, he sent his blitzkrieg forces into the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The small nations fell like

tumbling dominoes. Hitler seemed invincible; his army unstoppable.
France Falls Hitler next set his sights on France. France had prepared for Germany’s invasion by constructing an interconnected series of fortresses known as the Maginot Line along its border with Germany. Additionally, France had stationed its finest armies along its border with Belgium—the route that Germany had used to attack France in 1914. In between the Maginot Line and Belgium lay the Ardennes, a hilly, forested area that military experts considered invasion proof.
But once again the military experts were wrong. In early May 1940, German tanks rolled through the Ardennes, ripped a hole in the thin French line there, and raced north toward the English Channel. The German plan involved attacking the French and British forces from the front and the rear and trapping them against the channel. It almost worked. Only a few tactical German mistakes gave Britain enough time to evacuate its forces from the French port of Dunkirk. Some 338,000 British and French troops escaped to Britain. Had they not escaped, it is doubtful if Britain, with 70 percent of its troops at Dunkirk, could have remained in the war.
The Miracle of Dunkirk was a proud moment for Britain, but as the new prime minister Winston Churchill cautioned Parliament, “wars are not won by evacuations.” Although the British army escaped, the Germans took Paris and forced the French to surrender in the same railway car that the French had used for the German surrender in 1918. France was then divided into two sections: a larger northern section controlled by the Germans and known as Occupied France, and a smaller southern section administered by the French and known as Unoccupied France, or Vichy France, after its capital city. Although Vichy France was officially neutral, it collaborated with the Nazis.
Air Forces Fight Battle of Britain France had fallen to Hitler in just 35 days. Hitler next turned his fury on Britain. After the evacuation at Dunkirk, Churchill made it clear that he had no intention of continuing the policy of appeasement. He told his nation:
We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall

fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.
—Winston Churchill, June 4, 1940
Churchill's words stirred his nation as the British readied themselves for battle.
Hitler’s plan to invade Britain, codenamed Operation Sea Lion, depended upon Germany’s Luftwaffe, or air force, destroying the British Royal Air Force and gaining control over the skies above the English Channel. The Battle of Britain, then, was an air battle, fought over the English Channel and Great Britain. It began in July 1940. The British lost nearly 1,000 planes, the Germans more than 1,700. Germany bombed civilian as well as military targets, destroying houses, factories, and churches and conducted a months-long bombing campaign against London itself, known as "the blitz.” But the British held on and, sensing failure, Hitler made a tactical decision to postpone the invasion of Britain indefinitely.

American Reaction Is Divided
Winston Churchill referred to the United States in many of his speeches during the crisis in France and the Battle of Britain. The fight against Hitler, Churchill implied, was more than simply a European struggle. Nazi aggression threatened the freedoms and rights cherished by democratic nations everywhere. The contest was between ideologies as well as nations.
Public Opinion Supports Isolation President Roosevelt shared Churchill’s concerns, but at the beginning of the war in Europe he understood that the majority of Americans opposed U.S. intervention.
The severe economic crisis of the Great Depression had served to pin the nation’s attention firmly on domestic affairs throughout the 1930s. In addition, many believed that U.S. involvement in World War I had been a deadly, expensive mistake. The rise of fascism in Europe made the sacrifices of World War I seem even more pointless.
In the 1930s, numerous books and articles presented a new theory about why the United States had become involved in World War I that disturbed many Americans. The theory held that big business had conspired to

enter the war in order to make huge fortunes selling weapons. In 1934, a senate committee chaired by Gerald Nye of South Dakota looked into the question. Although the Nye Committee discovered little hard evidence, its findings suggested that “merchants of death”—American bankers and arms manufacturers— had indeed pulled the United States into World War I. The committee’s findings further reinforced isolationist sentiments.
In order to avoid making the "mistakes” that had led to U.S. involvement in World War I, Congress passed the Neutrality Acts of 1935, 1936, and 1937. The acts imposed certain restrictions on Americans during times of war. For example, Americans were prohibited from sailing on ships owned by belligerents or nations at war. The acts also prevented Americans from making loans to belligerents or selling them arms and munitions. The acts did not distinguish between aggressors like Germany and Italy and victims like Poland, or their allies, France and Britain.
Interventionists Press for Aid to Allies Once war began in Europe, Roosevelt felt confined by the limitations of the Neutrality Acts. Though he issued a proclamation of American neutrality, he was firmly anti-Nazi and wanted to aid the democracies of Europe. In the end, Congress agreed and passed the Neutrality Act of 1939, which included a cash-and-carry provision. This provision allowed belligerent nations to buy goods and arms in the United States if they paid cash and carried the merchandise on their own ships. Since the British navy controlled the seas, cash-and-carry in effect aided the Allies.
Many Americans disagreed with Roosevelt’s openly pro-Allies position. They argued that FDR’s policies violated American neutrality and threatened to push the United States into the war. Between early 1940 and late 1941, a great debate raged in America between isolationists and interventionists. The debate became particularly heated after the fall of France left Britain standing by itself in Europe against Germany. Interventionist organizations such as the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies claimed that Britain was fighting for free countries everywhere. Sending aid to Britain was a way for America to stay out of the conflict.
Isolationists Plead to Remain Neutral Isolationists countered by claiming that giving aid to the Allies was automatically harming the Axis and would culminate with the United States entering the conflict. They argued that the only way to keep America safe was to follow a policy of complete neutrality. The America First Committee, an isolationist group, held rallies and

sponsored speeches that criticized Roosevelt’s openly pro-British policies. Charles Lindbergh became the leading isolationist voice.
Lindbergh believed that the real threats to America were the Soviet Union and Japan, and he did not want to see his country weaken itself fighting in Western Europe to save Britain. “We must band together to prevent the loss of more American lives in these internal struggles of Europe. . . . Our safety does not lie in fighting European wars. It lies in our own internal strength, in the character of the American people and of American institutions.” Lindbergh’s addresses were measured and clear. He appealed to Americans’ minds but not their hearts.
Roosevelt Shifts Closer to Involvement Events in Europe shocked Americans out of strict neutrality. Reports by Edward R. Murrow, a CBS reporter stationed in London, during the blitz brought the war into American living rooms. His frequent live radio reports, which began with the words "This is London,” emphasized that the Germans were bombing not armies or military sites but civilians—grandparents, parents, and children.
These reports and the turn of events in Europe against the Allies convinced many Americans that

» With the fall of France, more Americans began to accept the inevitability of U.S. involvement in the war. There was little public resistance to the first peacetime draft.
the United States needed to at least prepare to defend itself.
Shortly after the fall of France in September 1940, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the Tripartite Pact and became allies. In that same month, after a heated debate between isolationists and interventionists, Congress passed a Selective Service Act—a peacetime draft—providing for the military training of 1.2 million troops and 800,000 reserve troops each year.
At the same time, President Roosevelt took an additional step to strengthen Britain. He gave Britain fifty World War I-era destroyers in exchange for eight British defense bases. Britain needed the ships to convoy goods across the Atlantic. Believing the act to be an emergency measure, Roosevelt made the transfer without the consent of Congress.
The American people evaluated FDR’s leadership the next month in the presidential election. Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented third term against Republican nominee Wendell L. Willkie of Indiana. Willkie was critical of FDR’s handling of both the economy and foreign affairs but not of the President’s basic positions on either.
Given such little differences between candidates, Americans voted overwhelmingly not to change leaders in the middle of a crisis.

IDENTIFY CENTRAL ISSUES
What were the main arguments in the debate between isolationists and interventionists?
America Moves Closer Toward War
Once safely reelected, President Roosevelt increased his support of Britain. When Britain began to run short on funds to purchase cash-and-carry goods in the United States, FDR took the opportunity to address Congress. On January 6, 1941, he spoke about “four freedoms"—freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear—that were threatened by Nazi and Japanese militarism. Roosevelt believed that the best way to stay out of the conflict with Germany was to aid Britain.
The United States Helps the Allies With the Lend-Lease Act Roosevelt compared America’s situation to the scenario of a fire in a neighbor's home. If a neighbor asked to borrow your fire hose to put out the fire, you would not debate the issue or try to sell the hose. Extending help was both being a good neighbor and acting to keep the fire from spreading to your own home.

» Analyze Charts How much Lend-Lease aid did the United States give the Allies by the end of 1941? Why did the United States give more aid to the British Empire than to the Soviet Union?
Britain, Roosevelt said, needed American aid, and it had run out of money to pay for it. The President called for America to become "the great arsenal for democracy.” Once again, America answered Britain’s plea for help. In March 1941, Congress approved the Lend-Lease Act, symbolically numbered 1776, after another heated debate between isolationists and interventionists.
The act authorized Roosevelt to “sell, transfer title to, exchange, lease, lend, or otherwise dispose of, to any such government any defense article" whenever he thought it was “necessary in the interests of the defense of the United States." By 1945, the United States had sent more than $40 billion of Lend-Lease aid to the Allies, including the Soviet Union. The Lend-Lease Act was nothing less than an economic declaration of war against Germany and the Axis Powers.
The Atlantic Charter Outlines Mutual Goals In
August 1941, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met secretly on a warship off the misty coast of Newfoundland.
They discussed their mutual war aims, the first being strategy: Their priority was the defeat of Germany, then Japan. They talked not only about Britain’s problems in the war but also about their hopes for the world after Hitler’s defeat. There would be no conquests made in subjugated territories. On board the ship they signed the Atlantic Charter, a document
that endorsed national self-determination and an international system of “general security.”
The signing of the Atlantic Charter signaled the deepening alliance between the two nations and the full moral support of United States to Britain. The meeting with Churchill and the Atlantic Charter showed Roosevelt’s international leadership in coordinating the U.S. relationship with its allies. The charter also cast the conflict in moral terms with the Allies dedicated to freedom in contrast to domination by totalitarian dictatorships.
U.S,
Navy Battles German U-Boats Hitler was not blind to America’s actions in support of the Allies. Nor did he fail to notice the fact that the United States had begun to escort arms shipments to Iceland, where the British picked them up and transported them to England. In the fall of 1941, he ordered his German U-boats, or submarines, to attack American ships. The U-boats shot at the USS Greer, hit the USS Kearny, and sunk the USS Reuben James, killing more than a hundred sailors. The attacks shocked and angered Americans, moving them closer to declaring war on Germany. Though the United States was still officially a neutral nation, Roosevelt gave orders to the navy to attack German U-boats on sight. In June 1941, Germany had gone to

Japan Attacks the United States
Although Japan and the United States had been allies in World War I, conflict over power in Asia and the Pacific had been brewing between the two nations for decades prior to 1941. Japan, as the area’s industrial and economic leader, resented any threats to its authority in the region. The presence of the United States in Guam and the Philippines posed such a threat. The United States also supported China in its ongoing struggle with Japan by sending aid and providing military advice. Still Japan relied on trade with the United States to supply much-needed natural resources.
U.S.
Involvement in the Pacific Grows As war broke out in Europe, the Japanese Empire continued to grow in China and began to move into Indochina. In July of 1940, President Roosevelt tried to stop this expansion by placing an embargo on important naval and aviation supplies to Japan, such as oil, iron ore, fuel, steel, and rubber. After Japan signed the Tripartite Pact in September of 1940 with Germany and Italy, FDR instituted a more extensive embargo. The embargo slowed, but did not stop, Japanese expansion as the Japanese

I saw more planes coming in, passing over Battleship Row dropping bombs. I remember very clearly what looked like a dive-bomber coming in over the Arizona and dropping a bomb.
I saw that bomb go down through what looked like a stack, and almost instantly it cracked the bottom of the Arizona, blowing the whole bow loose. It rose out of the water and settled.
I could see flames, fire, and smoke coming out of that ship, and I saw two men flying through the air and the fire, screaming as they went.

were able to secure the resources they needed within their new possessions.
In 1941, General Hideki Tojo (hi dehk ee toh joh) became the Japanese prime minister. Known as “the Razor” for his sharp mind, he focused intently on military expansion but sought to keep the United States neutral. Throughout the summer of 1941, Japan and the United States attempted to negotiate an end to their disagreement, but with little success. Japan was bent on further expansion, and the United States was firmly against it. Finally, in late November 1941, Cordell Hull, the U.S. Secretary of State, rejected Japan’s latest demands.
Diplomatic relations continued for the next week, but Tojo had given up on peace. By early December he had made the decision to deliver a decisive first blow against the United States.
The Attack on Pearl Harbor As
Japanese diplomats wrangled in the U.S. capital, Japan’s navy sailed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the site of the United States Navy’s main Pacific base. The forces that Tojo sent from Japan under the command of Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (joo ee chee nah goo moh) included 6 aircraft carriers, 360 airplanes, an assortment of battleships and cruisers, and a number of submarines. Their mission was to eradicate the American naval and air presence in the Pacific with a surprise attack. Such a blow would prevent Americans from mounting a strong resistance to Japanese expansion.
The attackers struck with devastating power, taking the American forces completely by surprise.
The Aftermath of the Attack The
Americans suffered heavy losses: nearly 2,500 people killed, 8 battleships severely damaged, 3 destroyers left unusable, 3 light cruisers damaged, and 160 aircraft destroyed and 128 more damaged. The U.S. battle fleet was out of commission for nearly six months, allowing the Japanese to access the raw materials of their newly-conquered territories, just as they had planned.
World War II 378	6.3 The United States Enters World War II
Despite these losses, the situation was not as bad as it could have been. The most important ships—aircraft carriers—were out at sea at the time of the attack and survived untouched. In addition, seven heavy cruisers were also out at sea. Of the battleships in Pearl Harbor, only three—the USS Arizona, the USS Oklahoma, and the USS Utah —suffered irreparable damage. American submarine bases also survived the morning, as did important fuel supplies and maintenance facilities.
In the final analysis, Nagumo proved too conservative. He canceled a third wave of bombers and refused to seek out the aircraft carriers. The American Pacific Fleet survived.
Roosevelt Declares War The attack on Pearl Harbor was a turning point for the United States. The Japanese dictatorship’s aggression, culminating in the attack on Pearl Harbor, was a compelling reason for the United States to enter the war.
As the news spread across the nation and FDR prepared to address Congress, Americans rallied together. Many did not know what to expect, but they anticipated monumental changes. Journalist Marquis Child recalled thinking, “Nothing will ever be the same," and added, “it never was the same.”
The smoke rising from Pearl Harbor left little doubt in anyone's mind about the necessity of declaring war on Japan. Earlier in 1941, further qualms about supporting the Allies had risen when Stalin’s Soviet Union joined their ranks. The Soviet Union became one of the Allies when Germany went back on the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact and invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Although the alliance with the Soviet Union would continue to be an uneasy one, Pearl Harbor finally ended the political divisions between isolationists and interventionists.
On December 8, President Roosevelt gave a speech to Congress asking for a declaration of war:
Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy— the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. . . . The facts of yesterday speak for themselves. The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation. . . .

—President Franklin Roosevelt, Message Asking for War Against Japan, December 8. 1941
After President Roosevelt’s speech, the House voted 388 to 1 to declare war against Japan, and the Senate joined them unanimously. True to their military commitments with Japan, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States. Congress in turn declared war on Germany and Italy.
The United States became a full ally with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union against the Axis Powers. Democrats and Republicans put aside their political differences to unify the nation as it faced the task of winning a war on multiple fronts.

Patriotism Inspires Rapid Mobilization
Following the Japanese attack, a spirit of patriotism and service swept across the country, inspiring exceptional actions by military personnel and civilians alike. Americans searched for ways to contribute to the war effort. They joined the military, volunteered with the Red Cross and other organizations, and moved into new jobs to help.
High Levels of Enlistment in the Military The
military draft was already in place under the Selective Service Act of 1940. After Pearl Harbor, however, men rushed to volunteer for the various branches of the armed forces. In all, 38.8 percent of those who served in the military volunteered, with the remaining 61.2 percent responding to the draft.
Organizing and prioritizing the needs of the military was a massive job. As army chief of staff, General George Marshall directed the military buildup, from coordinating and training troops to overseeing the manufacturing and delivery of all the necessary supplies.
During the course of the war, more than 16 million Americans served in the military. From 1941 to 1942 alone, the army grew from about 1.4 million to more than 3 million, the navy increased from under 300,000 to more than 600,000, and the marines expanded from about 54,000 to almost 150,000.
Americans from all ethnic and racial backgrounds joined the fight. Approximately 300,000 Mexican
World War II 380	6.3 The United States Enters World War II
Americans and 25,000 Native Americans served in integrated units. Nearly one million African Americans also joined the military. At first, they were limited to supporting roles. However, the casualties mounted, and about 50,000 African Americans eventually served in combat units. In addition, many of those in service and support units played vital, dangerous roles in military operations such as the D-Day invasion and the Battle of the Bulge. A small number of African Americans eventually served in integrated units, but the military was not officially desegregated until after the war.
Despite the obstacles facing them, African Americans served patriotically and with distinction during the war.
Women Join the Fight Over 350,000 women also responded to the call. In 1941, Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers introduced a bill to establish a Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps. This group became the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) in 1943. The WAC was part of the regular army, not an auxiliary attachment, and women who served in it received the same benefits as men. More than 150,000 women volunteered for the service.
The WACs fulfilled important functions as clerical workers, truck drivers, instructors, and lab technicians for the United States Army. Over the course of the war, 15,000 WACs served abroad and over 600 received medals for their service. Around 100,000 American women joined the navy’s female corps and tens of thousands more joined similar marine and Coast Guard groups. More than 57,000 nurses served in the Army Nurse Corps, putting themselves in danger to care for the wounded in Europe and the Pacific.
FDR
Leads Domestic Industry’s Rapid Mobilization From the start, Roosevelt and the other Allied leaders knew that American production would play a key role in helping the Allies win the war. Although America’s industry had started to mobilize in response to the Lend-Lease Act, American production still needed to churn out war materials faster. In January 1942, FDR created the War Production Board (WPB) to oversee the conversion of peacetime industry to war industry. In his annual message to Congress, FDR encouraged the nation to meet high levels of production, saying “this production of ours in the United States must be raised far above its present levels . . . Let no man say it cannot be done. It must be done—and we have undertaken to do it." The WPB called for factories to convert to airplane, tank, or bomb production. Conversions started immediately, although the competing demands

of different industries and agencies for scarce resources caused much confusion.
Next, FDR and Congress created a host of other agencies that worked together to organize the production effort. Together, the agencies allocated scarce materials into the proper industries, regulated the production of civilian goods, established production contracts, negotiated with organized labor, and controlled inflation. The Office of War Mobilization (OWM) supervised all of these efforts.
FDR also reached out to business leaders, who as a group had often opposed his New Deal programs, to get their expertise at leading or advising several of these agencies. Called “Dollar-a-Year-Men,” many executives were paid little or nothing to come to Washington to help in the war effort.
The Production Miracle Under the direction of the government, Americans worked to create a “production miracle.” The massive defense spending finally ended the Great Depression. The unemployment rate fell from 19 percent in 1938 to just 1.2 percent in 1944. For the first time in more than a decade there was a job for almost every worker. Each year of the war, the United States raised its production goals for military materials, and each year it met these goals.
The Ford Motor Company poured all of its resources into war production, building over 8,000 B-24 Liberator bombers. Using an innovative assembly process, Henry J. Kaiser’s shipyards produced large merchant “Liberty Ships” in as little as three and a half days. In 1944, American production levels were double those of all the Axis nations put together. The success of American domestic industry’s rapid mobilization thus gave the Allies a crucial advantage, strengthening America and Roosevelt’s relationship with its allies. In a toast at a wartime conference, Allied leader Joseph Stalin praised American production: “To American production, without which the war would have been lost.”

trained and highly motivated military. At the start of the Pacific war, the outlook was grim for America.
Losses in the Philippines In December 1941, General Douglas MacArthur, commander of United States Army forces in East Asia, struggled to hold the U.S. positions in the Philippines with little support. The task grew even more daunting when the Japanese destroyed half of the army’s fighter planes in the region and rapidly took Guam (gwahm), Wake Island, and Hong Kong. The main land attack came on December 22.
With Japanese forces advancing on two sides, MacArthur and his troops fell back from Manila to the Bataan (buh tan) Peninsula and a fortification on Corregidor (kuh rehg uh dor) Island, where they dug in for a long siege. Trapped, the Allies suffered greatly, lacking necessary supplies and living on half and quarter rations.
Realizing that it was only a matter of time before the Allies were forced to surrender, Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to leave to take command of the army in the Southwest Pacific. MacArthur famously promised, "I shall return.” After MacArthur left on March 11, the remaining Allied forces held out on the Bataan Peninsula until early April, when about 70,000 troops surrendered.
Japanese troops forced the sick and malnourished prisoners of war to march more than 60 miles inland. More than 7,000 American and Filipino troops died on the grueling journey, which is known as the Bataan Death March. In early May 1942, the Allies lost the Philippines when the citadel on Corregidor surrendered. The long fight had slowed part of the Japanese advance for five months.
The Bataan Death March was against the rules set out in the Geneva Convention and other international agreements about the treatment of prisoners of war and wounded soldiers. It was not the first time that humane standards for the treatment of prisoners had been violated during the conflict, and it was far from the last.
Japan Advances Throughout the Pacific, Japanese forces attacked and conquered. These advances secured important oil and rubber supplies for Japan and brought Southeast Asia and the western Pacific securely under Japanese control. By the summer of 1942, Japan appeared ready to dominate the Indian Ocean, Australia, New Zealand, and the central Pacific. Japan’s strategy was to take over so much of the Pacific region that the Allies would be too discouraged to fight back. In May 1942, the Allies needed to regroup quickly to have any hope of victory in the Pacific.

The United States Strikes Back After Pearl Harbor, FDR wanted the United States to retaliate against Japan. American military leaders devised a plan for a nighttime bombing raid from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Hornet, led by Colonel James Doolittle. While still 800 miles away from mainland Japan, the Hornet was detected, so rather than wait for night, Doolittle led a force of 16 B-25 bombers against Tokyo. They delivered their payload on the Japanese capital just after noon.
The raid killed 50 Japanese people and damaged 100 buildings. The pilots then flew to China, where they crash-landed. Doolittle’s Raid proved a minimal military gain, but it bolstered American morale for the long fight ahead.
Another group that contributed bravely to the American cause was the American Volunteer Group, known as the Flying Tigers. Led by retired army captain Claire Chennault, the pilots volunteered to fight the Japanese in the Pacific in 1941, flying their missions out of Burma. Between December 1941 and July 1942, the Flying Tigers destroyed 296 Japanese aircraft in China and Burma.
The Battle of Coral Sea Halts the Advance The Battle of Coral Sea also helped to kindle hope for the American military in the Pacific. In early May 1942, the Japanese moved to take Port Moresby in New Guinea. From that position they could threaten Australia and protect their important military bases at Rabaul (also in New Guinea). To counter Japan's move, the United States sent two aircraft carriers, the USS Lexington and USS Yorktown, along with support vessels. On May 7 and 8, in the middle of a Pacific storm, Japanese and U.S. aircraft carriers engaged in battle. It was the first sea fight in which enemy warships never sighted one another. Instead, U.S. airplanes attacked Japanese ships and vice versa.
Although technically the Battle of Coral Sea proved a draw, strategically it was a victory for the United States because it forced the Japanese to call off their attack on New Guinea. It marked a shift in momentum toward the Americans. From that day on, the Pacific theater of battle would be won or lost on the strength of aircraft carriers and planes. Here the productive capacity of the United States gave Americans a marked advantage over their adversaries. The war would last three more years, but the dark days of early 1942 were over.

Allied Strategy
The Axis Powers never had a coordinated strategy to defeat the Allies. Germany, Italy, and Japan shared common enemies but had strategies that reflected their individual political and military goals. Hitler wanted to dominate Europe and eliminate “inferior” peoples. Mussolini had dreams of an Italian empire stretching from the eastern Adriatic to East Africa. Tojo sought Japanese control of the Western Pacific and Asia.
The Allies shared more unified goals, although they did not completely trust one another. Roosevelt and Churchill feared that Stalin wanted to dominate Europe.
Stalin believed that the West wanted to destroy communism. None of the Allies wanted to risk a breakdown in their alliance, however. Roosevelt worked closely with Churchill to manage the relationship with their powerful but problematic ally, Stalin.
Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin considered Germany the most dangerous enemy. None felt Japan or Italy posed a serious long-term threat. Only Germany had the resources to simultaneously bomb Britain, fight U.S. and British navies on the Atlantic, and invade the Soviet Union across a 1,200-mile front. Thus, although their ultimate goal was to fight and win a two-front war, Roosevelt and the other Allied leaders agreed to pursue a “Europe First” strategy. They would

BlNFERWhydo you think Churchill and Stalin favored
a Europe First strategy?
The European Front
The first blow America struck against the Axis was by fulfilling Roosevelt’s promise to be the “arsenal of democracy.” American factories turned out millions of tons of guns, tanks, and other supplies—enough to keep the Soviets and British battling Germany for years. The problem was delivering the weapons, food, and medical supplies that fueled the Allied war machine.
War in the Atlantic Hitler was determined to cut the supply lines between the United States and Europe before American aid could make a difference. German U-boats patrolled the Atlantic and Caribbean, sinking more than 3,500 merchant ships and killing tens of thousands of Allied seamen. "The only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril,” Churchill wrote.
Finally, in mid-1943, the Allies began to win the war in the North Atlantic. As in World War I, convoys of escort carriers protected Allied shipping.
A new invention, radar, helped Allied vessels locate U-boats on the surface at night. Bombers and underwater depth charges allowed Allied forces to sink U-boats faster than Germany could manufacture them.
Soviets and Nazis Battle for Stalingrad Germany had attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, sending one army north toward Leningrad, a second east toward Moscow, and a third south toward Stalingrad. Although Hitler’s forces pushed deep into Soviet territory, killing or capturing millions of soldiers and civilians, they did not achieve their main objective of conquering the Soviet Union. Soviet resistance and brutal winter weather stopped the German advance.
In 1942, Hitler narrowed his sights and concentrated his armies in the southern Soviet Union. His goal this time was to control the rich Caucasus oil fields. To achieve this objective, he would have to capture the city of Stalingrad.
The struggle for Stalingrad was especially ferocious. German troops advanced slowly, fighting bitter block-by-block, house-by-house battles in the bombed-out buildings and rubble.
Soviet troops then counterattacked, trapping the German forces. Yet Hitler refused to allow his army

to retreat. Starving, sick, and suffering from frostbite, the surviving German troops finally surrendered on January 31, 1943.
The battle of Stalingrad was the true turning point of the war in Europe, ending any realistic plans Hitler had of dominating the entire continent. Nazi armies were forced to retreat westward back toward Germany. Instead, it was the Soviet Union that now went on the offensive.
War in North Africa Meanwhile, another important campaign was taking place in the deserts and mountains of North Africa, where the British had been fighting the Germans and Italians since 1940. Several goals motivated the Allied campaign in North Africa. Stalin had wanted America and Britain to open a second front against Germany in Western Europe, which would help relieve German pressure on the Soviet Union.
Roosevelt and Churchill felt they did not have the resources to prepare for an invasion of mainland Europe. An invasion of North Africa, however, required less planning and fewer supplies. In addition, forcing Germany out of North Africa would pave the way for an Allied invasion of Italy.
Allied soldiers had to fight in many different types of terrain during the war. But the Sahara of North Africa—the world’s largest desert—presented special challenges. In hot, dry weather, sandstorms choked and blinded troops. Tanks kicked up enormous dust clouds that were visible miles away, making it difficult for troops to move without being seen. Furthermore, most supplies for Allied troops in North Africa had to be brought in by sea, where transport ships faced German attacks.
In November 1942, the British won a major victory at El Alamein (ehl al uh mayn ) in Egypt and began to push westward. The victory prevented Germany from gaining access to the Suez Canal and oil fields in the Middle East.
About the same time, Allied troops landed in Morocco and Algeria and began to move east toward key German positions. An energetic American officer, General Dwight Eisenhower —known as Ike-commanded the Allied invasion of North Africa.
In February 1943, German general Erwin Rommel (known as the Desert Fox) led his Afrika Korps against the Americans at the Kasserine Pass in Tunisia. Rommel broke through the American lines in an attempt to reach the Allied supply base at Tebessa in Algeria. Finally, American soldiers stopped the assault. Lack of supplies then forced Rommel to retreat.

World War II
A
War on Two Fronts Allies Take Over North Africa The fighting at the Kasserine Pass taught American leaders valuable lessons. They needed aggressive officers and troops better trained for desert fighting. To that end, Eisenhower put American forces in North Africa under the command of George S. Patton, Jr., an innovative tank commander.
A single-minded general known as Blood and Guts, Patton told his junior officers:
You usually will know where the front is by the sound of gunfire, and that’s the direction you should proceed. Now, suppose you lose a hand or an ear is shot off, or perhaps a piece of your nose, and you think you should walk back to get first aid. If I see you, it will be the last . . . walk you’ll ever take.
S.
Patton, Jr., 1943 Serving under Patton was another able general, Omar Bradley, who took command of Patton’s group in March 1943 when Patton moved on to plan the next Allied move. American forces advanced east toward Tunisia with increasing confidence. Simultaneously, the British pressed westward from Egypt, trapping Axis forces in a continually shrinking pocket in Tunisia. Rommel escaped, but his army did not. In May 1943, the remaining German and Italian forces in North Africa—some 240,000 troops—surrendered.

Axis Powers on the
Defensive
Germany was now on the defensive, and the Allies planned to keep it that way. In January 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill met in Casablanca, Morocco, to plan their next move. The conference resulted in two important decisions. First, the Allies decided to increase bombing of Germany and invade Italy. Second, Roosevelt announced that the Allies would accept only unconditional surrender, or giving up completely without any concessions. Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo could not hope to stay in power through a peace agreement.
» General George Patton was one of the most famous American military leaders during World War II. He led American troops to victory in North Africa.
Italy Surrenders The Allies next eyed Italy. The island of Sicily was the obvious target for an invasion, as it was situated across the Mediterranean from Tunisia and only two miles from the Italian mainland. The Allies could invade Sicily without great risk from U-boats and under the protection of Allied aircraft. In July 1943, British and American armies made separate landings in Sicily and began to advance across the island before joining forces in the north. Once again, Eisenhower commanded the joint American-British forces, with Patton and Bradley both leading significant American forces.
Eisenhower hoped to trap Axis forces on Sicily, but they escaped to the Italian mainland. Still, the 38-day campaign achieved important results: It gave the Allies complete control of the western Mediterranean, paved the way for an invasion of Italy, and ended the rule of Benito Mussolini. On September 3, 1943, Italy surrendered to the Allies and five weeks later declared war on Germany.
But Hitler was not through with Italy. After a small German airborne force rescued Mussolini from a mountaintop fortress, Hitler installed him as head of a puppet state in northern Italy. In the south, German military forces continued the fight against the Allies.
World War II
A
War on Two Fronts The invasion of Italy was a slow, grinding slog. Italy was crisscrossed with mountains and rivers. Heavy rains and mountain snows made combat difficult. Soldiers fought in ankle-deep mud. In the mountains, where tanks and heavy artillery were useless, Allied forces depended on mules to haul supplies up slippery and steep roads. To make matters worse, the Germans occupied the best defensive positions. Fighting continued into 1945. The Allies won battles, but none were important enough to end the war in Italy.
Allied Bombers Attack Germany Stalin continued his demand that Roosevelt and Churchill open a second front in France. While the Allies did not launch a massive invasion of France until 1944, they did open a second front of another kind in early 1942. From bases in England, Allied bombers launched nonstop attacks against Germany.
Flying by night in order to avoid being shot down in large numbers, British planes dropped massive amounts of bombs on German cities, including civilian targets. The goal of this saturation bombing was to inflict maximum damage.
By day, American bombers targeted Germany’s key political and industrial centers. The goal of this campaign of strategic bombing was to destroy Germany’s capacity to make war. A Nazi official later
commented that “the fleets of bombers might appear at any time over any large German city or important factory.”
The bravery and contributions of an African American fighter squadron known as the Tuskegee Airmen played a key role in the campaign, escorting bombers and protecting them from enemy fighter pilots. In more than 1,500 missions over enemy territory in Europe, the Tuskegee Airmen did not lose a single bomber.
Overall, though, the bombing missions cost the Allies dearly. Bomber crews suffered an incredibly high 20 percent casualty rate. But they successfully carried the war into Germany, day after day and night after night. This second front in the sky did indeed relieve some of the pressure on the Soviet armies on the Eastern Front and helped pave the way for an all-out Allied offensive.

Turning Points in the
Pacific
While the Allies pursued their "Europe First” strategy, they did not ignore the Pacific. Through May 1942, Japanese forces continued to advance with seemingly unstoppable momentum. They had attacked American, British, and Dutch colonies, winning control of the Philippines, Malaya, Dutch East Indies, Hong Kong, Wake Island, Guam, and Burma. Then, the United States struck back. The American success at the Battle of Coral Sea in May 1942 served as a warning that the war in the Pacific was about to change.
Americans Triumph at Midway Admiral Yamamoto, commander of Japanese forces in the Pacific, knew that the United States Navy was a powerful threat. Before the Americans could retaliate for Pearl Harbor, Yamamoto sought to destroy American aircraft carriers in the Pacific. He turned his attention to Midway, an American naval base in the Central Pacific that was vital to the defense of Hawaii. Losing Midway would force American defenses back to the California coast. Yamamoto’s ambitious plan entailed taking Midway and establishing a military presence in the Aleutians, a string of islands off the coast of Alaska.
What Yamamoto did not realize was that Admiral Chester Nimitz, commander of the United States Navy in the Pacific, knew the Japanese plans. U.S. Navy code breakers had intercepted Japanese messages. To meet the expected assault, Nimitz sent his only available aircraft carriers to Midway. The Japanese navy was stretched out across more than a thousand miles, from the Aleutians to well west of Midway. American forces were all concentrated near Midway.
The Japanese began their attack on June 4, 1942. In the Battle of Midway, the most important naval battle of World War II, the United States dealt Japan a decisive defeat. American torpedo planes and dive bombers sank four Japanese aircraft carriers, along with all 250 aircraft on board and many of Japan’s most experienced pilots. America lost only one aircraft carrier.
Midway was the turning point of the war in the Pacific, ending the seemingly unstoppable Japanese advance. Japan still had a powerful navy, committed troops, and fortified positions. But Japanese forces would never again threaten Hawaii or dominate the Pacific. Japan was now on the defensive.
Americans Take the Offensive The first American offensive in the Pacific took place in August 1942, with
World War II I 391 1 6.4 A War on Two Fronts
an assault on the island of Guadalcanal. One marine described fighting on Guadalcanal:
It was beautiful, but beneath the loveliness . . . Guadalcanal was a mass of slops and stinks and pestilence; of scum-crusted lagoons and vile swamps inhabited by giant crocodiles ... of ants that bite like fire, of tree leeches that fall, fasten and suck; of scorpions
of centipedes whose foul scurrying
across human skin leaves a track of
inflamed flesh, of snakes and land
crabs, rats and bats and carrion birds
and of a myriad of stinging insects.
-—Robert Leckie, Delivered From Evil: The Saga of World War II
Guadalcanal was part of a U.S. strategy to approach Japan from both the southwest Pacific and the central Pacific. The logic behind the offensives was to force Japan to fight a two-front war and to capture bases from which to attack Japan. In jungles and on coral reefs, under torrential monsoons and the blistering sun, American servicemen began their slow, painful trek toward Japan.

A
War on Two Fronts While fathers, sons, husbands, and brothers served overseas, their families served on the home front. Every American, regardless of age or background, was expected to help boost morale and make sacrifices to shoulder the cost of the war. The war effort stirred patriotism and caused ordinary citizens to take exceptional actions.

Patriotism on the Home Front
The war also promoted economic recovery and spurred a massive movement of people around the country. And, while wartime fears and tensions tested civil liberties, new opportunities for women and minorities would spur stronger efforts to ensure equal rights after the war was over.
The Financial Cost of the War The war eventually cost Americans $330 billion, which was double the total amount of federal expenditures since the founding of the nation. In six years, the national debt skyrocketed from $42 billion to $269 billion. To help raise funds, Congress levied a 5 percent tax on all working Americans.
In addition, millions of Americans bought war bonds. In a war bond, citizens lend the government money in order to help fund the war. They bought the bonds at face value, say $25, and then received a certain amount of interest after ten years. The bonds allowed Americans both to save income and invest in the war effort. The government reminded Americans that every dollar spent on war bonds meant another bullet or bomb and another step closer to victory.
Controlling Shortages With factories converting to make goods needed for the war, consumer products soon became scarce. As shortages led to price increases, many feared that inflation would run

wild. To manage this problem, FDR created the Office of Price Administration, which had the authority to control wages and set maximum prices.
Another form of economic control was rationing. Americans were issued coupon books that limited the amount of certain goods that they could buy. Rationing ensured that raw materials such as rubber and gasoline found their way into war production. Also, rationing of food items, such as butter, sugar, milk, canned goods, and meat, ensured that fighting troops would have enough food.
Rationing of food and raw materials created shortages that Americans could not help but notice. To help with these shortages, people carpooled to work, recycled tires, and grew their own food in "victory gardens” planted in vacant lots or in their backyards. By 1943, more than 20 million victory gardens had been planted, from tiny household plots to public areas like Copley Square in Boston. Although most Americans accepted the need for wartime controls, others resented the restrictions. Unscrupulous profiteers manipulated the ration coupon system to create a “black market,” an illegal underground network for the sale of restricted goods.

» In this poster, people on the home front are urged to grow vegetables for victory. Determine Point of View Why would the idea of a victory garden have appealed to Americans?
Labor Unrest The government also restricted job mobility to ensure constant production. In some places, wages lagged behind rising prices and profits, and working conditions were less than ideal. Some workers also opposed sharing the workplace with women and African Americans. In 1940 and 1941, strikes were common throughout the country. The nation’s labor unions worked with the National War Labor Board to resolve most issues, however, and the strikes never seriously impacted production. Americans created a powerful industrial network that contributed to victory.
Raising Morale Worry about family and friends fighting overseas and sacrifices on the home front took a toll on morale. The federal Office of War Information (OWI) worked closely with the media to encourage support of the war effort. The OWI tried to spotlight common needs, minimize racial and economic divisions, and downplay problems of poverty and crime. Under the OWI’s guidance, the radio, print, and film industries reminded Americans that they were in a struggle between dictatorship and democracy.
Hollywood proved a capable and willing ally in this cause. Documentaries like Frank Capra’s Why We Fight series highlighted the need to defeat fascism. Fiction films showed patriotic Americans pitching in overseas or on the home front and stirred hatred of the enemy with stereotypical portrayals of treacherous Japanese and brutal Germans. Movie stars and popular singers volunteered their time to sell war bonds and entertain the troops. Through the United Service Organizations (USO), volunteers boosted the morale of those who were fighting the war. At the USO’s Hollywood Canteen in Los Angeles, a soldier could get a hot meal served by a celebrity or dance with his favorite movie star.
Encouraged by government and media, Americans voluntarily contributed to the war effort in dozens of large and small ways. They took new jobs and worked overtime at them. Retired citizens went back to work to help out. Americans bought war bonds and paid higher taxes. They volunteered for the Red Cross, manning blood banks, rolling bandages, and sending millions of care packages to soldiers overseas. They collected paper, scrap metal, and cooking fat to recycle for the effort. Instead of buying new, many people followed the motto “Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.”

Japanese Internment
During World War II
Not all Americans were included in the spirit of unity. The attack on Pearl Harbor also spread fear across America. The federal government began drafting policies aimed toward immigrants and aliens from the Axis nations. Aliens are foreign citizens living in the United States. All resident “enemy aliens” were required to register with the government, submit to fingerprinting, and list their organizational affiliations.
Executive Order 9066 Originally, laws made no distinction among nationalities. German, Italian, and Japanese aliens were subject to arrest or deportation if deemed dangerous to national security. Some 11,000 German immigrants and hundreds of Italian immigrants were held in camps; others faced curfews or travel restrictions. Federal orders also forced all three groups to vacate the West Coast temporarily in the winter of 1942. Once public fears subsided, FDR removed Germans and Italians from the enemy aliens list.
Japanese aliens and Japanese American citizens received no such respite. Believing people of Japanese ancestry to be inherently disloyal, West Coast leaders pressed FDR to address the “threat.” In February 1942, the President issued Executive Order 9066, designating certain areas as war zones from which anyone might be removed for any reason.
By September, the government evacuated more than 100,000 Japanese Americans on the West Coast. Evacuees—including both Issei, Japanese immigrants, and Nisei, native-born American citizens of Japanese descent—were forced to sell their property at a loss and allowed to take only necessary items.
Why did Japanese Americans generally face harsher treatment than Italian or German Americans? Several factors help explain the difference: racism, the smaller numbers of Japanese Americans, their lack of political clout, and their relative isolation from other Americans. In Hawaii, where Japanese Americans comprised one third of a multiracial society, they escaped a similar fate.
Japanese Americans Are Interned The first orders stipulated only that Japanese Americans must leave designated military zones, but leaders in interior states objected. The governor of Arizona insisted his state did not want to become a “dumping ground for enemy aliens.” The War Department then initiated a policy of internment, or temporary imprisonment of members of a specific group. Japanese American men, women, and children were transported to camps

in isolated locations such as Poston, Arizona, and Jerome, Arkansas. With few exceptions, Nisei and Issei remained in the camps for the duration of the war.

Japanese Americans Fight for Rights Since many of those interned in the camps were American citizens, the federal government's policy of internment raised constitutional issues. Some Japanese Americans went to court to seek their rights. In two cases, Hirabayashi v. United States (1943) and Korematsu v. United States (1944), the Supreme Court upheld the government's wartime internment policy. Not until 1988 did the government offer an apology and $20,000 payments to surviving internees.
Japanese Americans also faced another form of discrimination. At first, they were not accepted into the armed forces. But after the government lifted the ban in early 1943, many eagerly enlisted. The all-Nisei 442nd Regimental Combat Team fought in the Italian campaign and became the most decorated military unit in American history.
The 442nd helped counter the notion that Japanese Americans were not loyal citizens.

Increased Opportunities in Employment
All over the United States, American industry quickly converted to war production to meet the nation’s military needs. As the economic effects of World War II brought the Great Depression to an end, the millions of unemployed men who had been such a common sight during the 1930s seemed to vanish overnight. They either joined the military, worked to produce food for the world on the nation’s rich farms, or labored in factories producing war materiel. Soon, factories needed to hire workers outside of their usual pool of mostly white men. To keep production going, more women and more African Americans found opportunity in defense industries, although they still faced significant obstacles to gaining and succeeding in those jobs.
Women Work in Defense Industries Government and industry launched an all-out publicity campaign urging women to do their part to meet wartime production quotas. The image of a strong, determined female worker, hair tucked under a kerchief, graced countless magazines and posters. The name "Rosie the Riveter” was first used in a 1942 song, and several real-life Rosies won national publicity. But “Rosie” was really a symbol for an army of women who made artillery shells, sewed uniforms, and welded planes.
Years later, one of them spoke about the contribution that women had made:
Our war effort ... it was a good success and a good thing that we did it. It’s a good thing that the women went in. It’s a good thing that they showed the world that they can do things too. ‘Oh, it’s dirty work.’ Well, making a pie can be dirty work.
—Meda Montana Hallyburton Brendall, Veterans
History Project, Library of Congress
Despite the government’s encouragement, there were still obstacles to women working in war industry. They were generally paid less than men for the same or similar work. Some new workers also faced hostility in their new workplaces. Still, by the end of the war, women made up more than one third of the wartime workforce.
A woman working outside the home was nothing new, but wartime pressures created two sharp breaks from the past. Many women found jobs, especially in heavy industry, that fell outside the traditional realm of women’s work. The need for labor also weakened

the common practice that a woman quit her job once she married. Three fourths of women working in war industries were married, and 60 percent were older than 35 years.
Wartime Work Changes Women’s Lives Although the image of Rosie the Riveter working in a factory was widespread, women labored in both blue-collar and white-collar jobs. Most factory owners expected women to step aside once men returned home at war’s end. In white-collar settings, however, the war accelerated long-term trends toward increased employment. During the 1940s, the number of women employed in secretarial and clerical work increased fivefold.
With fathers in the military and mothers in the workplace, children’s lives began to change. The federal government spent $50 million building day-care centers for children of working mothers. Still, only about 130,000 kids ended up in day-care centers and most were not filled to capacity. Many parents preferred to leave their children in the care of neighbors or relatives.
Wartime work helped women move closer to achieving the American Dream, gaining success through hard work and initiative. They benefited from the experience in several ways. They earned paychecks, some for the first time, formed new and

different relationships, and gained organizational experience. “I decided that if I could learn to weld like a man,” noted one laborer, “I could do anything it took to make a living.” The confidence and knowledge women developed enriched their postwar experiences and helped create opportunities for their daughters in the years ahead.
African Americans Seek Employment Opportunities Many African American leaders hoped that the war might provide jobs and alleviate their dismal economic situations. However, few found meaningful employment with national defense employers before Pearl Harbor. Out of 100,000 Americans working in the aircraft industry in 1940, for example, only 240 were African Americans. Even jobs provided by the government and military remained segregated.
African American leaders stressed the need for a "Double V” campaign—victory against fascism abroad and victory against discrimination at home. The charismatic and savvy labor leader A. Philip Randolph asserted that African Americans would no longer accept second-class citizenship. "We loyal Negro American citizens demand the right to work and fight for our country,” he proclaimed.
In June 1941, Randolph presented President Roosevelt a list of demands, including the end of discriminatory practices in government-funded training, employment, and the armed services. He also took steps to organize a massive protest march on Washington, D.C.
Roosevelt Issues Executive Order 8802 FDR had
hoped to put civil rights reform on the back burner while war raged in Europe and Asia. But Randolph persisted in his plans. With the United States nearing involvement in the war, Roosevelt feared that the sight of a huge protest march on the nation’s capital would undermine unity and fuel enemy propaganda. So, under pressure, he issued Executive Order 8802. This measure assured fair hiring practices in any job funded with government money and established the Fair Employment Practices Committee to enforce these requirements. By 1944, nearly 2 million African Americans worked in defense industries, although racist practices were still common.
Such victories encouraged African Americans to join organizations dedicated to promoting equal rights. The NAACP grew to 500,000 members. In 1942, civil rights leaders founded the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), an organization that sought to apply nonviolent protest as a means of fighting segregation. Although segregation still prevailed in the military, the South, and other parts of the nation, wartime developments
6.5 The Home Front
helped set the agenda for the civil rights struggles of the coming decades.
COMPARE AND CONTRAST
How were the employment experiences for women and African Americans the same? How did they differ?
Migration During World War II
Wartime needs encouraged migration. People from rural areas, whites and African Americans, moved north to industrial cities and west to California. They sought jobs in wartime industries or near military bases. Farmers looked for creative ways to keep their farms producing necessary food. The moving population and new jobs invigorated Americans but the effects of changing demographics also led to strain and unrest in some areas.
Workers on the Move During World War II, California alone gained 2 million new residents seeking work in shipyards and other industries related to the war. The South lost residents in its rural areas, but grew by a million new people as a whole. Older industrial cities in the North, such as Detroit and Chicago, also boomed. Movement of people fostered long-term changes in the country’s demographic patterns.
Demographics are statistics that show human characteristics of a population. After receiving billions of dollars to fund industry and build military bases, the South and Southwest became a growing economic and political force.
Population shifts affected Native Americans, too. As Native Americans left reservations to work in defense industries, they had the opportunity to learn new skills and had greater contacts with non-Indians. Many of these people, as well as Native American veterans, never returned to the reservations after the war.
Migration Changes Farming Meanwhile, American farmers faced a challenge. They needed to produce more food than ever before to power both the American war effort and send to Allies abroad. However, more and more people left farms for the military or jobs in the cities. Farmers developed new farming methods, including more efficient machinery and better fertilizers, to improve yields with fewer workers.
They also found several solutions to alleviate the rural population drain. First, teenagers too young to enlist helped out more.
Also, tens of thousands of Axis prisoners of war were paid to work on farms, which was allowed

under the Geneva Convention. Finally, the United States partnered with Mexico to operate the bracero program, bringing laborers from Mexico to work on American farms especially in the West. During the war years, several hundred thousand braceros embraced this opportunity and migrated to the United States. In the long term, the bracero program initiated decades of migratory labor in the West.
Conflict Springs From Migration In the summer of 1943, migration led to racial violence in some cities. The worst occurred in Detroit, where conflict rose over the construction of housing for black workers drawn north to defense plants. Some 100,000 whites and
blacks broke into scattered fights at a city park. By the next morning, full-scale riots erupted in which 34 people were killed. Federal troops ended the violence, but the city’s problems were never resolved. Mexican Americans had long dealt with similar obstacles.
Few had mastered the English language, and many languished in slums while struggling to find work. A violent incident highlighted the problems. In the Los Angeles area, many Mexican and Mexican American youths dressed in stylish “zoot suits” with baggy pants and long jackets. In June 1943, mobs of off-duty sailors roamed through the Mexican sections of Los Angeles, attacking “zooters.” When the fighting ended, police arrested the zoot-suited victims, not their attackers.
After the riots, an indignant Governor Earl Warren formed a committee to investigate the causes of the outbreak and demanded that the guilty parties be punished. Although the committee blamed the lack of sufficient recreation for the violence, long-brewing racial tensions acted as the true spark.

Planning Germany’s Defeat
Opening a Second Front Throughout 1943, Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin argued over when they would start a second front in France. Up to that point, Soviet troops had done most of the fighting in Europe. Stalin insisted that Britain and the United States carry more of the military burden by attacking Germany in the west, thereby forcing Germany to divide its troops.
Roosevelt sympathized with Stalin’s position, but Churchill hesitated and delayed. Recalling the slaughter of British troops on the Western Front in World War I, he was not anxious to see history repeat itself. He argued that the German U-boat presence was too great in the English Channel and that the Allies needed more equipment, more landing craft, and better-trained soldiers.
The Big Three Meet In November 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill traveled to Teheran, Iran, for their first face-to-face meeting with Stalin. Churchill continued to voice concerns about an invasion of France, but Roosevelt sided with Stalin. Reluctantly, Churchill agreed. After years of war, British and American soldiers would invade France and begin

their march toward Germany. At the end of the Teheran Conference, the Big Three issued a joint statement that gave no hint of their earlier disagreements:
We have reached complete agreement as to the scope and timing of the operations to be undertaken from the east, west and south. The common understanding which we have here reached guarantees that victory will be ours. . . . No power on earth can prevent our destroying the German armies by land, their U Boats by sea, and their war planes from the air.

Six months after the Teheran Conference, the plan to open a second front in France became reality. The massive Allied invasion of France was given the code name Operation Overlord.
H IDENTIFY SUPPORTING DETAILS
Why did Roosevelt and Churchill not agree to open a second front in France until late 1943?
The Invasion of Normandy
Operation Overlord involved the most experienced Allied officers in Europe. American General Dwight D. Eisenhower again served as Supreme Commander. British General Bernard Montgomery served as commander of the ground forces, while General Omar Bradley led the American troops who would participate in the invasion.
Eisenhower Plans the Invasion U S. Army chief of staff George Marshall had long pushed for an Allied invasion of France, believing that the British strategy of invading North Africa and Italy would not contribute to Germany’s defeat. Although he was the obvious choice to lead the invasion of Normandy once the Allies had finally agreed to do so, Roosevelt decided that he was too valuable to remove from his current position. Instead, Roosevelt looked to Eisenhower.
Eisenhower had been given command of all American forces in Europe in 1942—even though more than 350 other generals had more seniority. After strong performances in North Africa and Italy, he was made Supreme Commander of Allied Forces. In this role, he planned Operation Overlord.

with evidence from the map.	| Q9
Overlord involved landing 21 American divisions and 26 British, Canadian, and Polish divisions on a 50-mile stretch of beaches in Normandy. The fleet was the largest ever assembled, comprising more than 4,400 ships and landing crafts.
The plan involved striking five Normandy beaches (code-named Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword), but it also included an elaborate deception: the creation of a fictional Allied army under American General George S. Patton. The Allies set up fake headquarters in southeast England across the English Channel from Calais, France, equipped with wood and cardboard tanks, useless ships, and radio messages. The Allies hoped to convince the Germans that the Allied attack would come at Calais, not farther west in Normandy. In the end, the deception worked. Hitler ordered his top tank division to Calais.
Allies Storm the Beaches On June 6, 1944—known as D-Day—the Allies launched the invasion. More than 11,000 planes prepared the way, attempting to destroy German communication and transportation networks and soften Nazi beach defenses. At 6:30 A.M., after a rough crossing of the English Channel, the first Allied troops landed.
On four beaches, the landings were lightly opposed and casualties were low. But at Omaha, one of the two
beaches assigned to American forces, the Germans offered strong opposition.
Germans Defend Normandy On the cliffs overlooking the beach, the Germans had dug trenches and built small concrete pillbox structures from which heavy artillery could be fired. They had the beach covered with a wide variety of deadly guns. They had also heavily mined the beaches. When the first American soldiers arrived, they stepped out of their landing crafts into a rainstorm of German bullets and shells. Some crafts dumped their occupants too far from the beach; soldiers, weighted down by heavy packs and weapons, drowned. As one eyewitness recalled,
One writer called D-Day “the longest day." For many American soldiers, it was a very short day—and their last day on Earth. Some fought bravely and died. Others fought bravely and survived. By the end of the day, the Allies had gained a toehold in France. Within a month, more than one million Allied troops had landed at Normandy—but there they were held by German defenses.
In mid-July, under General Bradley—the commander of all American forces in France—Allied bombers launched an enormous assault on the German lines, opening up a gap that American armored divisions raced through. General Patton took charge of the U.S. Third Army and began an all-out drive across France,

advancing rapidly toward Paris. Berlin, the capital of Germany, was still a long road ahead, but the Allies had taken the first, and most important, step on that road.
H DRAW CONCLUSIONS
Why do you think it was so important to the Allies for Operation Overlord to succeed? Use evidence from the text to support your answer.
Defeat of Germany
After D-Day, Germany faced a hopeless two-front war. Soviet soldiers were advancing steadily from the east, forcing German armies out of Latvia, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary. Mile by mile, Germany lost the lands it had once dominated and the natural resources it had once plundered.
Allies on the Move Allied armies were also on the move in the west. British and Canadian troops had finally broken through the German lines in northern France and moved south to join Patton’s American forces. In August 1944, the Allies liberated Paris. Hitler had ordered his generals to destroy the French capital, but they disobeyed him, leaving the “City of Lights” as beautiful as ever. As Parisians celebrated, Allied troops kept advancing.
» An American soldier waves from his tank as the Allies enter Paris in August 1944.
As a mood of hopelessness fell over Germany, Rommel and other leading German generals plotted to overthrow Hitler. On July 20, 1944, a German officer planted a bomb at Hitler’s headquarters.
The explosion killed or wounded 20 people, but Hitler survived. Rommel took poison to escape being put on trial. Claiming that fate was on his side, Hitler refused to surrender to the advancing Allied troops.
Hitler’s Desperate Counterattack In December 1944, Hitler ordered a counterattack. With Allied troops strung out between the English Channel and the Alps, German forces massed near the Ardennes. Hitler’s plan called for English-speaking German soldiers in U.S. uniforms to cut telephone lines, change road signs, and spread confusion. German tanks would then secure communication and transportation hubs.
The counterattack, known as the Battle of the Bulge, almost succeeded. The Germans caught the Allies by surprise, created a bulge in the American line, and captured several key towns. Snowy, cloudy skies prevented the Allies from exploiting their air superiority. But at the Belgian town of Bastogne (bas tohn), American forces led by Eisenhower and Patton held despite frostbite and brutal German assaults. Then, on December 23, the skies cleared and Allied bombers attacked German positions.
After reinforcements arrived, the Allies went back on the offensive, steadily pushing the Germans out of France. The Battle of the Bulge was a desperate attempt to drive a wedge between American and British forces. Instead, the battle crippled Germany by forcing it to use its reserve troops and supplies. Ultimately, it shortened the time Hitler had left.
Winston Churchill gave U.S. forces full credit for the Allied victory at the Battle of the Bulge:
The United States troops have done almost all the fighting and have suffered almost all the losses. They have suffered losses almost equal to those of both sides at the Battle of Gettysburg. . . . [The Battle of the Bulge] will, I believe, be regarded as an ever-famous American victory.

Commons, January 18, 1945

showed in combat. In fact, some 40 percent of the Congressional Medals of Honor—the highest military award given by the United States—awarded since 1900 were given for service in World War II. Of the 464 Medals of Honor awarded for World War II, 266 were given posthumously.
Audie Murphy was one recipient of the Medal of Honor. In fact, he received more medals than any other American in World War II. In January 1945, his squad was set upon by German troops. Ordering his men to withdraw, Murphy climbed atop a burning tank that was in danger of exploding. For an hour, he used the tank’s machine gun to hold off the enemy:
Germans reached as close as 10 yards, only to be mowed down by his fire. He received a leg wound, but ignored it and continued the single-handed fight until his ammunition was exhausted. He then made his way to his company, refused medical attention, and organized the company in a counterattack.
—Medal of Honor Citation for Audie Murphy
Germany Surrenders By January 1945, the Soviet Army had reached the Oder River outside Berlin. The Allies also advanced northward in Italy. In April, Benito Mussolini tried to flee but was captured and executed. By this time, American and British troops had crossed the Rhine River into Germany, and a U.S. force soon reached the Elbe River, 50 miles west of Berlin. Allied forces were now in position for an all-out assault against Hitler’s capital.
Hitler was by now a physical wreck: shaken by tremors, paranoid from drugs, and kept alive by mad dreams of a final victory. He gave orders that no one followed and planned campaigns that no one would ever fight. Finally, on April 30, he and a few of his closest associates committed suicide. His "Thousand Year Reich” had lasted only a dozen years.
On May 7, in a little French schoolhouse that had served as Eisenhower’s headquarters, Germany surrendered. Americans celebrated V-E (Victory in Europe) Day. Sadly, President Roosevelt did not see the momentous day. He had died a few weeks earlier. It would be up to the new President, Harry S. Truman, to see the nation through to final victory.

Americans Advance
Toward Japan
While war still raged in Europe, American forces in the Pacific had been advancing in giant leaps. Under the leadership of General Douglas MacArthur, they followed an island-hopping strategy, capturing some Japanese-held islands and ignoring others in a steady path toward Japan.
Navajo troops played a vital role in the Pacific island-hopping campaign. The Navajo language has no written alphabet, and at the start of the war only a small number of non-Navajo people could understand it—none of them Japanese. Navajo radio operators developed and memorized a secret code using the language, and they used it to send critical messages from island to island. The code was never broken by the Japanese.
Struggle in the Pacific From Tarawa and Makin in the Gilbert Islands, American forces jumped ahead to Eniwetok and Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. Then, they took another leap to Saipan, Tinian, and Guam in
the Mariana Islands. By 1944, the United States Navy, under Admiral Nimitz, was blockading Japan, and in October General MacArthur began the fight to retake the Philippines.
American forces took each island only after a difficult struggle. Time and again, Japanese defenders fought virtually to the last man. Rather than surrender, many Japanese troops readily killed themselves. At the same time, Japanese kamikaze (kah muh kah zee) pilots deliberately crashed their planes into American ships. By the end of the war, more than 3,000 Japanese pilots had died in kamikaze missions. Their deaths, however, did not prevent MacArthur from retaking the Philippines—as he had promised when he left the islands in 1942—or the U.S. Navy from sinking Japanese ships.
American Forces Near Japan One of the fiercest battles in the island-hopping campaign took place in February and March 1945.
On Iwo Jima ( EE woh jee muh), a 5-mile-long island 650 miles southeast of Tokyo, the capital of Japan, United States Marines faced a dug-in, determined enemy. In 36 days of fighting, more than 23,000 marines became casualties. But in the end, the Allies took the island.

The fight for Okinawa (oh kuh NAH wuh) in April 1945 was even deadlier than Iwo Jima. Only 340 miles from Japan, Okinawa contained a vital air base, necessary for the planned invasion of Japan. Taking Okinawa was the most complex and costly operation in the Pacific campaign, involving half a million troops and 1,213 warships. U.S. forces finally took Okinawa but at a cost of roughly 50,000 casualties.
Americans Bombers Attack Japan From Okinawa and other Pacific bases, American pilots could bomb the Japanese home islands. Short on pilots and aircraft, low on fuel and ammunition, Japan was virtually defenseless. American bombers hit factories, military bases, and cities. In a single night in March 1945, B-29 bombers destroyed 16 square miles of Tokyo. The raid killed over 83,000 Japanese—more than either of the later atomic bombs—and injured 100,000 more.

The War Comes to an End
Advances in technology helped determine the outcome of World War II. Allied and Axis scientists labored to make planes faster, bombs deadlier, and weapons more accurate. As always in warfare, specific military needs resulted in scientific discoveries and technological innovations.
Science and Technology Help Win the War
Scientists and engineers on both sides of the war worked on the development of conventional weapons at a rapid pace, creating and improving many wartime technologies. They developed fast and powerful aircraft, ships, and weapons, as well as radar and sonar to detect enemy aircraft and ships. To treat sick and wounded soldiers, they developed a way to mass-produce penicillin, an antibiotic, and to more easily transport and store blood plasma.
To supply military needs, they invented synthetic materials such as nylon, used to make parachutes and vehicle tires. But the most crucial scientific development of all was the atomic bomb.
Scientists Develop the Atomic Bomb In the
early 1930s, scientists learned how to split the nuclei of certain elements. They also discovered that this process of nuclear fission released tremendous energy. Over the next decade, they learned more about the nature of the atom, the effect of a chain reaction, and the military uses of uranium.

bomb against Japan in an effort to end the war and limit. American casualties.
Early in the war, Albert Einstein, the world’s most famous scientist, signed a letter that alerted President Roosevelt about the need to proceed with development of atomic weapons. In 1942, Roosevelt gave the highest national priority to the development of an atomic bomb. The program, code-named the Manhattan Project, cost several billion dollars and employed tens of thousands of people.
The two primary leaders of the project were General Leslie Groves and physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Groves was responsible for building facilities, acquiring materials, recruiting scientists, and providing security. Oppenheimer ran the scientific aspect of the project from Los Alamos, New Mexico. Scientists working on the top-secret project included many refugees from Europe, including Enrico Fermi, developer of the first atomic reactor.
On the morning of July 16, 1945, in a barren area outside of Alamogordo, New Mexico, the first atomic bomb was tested. The flash of light was clearly visible 180 miles away, and the sound was heard at a distance of 100 miles. Watching the blast, Oppenheimer recalled the following line from a Hindu poem: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of Worlds.”
The general’s thoughts were less poetic. Turning to an aide, Groves said, “The war’s over. One or two of those things and Japan will be finished.”
Truman Decides to Use the Bomb The decision to use the bomb fell directly on the shoulders of Harry Truman.
The new President fully understood the ethical issues presented by using the bomb, especially against civilians. At the same time, he also knew that the Axis Powers had nuclear scientists, and there was no way to tell how close they were to developing their own bomb. Ultimately, Truman’s chief priority was to save American lives. His military advisers predicted that, in light of the ferocious defense waged by Japanese soldiers during the island-hopping campaign, an invasion of Japan might cost as many as 1,000,000 American casualties.
In truth, Truman did not agonize over the decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan. For the President, abstract ethical issues did not outweigh very real American lives and an opportunity to end the war. Later, some critics would condemn Truman’s decision. But in the late summer of 1945, no one close to him did so.
Hiroshima and Nagasaki Are Destroyed On
August 6, 1945, U.S. pilots dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. It exploded at 8:15 a.m. One survivor of the blast later recalled the first moments:
World War II 408	6.6 The Allies Win the War
After I noticed the flash, white clouds spread over the blue sky. It was amazing. It was as if blue morning-glories had suddenly bloomed up in the sky. . . • Then came the heat wave. It was very, very hot. Even though there was a window glass in front of me, I felt really hot. It was as if I was looking directly into a kitchen oven.
—Isao Kita, Hiroshima Witness
Within two minutes, more than 60,000 of Hiroshima’s 344,000 residents were dead or missing.
Over the next three days, Japanese leaders debated whether to surrender or continue to fight. Then, on August 9, two events rocked Japan. First, the Soviet Union declared war against Japan and invaded Japanese-held Manchuria. Next, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, killing 35,000 residents.
Japan Surrenders Debate continued at the highest levels of Japanese government. Finally, Emperor Hirohito made the decision to surrender.
On August 15, the Allies celebrated V-J (Victory in Japan) Day. Japan officially surrendered on September 2 aboard the USS Missouri.
But even as the Allies celebrated victory, the horrifying costs of the war began to become clear. As many as 60 million people, mostly civilians, had died in the conflict. Cities, factories, farms, and roads lay in ruins in large parts of Europe and Asia, and millions of refugees were homeless. Winning the war had been an enormous effort for the Allies. Peace would bring new challenges.

Roots of the Holocaust
The mass murders of Jews, as well as other "undesirables," were a direct result of a racist Nazi ideology that considered Aryans (white gentiles, especially those of Germanic, Nordic, and Anglo-Saxon blood) superior to other people. Among the groups that the Nazis considered inferior were the Slavic peoples of Russia and Eastern Europe.
From the start, the Nazi movement trafficked in anti-Semitism. Hitler blamed Jews for all the ills of Germany, from communism to inflation to abstract painting—and, especially, for the defeat of Germany in World War I. Other extremists influenced Hitler’s ideas and shared his prejudices. In the 1920s, his was just another angry voice in the Weimar Republic, advancing simplistic answers for the nation’s grave economic, political, and social troubles. In 1933, however, Hitler became chancellor of Germany.
Hitler’s Campaign Against the Jews Hitler’s persecution of the Jews began as soon as he came to power. At first, his focus was economic. He urged Germans to boycott Jewish-owned businesses, and he barred Jews from jobs in civil service, banking, the stock exchange, law, journalism, and medicine. In 1935, Hitler moved to a broader legal persecution. The Nuremberg Laws, named for the city that served as the spiritual center of Nazism. They denied German citizenship to Jews, banned marriage between Jews and non-Jews,

and segregated Jews at every level of society. Yet even these measures were not enough for Hitler. He hinted that, in the future, there might be what he called the “Final Solution to the Jewish question.”
Hitler employed the full power of the state in his anti-Semitic campaigns. Newspapers printed scandalous attacks against Jews. Children in schools and the Hitler Youth movement were taught that Jews were “polluting” German society and culture. Comic books contained vile caricatures of Jews.
The Violence of Kristallnacht Acts of violence against Jews were common. The most serious attack on German Jews took place on November 9, 1938. It became known as Kristallnacht (krihs tahl nahkt), or the “Night of the Broken Glass." After a Jewish refugee killed a German diplomat in Paris, Nazi officials ordered attacks on Jews in Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland. Secret police and military units destroyed more than 1,500 synagogues and 7,500 Jewish-owned businesses, killed more than 200 Jews, and injured more than 600 others. The Nazis arrested thousands of Jews.
Refugees Try to Escape Between 1933 and 1937, about 129,000 Jews fled Germany and Nazi-controlled Austria. They included some of the most notable figures in the scientific and artistic world, including physicist Albert Einstein.
More Jews would have left, but they were not generally welcomed into other countries. During the Great Depression, with jobs scarce, the United States and other countries barred their doors to many Jews. In 1939, the ocean liner St. Louis departed Germany for Cuba with more than 900 Jewish refugees on board. Only 22 of the passengers received permission to stay in Cuba. U.S. officials refused to accept any of the refugees. The ship returned to Germany. Almost 600 of the Jews aboard the St. Louis later died in Nazi concentration camps.

How did Hitler and the Nazis gradually deprive Jewish people of their rights?
Hitler’s “Final Solution”
Since 1933, the Nazis had denied Jews the rights of citizenship and committed acts of brutality against them. These acts of persecution were steps toward Hitler’s “Final Solution to the Jewish question”: nothing short of the systematic extermination of all Jews living in the regions controlled by the Third Reich. Today,

we use the word genocide to describe such willful annihilation of a racial, political, or cultural group.
The First Concentration Camps In 1933, the year he became chancellor, Hitler opened the first Nazi concentration camps, areas where members of specially designated groups were confined. The earliest camps included Dachau, Sachsenhausen, and Buchenwald. Later, Ravensbruck, not far from Berlin, was opened for female prisoners.
In theory, the camps were designed not to kill prisoners, but to turn them into "useful members” of the Third Reich. The Nazis imprisoned political opponents such as labor leaders, socialists, and communists, as well as anyone—journalists or novelists, ministers or priests—who spoke out against Hitler. Many Jews as well as Aryans who had intimate relations with Jews were sent to camps. Other groups targeted as "undesirable” included Gypsies, Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexuals, beggars, drunkards, conscientious objectors, the physically disabled, and people with mental illness.
Camp administrators tattooed numbers on the arms of prisoners and dressed them in vertically striped uniforms with triangular insignias. For example, political prisoners wore red insignias, homosexuals pink, Jews yellow, and Jehovah’s Witnesses purple. Inside the walls of the concentration camps, there were
no real restraints on sadistic guards. They tortured and even killed prisoners with no fear of reprisals from their superiors.
Death by starvation and disease was an everyday occurrence. In addition, doctors at camps such as Dachau conducted horrible medical experiments that either killed inmates or left them deformed. Prisoners were made subjects of bogus experiments on oxygen deprivation, hypothermia, and the effects of altitude. Bodies were mutilated without anesthesia. Thousands of prisoners died in agonizing pain, including some 5,000 mentally or physically disabled children.
The Nazis Build Death Camps When Germany invaded Poland and the Soviet Union, the Nazis gained control of large territories that were home to millions of Jews. Under Nazi rule, Jews in Warsaw, Lodz, and other Polish cities were forced to live in crowded, walled ghettos. Nazis also constructed additional concentration camps in Poland and Eastern Europe.
At first, the murder of Jews and other prisoners tended to be more arbitrary than systematic. But at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, Nazi leaders made the decision to move toward Hitler’s “Final Solution.” Reinhard Heydrich, an SS leader known as “the man with an iron heart,” outlined a plan to exterminate about 11,000,000 Jews.

the minutes of the meeting do not use the word “kill,” everyone there understood that killing was their goal.
Many concentration camps, especially in Poland, were designated as death camps, camps where prisoners were systematically exterminated. The largest death camp was Auschwitz in southern Poland. Others included Treblinka, Maidenek, Sobibor, Belsec, and Chelmno. Prisoners from various parts of the Reich were transported by trains to the death camps and murdered. Nazis forced prisoners into death chambers and pumped in carbon monoxide or crammed the prisoners into shower-like facilities and released the insecticide Zyklon B.
Some concentration camps that the Nazis converted into death camps did not have gassing equipment. In these camps, Nazi guards shot hundreds of thousands of prisoners. Nazi “Action Groups" that followed the army into Eastern Europe also shot several million Jews and buried them in ditches.
In fully functioning death camps, the bodies of murdered prisoners were further desecrated. Human fat was turned into soap; human hair was woven into wigs, slippers, and mattresses; cash, gold fillings, wedding rings, and other valuables were stripped off the victims. After the Nazis had taken what they wanted, they burned the bodies in crematoriums.
By 1945, about 6 million European Jews had been murdered. But Jews were not the only victims. As many as 5 million others lay dead, including nearly 2
million non-Jewish Poles. While many survivors lived with constant nightmares of the experience, or with the sorrow and guilt of being the last members of their families, many others determined to rebuild their lives and families in the United States, Israel, or elsewhere and continue to be productive citizens.

State Department at first made a conscious effort to block Jewish immigration. Later commentators have blamed this failure on several factors: anti-Semitism, apathy, preoccupation with the Great Depression, and a tendency to underestimate Hitler’s genocidal plans.
The United States Takes Limited Action Once the war started, news of the mass killings filtered to the West.
By the end of 1942, the Allies acknowledged that Jews were being taken to Poland and killed. In April 1943, British and American officials hosted the Bermuda Conference to discuss rescuing surviving Jewish refugees from Europe. However, no concrete action was taken.
By early 1944, however, FDR began to respond to the reports. He established the War Refugee Board, a government agency that worked with the Red Cross to save thousands of Eastern European Jews, especially in Romania and Hungary.
Tragically, too few were saved. Of the Allies, the Soviet Union was closest to the death camps, but Stalin showed no concern. Britain and the United States expressed sympathy, but their resources and strategy were focused on defeating Hitler not on stopping his genocidal campaign. They might have bombed railway

lines to the death camps, but the camps were not military targets.
A
War Department official told the Refugee Board that bombing the railway lines “could be executed only by the diversion of considerable air support essential to the success of our forces now engaged in decisive operations elsewhere.” The Allies also refused to pressure countries within the Nazi sphere of influence to stop the transportation of Jews to Germany. The Liberation of the Concentration Camps As
they pushed toward Germany from the east and west, Soviet and American troops liberated the camps one by one. For most Americans, the enormity of the Nazi crime became real only when the camp liberators began to report back on what they found. When they saw it all—the piles of dead bodies, the warehouses full of human hair and jewelry, the ashes in crematoriums, the half-dead emaciated survivors—they realized as never before that evil was more than an abstraction.
Hardened by war, accustomed to the sight and smell of death, the liberators were nevertheless unprepared for what they saw. Major Richard Winters was stunned almost beyond belief:
The memory of starved, dazed men,
who dropped their eyes and heads
when we looked at them through the
chain-link fence, in the same manner
that a beaten, mistreated dog would
cringe, leaves feelings that cannot be
described and will never be forgotten.
The impact of seeing those people
behind that fence left me saying, only
to myself, ‘Now I know why I’m here.’
—Richard Winters, quoted in Band of Brothers (Ambrose)
The liberation of the camps led to an outpouring of American sympathy and sincere longing to aid the victims. Many survivors found temporary or permanent homes in the United States.
The revelation of the Holocaust also increased demand and support for an independent Jewish homeland. In 1948, when the Jewish community in Palestine proclaimed the State of Israel, President Truman immediately recognized the new nation. Since then, the United States has continued to offer strong support to Israel.
Today, people in the United States and around the world are working to make sure that the Holocaust is not forgotten. In 1993, the United States Holocaust Memorial

Planning the Postwar World
World War II differed from World War I in several ways. One major difference was that it was fought to the bitter end.
In 1918, the Kaiser surrendered before the Allies could invade Germany. By contrast, in World War II, Japan and Germany kept fighting long after their defeat was certain. In the last year of the war, they lost battle after battle, retreated from the lands they had conquered, and saw the slow destruction of their military forces. Allied bombing devastated their cities and industries. Yet Germany fought on until Hitler committed suicide, and Japan refused to surrender until after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The Yalta Conference The protracted fighting gave the Allies time to make plans for a postwar world. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met at Yalta on the Black Sea in February 1945 to discuss final strategy and crucial questions concerning postwar Germany, Eastern Europe, and Asia. At the Yalta Conference, the Big Three agreed that Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania would hold free elections. However, Stalin later reneged on this promise.

Roosevelt and Churchill were not in a good position to press Stalin too hard. The Red Army already occupied much of Eastern Europe, and Roosevelt wanted Soviet help in the war against Japan. Vague promises were about as much as Stalin would give.
The Potsdam Conference A dramatically altered Big Three met in July 1945 in the Berlin suburb of Potsdam. Although Stalin remained in power in the Soviet Union, Harry S. Truman had become U.S. President in April upon the death of FDR. After the start of the conference, Clement Atlee replaced Churchill as prime minister of Britain.
At Potsdam, Truman took the reins of international leadership and began to reshape the relationship of the United States with its Allies. While in Potsdam, Truman learned of the successful test of the atomic bomb. But he was more focused on Europe and the Soviet Union than on Asia. Truman was more distrustful of Stalin than Roosevelt had been. Fearing Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, Truman continued to press for free elections after the war.
At the meeting, the Big Three formalized the decision to divide Germany into four zones of occupation: Soviet, American, British, and French. They agreed to new borders and free elections for Poland, and they recognized the Soviets’ right to claim reparations for war damages from the German sector they controlled. Stalin also reaffirmed his Yalta pledge to enter the war against Japan.

After the war ended in August 1945, plans for the postwar world had to be turned into realities. However, the changes that took place were often not what the Allies had envisioned at Yalta and Potsdam.
Worldwide Political Changes World War II changed political boundaries in many parts of the world. The borders of Poland, for example, shifted slightly to the west. In time, as you will learn, differences between the Soviet Union and its former Allies led to the division
of Germany into two countries: communist East Germany and noncommunist West Germany. Nearly all the nations of Eastern Europe became communist states under Soviet control.
Other countries experienced profound political changes. Communist and noncommunist interests clashed in Eastern Europe. In China, a long-standing civil war between Nationalists and communists resumed.
In Japan, General Douglas MacArthur headed an American military occupation and supervised the writing of a new constitution. It abolished the armed forces except for purposes of defense, gave women the right to vote, enacted democratic reforms, and established the groundwork for full economic recovery. In 1951, Japan and the United States signed a peace treaty that formally ended World War II and disbanded what was left of Japan’s colonial empire.
The War Weakens Imperialism The war also marked the end of Western European domination of the world. Since the 1500s, nations such as Britain, France, and Spain had exerted paramount influence on global developments. They colonized much of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and the Americas. They controlled world trade and finance, led the industrial revolution, and stood at the forefront of world military power.

World War II 417	6-8 Impact of World War II
The aggressive acquisition of territories by Japan and Germany underscored the abuses of imperialism. After World War II, colonial peoples renewed their drive for independence from European powers. Freed from Japanese domination, the East Indies had no interest in returning to Dutch colonial status.
Nor did Indochina want to see the return of French rule. India, Burma, colonies in the Middle East and Africa—all had their sights set on independence.
By the end of the war, it was clear that the Age of Imperialism was in the twilight of its existence. The British Empire, the predominant power of the nineteenth century, came out of the war suffering severe economic shortages and, within decades, would see the loss of most of its colonies.
New Superpowers Emerge Into the power vacuum stepped the United States and the Soviet Union. They had played the most decisive roles in defeating the Axis Powers, and they emerged from the war confident and strong. Indeed, they so dominated the postwar world that they became known as superpowers.
Of the two superpowers, the United States was clearly the stronger. Except for the attack on Pearl Harbor, no major battle had been fought on U.S. soil. In addition, American industry had boomed during the

war. By 1945, America was wealthy, militarily powerful, and confident. By contrast, much of the war had been fought on Soviet soil. Its industries, cities, and peoples had suffered terribly.
Still, the Red Army controlled most of Eastern Europe and threatened to move farther west. Militarily, although the Americans had the atomic bomb, the Soviets had the Red Army, the world’s largest military force.
H IDENTIFY EFFECTS
What impact did World War II have on the relative roles of the United States and Britain in the world?
International Organizations and Treaties
Americans were quick to recognize that their nation had taken on a new position in the world. After World War I, the Senate had rejected the Treaty of Versailles and refused to join the League of Nations. Many Americans now viewed these decisions as mistakes that contributed to the rise of fascism and the outbreak of another war. As World War II drew to a close, Americans were ready to embrace the idea of world organizations.
Economic Effects of World War II World War II paved the way for a restructuring of the world economy. The United States took on major responsibilities in shaping the postwar world economy.
After meeting in 1944 with the Allies in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, the U.S. government pushed for establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The United States provided most of the working capital for these new organizations, which worked to foster global economic and financial stability. The agreements made at Bretton Woods also represented another step in the shifting trend from the gold standard to fiat money. The international currency system was pegged to the U.S. dollar, with the United States agreeing to keep the price of gold at a certain level, effectively making the dollar the new standard.
In 1947, the United States signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a treaty designed to expand world trade by reducing tariffs. It went into effect on January 1,1948. Between its signing and 1993, average tarrifs dropped from 40 percent to 5 percent. Losing protective tariffs has caused some industries in the United States to suffer from competition with foreign goods but the lower tariffs

encouraged world trade in general. GATT was replaced by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995.
The United Nations Even more importantly, the United States led the charge for the establishment of the United Nations (UN), an organization that many hoped would succeed where the League of Nations had failed. In April 1945, delegates from 50 nations met in San Francisco to write the charter for the UN. The Senate overwhelmingly ratified the charter, and the UN later set up its permanent home in New York City. A major goal of the UN was to prevent further world wars or events such as the Holocaust.
The United Nations was organized on the basis of cooperation between the Great Powers, not on the absolute equality of all nations. All member nations sat on the General Assembly. However, the five major World War II Allies—the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China—were assigned permanent seats on the most powerful arm of the UN, the Security Council.
President Truman named former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to represent the United States at the UN.
As elected chair of the Commission on Human Rights, she guided the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a 1948 document that defined rights that belonged to all people in the world. It states:
Recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. . . . All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
—Universal Declaration of Human Rights
The Declaration condemns slavery and torture, upholds freedom of speech and religion, and affirms that “everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family.” Though the document sets lofty goals it has proved difficult to enforce.
Over the next decades, the UN set up a refugee agency to help people displaced by the war.
It also aided the move away from colonialism, helped to create the Jewish state of Israel, mediated

regional conflicts, and provided food and other aid to much of the world.
Not all Americans support participation in the United Nations and other international bodies. Some argue that giving decision-making authority to global organizations undermines U.S. sovereignty.
War Crimes Trials In the effort to create a better world, the Allies did not forget to punish the people who had caused so much destruction and death. During the war, the Axis Powers had repeatedly violated the Geneva Convention, an international agreement governing the humane treatment of wounded soldiers and prisoners of war.
The Allies tried more than a thousand Japanese citizens for committing atrocities in China, Korea, and Southeast Asia and brutally mistreating prisoners of war. Hundreds were condemned to death, including Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and the general responsible for the Bataan Death March.
Americans more closely followed the Nuremberg Trials, in which the Allies prosecuted Nazis for war crimes. The trials turned a glaring spotlight on the evils of the Third Reich. The first of the Nuremberg Trials involved key leaders of Nazi Germany, such as Hermann Goring. Day by day, prosecutors described

their crimes, detailing especially the horrors of the Holocaust. Most of the defendants pleaded that they were just following orders, that Hitler was the source of all the crimes. But Robert Jackson, the American prosecutor, pointed out the importance of holding former Nazi officials responsible for their actions:
No half-century ever witnessed
slaughter on such a scale, such
cruelties and inhumanities. ... If
we cannot eliminate the causes and
prevent the repetition of these barbaric
events, it is not an irresponsible
prophecy to say that this twentieth
century may yet succeed in bringing
the doom of civilization.
—-Robert Jackson, closing speech, Nuremberg War Crimes Trials, 1946
Some of the Nazis were hanged; others received long prison terms. The evidence presented at the trials increased world support for the establishment of Israel as a Jewish homeland.
In the following decades, Allied or Israeli authorities captured and tried such other Nazis as Adolf Eichmann, a leading architect of the “Final Solution," and Klaus Barbie, a Gestapo officer convicted of torturing and murdering Jews and resistance fighters in Lyon, France. The periodic trials kept alive the memory of the Nazi crimes against humanity.
K3I IDENTIFY STEPS IN A PROCESS
What Steps did the United States take to increase its role in the postwar world?
Domestic Impact of the War
A new American identity rose from World War II. Americans regarded the Nazis as totalitarian, racist, and warlike. During the war, U.S. leaders and American popular culture had emphasized that the Allies were fighting a “people’s war” for tolerance, freedom, democracy, and peace. Although many Americans felt that their country had not always lived up to that ideal, they hoped that the postwar period would usher in significant changes.
A
Leader on the Global Stage Millions of Americans had spent several years closely following the war. They had attached world maps to their walls and traced the World War II 420	6.8 Impact of World War II
paths of U.S. troops in the deserts of North Africa, the forests of Europe, and the coral islands of the Pacific. For this generation of Americans, the world had somehow become a smaller, more interconnected place. They had learned to think in global terms.
Few Americans called for a return to a policy of isolationism or retreat from their global responsibilities. They recognized that what happened in the far reaches of the globe affected them, that America’s national security was linked to world security.
Impact on the Economy and Government World War II ended the Great Depression and ushered in decades of economic growth. Expansion in world trade, spurred by GATT and other treaties, also contributed to postwar economic prosperity.
The war also redistributed wealth across the country. Defense industries and military bases in the South and West spurred people to move to these regions, which in turn created more wealth and encouraged further migration.
Like other wars, World War II led to a greater governmental influence in economic affairs. From the collection of raw materials to attempts to control inflation, the government had made the important decisions to guide the economy. In the process, it established the expanded economic role that government would play in postwar America.
The war also increased the power of the U.S. presidency. The War Powers Acts of 1941 and 1942 gave the President broad powers to conduct the war. Backed by these laws, FDR issued Executive Orders to take actions he felt necessary to win the war. These included orders that established a Censorship Board and banned hiring discrimination in government-funded defense industries. The War Powers Acts raised constitutional issues in that some felt that the greater powers of the Executive branch threatened the traditional separation of powers laid out in the Constitution.The increased use of Executive Orders as a presidential tool remains controversial today.
Demanding Equal Rights African American soldiers in World War II had clearly believed they were fighting two foes: dictatorship overseas and racism in the United States. Less than two months after Pearl Harbor, one of the nation’s leading black newspapers published a letter from a young man in Wichita, Kansas:
Being an American of dark complexion and some 26 years, these
AMERICANS
will always fight for liberty
» This 1943 poster emphasizes America as a defender of liberty. After the war, the United States continued to take on the role of leader of the Free World in opposition to the Soviet Union.

questions flash through my mind:
‘Should I sacrifice my life to live half
American?’ ‘Will things be better for the next generation in the peace to follow?’ . . .
I suggest that while we keep defense and victory in the forefront that we don’t lose sight of our fight for true democracy at home.
G.
Thompson, letter to the Pittsburgh Courier, January 31, 1942
World War II gave renewed vigor to the fight for civil rights. In this battle, African Americans were not alone. A growing number of white Americans also called for the nation to fully live up to its promise as a beacon of freedom, democracy, and justice.

The Beginning of the Cold War
Background of the Cold War
When Franklin Roosevelt died in April 1945, the nation was at a critical point. The United States was still at war. In addition, relations with the Soviet Union—one of the most important wartime allies—were beginning to break down.
Soviet Aggression Against Its Citizens The United States and the Soviet Union had been united only in their opposition to Nazi Germany. Beyond that, they had little in common. The United States was a capitalist democracy. Its citizens believed in free elections, economic and religious freedom, private property, and respect for individual differences. The Soviet Union was a dictatorship.
Under Joseph Stalin, the Communist Party made all key economic, political, and military decisions. The Soviet people could not worship as they pleased, own private property, or express their views freely. Those who opposed or questioned Stalin risked imprisonment and death.
Soviets Control Eastern Europe By the time Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill met at Yalta in February 1945, it was clear that the
436
Allies would defeat Germany. But it was unclear how Germany and the nations of Eastern Europe would be governed after the war. Soviet troops already occupied much of Eastern Europe and parts of Germany.
Stalin wanted to keep Germany weak and divided. He also wanted Eastern Europe to remain under the control of the Soviet Union. The United States and Great Britain sought a stronger, united Germany and independent nations in Eastern Europe. At the conference, Stalin agreed to establish "broadly representative” governments and free elections in Eastern Europe and to divide Germany only temporarily into zones of occupation.
Despite Stalin’s promises, nearly all of the lands occupied by the Soviet Red Army in the spring of 1945 remained under Soviet control after the war. The Eastern European countries of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, as well as the eastern portion of Germany, became satellite states controlled by the Soviet Union.
Wartime Alliance Unravels By the time Soviet, British, and U.S. leaders met at Potsdam in the summer of 1945, Harry Truman had succeeded Roosevelt as President. Truman and Clement Attlee, the new British prime minister, hoped that Stalin would confirm the decisions made at Yalta. However, Stalin refused to make a commitment to allow free elections in Eastern Europe.
Truman left Potsdam believing that the Soviet Union was “planning world conquest” and that the alliance with the Soviet Union was falling apart. With the Soviet Red Army at his command, Stalin seemed to present a real threat. Thus, the stage was set for a worldwide rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. The 46-year struggle became known as the Cold War because the two superpowers never faced each other directly in a "hot” military conflict.

Responding to the Soviet Challenge
President Truman was not the only world leader who believed that Stalin had aspirations toward world domination. Winston Churchill also spoke out forcefully against the Soviet Union. On March 5, 1946, he gave an important speech at Fulton College in Missouri, Truman’s home state. Referring to a map of Europe, Churchill noted that “an iron curtain has descended

across the Continent.”
7.1 The Beginning of the Cold War
Postwar America
East of that iron curtain, the Soviet Union was gaining more control by installing communist governments and police states and by crushing political and religious dissent. In addition, Churchill feared, the Soviets were attempting to spread communism to Western Europe and East Asia. The only solution, Churchill said, was for the United States and other democratic countries to stand firm.
Truman Faces Soviet Aggression in Eastern Europe Truman shared Churchill’s beliefs. Born in a small town in Missouri, Truman had been too poor to attend college. He was the only president in the twentieth century with no college education. Instead, he worked the family farm, fought in France during World War I, and eventually began a political career. His life was a testament to honesty, integrity, hard work, and a willingness to make difficult decisions. “The buck stops here,” was his motto as President. It meant that the person sitting in the Oval Office had the obligation to face problems head on and make hard decisions.
In 1947, no issue was more weighty than the growing crisis between the United States and the Soviet Union. After the war, a number of European and Asian countries were struggling against communist

movements supported by the Soviets. In particular, the governments of Greece and Turkey were battling communist forces seeking to gain control. Greece and Turkey needed aid, and in 1947 the United States was the only country with the resources to help them.
The Truman Doctrine Opposes Soviet Aggression
On March 12, 1947, President Truman addressed both houses of Congress. With emotion in his voice, Truman described the plight of the Greek and Turkish people. The fight they were waging, he said, was the fight that all free people had to confront. Truman requested money from Congress “to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation [conquest] by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” If the United States retreated into isolationism, he warned, the peace of the world and the welfare of the nation would be in danger. The fall of a nation to communism, Truman argued, could lead its neighbors into communism as well.
I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures. I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way. I believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes.
—President Harry S. Truman, Address Before a Joint
Session of Congress, March 12, 1947
Congress responded by voting to give $400 million in aid for Greece and Turkey. President Truman’s promise to aid nations struggling against communist movements became known as the Truman Doctrine, and it set a new course for American foreign policy.

Postwar America 438	7.1 The Beginning of the Cold War

The United States
Contains Soviet Expansion
In the July 1947 issue of the magazine Foreign Affairs, a writer who called himself “X” published an article titled “The Sources of Soviet Conduct.” The author was really George F. Kennan, an American diplomat and a leading authority on the Soviet Union. His article presented a blueprint for the American policy that became known as containment because its goal was to keep communism contained within its existing borders.
Kennan Urges a Policy of Containment Kennan contended that while Stalin was determined to expand the Soviet empire, he would not risk the security of the Soviet Union for expansion. In Kennan’s view, the Soviet Union would only expand when it could do so without serious risks. Stalin would certainly not chance war with the United States—a war that might destroy his power in the Soviet Union—just to spread communism.
Kennan cautioned his readers that there would be no quick, easy solution to the Soviet threat. Containment would require a full commitment of American economic, political, and military power:
We are going to continue for a long time to find the Russians difficult to deal with. It does not mean that they should be considered as embarked upon a do-or-die program to overthrow our society by a given date. ... In these circumstances, it is clear that the main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies.
—George Kennan, “The Sources of Soviet Conduct”
United States Responds with Marshall Plan The
containment policy’s first great success was in Western Europe. After World War II, people there confronted severe shortages of food, fuel, and medical supplies, as well as brutally cold winters.
In this environment of desperate need, Secretary of State George C. Marshall unveiled a recovery plan for Europe. In a speech at Harvard University, he warned

that without economic health, "there can be no political stability and no assured peace.”
In early 1948, Congress approved the Marshall Plan. Over the next four years, the United States gave about $13 billion in grants and loans to nations in Western Europe. The program provided food to reduce famine, fuel to heat houses and factories, and money to jump-start economic growth. Aid was also offered to the Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe, but Stalin refused to let them accept it.
The Marshall Plan provided a vivid example of how U.S. aid could serve the ends of both economic and foreign policy. The aid helped countries that desperately needed assistance. The prosperity it stimulated then helped the American economy by increasing trade. Finally, the good relationships that the aid created worked against the expansion of communism.

Soviet Aggression Drives Cold War
The front lines of the Cold War were located in Germany. The zones that were controlled by France, Britain, and the United States were combined to form West Germany. West Germany was bordered on the east by the Soviet-controlled East Germany. The Allies also controlled the western part of Berlin, a city tucked deep inside communist East Germany.
United States and Britain Respond with Berlin Airlift West Berlin was, as one Soviet leader later described it, "a bone in the throat” of the Soviet Union. Its relative prosperity and freedom stood in contrast to the bleak life of East Berliners. Stalin was determined to capture West Berlin or win other concessions from the Western allies. In June 1948, he stopped all highway, railway, and waterway traffic from western Germany into West Berlin. Without any means of receiving aid, West Berlin would fall to the communists.
Stalin was able to close roads, stop barges, and block railways, but he could not blockade the sky. As a result, the United States and Britain supplied West Berlin through a massive airlift that lasted nearly one year. Food, fuel, medical supplies, clothing, toys— everything the residents of West Berlin needed was flown into the city.
Even through rain and snow, goods arrived regularly. The Berlin airlift demonstrated to West Berlin, the Soviet Union, and the world how far the United States would go to protect noncommunist parts of Europe and contain communism.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization In May
1949, Stalin was forced to acknowledge that his attempt to blockade Berlin had failed. The Berlin airlift was a proud moment for Americans and Berliners and a major success for the policy of containment. One Berlin resident later recalled her feelings when the blockade was finally lifted:
Sheer joy—nothing else. Nothing else. Joy, and [the feeling that], ‘We have done it! And it works!’ . . . That was so very important. The West has won! I say this quite deliberately in such a crass way because you wanted to know how I felt emotionally. The West—well, we have succeeded. And

the West has won and the others have not!
—Ella Barowsky, CNN interview, 1996
The Berlin airlift demonstrated that Stalin could be contained if Western nations were prepared to take forceful action. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), formed in 1949, provided the military alliance to counter Soviet expansion. Twelve Western European and North American nations agreed to act together in the defense of Western Europe. Member nations agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them . . . shall be considered an attack against all of them.” This principle of mutual military assistance is called collective security.
In 1955, West Germany became a member of NATO. In response, the Soviet Union and its satellite states formed a rival military alliance, called the Warsaw Pact. All the communist states of Eastern Europe except Yugoslavia were members.
Like members of NATO, nations of the Warsaw Pact pledged to defend one another if attacked. Although members agreed on paper not to interfere in one
another's internal affairs, the Soviet Union continued to exert firm control over its Warsaw Pact allies.

Since the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Soviets had hoped to spread communism to every corner of the world, training foreigners in Marxist theory and revolutionary strategy. The Soviets were confident that communism would reach worldwide influence. In 1949, events in China seemed to justify their confidence.

Policy During China’s Civil War Before Japan invaded China in 1937, Nationalist leader Jiang Jieshi (zhee AHNG zhi SHEE), known in the United States as Chiang Kai-shek, had been fighting a civil war against communists led by Mao Zedong (mow zeh DUHNG). Although Jiang and Mao temporarily joined forces in an uneasy alliance to fight Japan, the civil war resumed with a new fury after the war ended. The Soviet Union supported Mao, while the United States sent several billion dollars in aid to Jiang. American leaders feared that Jiang’s defeat would create a communist superpower spanning most of Asia.
Jiang’s regime proved unequal to the task. Nationalist generals were reluctant to fight. And, while masses of Chinese people faced starvation, corrupt officials diverted U.S. aid dollars into their own pockets. By promising to feed the people, Mao won increased support.

China Falls to Communism In 1948, Mao’s forces dominated the war. Jiang appealed for American military intervention. However, the U.S. government had no intention of sending American troops to support the corrupt Jiang. In 1949, Jiang fled the Chinese mainland, taking control of the large offshore island of Taiwan. Mao’s communists then took control of the world’s most populous country, renaming it the People's Republic of China.
Mao’s victory was an immense shock to Americans. Not only was China under the control of sworn enemies of the United States, but communist regimes now controlled about one fourth of the world’s landmass and one third of its population. “Who lost China?” Americans asked. Many critics blamed the Truman administration, saying that the United States had failed to give enough support to Jiang. But Secretary of State Dean Acheson argued:
The unfortunate but inescapable fact is that the ominous result of the civil war in China was beyond the control of the government of the United States. Nothing that this country did or could have done within the reasonable limits of its capabilities could have changed the result.

Involvement in Korea The focus of attention turned to the peninsula of Korea, separated from northeast China by the Yalu River. Once controlled by Japan, Korea had been divided into two independent countries by the United States and the Soviet Union after World War II. The dividing line was set at the 38th parallel. The Soviets installed a communist government and equipped the armed forces in North Korea. The United States provided smaller amounts of aid to noncommunist South Korea.
North Korea Invades South Korea American occupation troops remained in South Korea until June t949. Their departure coincided with the communist victory in China. Soon after, North Korea began a major military buildup.

Postwar America 443	7.2 The Korean War
On June 25, 1950, North Korean forces attacked across the 38th parallel. The 90,000 North Korean troops were armed with powerful tanks and other Soviet weapons. Within days, the northerners overtook the South Korean capital city of Seoul and set out in pursuit of the retreating South Korean army.
Reasons for U.S. Involvement President Truman remembered how the policy of appeasement had failed to check the German aggression that sparked World War II. This knowledge, coupled with the U.S. policy of containment, caused Truman to announce that the United States would aid South Korea.
Within days, the UN Security Council unanimously voted to follow Truman’s lead, recommending that “the Members of the United Nations furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area.” Undoubtedly, the Soviet Union would have used its veto power to block the UN resolution if it had been present for the vote. However, it had been boycotting Security Council sessions because the UN had refused to seat Mao's People’s Republic of China.
Truman did not ask Congress for a formal declaration of war, as required by the Constitution. However, supported by the UN resolution, Truman ordered

American troops who were stationed in Japan to move to South Korea. The soldiers were mainly occupation troops who had not been trained for forced marches in monsoon rains or heavy combat in rice paddies, nor did they have the military equipment needed to stop the invasion. Soon, they joined their South Korean allies in retreating to the southeast corner of the peninsula near the city of Pusan. There, the allies held fast. As fresh supplies and troops arrived from Japan, soldiers from other UN countries joined the American and South Korean forces.
The U.S. and Its Allies Counterattack By September 1950, the UN forces were ready to counterattack. General Douglas MacArthur, the World War II hero, had a bold plan to drive the invaders from South Korea. He suspected that the rapid advance of North Korean troops had left North Korea with limited supply lines. He decided to strike at this weakness by launching a surprise attack on the port city of Inchon, well behind enemy lines. Because Inchon was such a poor landing site, with swift currents and treacherous tides, MacArthur knew that the enemy would not expect an attack there.
MacArthur’s bold gamble paid off. On the morning of September 15, 1950, U.S. Marines landed at Inchon and launched an attack on the rear guard of the North Koreans. Communist forces in South Korea began fleeing back to North Korea. By October 1950, the North Koreans had been driven north of the 38th parallel.
With the retreat of North Korean forces, U.S. officials had to decide what to do next. Should they declare their UN mandate accomplished and end the war? Or should they send their forces north of the 38th parallel and punish the communists for the invasion? Truman was concerned about the action China would take if the United States carried the war into North Korea. Chinese leaders publicly warned the Americans not to advance near its borders. But MacArthur did not take this warning seriously. He assured Truman that China would not intervene in the war. Based on this advice, the United States pushed a resolution through the UN, calling for a “unified, independent, and democratic” Korea.
Truman and MacArthur Disagree on Military Goals Highly confident, MacArthur attacked north of the 38th parallel. Despite mountainous terrain and freezing temperatures, by Thanksgiving the Allied advance had reached the Chinese border at the Yalu River. Then, on November 25, 1950, some 300,000 Chinese soldiers attacked South Korean and U.S. positions. Badly outnumbered, the UN troops were forced back.

With China now in the war, the United States confronted a major land war in Asia. It was possible that this war could not be won without huge commitments of troops and even atomic weapons. Truman steadfastly ruled out both of these options. MacArthur, who favored an invasion of China, was enraged. He distrusted Truman’s policy of a limited war fought to achieve only specific goals. As a soldier, MacArthur favored total victory.
Unable to sway Truman, the general sent a letter to the House Republican leader attacking the President’s policies. After the letter became public, Truman fired MacArthur for insubordination. There was a huge outcry in the United States, and MacArthur returned home a national hero.
H RECALL
How did President Truman react to the North Korean invasion of South Korea? Outcomes of the Korean War
By the spring of 1951, Allied forces had regrouped aud stabilized their position near the 38th parallel. The stalemate lasted until 1953. During that time, the two sides fought small, bloody battles with limited
results. At the same time, diplomats tried to devise an acceptable peace agreement.
Short-Term Outcomes of the Korean War The
stalemate was a key issue in the presidential election of 1952. Republican candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower promised that if elected he would end the war. Upon his election, he visited Korea, spoke with the troops, and studied the enemy’s fortifications.
Eisenhower became president in January 1953. The former general was convinced that only strong action would break the stalemate. When peace talks threatened to fail, he hinted that he might introduce nuclear weapons into the conflict. That warning, along with the death of Joseph Stalin, convinced the communists to settle the conflict. On July 27, 1953, after slightly more than three years of fighting, the two sides signed a cease-fire. That cease-fire is still in effect today.
Long-Term Outcomes of the Korean War There was no victory in the Korean War. North Korea remained a communist country allied to China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea stayed a noncommunist country allied to the United States and the major democracies. The two Koreas remained divided at about the 38th parallel.
Postwar America 445	7.2 The Korean War
» Ongoing military exercises between U.S. and South Korean forces, such as these on the Namhan River, emphasize the U.S. commitment to the safety and security of the South Korean people.
Yet the war had important long-term outcomes. Truman had committed U.S. troops to battle without a congressional declaration of war. This set a precedent that future Presidents would follow. The Korean War also seemed to support the growing belief among policymakers that the fall of one nation to communism could have a ripple effect throughout the region. The Korean War also led to increased military spending. By 1960, military spending accounted for nearly half of the
federal budget. More than a million U.S. soldiers were stationed around the world.
A new alliance underscored U. S. interest in Asia. Like NATO, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SE ATO) was a defensive alliance aimed at preventing the spread of communism. Its members included Pakistan, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, France, Britain, and the United States.

The Arms Race Intensifies Tensions
A change in the balance of world power is usually gradual, taking place over decades or even centuries. But sometimes, the shift happens in a blink of an eye. Such a major shift in the balance of power in the Cold War took place on September 2, 1949. Instruments in an American B-29 aircraft flying over Alaska detected unusual atmospheric radiation. The radiation cloud was drifting eastward from the direction of Siberia.
American nuclear scientists analyzed the data that the aircraft had gathered. They then reached an inescapable conclusion: The Soviet Union had set off an atomic bomb.

time, Americans sensed that the world was a much more dangerous and threatening place.
The Arms Race Speeds Up During the Cold War, specific needs resulted in scientific discoveries and technological innovations in the military. Three months after news that the Soviets had developed an atomic bomb, Truman ordered the Atomic Energy Commission to produce a hydrogen bomb. Developers predicted that the H-Bomb would be 1,000 times as powerful as an atomic bomb. They hoped it would restore the United States’ military advantage over the Soviets.
Some scientists, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein, opposed developing the H-Bomb, claiming it would only lead to a perpetual arms race. Others argued that Stalin would continue to develop more powerful weapons no matter what the United States did.
In 1952, the United States tested the first hydrogen bomb. The next year, the Soviets tested one of their own. More bombs and tests followed. Most of these tests were conducted above ground, spewing radioactive waste into the atmosphere. Atomic testing in the American west, at sites such as the Nevada desert, led to increased atmospheric radiation and

long-range health problems for people living downwind of the test sites.
During the next four decades, the United States and the Soviet Union developed and stockpiled increasingly powerful nuclear weapons. They armed planes, submarines, and missiles with nuclear warheads powerful enough to destroy each country many times over. Both sides hoped that this program of mutually assured destruction would prevent either country from actually using a nuclear device against the other. Still, the threat of nuclear destruction seemed to hang over the world like a dark cloud.

Eisenhower’s Response to Soviet Aggression
President Dwight Eisenhower knew firsthand the horrors of war and the need to defend democracy. He had led the World War II Allied invasions of North Africa, Italy, and Normandy. Having worked with top military and political leaders during the war, he was capable of speaking the language of both.
Eisenhower accepted much of Truman’s foreign policy. He believed strongly in a policy to actively contain communist aggression. Eisenhower’s secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, was an experienced diplomat who had helped organize the United Nations after World War II. Dulles endorsed the President’s vision of the role the United States should play in the world and had stood firmly behind U.S.
efforts to contain communism through involvement in Korea. Containment, Dulles believed, could prevent the possibility of a “domino effect” throughout Southeast Asia with one country after another falling under communist rule.
In their approach toward foreign policy, Eisenhower and Dulles differed significantly from both Truman and his Secretary of State, Dean Acheson. Both teams of men considered the spread of communism the greatest threat to the free world. But Eisenhower believed that Truman's approach to foreign policy had dragged the United States into an endless series of conflicts begun by the Soviet Union. These limited, regional conflicts threatened to drain the country’s resources.

Eisenhower’s Policies toward Communism
Eisenhower opposed spending billions of dollars on conventional forces, such as troops, ships, tanks, and artillery. Instead, he focused on stockpiling nuclear weapons and building the planes, missiles, and submarines needed to deliver them. He assumed that if there were a major war, it would be nuclear.
Eisenhower’s new policy drew some criticism: conservatives felt that downgrading conventional forces would weaken American defense, while liberals feared that preparing for nuclear war made such a war more likely. Still, Eisenhower’s approach did save money by providing a “bigger bang for the buck.” In 1953, the defense budget was $50.5 billion; in 1955, it dropped down to $35.8 billion.
In 1954, Dulles announced the policy of massive retaliation. The United States would respond to communist threats to its allies by threatening to use crushing, overwhelming force, perhaps even nuclear weapons.
A potential aggressor must know that he cannot always prescribe battle conditions to suit him. . . . The way to deter aggression is for the free community to be willing and able to
respond vigorously at places and with means of his choosing.
—John Foster Dulles, 1.954
Dulles further believed that only by going to the brink of war could the United States protect its allies, discourage communist aggression, and prevent war. “You have to take some chances for peace, just as you must take chances in war,” he said in 1956. Dulles’s approach became known as brinkmanship.
Stalin’s Death Eases Tensions On March 5, 1953, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin died, setting off a short power struggle. Nikita Khrushchev soon emerged as the new head of the Soviet Union. Although a communist and a determined opponent of the United States, Khrushchev was not as suspicious or as cruel as Stalin. He condemned the excesses of the Stalin regime and inched toward more peaceful relations with the democratic West.
In July 1955, Khrushchev met with Eisenhower at a conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Although the meeting yielded few significant results, it did seem to be a small move toward “peaceful coexistence” of the two powers.

International Cold War Conflicts
Peaceful co-existence was easier to imagine than it was to practice. The United States and the Soviet Union remained deeply divided. The Soviet Union would not allow free elections in the areas it controlled, and it continued to attempt to spread communism around the world. Dulles talked about “rolling back” communism and liberating the countries under Soviet rule.
Uprisings Behind the Iron Curtain: Poland and Hungary American talk of “rolling back” communist borders and Khrushchev’s talk of “peaceful coexistence” were taken seriously by people in Soviet-dominated countries behind the iron curtain. People in Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia resented the control exerted by the Soviet Union. Many hungered for more political and economic freedom.
In 1956, two uprisings shook Eastern Europe. First, workers in Poland rioted against Soviet rule and won greater control of their government. Since the Polish government did not attempt to leave the Warsaw Pact, Soviet leaders permitted the actions.
Then, encouraged by Khrushchev's words and Poland’s example, Hungarian students and workers organized huge demonstrations. They demanded that pro-Soviet Hungarian officials be replaced, that Soviet troops be withdrawn, and that noncommunist political parties be organized. Khrushchev responded brutally, sending Soviet soldiers and tanks to crush the Hungarian revolution. The Soviets executed many of the revolution’s leaders, killed hundreds of other Hungarians, and restored hard-line communists to power.
Americans could only watch these events in horror. Eisenhower’s massive retaliation approach was powerless. The United States would not use nuclear weapons—or any other weapons—to guarantee Hungarian independence from the Soviet Union.
The Hungarian revolt added a new level of hostility to international relations. At the 1956 Olympic Games, held that November in Melbourne, Australia, the bitter feelings surfaced. A water-polo match between the Soviet Union and Hungary turned violent. Sportswriters called it the “blood in the water” match.
The Suez Crisis The United States found itself involved in another Cold War conflict, this time in the Middle East. As Cold War tensions intensified, Egypts president Gamal Abdel Nasser tried to use the U.S." Soviet rivalry to his advantage.
Postwar America 450
7.3 The Cold War Intensifies
Suez Canal Region
Nasser wanted to construct a dam on the Nile River at Aswan. The United States and Britain initially offered to fund the project, but when Nasser recognized the communist People's Republic of China and opened talks with the Soviet Union, the Eisenhower administration withdrew its offer. In response, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, placing it under government control. The canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, had originally been managed by a British-French company and was protected by British armed forces.
Nasser’s action threatened the flow of Middle Eastern oil to Europe. Without consulting with Eisenhower, Britain and France plotted to get the canal back into Western hands. They joined forces with Israel, a young nation that had long suffered from raids along its border with Egypt. Britain and France used the Suez crisis as an excuse to seize control of the Suez Canal. Israel viewed Egypt’s nationalization of the canal as a violation of international law and wanted to preserve freedom for Israeli shipping.
President Eisenhower was outraged by these actions. Rather than support his Western allies, Eisenhower criticized them and refused to supply them with U.S. oil. The three nations had counted on Eisenhower's support, and when it did not come, they were forced to withdraw their troops from Egypt.
The Eisenhower Doctrine Eisenhower’s response to the attempted seizure of the Suez Canal did not mean that he was unconcerned with communist influence in the Middle East. In response to Soviet influence there and elsewhere, the President made a statement in January 1957 that became known as the Eisenhower Doctrine. Eisenhower announced that the United States would use force to help any Middle Eastern nation threatened by communism. Eisenhower used his doctrine in 1958 to justify sending troops to Lebanon to put down a revolt against its pro-American government.
The Eisenhower administration also used the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in its struggle against communism. Congress had created the CIA in 1947 as an intelligence-gathering organization. Eisenhower gave it a new task. He approved covert, or secret, CIA operations to protect American interests. In 1953, the CIA aided a coup that installed a new government in Iran. In 1954, it accomplished a similar mission in Guatemala. While both operations helped to place anticommunist leaders in power, they also created long-term resentment against the United States.
The Space Race Increases Tensions Although the United States successfully contained the spread of communism on the ground, it did suffer a setback in

space. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched a 184-pound steel ball containing a small transmitter into an orbit of Earth. The Soviets named the tiny satellite Sputnik 1. The following month they launched a much larger satellite. It carried a dog, named Laika, to see how a living creature would react to space travel. Since there was no way to return the satellite to Earth, Laika died in orbit.
The launches shocked many Americans, who had long believed that superior technology would keep the United States ahead of the Soviet Union. Would Soviet space technology give them the rocket power to launch missiles that could reach American cities?
In a state of crisis, Congress quickly approved the National Defense Education Act, a $1 billion program intended to produce more scientists and science teachers. The act authorized money for loans to enable high school and college graduates to continue their education in science. In addition, Congress created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to coordinate the space-related efforts of American scientists and the military. The space race and arms race provided some unexpected benefits that improved Americans’ quality of life, as technologies originally intended for military or space use, such as the microwave and the internet, eventually became available among the wider population.

\~/ Americans have often faced the difficult task of balancing the need to provide national security with the need to protect people’s rights and freedoms. In times of crisis, rights have sometimes been limited. Beginning in the late 1940s, the Cold War dominated American life. For some of those years, the nation was in the grip of a new Red Scare. The hunt for communists netted some spies, but it also disrupted the lives of thousands of innocent Americans.
Senator Joseph McCarthy’s accusations that communist sympathizers worked in the U.S. government led to controversial televised Senate hearings.

The Cold War influenced many aspects of American life. American soldiers fought and died in Korea. Industries hummed with activity, turning out weapons and supplies. Americans read newspaper articles about who “lost” China or who was winning the “space race.” Popular culture reflected an us-versus-them attitude—democrats versus totalitarians, capitalists versus communists, the West versus the East. In the end, the Cold War was turning out to be every bit as global and as encompassing as World War II had been.
The Second Red Scare The fear that communists both outside and inside America were working to destroy American life created a reaction known as a Red Scare. This fear was not unique to the late 1940s and 1950s. The 1917 Russian Revolution and the communists’ call for worldwide revolution had led to a similar Red Scare in 1919 and 1920. However, the Red Scare that followed World War II went deeper and wider—and lasted far longer—than the earlier one. Trumans Attorney General, J.

factories, offices, butcher stores, on street corners, and private businesses. And each carries in himself the death of our society.”
The spread of communism into Eastern Europe and Asia raised concerns that American communists, some in influential government positions, were working for the enemy. In truth, some American communists were agents of the Soviet Union, and a handful of them held high-ranking positions in government. However, overwhelmingly, government officials were loyal to the United States.
Recognizing public concern about domestic communism, President Truman used an executive order to create a Federal Employee Loyalty Program in March 1947. The order permitted the FBI and other government security agencies to screen federal employees for signs of political disloyalty. About 3,000 federal employees either were dismissed or resigned after the investigation.
The order also empowered the Attorney General to compile a list of “totalitarian, fascist, or subversive organizations” in the United States. Americans who belonged to or supported organizations on the Attorney General’s list were singled out for more intense scrutiny. Many were labeled “security risks” and dismissed from their jobs.
The Truman administration also used the 1940 Smith Act to cripple the Communist Party in the United States. This act made it unlawful to teach or advocate the violent overthrow of the U.S. government. In 1949, a New York jury found 11 communists guilty of violating the Smith Act and sent them to prison.
The House Un-American Activities Committee
Congress joined in the search for communists. In 1938, the House of Representatives had created the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) to
investigate possible subversive activities by fascists, Nazis, or communists. After the war, the committee conducted several highly publicized hearings on communist activities in the United States. Cold War fears were intensified by HUAC investigators, who probed the government, armed forces, unions, education, science, newspapers, and other aspects of American life.
The best-known HUAC hearings targeted the movie industry in 1947. The HUAC investigations uncovered people who were, or had been, communists during the 1930s and 1940s. A group of left-wing writers, directors, and producers known as the Hollywood Ten refused to answer questions, asserting their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. The hearings turned into a war of attacks and counterattacks as committee

members and witnesses yelled at each other and pointed accusatory fingers.
After the hearings, the Hollywood Ten were cited for contempt of Congress and were tried, convicted, and sent to prison. Movie executives circulated a blacklist of entertainment figures who should not be hired because of their suspected communist ties. The careers of those on the list were shattered. Not until the case of Watkins v. United States (1957) did the Supreme Court decide that witnesses before HUAC could not be forced to name radicals they knew.
The HUAC investigation had a powerful impact on filmmaking. In the past, Hollywood had been willing to make movies about controversial subjects such as racism and anti-Semitism. Now, most producers concentrated only on entertainment and avoided addressing sensitive social issues.
Red Scare Intensifies Cold War Fears The case of the Hollywood Ten demonstrated that in the mood of fear created by Soviet aggression, freedom of speech was not guaranteed. Americans lost their jobs because they had belonged to or contributed to an organization on the Attorney General’s list. Others were fired for associating with people who were known communists or for making remarks that were considered disloyal. Teachers and librarians, mail carriers and longshoremen, electricians and construction workers—people from all walks of life—might be accused and dismissed from their jobs.
The effort to root out communist influence from American life cut across many levels of society. Communists were exposed and blacklisted in the country’s academic institutions, labor unions, scientific laboratories, and city halls. No one was above suspicion. The case of J. Robert Oppenheimer illustrates the difficulty of distinguishing loyalty from disloyalty. During World War II, Oppenheimer had led the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. After the war, he became chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). However, Oppenheimer had ties to people who belonged to the Communist Party, including his wife and brother.
In 1954, the AEC denied Oppenheimer access to classified information. Although the AEC had no evidence that Oppenheimer himself had ever been disloyal to the United States, it questioned whether his communist ties disqualified him from holding this position.

Domestic Spy Cases
Increase Fears
Two sensational spy trials drew the nation’s attention to the threat posed by communist agents working to subvert the United States. The accused in the two cases could not have been more different. Alger Hiss had been educated at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Law School. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were from the poor, lower east side of Manhattan. Although Hiss and the Rosenbergs never met, their crimes and their trials have linked them in the public’s imagination.
HUAC
Investigates Alger Hiss Until 1948, Alger Hiss’s career seemed flawless. A seemingly dedicated government servant, Hiss had worked on several important New Deal agencies and helped to organize the United Nations. But a man named Whittaker Postwar America 455	7.4 Cold War Fears at Home
Chambers disputed Hiss’s image. As a young man, Chambers had become a communist espionage agent. But Chambers later turned against communism because of the brutality of Stalin’s rule. Chambers began writing compellingly about the evils of communism. In 1948, he testified before HUAC about his communist past and named Alger Hiss as one of his contacts in the federal government.
Hiss soon appeared before HUAC. He denied that he was a communist and an espionage agent, and he denied that he even knew Whittaker Chambers. But Richard Nixon, a young member of Congress from California, convinced the other committee members to press the case. Slowly, Hiss’s story began to unravel. Chambers proved that he did know Hiss and that Hiss had given him confidential government documents. Chambers had even kept a microfilm copy of some of those documents, storing them in a hollowed-out pumpkin on his Maryland farm.
Hiss was tried for perjury. The first trial ended in a hung jury. At his second trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. Even after his conviction, many Americans continued to believe that Hiss was innocent. However, as years passed, the evidence grew overwhelmingly against him. The fact that someone as influential as Hiss was a communist

agent raised serious concerns. The Hiss case had another unexpected effect. The congressional hearings thrust Richard Nixon into the national spotlight. In 1952, he was named Eisenhower’s running mate and would later become President.
The Rosenbergs and the Venona Papers Nothing created more concern about internal security than the charge that some Americans had helped the Soviets build an atomic bomb. The case began when a scientist named Klaus Fuchs was charged with sending atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. The investigation against Fuchs ultimately led to the arrest of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg in 1950. The Rosenbergs were charged with conspiring to pass secret information about nuclear science to Soviet agents.
The trial of the Rosenbergs generated intense controversy in America and around the world. The case against them was based largely on the word of one confessed spy. Pleading innocent, the Rosenbergs claimed that they were being persecuted for being Jewish and for holding unpopular beliefs. In the end, both were found guilty and sentenced to death. Many believed that the harsh sentence was intended as a lever to force them to identify other members of the alleged spy ring. But the Rosenbergs claimed they had no such information. After 26 months on death row, the Rosenbergs were electrocuted in 1953.
Years of debate followed the executions. Some insisted that anti-Semitic sentiment led to the Rosenbergs’ conviction and death. However, in 1995, the U. S. National Security Agency released secret Soviet messages that the United States had intercepted in the 1940s, known as the Venona Papers. The papers revealed the names of many Americans who spied for the Soviet Union. These documents confirmed the guilt of some of those investigated by HUAC, including the Rosenbergs and Alger Hiss.

clever and unscrupulous man began to take advantage of this sense of fear and helplessness. He suggested that these setbacks were really caused by the work of traitors inside the United States.
The Rise of Senator Joe McCarthy In February 1950, a little-known senator from Wisconsin made a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia. The senator, Joseph R. McCarthy, charged that the State Department was infested with communist agents. He waved a piece of paper, which, he said, contained the names of State Department employees who were secretly communists.
The reason why we find ourselves in a position of [weakness] is not because the enemy has sent men to invade our shores, but rather because of the traitorous actions of those who have had all the benefits that the wealthiest nation on earth has had to offer—the finest homes, the finest college educations, and the finest jobs in Government we can give. .
. . I have here in my hand a list of 205 [individuals] that were known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping the policy of the State Department.
- Joseph McCaithy, February 9, 1950
The charge provoked a furor. When challenged to give specific names, McCarthy said he had meant that there were “205 bad security risks” in the department. Then he claimed that 57 employees were communists. Over the next months, the numbers on his list changed. McCarthy never did produce the list of communists. Still, with the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, McCarthy’s accusations grabbed the attention of the American public.
At the time of the above speech, McCarthy was finishing his first term in the Senate. He had accomplished very little in that term and was looking for a popular issue on which to focus his 1952 reelection campaign. Anticommunism seemed to be just the issue. McCarthy was easily reelected to a second term.
The Methods of McCarthyism In the following four years, McCarthy put forward his own brand

of anticommunism—so much so that the term McCarthyism became a catchword for extreme, reckless charges. By making irresponsible allegations, McCarthy did more to discredit legitimate concerns about domestic communism than any other single American. Between 1950 and 1954, McCarthy was perhaps the most powerful politician in the United States. Piling baseless accusations on top of charges that could not be proved, McCarthy became chairman of an investigations subcommittee. Merely being accused by McCarthy caused people to lose their jobs and destroyed their reputations. He attacked ruthlessly. When caught in a lie, he told another.
When one case faded, he introduced a new one. Confident because of his increasing power, McCarthy took on larger targets. He attacked former Secretary of State George Marshall, a national hero and author of the Marshall Plan. Even other senators came to fear McCarthy. They worried that he would brand them as communist sympathizers.
McCarthy Loses Support In 1954, McCarthy went after the United States Army, claiming that it, too, was full of communists. Army leaders responded that McCarthy’s attacks were personally motivated.
Postwar America 457 ;	7.4 Cold War Fears at Home
» Republican Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine so strongly opposed McCarthy’s tactics that she made her “Declaration of Conscience” on the Senate floor in June 1950.
Finally, the Senate decided to hold televised hearings to sort out the allegations. For weeks, Americans were riveted to their television sets. Most were horrified by McCarthy’s bullying tactics. For the first time, the public saw McCarthy badger witnesses, twist the truth, and snicker at the suffering of others. It was an upsetting sight for many Americans.
By the time the hearings ended in mid-June, the senator had lost many of his strongest supporters. The
Senate formally censured, or condemned, him for his reckless accusations. Although McCarthy continued to serve in the Senate, he had lost virtually all of his power and influence.
The end of the Korean War in 1953 and McCarthy’s downfall in 1954 signaled the decline of the Red Scare. The nation had been damaged by the suppression of free speech and by the lack of open, honest debate. However, Americans had come to realize how important their democratic institutions were and how critical it was to preserve them.

After World War II, many Americans worried that the war’s end would bring renewed economic depression. Numerous economists shared this pessimistic view of the future, predicting that the American economy could not produce enough jobs to employ all those who were returning from the military. Yet instead of a depression, Americans experienced the longest period of economic growth in American history, a boom that enabled millions of Americans to enter the middle class. This era of sustained growth fostered a widespread sense of optimism about the nation’s future.

Postwar Prosperity

Causes and Effects of Prosperity in the 1950s
At the end of the war in August 1945, more than 12 million Americans were in the military. Thousands of American factories were churning out ships, planes, tanks, and all the materials required to help fight the war in the Pacific. Virtually overnight, both the need for such a huge military machine and the focus on war production came to an end. Orders went out from Washington, D.C., canceling defense contracts, causing millions of defense workers to lose their jobs. Wartime industries had to be converted to meet peacetime needs.
As Americans set about enjoying the fruits of peace, President Harry Truman responded to calls to “bring the boys home for Christmas by starting the demobilization, or sending home members of the army. By July 1946, only 3 million remained in the military.
Americans were happy that the war was over, but they retained some sense of unease about the future. One poll taken in the fall of 1945 showed that 60 percent of Americans expected their earnings to fall with the return of a peacetime economy. “The American soldier is . . . worried sick about postwar joblessness, Fortune magazine observed.

Impact of the Gl Bill To help deal with this anxiety, the federal government enacted the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, also popularly known as the Gl Bill of Rights. It granted veterans a variety of benefits. It provided a year of unemployment payments to veterans who were unable to find work. Those who attended college after the war received financial aid. The act also entitled veterans to government loans for building homes and starting businesses.
The Gl bill had an enormous impact on American society. Home loans to veterans fueled an upsurge in home construction, which led to explosive growth in suburban areas. Perhaps the greatest contribution of the Gl bill came in education. The average soldier was inducted into the armed forces at the time when he or she would have been finishing high school.
The bill encouraged veterans to enter or return to college. Each veteran was eligible to receive $500 a year for college tuition. The bill also provided $50 a month for living expenses and $75 a month for married veterans. Eight million veterans eventually took advantage of the education benefits.

Baby Boom Increases Consumption Upon their return, soldiers quickly made up for lost time by marrying and having children. Americans had put off having children because of the depression and war. Now, confident that the bad times were behind them, many married couples started families. This led to what population experts termed a baby boom. In 1957, at the peak of the baby boom, one American baby was born every 7 seconds, a grand total of 4.3 million for the year. One newspaper columnist commented, “Just imagine how much these extra people . . . will absorb—in food, in clothing, in gadgets, in housing, in services. . . .” Between 1940 and 1955, the U.S. population experienced its greatest increase, growing 27 percent from about 130 to about 165 million.
Postwar Inflation Fortunately, unemployment did not materialize, nor did a depression return. However, Americans experienced some serious economic problems. The most painful was skyrocketing prices. With war’s end, the federal government ended rationing and price controls, both of which had helped keep inflation in check during the war. A postwar rush to buy goods created severe inflationary pressures. There was just too much money to spend on too few goods. Overall, prices rose about 18 percent in 1946. The price of some products, such as beef, nearly doubled within a year.

and limited economic growth. The end of wartime restrictions finally opened the floodgates to consumer purchases. As demand soared, businesses employed more people to produce goods. This created a cycle in which people bought new goods, leading businesses to hire more workers, who in turn bought more goods.
At the end of World War II, the United States was the only developed nation largely untouched by the devastation. Although it had only 6 percent of the world’s population, the United States produced about 50 percent of the world’s total output. The free enterprise system allowed Americans to enjoy a higher standard of living than any other nation in the world.
Technological Progress Enhances Productivity
The American economy benefited from numerous technological advances during the postwar period. Some developments, such as the use of atomic energy, were the result of war research. The use of computers increased, and businesses gradually began to depend on them. Farms benefited from improved machinery and chemicals, allowing farmers to grow more crops with fewer laborers. Worker productivity—the rate at which goods are produced or services performed— continued to improve, largely because of new technology.
Military Spending Supports Growth Increased government spending boosted the economy, too. The Cold War had a number of economic effects. With the outbreak of the Korean War and the escalating Cold War with communist nations in Europe and Asia, the United States once again committed a significant part of its budget to defense spending. Military spending led to the development of new technologies and new materials, such as plastics and new light metal alloys, that found widespread use outside the military. Other large federal spending programs, such as the Marshall Plan, initiated foreign demand for goods made in the United States.

Americans Migrate to the Sunbelt
In 1958, two New York baseball teams—the Dodgers and the Giants—moved to California. Their move reflected another crucial trend of the postwar era, the growth of the Sunbelt, the name given to the southern and western states. By the mid-1960s, California passed New York as the state with the largest population. The migration to Sunbelt cities, such as Houston, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, continued for the rest of the twentieth century.
Causes of Migration Many factors played a role in attracting people to the Sunbelt. A warm, sunny climate drew some Americans. A booming industrial economy and rapidly growing cities attracted people to Texas, which added more than 3 million new residents in the 1940s and 1950s. The explosive growth of the aerospace and electronics industries also attracted newcomers to the Sunbelt.
The development of air conditioning also played a major role. Invented in 1902, air conditioners were at first used only in public buildings, such as movie theaters and courthouses. But after World War II, the development of window units made it possible to cool
homes. Northerners who had visited states like Florida, Texas, or Arizona only in winter could now live in hotter climates all year round.
Latinos contributed to the growth of the Sunbelt. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, many Cubans, who were escaping the new regime of Fidel Castro, made Miami, Florida, their new home. Prior to World War II, most Mexican Americans lived in rural areas. However, by the 1960s, the majority of them migrated to urban areas, such as Los Angeles, El Paso, and Phoenix.
Effects of Migration on Society and the Environment The shift to the suburbs and the Sunbelt had a momentous impact on American society. As people moved, their political power went with them. Thus, suburbs and the Sunbelt gained representation. Urbanites in the Northeast and Midwest lost political power. Texas, for example, gained eleven new seats in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1940 and 2000.
Urban and suburban growth created environmental concerns, ranging from traffic jams and smog to water shortages. To meet growing populations, communities utilized once valuable open lands for housing, schools, roads, new businesses, and parking lots. In the 1960s

Q CHECK UNDERSTANDING
What motivated so many Americans to migrate to the Sunbelt?
Innovations and Economic Development
The important postwar population shifts were matched by equally groundbreaking structural changes in the American economy. For the first time in American history, more people found employment in the service sector—businesses that provide services, such as healthcare, law, retail, banking, or insurance—than in the manufacturing sector. These shifts led some to describe the United States as a postindustrial society.
Innovative Computers Drive Economic Growth
Between 1947 and 1957, the percentage of the American workforce employed in industrial or blue-collar jobs declined 4 percent. During the same time period, employment in the service sector, or white-collar jobs, rapidly grew.
The new workforce included many who worked in information industries, including those who built or operated the first computers. These computers were enormous. One of the first, named ENIAC, short for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, took up roughly 18,000 square feet, or the size of three basketball courts! Despite its size, it was less powerful than today’s desktop computer.
Still, ENIAC was a remarkable advance. By the 1960s, the government and private industry had found many uses for the computer. Hotels used computers to help make reservations, and banks used them to keep track of accounts. Industries started using computers to automate work or perform jobs once done by people. All these technological innovations clearly revealed that the free enterprise system was improving the standard of living in the United States.
Changes in the Labor Force Meanwhile, the number of women in the labor force continued to grow, doubling between 1940 and 1960. Many of these women worked part time. Few pursued long-term careers and most remained underpaid. Yet without their paychecks, their families would have found it difficult to remain in the middle class.
While the service sector grew rapidly, both the number and the percentage of Americans who made a living by farming continued to decline. In 1935, one fourth of the nation’s families lived on farms. By 1960,
» During the 1950s, many Americans moved to the warm and sunny South and West, the so-called “Sunbelt.” Huge developments, like Lakeland Park in California, met their need for housing.
less than one in ten families did. At the same time, improvements in technology, ranging from mechanical cotton pickers to chemical pesticides, made agriculture much more productive. This allowed fewer workers to grow even more food. New irrigation systems helped transform much of the land in the Southwest from arid to fertile fields.
The Role of Entrepreneurs At home, the postwar era saw the rise of franchise businesses. A franchise business allows a company to distribute its products or services through retail outlets owned by independent operators.
Franchises were attractive to consumers because they stressed quality and sameness, no matter where one was in the United States. The Holiday Inn franchise came into existence following a trip that home builder Kemmons Wilson took to Washington, D.C., with his family of five children. Frustrated, Wilson found hotels difficult to locate, overpriced, and lacking adequate parking facilities. As he traveled, according to author David Halberstam, "Wilson became more irritated until he turned to his wife and announced that he was going into the hotel business. Everyone in this country, he thought, had a car and a family, and sooner or later
Postwar America | 463 1 7.5 Postwar Prosperity
everyone had to go somewhere.” Today, there are tens of thousands of Holiday Inn hotels all over the world.
Many postwar critics lamented the growth of franchise businesses. For them, the franchises represented a growing lack of originality, evidence that the United States was becoming a “bland” nation in which people ate bland food, lived in bland look-alike houses, and watched bland television shows that followed the same plot line.
Entrepreneurs Lead Management Innovations
The transition from an industry-based to a service-based economy created opportunities for entrepreneurs. For example, Californians Richard and Maurice McDonald opened their new restaurant in 1948. The brothers emphasized efficiency, low prices, high volume, and quick service. They did away with anything that slowed down the process, including plates, glasses, dishwashing, and tipping. In 1955, Ray Kroc began to franchise McDonald’s system and name. By the end of the century, McDonald’s had become the most successful food service organization in history, and the name McDonald’s came to stand for low-priced, standardized-quality food.
Other entrepreneurs’ names also came to represent their businesses. For example, Wal-Mart, a discount merchandising business founded by Sam Walton,
became one of the most successful businesses in the late twentieth century. Another entrepreneur, Estee Lauder, founded a cosmetics company that specialized in skin care and protection products.
Lauder’s focus on selling her products only in high-end department stores created a $100 million dollar business by the 1970s. Walton and Lauder are just two of the millions of small business entrepreneurs whose businesses grew, allowing them to achieve the American dream.

American Corporations Go Multinational As the postwar economy expanded, so did multinational corporations, companies that produced and sold their goods and services all over the world and established branches abroad. General Motors, General Electric, and IBM produced a larger and larger share of all of the goods sold. Changing business strategies and management innovations allowed many of these corporations to earn large portions of their profits abroad. Coca Cola, for instance, sold its soft drinks all over the globe. Hollywood movies found eager audiences in Tokyo, Mexico City, and Germany.
Effects of Prosperity on Labor The prosperity of the 1950s was reflected in generally good times for the labor movement. In 1955, the AFL and the CIO, which had split in the mid-1980s, united to form the AFL-CIO. The new organization enjoyed a good deal of political clout, especially within the Democratic Party Yet trade unions also lost some momentum during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Most of the new white-collar workers did not join unions, and labor’s image was tarnished by a corruption scandal involving the Teamsters Union. Government investigators accused the Teamsters, who represented truck drivers, of illegally using their members’ funds.

Truman’s Postwar
Leadership
As the postwar economy evolved and new demographic patterns changed society, American leaders faced rapidly shifting domestic and foreign political landscapes. On April 12,1945, when Franklin Roosevelt died, Harry S. Truman had been Vice President for only 4 months. When Eleanor Roosevelt told him that her husband had died, Truman responded, “Is there anything I can do for you?” She replied, “Is there

anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now.”
Eleanor Roosevelt’s remark captured Harry Truman’s predicament. He had to preside over one of the more difficult times in American history. The postwar years saw the beginning of the Cold War and communist takeovers in Europe and Asia. At home, there was inflation and labor unrest. Communist advances and a troubled domestic economy created a sense of deep unrest in the American public during the Truman years.
Relationships with Congress and Labor From the first days of his presidency, Truman faced a double-barreled challenge: a restless labor movement and a combative Republican Party. Trade unionists demanded pay increases to keep up with inflation. When employers refused to meet labor’s demands, millions of steel, coal, railroad, and automotive workers went on strike.
The wave of strikes was one of the largest in American history. It prompted Congress to enact the Taft-Hartley Act, a law that outlawed the closed shop—a workplace in which only union members can be hired. Taft-Hartley rolled back some of the rights that labor unions had gained during the New Deal. Although Truman vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress overrode his veto.
Support for Civil Rights Unlike FDR, who feared challenging the power of white southern senators and representatives, Truman refused to remain passive. He established a special committee on civil rights to investigate race relations. The committee made several recommendations for civil rights reforms.
However, Congress rejected the recommendations and did not pass any meaningful civil rights reforms until the late 1950s. Truman also issued an executive order desegregating the military. This was more successful. By 1951, most units had been integrated.
Truman Defeats Dewey By the spring of 1948, Truman’s standing had sunk so low that he faced challenges from both the right and the left in his own Democratic Party. Southern Democrats, angry at Truman’s support for civil rights, left the party and established the States' Rights Party. They named South Carolina governor Strom Thurmond as their candidate for President. At the other end of the political spectrum, Henry Wallace, who had been Vice President during FDR’s third term, broke with Truman over foreign policy issues. Wallace became the candidate of a new Progressive Party.
» Unmet demands for pay raises in the face of inflation led to labor unrest, such as this strike at a Pittsburgh steel mill, during the Truman administration.
The breakaway of two large blocs of Democrats was accompanied by the Republican Party's nomination of Thomas Dewey, the well-known governor of New York, for President. Few people thought that Truman had any chance of winning the 1948 election. Truman, however, did not see it that way.
He staged an energetic “whistle stop” train tour of the nation, delivering over 300 speeches and traveling 31,000 miles in a matter of weeks. At train stops in small towns, Truman attacked the current Congress as “do nothing” and the worst in history. “Give ’em hell, Harry!” some in the crowd would cry out during his speeches. Although every political poll predicted that Dewey would win easily, Truman won by a narrow victory. He had managed the political upset of the century.
Consequences of Truman’s Presidency Shortly after the election, Truman announced a far-ranging legislative program, which he called the Fair Deal. The Fair Deal, he explained, would strengthen existing New Deal reforms and establish new programs, such as national health insurance. But Congress was not in a reforming mood, and Truman failed to win approval for most of his Fair Deal proposals.
Legislative failure and a stalled war in Korea contributed to Truman’s loss of popularity. He chose not to seek the 1952 Democratic nomination. His reputation, however, has improved through the years. Today, many historians applaud him for his common-

U RECALL
Why was Truman’s victory in 1948 so surprising?
Eisenhower Leads a
Thriving Nation
The 1952 election was hardly a contest. The Republican candidate, Dwight Eisenhower, was so popular that both the Democratic and Republican parties had wanted him as their presidential candidate. Eisenhower, whose nickname was Ike, charmed the public with his friendly smile, reassuring personality, and record of service and honesty. The Democratic candidate, Adlai
Stevenson, a senator from Illinois, failed to catch the popular imagination the way Eisenhower did.
Dwight Eisenhower had spent nearly his entire adult life in the military and had never held a political office before 1952. Thus, Americans could not know for certain which way he would guide the nation upon taking office. However, most Americans believed that Eisenhower’s calm personality mirrored his political views and that he would keep to the “middle road," achieving a balance between liberal and conservative positions.
Eisenhower charted a middle course as President. While he shared the conservative view that the federal government had grown too strong, he did not repeal existing New Deal programs, such as Social Security and the minimum wage. Federal spending actually increased during his presidency. Eisenhower even introduced several large new programs. For example, he created an interstate highway system and began to spend federal dollars for education, specifically to train more scientists.
One reason for Eisenhower’s popularity was the strength of the American economy during the 1950s. His presidency was one of the most prosperous, peaceful, and politically tranquil in the twentieth century.

The 1950s marked a period of changing national population distribution. Between 1940 and 1960, more than 40 million Americans moved to the suburbs, one of the largest mass migrations in history. Rural regions suffered the most dramatic decline in population, but people also came by the thousands from older industrial cities, seeking, as one father put it, a place where “a kid could grow up with grass stains on his pants.” During the same time period, many older industrial cities lost population.

Suburban Migration
Causes and Effects of Suburban Growth People flocked to the suburbs in part because the nation suffered from a severe shortage of urban housing. During the depression and World War II, new housing construction had come to a near standstill. At war's end, as Americans married and formed families, they went in search of a place they could call their own.
Fortunately, at this time of peak demand, developers figured out how to build affordable housing in a hurry. William Levitt became a leader in mass producing suburban homes. Entire rows of houses in Levittown, a suburb of New York City on Long Island, were built using the same plan. This method enabled workers to build houses in weeks rather than in months. On the installment plan, buyers could pay $58 a month toward the cost of a home. Demand for the homes was so great that Levitt built two other Levittowns—one outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the other in New Jersey. These houses were ideal foi young couples starting out because they were affordable and comfortable. Other developers adopted Levitt’s innovative techniques, and suburbs were soon springing up across the country.

Suburban development benefited from investment by the government. State and federal governments constructed thousands of miles of highways that linked the suburbs to cities. New home buyers also benefited from the GI bill and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which provided low-interest loans. FHA-backed loans allowed home buyers to pay as little as 5 to 10 percent of the purchase price and to pay off their mortgages over 30 years.
Residents of new suburbs faced the challenge of establishing new towns with churches, synagogues, schools, and police and fire departments. Through these institutions, the suburbanites forged a sense of community. During the 1950s, the suburbs became increasingly self-contained. While suburban residents of earlier generations had depended on the city for entertainment and shopping, the postwar suburban dweller could find a vast array of goods and services in nearby shopping centers.
Interstates Support Migration and Prosperity
Free enterprise was supported by government policy to improve the quality of life in suburban communities. Committed to the idea of easing automobile travel, President Eisenhower authorized the first funding of the interstate system in 1953. Further legislation
» President Eisenhower authorized funding of the massive new interstate highway system. One outcome was that new suburbanites could more easily commute by car to jobs in major cities.
passed by Congress in 1956 resulted in the Interstate Highway Act, which authorized funds to build 41,000 miles of highway consisting of multilane expressways that would connect the nation’s major cities.
Such expressways, Eisenhower argued, would safely carry the nation’s growing automobile traffic, boost economic prosperity, and provide a valuable transportation network to strengthen national defense. This represented the biggest expenditure on public works in history, bigger by far than any project undertaken during the New Deal. In 1990, further recognition of President Eisenhower’s role in establishing the massive highway system led to a renaming of the highways. It became the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways.
Besides easing commutes from suburbs to cities, highways boosted the travel and vacation industries. Vacationers drove to national parks, to beaches, and to new destinations, such as Las Vegas. With more money and more children, families sought leisure activity. Walt Disney met this demand by building an extraordinary amusement park in California. Disneyland excited the imagination with visions of the future, including make-believe rides in space.
Technological Innovations Lead to the “Car Culture” During the 1920s, automobile ownership had soared in the United States. With the explosion of suburban growth in the 1950s, Americans grew even more dependent upon their cars. The number of registered automobiles jumped from 26 million in 1945 to 60 million in 1960.
These new automobiles tended to have big engines and enormous horsepower. They came with the newest technology, such as power steering and brakes and automatic transmissions. Harley Earl of the Ford Motor Company captured the mood of the 1950s by designing cars with lots of chrome that reminded people of jet planes.
While some suburbanites rode the train or other forms of mass transportation, Americans increasingly depended upon their cars to commute to work. Suburbanites also needed their cars to shop at suburban shopping malls. Entrepreneurs opened fast-food restaurants and drive-in movie theaters, both of which catered to the car culture. While these businesses flourished, many older businesses, often located in older city neighborhoods, struggled to survive.

» Analyze Data How did the percentage change in the top two income brackets shown affect U.S. consumer culture?
Increased Consumption and Consumerism
For much of our history, Americans had been taught to save their money. “A penny saved is a penny earned,” advised Benjamin Franklin. However, as the U.S. economy began to boom in the postwar era, Americans were caught up in a wave of consumerism, buying as much as they could, much of it on credit. What accounted for this spending spree?
Free Enterprise System Improves Standards of
Living One reason Americans spent more was that they had more money to spend. During the 1950s, median family income, or average family income, rose from $3,319 to $5,417.
The average American family now had twice as much real income as the average family had during the prosperous years of the 1920s. Consumer-oriented companies found new and innovative ways to encourage buying on credit. For example, General Motors advertised its cars with the slogan “Buy Now, Pay Later.” The Diner’s Club introduced the first credit card.
Technological Innovations Drive New Conveniences Embracing the free-enterprise system, American businesses developed technological and Purchasing innovations that improved the standard
of living. Home appliances topped the list of the goods that Americans bought. Families purchased electric washing machines and dryers, refrigerators and ranges. These labor-saving appliances helped transform housework, lessening the physical demands of everything from washing clothes to preserving foods.
With money to spend, easy credit, and new goods to buy, shopping became a new pastime for Americans. Supermarkets, where customers could buy everything from milk to mops, appeared. Shopping centers sprouted all over suburbia.
One product that Americans bought in record numbers was a television. In 1946, manufacturers produced fewer than 6,000 TV sets. Seven years later, Americans purchased 7 million sets, and by the end of the decade, 90 percent of all households owned a television.

peacetime, they embraced traditional ideals of family life and community.
The “Ideal” American Family During World War II, many women—including married women with children — had gone off to work in factories. In 1943, women made up 25 percent of the workers in the wartime auto industry. With the war’s end, however, most of the women who had entered the workforce returned to being homemakers. Now, a more traditional image of the family took hold, one in which women stayed home and men served as “breadwinners.” Women who wanted a career outside the home faced social pressures to rethink their decisions.
During the 1950s, the ideal family was one in which men worked and supported their families and women stayed home and reared their children. In the popular magazines of the postwar era, social scientists and other opinion makers described the nuclear family, or a household consisting of a mother and father and their children, as the backbone of American society. For the nuclear family to function smoothly, experts claimed, women had to accept their role as homemakers. Television shows and movies made similar assertions. For example, in the 1955 Hollywood movie The Tender Trap, actress Debbie Reynolds declared, “A woman isn’t a woman unless she’s been married and had children.”
» Women in the 1950s were encouraged to return to traditional family roles by staying home to raise families.
As the 1950s progressed, however, more women were willing to challenge the view that a woman could not have a career outside the home. By 1960, women held one third of the nation’s jobs. Approximately half of these women workers were married.
Baby Boom Increases Focus on Children More so than in the past, family life revolved around children. Not surprisingly, the best-selling book of the era was Dr.
Benjamin Spock’s Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care. Parents bought and read his book because they wanted expert advice on how to raise their children. Spock emphasized the importance of nurturing children, from their earliest days as infants through their teen years. Mothers, Spock suggested, should not worry about spoiling their children because children could not get too much comfort and love. Some criticized Spock for promoting what they called “a permissive culture.” Nevertheless, Spock’s book remained extremely popular for several decades.
Another sign of the degree to which family life revolved around children was the amount of money parents spent on their children. Some parents defended their spending by arguing that such spending guaranteed against the recurrence of another depression.
As baby boomers became teens, their impact on the economy and American culture became even more noticeable. While as children they received toys, such as Davy Crockett caps and Barbie dolls, as teens they purchased very expensive items. As LIFE magazine observed:
The time is past when a boy’s chief possession was his bike and a girl’s party wardrobe consisted of a fancy dress worn with a string of dime-store pearls. . . . Today’s teenagers surround themselves with a fantastic array of garish and often expensive baubles and amusements. They own 10 million phonographs, over a million TV sets, 13 million cameras.

Billy Graham Contributes to a Religious Revival
The 1950s also witnessed a revival of religion in the United States. Organized religious groups became more powerful and more houses of worship were built. Regular church attendance rose from about 50 million in
Postwar America
7.6 Mass Culture in the 1950s
1940 to about 80 million in 1958. The increased number of churches and synagogues in suburban communities across the country helped to strengthen community ties. The evangelist Billy Graham attracted millions to religious revivals that he held around the nation.
Roman Catholic bishop Fulton Sheen effectively used television to reach audiences estimated at 10 million a week. During the 1950s, Congress added the words “In God We Trust” to the dollar bill and “under God," to the Pledge of Allegiance. These additions were aimed at making clear the contrast between the centrality of religion in American society and the atheist basis of communist societies.
Specific Needs Lead to Medical Innovations
During the 1950s, American families benefited from numerous advances in medicine. By 1952, Dr. Jonas Salk was refining a vaccine against polio, the disease that had struck down Franklin Roosevelt and that, in 1952 alone, had crippled tens of thousands and killed 1,400, mostly children. By 1960, the widespread distribution of Salk’s new vaccine and an oral vaccine developed by Albert Sabin had nearly eliminated the disease.
At the same time, antibiotics, such as penicillin, came into widespread use.
The antibiotics helped control numerous infectious diseases caused by bacteria, such as whooping cough and tuberculosis. As a result of these medical advances and a better understanding of the importance of diet, children born after 1946 had a longer life expectancy than those born before 1946.

teenagers help develop prosperity during the 1950s?
Educational Opportunities and Priorities
As the economy grew, so too did opportunities for Americans to attain higher education. A more educated workforce boosted economic productivity. In 1940, only about 15 percent of college-age Americans attended college. By the early 1960s, however, close to 40 percent did. The percentage of Americans who completed high school also rose sharply. "The astonishing growth of education in the late 1940s (and thereafter),” wrote historian James Patterson, "seemed yet another sign that the American Dream was well and alive.”
Defense Spending Shapes Education Priorities
New priorities meant that students had expanded opportunities. In Texas, for example, the state

legislature passed laws guaranteeing young people the chance to attend public school through the twelfth grade. Large sums of money were needed to meet the education needs of the baby-boom generation. Most of the funding for education came from local and state governments, but after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 in 1957, many Americans called for more federal funds for education.
In a mood of crisis, Congress quickly approved the National Defense Education Act. Its $1 billion program was aimed at producing more scientists and science teachers. The act authorized money for loans to high school and college graduates to continue their scientific education.
Education Becomes More Accessible The postwar era saw the stirrings of a movement to make education more accessible. Many states poured funds into their public universities, making it easier for ordinary Americans to attend college. California, for example, established a California Master Plan, which called for three tiers of higher education: research universities, state colleges, and community colleges. All of them were to be accessible to all of the state’s citizens. Other states also built or expanded their college systems.
On another front, in 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka that segregated

Television Shapes
American Culture
In 1938, when television was still just a curiosity, E.
B.
White, author of Charlotte's Web, wrote that it “is going to be the test of the modern world. . . . We shall stand or fall by the television.” While White’s view may have been exaggerated, clearly television has had an enormous impact on American society. Between 1945 and 1960, Americans purchased television sets at a faster pace than they had bought either radios or cars during the 1920s. The popularity of this new technology threatened the movie industry because families stayed home to watch TV rather than go out to watch movies at the theater.
Although television attracted viewers of all ages, it had a special influence on children. Baby-boom children rushed home from school to watch the Howdy Doody Show or the Mickey Mouse Club. Children also watched hours of cartoons and shows featuring their favorite superheroes, such as the Lone Ranger. Westerns were especially popular during the 1950s and early 1960s.
Among the most memorable shows were sitcoms about families. Fifty million Americans tuned in each week to watch the I Love Lucy show, starring the comedic actress Lucille Ball. Other popular family sitcoms included Leave It to Beaver, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, and Father Knows Best.
These shows reflected and reinforced the ideal of the 1950s family. None of the family sitcoms had important African American characters. None of the major characters got divorced. Major real-life problems, such as mental illness, alcoholism, and personal depression, rarely, if ever, appeared. Writes David Halberstam, "No family problem was so great that it could not be cleared up within the allotted twenty-two minutes.”
Even before television emerged in the 1950s, a mass national culture had begun to develop in the United States. Nationally broadcast radio programs, Hollywood films, and other forms of popular culture had helped erode distinct regional and ethnic cultures. Television sped up and reinforced this process. Americans in every region of the country watched the same shows and bought the same goods they saw advertised.
Television changed political campaigns. During the 1952 presidential campaign, Americans could see the

Critics and Rebels Emerge
The failure of society to provide equal opportunities to minorities was one source of discontent during the postwar era. Another was the belief that while material conditions were better in the 1950s, the quality of life had not improved. Many intellectuals and artists did not consider homes in the suburbs, shopping centers, and an unending supply of new gadgets as representing a better life.
Cultural Movements Against Conformity Many social critics complained about an emphasis on conformity. In a book called The Lonely Crowd, sociologists David Riesman and Nathan Glazer lamented that Americans had sacrificed their individualism in order to fit into the larger community. They also criticized the power of advertising to mold public tastes. The theme of alienation, or the feeling of being cut off from mainstream society, dominated a number of the most popular novels of the era. The bestseller The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, by Sloan Wilson, followed a World War II veteran who could not find real
meaning in life after the war. Holden Caulfield, the main character in J. D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye, a favorite among many teens, mocked what Salinger saw as the phoniness of adult society

Although not published until 1963, Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique described the plight of the suburban housewife during the 1950s. By the 1960s, Friedan would be at the forefront of a movement to change the social and political status of women in American society.
The Impact of the Beat Generation on American Society An additional critique of American society came from a small group of writers and artists called beatniks, or the beats. The beats refused to conform to accepted ways of dressing, thinking, and acting. Conformity, they insisted, stifled individualism. They displayed their dislike of American society by careless dress and colorful jargon.
In their poems, such as Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl,” and novels, such as Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, the beats lambasted what they saw as the crass materialism and conformity of the American middle class. Many Americans, in turn, were outraged by their behavior and believed that Beatnik values would have a negative impact on society.
Hollywood captured this rebellious spirit and youthful defiance in several influential films in the 1950s. In Rebel Without a Cause, James Dean portrayed a tormented teenager who rejects the values of the establishment while trying to fit in with his peers.
Actor Marlon Brando became a symbol of nonconformity for his role as the leader of an outlaw motorcycle gang in the film The Wild One. These characters—and ultimately, Dean and Brando themselves—became role models for disenchanted teenagers.
A
New Style of Music In the summer of 1951, a relatively unknown white disc jockey named Alan Freed began broadcasting what commonly had been called “race” music to listeners across the Midwest. Renaming the music rock-and-roll, Freed planted the seed for a cultural revolution that would blossom in the mid-1950s. Rock music originated in the rhythm and blues traditions of African Americans. As African Americans began to move north, they brought their musical traditions with them. Independent recording companies began recording rhythm and blues (R&B) music. Rock-and-roll borrowed heavily from rhythm and blues. As Chuck Berry, known as the pioneer of rock-and-roll, put it, “It used to be called boogie-woogie, it used to be called blues, used to be called rhythm and blues... . It’s called rock now.”
Live performances of rhythm and blues music had long been kept separate from whites by Jim Crow laws in the South or by more subtle forms of segregation

in the North. But now, through the radio, it began to attract a wider white audience in the postwar era. For example, a young Elvis Presley listened to a Memphis radio station that played African American gospel tunes. He began to integrate those tunes into the music he played. Meanwhile, in the early 1950s, Sam Phillips set up a recording studio in Memphis to record and play the music of some of Memphis’s best African American blues performers, such as B. B. King. One day Phillips heard Presley and almost immediately recognized that he had found the person he had been looking for.
Presley’s arrival set off the new rock craze. His first hit, “Heartbreak Hotel,” sold in the millions, and his success sparked popularity for rock music. Presley, along with African American performers such as Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Little Richard, and Ray Charles, had profound influence on popular music throughout the world. Within a few years, this new music would inspire the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, British rock-and-roll groups whose music would captivate audiences worldwide.
Yet at first, not everyone liked Elvis or the new rock craze, which many saw as having a very negative impact on culture. When Ed Sullivan, the host of a famous TV variety show, invited Elvis to sing on his

show, he directed cameramen to show Elvis only from the waist up, because many parents objected to Elvis's gyrating hips and tight pants. Ministers complained about the passions that rock music seemed to unleash among so many youngsters. Congress held hearings on the subversive nature of rock music. Nonetheless, it became a symbol of the emerging youth culture and of the growing influence of youth on mass culture.

Poverty in the Cities and Rural Areas
Behind the new household appliances, the spreading suburbs, the burgeoning shopping malls, and the ribbons of highways was a very different United States. It was a nation of urban slums, desperate rural poverty, and discrimination. People who were poor and dispossessed were well hidden.
In an influential 1962 book entitled The Othei America, Michael Harrington shocked many Americans by arguing that poverty was widespread in the United States. Harrington claimed that 50 million Americans, one fourth of the nation, lived in poverty. Despite American affluence, Harrington said, poverty plagued African Americans in the inner cities, rural whites in areas such as Appalachia, and Hispanics in migrant farm labor camps and urban barrios. Harrington argued that Americans could not afford to ignore the existence of the poor:
The poor live in a culture of poverty.
[They] get sick more than anyone else in the society. . . . Because they are sick more often and longer than anyone else, they lose wages and work and find it difficult to hold a steady job. And because of this, . . . their prospect is to move to an even lower level . . . toward even more suffering.

Effects of Migration on Cities During the decades that followed World War II, African Americans and other nonwhite minorities moved in great numbers from rural areas to cities. Most migrated in search of better economic opportunities. In the same period, however,

American cities were suffering a severe decline as middle-class white families moved to the suburbs.
The loss of the middle class hurt cities economically because the middle class paid a large share of the taxes. It hurt them politically, as well, because as the suburbs gained population, they also gained representation in state legislatures and the national government. This combination of declining economic and political power put a serious strain on cities, leading to a deterioration of services, such as garbage removal and street repair. In turn, as the conditions worsened and crime increased in what was now called the inner city, more of the middle class decided to move to the suburbs. Inner city refers to the older, central part of a city with crowded neighborhoods in which low-income, usually minority, groups live. Inner cities are often plagued with problems such as inadequate housing and schools, as well as crime.
Federal, state, and local governments tried to reverse the downward trend in American cities by developing urban renewal projects. With these projects, the government cleared large tracts of older housing and built freeways and developments that, it was hoped, would “revitalize” downtown areas. Unfortunately, the projects often backfired. Urban renewal drove people from their homes to make room for the new projects and highways. The poor were forced to seek housing rn neighborhoods that were already overcrowded and
overburdened. One resident of East Harlem, New York, who lost his home to an urban renewal project, observed:
Middle-class flight only worsened inner-city problems, such as inadequate services and schools.
Nobody cared what we wanted when they built this place. They threw our houses down and pushed us there and pushed our friends somewhere else. We don’t have a place around here to get a cup of coffee or a newspaper even, or borrow fifty cents. —America’s History Since 1865
The federal government tried to ease the shortage of affordable housing by constructing public housing. At the time, these housing projects seemed a godsend to those who lived there. Rent was cheap and the residents often enjoyed certain services, like hot running water, for the first time in their lives. Yet, since the public housing was often built in poor neighborhoods, the
Postwar America 477 Y7 Social Issues of the 1950s
projects led to an even greater concentration of poverty. This, in turn led to other problems, such as crime.
Migration from Rural Areas The plight of the rural poor was just as bad if not worse than that of the urban poor. Mississippi Delta sharecroppers, coal miners in Appalachia, and farmers in remote areas were left behind as others prospered, and often their economic situation got worse as time passed. A major transformation in farming was taking place. Corporations and large-farm owners came to dominate farm production. Many independent small-farm owners found it difficult to compete with the large farms and slipped into poverty.
Many farmers responded by leaving their rural communities behind, joining the waves of the poor who relocated to the city. Others remained behind, wondering if they would ever get to enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
RECALL
How did the federal government respond to the decline of American cities? Struggles of Minorities
During the postwar years, the battle for civil rights in the South began to gain headlines. Yet, in the same time period, African Americans and other minorities also fought for equality in the urban north and west.
Central to their struggles were efforts to overcome housing and employment discrimination.
Discrimination against Puerto Ricans Latinos from Puerto Rico and Mexico and Native Americans faced many of the same problems that African Americans encountered in the years following World War II. Puerto Rican migrants to New York City, for example, often found themselves clustered together in many of the poorest inner city neighborhoods with employment opportunities limited by both formal and informal forms of discrimination. As newcomers whose native language was not English, they enjoyed little political power. Thus, they received little help from city governments in getting better services, education, or an end to discriminatory practices.
Labor Conditions and Mexicans Both Mexicans and Mexican Americans faced a similar situation in the United States. During World War II, the U.S. government had established the bracero program as a means of addressing the shortage of agricultural workers. Braceros was a term for Mexican migrant farmworkers in the United States. The program gave temporary visas to Mexican immigrants. By 1964, 3 million Mexicans had worked in the United States under the program, most of them as farm laborers. Many were exploited and cheated by their employers. Mexican workers followed crops from state to state. Often, children worked alongside their parents. The migrants

had little power to oppose the exploitation, for if they complained about conditions, employers threatened to deport them back to Mexico. One U.S. Department of Labor official called the program “legalized slavery."
One champion of the rights of Mexican migrant workers, Ernesto Galarza, joined the effort to organize unions for Mexican farm laborers.
Americanization of Native Americans In 1953, the federal government enacted the termination policy, a major change in the rules governing Native Americans. The law sought to end tribal government and to relocate Native Americans to the nation’s cities. It also terminated federal responsibility for the health and welfare of Native Americans. Proponents of the policy argued that it would free American Indians to assimilate, or merge, into American society. While some Native Americans praised the intent of the program, most came to agree with Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon who argued that it made things worse for them. “[Tjhe social and economic devastation which these policies have wrought upon many groups has been tremendous. . . . While these problems were already severe among Indian societies generally, they have become epidemic among terminated Indians."

The postwar period brought prosperity to many, but most African Americans were still treated as second-class citizens. The civil rights movement, a broad and diverse effort to attain racial equality, compelled the nation to live up to its ideal that all are created equal. The movement also demonstrated that ordinary men and women could perform extraordinary acts of courage and sacrifice to achieve social justice, a lesson that continues to inspire people around the world today. 9.A, 9.C, 9.F, 9.G, 9.1, 21.A, 23.A, 23.B, 24.B

Separate but Not Equal In the South, Jim Crow laws enforced strict separation of the races. Segregation that is imposed by law is known as de jure segregation. In 1896, in Plessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme Court had ruled that such segregation was constitutional as long as the facilities for blacks and whites were "separate but equal.” But this was seldom the case. The facilities for African Americans were rarely, if ever, equal.
Rosa Parks Orval Faubus
In the South and elsewhere, segregation extended to most areas of public life. Officials enforced segregation of schools, hospitals,
Discrimination Throughout the Country In the
North, too, African Americans faced segregation and discrimination. Even where there were no explicit laws, de facto segregation, or segregation by unwritten custom or tradition, was a fact of life. African Americans in the North were denied housing in many neighborhoods. They faced discrimination in employment and often could get only low-paying jobs.
Jim Crow laws and more subtle forms of discrimination had a widespread and severe impact on African Americans. Black Americans occupied the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. Compared to white Americans, they had significantly higher rates of poverty and illiteracy, as well as lower rates of homeownership and life expectancy. Although African Americans living in the North could vote, most who lived in the South could not. Very few African Americans held public office.
In the West and Southwest, Asian Americans and Mexican Americans, too, faced de facto segregation and, in some cases, legal restrictions.
Civil Rights Advance Slowly in the 1940s In many ways, World War II set the stage for the rise of the modern civil rights movement. President Roosevelt banned discrimination in defense industries in 1941. Gunnar Myrdal’s publication in 1944 of An American Dilemma brought the issue of American prejudice to the forefront of public consciousness. Lastly, after risking their lives defending freedom abroad, African Americans were unwilling to accept discrimination at home.
In the 1940s, new organizations arose to try to bring an end to racial injustice and expand participation in the democratic process. James Farmer and several others founded the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) with the goal of ending discriminatory policies and improving relations between races. Its members were deeply influenced by the teachings of Henry David Thoreau and Mohandas Gandhi about the use of nonviolent protest to confront injustice. They became convinced that African Americans could apply similar nonviolent methods to gain civil rights. CORE organized nonviolent protests such as sit-ins against segregation in public facilities in Chicago, Detroit, Denver, and other northern cities.
Success was limited, but one highly visible break in the wall of segregation did take place in 1947. Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers, becoming the first African American to play major league baseball. Robinson braved death threats and rough treatment, but throughout his career he won the hearts of millions and paved the way for integration of other sports.

Nevertheless, African Americans continued to face discrimination and felt that racial equality was long overdue. However, the vast majority of white Americans took the opposite view. Racial violence erupted in the South, sometimes against African American veterans who were just trying to register to vote.
In the wake of this violence, President Truman appointed a Committee on Civil Rights to investigate race relations. In its report, the committee recommended a number of measures to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans, including an antilynching law and federal protection of voting rights. Unfortunately, Truman was unable to win congressional support for these initiatives. However, in 1948, he did use his executive power to order the desegregation of the military. Over time, the U.S. armed forces would become one of the most integrated institutions in the United States.

What tactics did some civil rights organizations use during the 1940s?
A
Landmark Supreme Court Decision Although the civil rights movement had made some gains in the 1940s, it stalled in the early 1950s. One of its greatest disappointments was the NAACP’s
failure, after decades of lobbying Congress, to make the lynching of African Americans a federal crime. Feeling that the executive and legislative branches of government were unwilling to promote additional reforms, the NAACP decided to turn to litigation in the federal courts to attain its political goals.
The NAACP Turns to Litigation in the Courts By the
end of World War II, the NAACP had become the largest and most powerful political civil rights organization in the nation. It attracted a wide array of individuals, both black and white, including a number of lawyers who used litigation as a means to expand civil rights across the country. In the 1940s, a team of NAACP attorneys pursued a legal strategy to challenge the legality of segregation in the courts. Thurgood Marshall, an African American lawyer from Baltimore, Maryland, headed the legal team that mounted this challenge.
In 1950, the NAACP won a number of key court cases. In Sweatt v. Painter, the Supreme Court ruled that the state of Texas had violated the Fourteenth Amendment by establishing a separate, but unequal, all-black law school. Similarly, in the McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, the Court ruled that the state of Oklahoma had violated George McLaurin’s constitutional rights. Even though McLaurin had been admitted to the graduate school of the University of Oklahoma, he was denied equal access to the library, dining hall, and classrooms. According to the Supreme

Court, a truly equal education involved more than simply admitting African Americans to previously all-white universities.
The Supreme Court Issues a Broad Decision Not
long after it won these cases, the NAACP mounted a much broader challenge to segregated public education at all grade levels. This challenge became known as Brown v. Board of Education. In the Sweatt and McLaurin cases, the NAACP asserted that Texas and Oklahoma had failed to provide equal educational experiences. In the Brown case, however, the NAACP challenged the “separate but equal” principle itself, which had been established in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case.
The Supreme Court agreed with the NAACP’s argument that segregated public education violated the U.S. Constitution. All nine of the Court’s Justices supported the Brown decision, which was written by newly appointed Chief Justice Earl Warren. “Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race . . . deprive the children of the minority group equal education opportunities?” Warren asked in his decision. “We believe that it does.” The Chief Justice and the Court declared, “in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place.”
In the same month as the Brown decision, the Supreme Court decided another civil rights case, this time involving Mexican Americans. In Hernandez v. Texas, the Court ended the exclusion of Mexican Americans from trial juries. The Hernandez decision was the first Supreme Court ruling against discrimination targeting a group other than African Americans.
The Public Response The Brown decision was one of the most significant and controversial in American history. Because public education touched so many Americans, it had a much greater impact than cases involving only professional and graduate schools. Moreover, by overturning the principle of "separate but equal,” the Court lent its support to the views of many civil rights advocates that all forms of segregation are wrong.
In a separate ruling, known as Brown II, the Court called for the implementation of its decision “with all deliberate speed” across the nation. However, most southerners had no intention of desegregating their schools without a fight. In 1956, about 100 southern members of Congress endorsed “The Southern Manifesto.” They pledged to oppose the Brown ruling through all “lawful means,” on the grounds that the Court had misinterpreted the Constitution.
Civil Rights and Reform in the 1960s	495	8.1 The Civil Rights Movement Strengthens
More ominously, the Ku Klux Kian staged a revival. Many prominent white southerners and businessmen organized “White Citizens Councils” that declared that the South would not be integrated. The Citizens Councils imposed economic and political pressure against those who favored compliance with the Supreme Court’s decision.
B CHECK UNDERSTANDING
How did earlier legal decisions differ from Brown v. Board of Education?
Conflict Between Federal and State Power
Historically, education had been a state matter. States and local school boards ran the schools, and the federal government had little involvement. Local and state officials resisted the Brown decision’s order to desegregate, and clashes with the federal government resulted. The most famous battle took place in 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Soldiers Arrive at a High School in Little Rock
The Little Rock school board had established a plan to gradually desegregate its schools, beginning with
» Elizabeth Eckford, one of nine students chosen to integrate Little Rock High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, walked past an angry crowd as officers from the National Guard stood by.
Central High School. Nine young African American students volunteered to enroll. But Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus announced his opposition to integration and called out the Arkansas state National Guard. When the nine students arrived at Central High, the soldiers blocked their way.
One of the nine, Elizabeth Eckford, has described the scene. An angry white mob began to approach her, with some screaming, “Lynch her! Lynch her!” Eckford sought out a friendly face, someone who might help. "I looked into the face of an old woman and it seemed a kind face,” she recalled, “but when I looked at her again she spat on me.” Fortunately, another white woman whisked Eckford away on a public bus before the mob could have its way. None of the Little Rock Nine gained entrance to the school that day.
Up until the Little Rock crisis, President Eisenhower had provided little leadership on the civil rights front. Following the Brown decision, he did not urge the nation to rapidly desegregate its schools. Privately, he expressed his misgivings about the ruling. But when Governor Faubus resisted the will of the federal courts, Eisenhower realized he had to act. He sent federal troops to Little Rock to protect the students and to enforce the Court’s decision. Eisenhower explained this action in a nationally televised address:
It is important that the reasons for my action be understood by all our citizens. ... A foundation of our American way of life is our national respect for law. . . .
If resistance to the federal court orders ceases at once, the further presence of federal troops will be unnecessary and the City of Little Rock will return to its normal habits of peace and order and a blot upon the fair name and high honor of our nation in the world will be removed.
—President Dwight D. Eisenhower, “Address on Little
Rock,” 1957
For the entire school year, federal troops stayed in Little Rock, escorting the nine students to and from Central High and guarding them on the school grounds. On the last day of class, Ernest Green, the one senior of the nine, became the first African American to graduate from Central High School. The showdown demonstrated that the President would not tolerate

open defiance of the law. Still, most southern states found ways to resist full compliance with the Court’s decision. Many years would pass before black and white children went to school together.
Political Lobbying Leads to a New Civil Rights
Act While organizations like CORE continued to nonviolently protest discrimination in public places in the North, the political lobbying efforts of civil rights forces yielded a small victory when Congress voted to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1957. President Eisenhower signed the bill into law, which established the United States Civil Rights Commission and gave it the power to investigate violations of civil rights. It empowered the U.S. Attorney General to bring lawsuits to address civil rights violations. The law also gave the Attorney General greater power to protect the voting rights of African Americans. But overall, it lacked teeth. CORE leader Bayard Rustin noted, however, that it had symbolic importance as the first civil rights law passed by Congress since Reconstruction.

The Montgomery Bus
Boycott
In addition to legal efforts during this era, some civil rights activists took direct action to end segregation. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, an African American seamstress, did just that. She boarded a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and sat down in an empty seat. Several stops later, the bus driver requested that she give up her seat to a white passenger. Montgomery law required African American passengers to give up their seats to whites. After Rosa Parks refused to obey the law, she was arrested. "The [policemen] asked if the driver had asked me to stand up, and I said yes, and they wanted to know why I didn’t,” Parks later recalled. “I told them I didn’t think I should have to stand up. After I had paid my fare and occupied a seat, I didn’t think I should have to give it up.”
Rosa Parks’s Act Transforms a Movement Parks s action set in motion a chain of events that transformed the civil rights movement. Over the next few days, a core of civil rights activists in Montgomery organized

a one-day bus boycott. They called upon the black community to refuse to ride the buses as a way to express their opposition to Parks’s arrest, in particular, and segregation, in general. Meanwhile, during the Montgomery bus boycott, the NAACP began preparing a legal challenge.
For a long while, many people thought that Parks had refused to give up her seat simply because she was tired after a long day of work. In reality, Parks had a record of fighting for civil rights. She had been active in the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP for years. This does not mean that she set out to get arrested and spark a movement. However, her choice to not give up her seat was an effective form of nonviolent protest and an influential moment in the civil rights movement’s struggle for the equality of political rights.
Martin Luther King Calls for Nonviolent Protest
On the evening following the boycott, the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), the organization that sponsored the bus boycott, held a meeting. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a Baptist minister, addressed the group. Though he had little time to prepare, King delivered an inspirational speech that brought the audience to its feet. Noting that African Americans were tired of segregation and oppression, King declared that there was no alternative but to protest.

ended its boycott, and African Americans began to ride the buses again.
Ministers Inspire the Movement The bus boycott represented a tremendous victory for African Americans in Montgomery and across the nation. The boycott revealed the power that African Americans could have if they joined together. The protest also elevated King and his philosophy of nonviolence into a prominent position within the civil rights movement.
After the boycott, King and another Montgomery minister, Ralph Abernathy, established the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to continue the struggle for civil rights. Made up largely of southern African American ministers, the SCLC advocated nonviolent resistance to fight injustice. The SCLC went on to organize a series of protests, including a Prayer Pilgrimage in Washington, D.C., in 1957, which helped convince Congress to pass civil rights legislation. Still, discrimination and segregation remained widespread.

However, he called for the protest to be nonviolent. He urged them not to become resentful, which would lead to hatred toward whites, but rather to follow Christian doctrine and love them.
After King spoke, the MIA vowed to continue the boycott and chose King as its leader. For more than a year, African Americans in Montgomery maintained their boycott of the buses. They did so despite economic pressures from their employers and threats of violence by the Ku Klux Kian. King himself survived a bombing of his house. Fortunately, his wife and baby daughter were not home at the time.
Finally, in 1956, the Supreme Court ruled that the Montgomery city law that segregated buses was unconstitutional. After more than a year, the MIA

8.1 The Civil Rights Movement Strengthens
Despite the Brown decision and other civil rights victories, little changed in the everyday lives of most African Americans. Nonetheless, activists continued to struggle for civil rights. In the early 1960s, the movement experienced a groundswell of support. This surge produced a dramatic shift in race relations, led to the passage of landmark civil rights legislation in 1964, and set the stage for future reforms.
Martin Luther King, Jr. called on the nation to end segregation in his famous “I Have a Dream” speech delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., in 1963.

Surges Forward
Student Activists Promote Civil Rights
After the Brown decision, many black youths expected that their schools would integrate quickly and that other racial reforms would follow. Change was not quick to come, however. Disappointed by the lack of progress, young African Americans began to challenge segregation with new vigor and determination.
Nonviolent Protests Challenge Segregation On February 1,1960, four African American college students ordered doughnuts and coffee at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. As they expected, the white waitress refused to serve them. In the South, nearly all restaurants that served whites refused to serve blacks. To protest this discrimination, the four students sat down on the stools at the lunch counter, where they stayed until closing time.
Word of the Greensboro sit-in spread rapidly, sparking a wave of similar protests across the nation. In Nashville, Tennessee, for instance, students led by the Reverend James Lawson staged sit-ins nnd, later, marches to protest racial inequality.

Elsewhere, protesters held “wade-ins” at public beaches and “read-ins” at public libraries, refusing to leave beaches or libraries reserved for whites only. African Americans boycotted buses. Groups of demonstrators knelt in prayer. Other activists carried picket signs in demonstrations and wrote letters to newspapers and government officials to express their support of the protests in the South.
Protestors in the civil rights movement used many different nonviolent methods to make it clear that they were determined to expand political rights and economic opportunities.
Political Organizations Encourage Nonviolent Protest The sit-ins marked the birth of a new militancy, especially among young African Americans. To build on the momentum they had gained, about 175 students from 30 states met at Shaw University, in Raleigh, North Carolina. There, on Easter weekend in 1960, they listened to James Lawson deliver an inspiring address:
We who are demonstrators are trying to raise what we call the ‘moral issue.’ That is, we are pointing to the viciousness of racial segregation and prejudice and calling it evil or sin. . . .
» In 1960, students at the University of Michigan joined the call for civil rights and equality for all Americans.
[We are also] asserting, ‘get moving.’
The pace of change is too slow. At this rate it will be another generation before the major forms of segregation disappear. . . . Most of us will be grandparents before we can live normal human lives.
—James Lawson, “From a Lunch Counter Stool," 1960
Ella Baker, a veteran of the struggle for civil rights, had organized the meeting. The granddaughter of enslaved African Americans, Baker had been active in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). She helped the young activists to establish a new civil rights organization, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC. Its goal was to create a grass-roots movement that involved all classes of African Americans in the struggle to defeat white racism and to obtain equality.

Freedom Rides Begin Throughout the South
The next battleground was interstate transportation. Political activists targeted this industry because they knew that travel between states was subject to federal rather than state regulation. In fact, the Supreme Court had recently ruled in Boyntonv.Virginia (1960) that segregation on interstate buses and in waiting rooms was illegal. Civil rights activists were now going to test the federal government’s willingness to enforce the law.
Freedom Riders Risk Physical Harm In the spring of 1961, CORE staged a “freedom ride” through the Deep South. Riders set off in two separate buses from Washington, D.C., bound for New Orleans. En route, they defied segregationist codes. African Americans sat in the front of the bus and used “white” restrooms in bus stations.
In Alabama, the trip took a dangerous turn. After departing from Anniston, segregationists firebombed one of the buses. When the second bus arrived in Birmingham, a white mob attacked the riders.

world, prodding President John F. Kennedy to intervene. Kennedy had intervened before. The previous year, when he was running for the presidency, Kennedy had helped to win Martin Luther King’s release from a Georgia prison after state officials had sentenced King to 6 months in jail for a traffic violation. King was freed and Kennedy, with the help of African American voters, went on to win the presidential election of 1960.
Kennedy now took action to stem the violence against the freedom riders. His administration worked out a deal with Mississippi’s leaders. Police and state troopers agreed to protect the riders. The Federal Transportation Commission also issued an order mandating the desegregation of interstate transportation.
In exchange, the Kennedy administration agreed not to intervene when Mississippi authorities arrested the activists and sentenced them to jail for disturbing the peace.
The freedom riders achieved their immediate goal. They compelled a reluctant federal government to act. By refusing to allow violent mobs to deter them, the riders also displayed that intimidation would not defeat the movement.

What did the freedom rides accomplish? L^- Public Institutions Open Doors to Minorities
In the fall of 1962 and spring of 1963, protests against racial discrimination intensified. The protesters put pressure on the federal government to help break down legal, or de jure, segregation.
Litigation Against the University of Mississippi
One struggle that gained international attention involved James Meredith. Meredith was an Air Force veteran who sought to enroll at the all-white University of Mississippi, known as “Ole Miss.” He was aided by the NAACP, a political organization that had been using litigation to challenge the legality of segregation in the courts. In September 1962, with the support of the NAACP, Meredith won a federal court case that ordered the university to desegregate. Civil rights activist Medgar Evers was instrumental in this effort.
Mississippi governor Ross Barnett was determined to prevent the integration of the university. The issue became a standoff between the governor and the federal government.
On September 30, rumors of Meredith’s arrival on the university’s campus began to spread. Federal marshals had been assigned to protect him. Over

the course of the night, a full-scale riot erupted, with federal marshals battling white protesters intent on scaring Meredith away.
As the rioting took place, President Kennedy addressed the nation on television. “Americans are free ... to disagree with the law but not to disobey it,” he declared. “For any government of laws . . . , no man, however prominent and powerful ... is entitled to defy a court of law.” The rioting went on throughout the night. By the time it ended, 160 people had been injured and 2 men had been killed.
The following morning, Meredith registered as a student and took his first class. He graduated from Ole Miss in 1963 and went on to obtain his law degree from Columbia University in New York City. Tragically, Medgar Evers was assassinated, on his front doorstep, in June 1963. Three years later, Meredith was shot and nearly killed. Both shootings stand as historical reminders of the high costs of fighting racial discrimination.
A
Letter from Birmingham Jail In the spring of 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the SCLC targeted Birmingham, Alabama, for a major civil rights campaign. They chose Birmingham because of its reputation as the most segregated city in the South. » Scenes of young protesters being attacked with high-pressure hoses and dogs shocked Americans, prompting a cry for federal action.
The campaign began nonviolently at first with protest marches and sit-ins. City officials got a court order prohibiting the demonstrations. On Good Friday, April 12,1963, King decided to violate the order and join the demonstration personally, even though he knew it would lead to his arrest.
From his jail cell, King wrote a letter explaining why he and other civil rights activists were tired of waiting for reform: “For years now I have heard the word ‘wait!’ It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ‘Wait!’ has almost always meant ‘Never.’"
One of the most poignant passages of the letter describes King's concern about the impact of discrimination on his children:
Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, ‘Wait.’ But . . . when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children. . . . Then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait.
—Martin Luther King, Jr., “Letter from Birmingham
Jail,” 1963
The SCLC gave King’s letter to the press, and it soon appeared in newspapers across the nation. The letter provided Americans with a clear explanation of King’s philosophy of nonviolence and his use of direct action. Its powerful message and eloquence also stirred many white moderates to support the civil rights movement.
After King was released from jail, the SCLC increased the frequency of the demonstrations. For the first time, schoolchildren joined the “freedom marches.” Finally, Birmingham’s Public Safety Commissioner, T. Eugene “Bull” Connor, would not tolerate the demonstrations any longer. He used police dogs and fire hoses on the protesters. Many Americans were shocked by photographs and news coverage of nonviolent protesters set upon by dogs and overwhelmed by the powerful jets of water from fire hoses. They sent telegrams and letters by the thousands to the White House, calling on the President to act.

Kennedy Addresses Minority Rights In Alabama, Governor George Wallace made it clear where he stood on civil rights: “I say segregation now! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!” In response to the impending entrance of two African American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, to the University of Alabama, Wallace vowed to stand “in the schoolhouse door” and personally block any attempt to integrate Alabama schools. Because of the events unfolding at the University of Alabama, President Kennedy became convinced that he had to take a more active role in promoting civil rights.
On June 11,1963, in order to facilitate the registration of Malone and Hood, Kennedy ordered the secretary of defense to call up the Alabama National Guard. Faced with the authority of the federal government, Governor George Wallace backed down.
He stepped aside and allowed the two students to enter the University of Alabama—only after proclaiming for the assembled media cameras the rights of states to control their own schools. Later, reflecting on the showdown with Wallace, Vivian Moore stated, “I didn’t feel I should sneak in. I didn’t feel I should go around the back door. If [Wallace] were standing in the door, I had every right to face him and go to school.”
That evening, as a result of the events in Alabama, President Kennedy delivered a moving televised address. Calling civil rights a “moral issue,” he declared that the nation had an obligation to “fulfill its promise” of giving all Americans “equal rights and equal opportunities.” President Kennedy sent to Congress a proposal for sweeping civil rights legislation. His brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, led the charge for passage of the bill.

Thousands Gather in the Nation’s Capital
To put pressure on Congress to pass the new civil rights bill and to improve economic opportunities for blacks, supporters made plans for a massive nonviolent protest in Washington, D.C. The event brought together the major political organizations promoting civil rights— including the NAACP, SCLC, and SNCC—as well as labor unions and religious groups.
The March on Washington took place on August 28, 1963. Organizers had hoped for 100,000 demonstrators. More than double that number showed UP, having made the journey to the capital from around

the country. They were a diverse group—young and old and from many different classes and religious backgrounds. More than a quarter of the marchers were white.
Before the march, there had been some concern about maintaining order at such a huge demonstration. Yet despite the massive numbers, the day was peaceful and even festive. Popular celebrities and entertainers were on hand to perform for the crowd.
The Washington Monument was the starting point for the day's events. Prominent singers performed songs, including the civil rights movement’s unofficial anthem, “We Shall Overcome.” Then the throng marched to the Lincoln Memorial. The main rally took place in front of the Lincoln Memorial, where a distinguished roster of speakers addressed the crowd. A. Philip Randolph, the elder statesman of the civil rights movement, gave the opening remarks. He was followed by representatives of various religious and labor groups.
The highlight of the day came when the final speaker, Martin Luther King, Jr., took the podium. King held the audience spellbound as he described his dream of a colorblind society “when all of God’s children” would be free and equal. Millions more watched King’s address live on television. This powerful and eloquent speech has come to be known as the “I Have a Dream” speech.

Behind the scenes, there was some tension between the organizations that had planned the March. SNCC, in particular, had wanted to stage a more militant protest to show its dissatisfaction with the pace of change. Yet for the public at large and for most who took part, the March on Washington represented a magical moment in American history.
The March on Washington was one of the largest political demonstrations in U.S. history. Widely covered in the media, the March increased awareness of the movement and built momentum for the passage of civil rights legislation.
Despite the huge numbers and the emotional intensity of the day, the March remained orderly and is considered a model for peaceful protest. The March on Washington has come to symbolize the civil rights movement.

On September 15, 1963, less than three weeks after the march, a bomb exploded in the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. The church had been the SCLC’s headquarters earlier that spring. Four young African American girls, all dressed in their Sunday best, were killed in the bombing.
Two months later, on November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the presidency.
Johnson was a southerner with an undistinguished record on racial matters. However, he surprised many Americans by immediately throwing his support behind the cause of civil rights. “No eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy’s memory," Johnson told Congress and the nation, “[than the] earliest passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.”
The civil rights bill faced strong opposition in Congress, but Johnson put his considerable political skills to work for its passage. The bill passed in the House of Representatives, but it faced a more difficult fight in the Senate, where a group of southern Democratic senators attempted to block it by means of a filibuster. This is a tactic by which senators give long speeches to hold up legislative business. The filibuster went on for more than 80 days until supporters finally put together enough votes to overcome it. In the end, the measure passed in the Senate, and President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law in July.
The act banned segregation in public accommodations and gave the federal government the ability to compel state and local school boards to desegregate their schools. The act also allowed the Justice Department to prosecute individuals who violated people’s civil rights and outlawed discrimination in employment on account of race, color, sex, or national origin. It also established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which is responsible for enforcing these provisions and investigating charges of job discrimination.

Increasing Participation in the Political Process
None of the federal court decisions or civil rights measures passed through 1964 fundamentally affected the right to vote. The problem was a southern political system that used literacy tests, poll taxes, and intimidation to keep blacks from voting.
In Mississippi, in 1964, for instance, not a single African American person was registered to vote in five counties that had African American majorities. All of the major civil rights organizations sought to overcome these political injustices.
SNCC and Political Rights SNCC had spent several years organizing voter education projects in Mississippi. It met with little success and a great deal of violent opposition. But in 1964, it decided to get more directly involved in the political process. It called for a major campaign, known as Freedom Summer. About 1,000 volunteers, mostly black and white students, were to flood Mississippi to register African Americans to vote. They also formed the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), an alternative to Mississippi's all-white

regular Democratic Party, to give African Americans a voice in state politics.
Even before most of the Freedom Summer volunteers had arrived, three civil rights workers—Michael Schwerner, James Chaney, and Andrew Goodman— disappeared. SNCC claimed that they were murdered; state authorities denied these charges.
President Johnson ordered a massive search for the three, which ended when their bodies were found buried in an earthen dam. All had been shot at point-blank range. Yet, despite the obvious dangers, almost all of the other volunteers remained in the state.
Work of Political Organizations After Freedom Summer ended in August 1964, an MFDP delegation traveled to the Democratic Convention in New Jersey, seeking to be recognized as Mississippi's only Democratic Party. At the convention, Fannie Lou Hamer, one of the MFDP’s leaders, gave powerful testimony. She described how she and other activists had been beaten, fired from their jobs, and displaced from their homes all because, as she put it, they wanted "to register” and “live as decent human beings.”
Despite Hamer’s testimony, the Democrats refused to seat the MFDP. Instead, party officials offered a compromise: they would seat two MFDP members as "at-large delegates” and reform the nomination rules to
guarantee greater minority representation in the future. The MFDP rejected this offer. Ironically, Mississippi’s regular Democratic delegation left the convention in protest because the national party had made the offer to the MFDP.
Martin Luther King, Jr., Leads the March on Selma Early in 1965, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the SCLC organized a major campaign in Selma, Alabama, to pressure the federal government to enact voting rights legislation. The protests climaxed in a series of confrontations on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, on the main route from Selma to Montgomery. The first of these confrontations took place on March 7, 1965, a day that became known as “Bloody Sunday.” Heavily armed state troopers and other authorities attacked the marchers as they tried to cross the bridge. Sheyann Webb, a six-year-old girl at the time, recalled the scene:
I heard all of this screaming and .

Webb survived, but the rampage continued. Television coverage of the violence outraged the nation. On March 15, President Johnson went on national television and called for a strong federal voting rights law. Historically, regulation of voting rights had been left to the states, but Johnson argued that “it is wrong to deny any of your fellow citizens the right to vote.” He added, “Their cause is our cause too, because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.”
Voting Rights Act of 1965 Spurred by the actions of protesters, lobbying by the Washington bureau of the NAACP, and the words of the President, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The act banned literacy tests and empowered the federal government to oversee voting registration and elections in states that had discriminated against minorities. In 1975, Congress extended coverage to Hispanic voters in the Southwest.
Some legislation laid the groundwork for the Voting Rights Act. One such legal landmark was the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1964. It banned the poll tax, which had been used to keep poor African Americans from voting. Also, in response to litigation, the federal courts handed down several important decisions that expanded the right to participate in the democratic process. Baker v. Can and Reynolds v. Simms limited racial gerrymandering, the practice of drawing election districts in such a way as to dilute the African American vote, and established the legal principle of “one man, one vote.” In 1973, the Supreme Court further challenged racial gerrymandering in White v. Regester.
These laws and decisions had a profound impact. Particularly in the Deep South, African American participation in politics skyrocketed. In Mississippi, the percentage of African Americans registered to vote jumped from just under 7 percent in 1964 to about 70 percent in 1986. Nationwide, the number of African American elected officials rose from fewer than 100 to more than 6,000 by the mid-1980s.

Civil Rights and Reform in the 1960s
Violence Troubles Civil Rights Efforts
Many celebrated the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Yet for some African Americans, things had not changed much. In many urban areas, there was anger and frustration over continuing discrimination and poverty. That anger exploded into violence in several cities.
Disorder in the Cities Less than a week after Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, one of the worst race riots in American history erupted in the predominantly African American neighborhood of Watts in Los Angeles. Violence, looting, and arson spread for several days before National Guard troops restored order.
Watts was one of many race riots that erupted in the 1960s. The worst violence occurred in Newark, New Jersey, and Detroit, Michigan, in the summer of 1967. In Detroit, 43 people died, and property damage reached $50 million. The outbursts frightened many white Americans.
In most previous race riots, whites had used violence to keep African Americans “in their place.” But now, blacks were using violence against police and white business owners in black neighborhoods.
Investigating the Race Riots To determine the causes of the riots, President Johnson established the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission. It concluded that long-term racial discrimination stood as the single most important cause of violence. The commission also recommended establishing and expanding federal programs aimed at overcoming the problems of America’s urban ghettos.
Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white, separate and unequal. . . . Segregation and poverty have created the racial ghetto and a destructive environment totally unknown to most Americans.
—National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders,
Report, 1967
The Kerner Commission’s findings proved highly controversial. A number of conservative commentators argued against expanding federal spending.
They said that this amounted to rewarding the rioters. Others noted that the black-white split that the report described ignored other minorities.
» During the 1960s, race riots, like this one in Detroit, often left significant parts of largely African American neighborhoods burned out or otherwise destroyed.
» Conservative critics argued that the Kerner Commission did not satisfactorily explain why the riots occurred.

President Johnson did not follow up on the commission’s recommendations, largely because the Vietnam War was consuming enormous sums of federal money. The riots also fueled a white backlash. Many whites opposed further reforms. However, the private sector stepped in to create economic opportunities for citizens. In 1967, the life insurance industry formed an Urban Problems Committee of CEOs who created a “Billion Dollar Urban Investment Program” to provide investments for low- and moderate- income housing and job-creating enterprises in poor urban areas.
RECALL
Why was the Kerner Commission formed? New Civil Rights Groups
The racial rioting of the mid-1960s coincided with the radicalization of many African Americans, particularly young urban African Americans. Rather than advocating nonviolence and integration, they called for another approach.
Malcolm X Offers a Different Vision The most well known African American radical was Malcolm X, who was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1925. He adopted the X to represent his lost African name. Little, he argued, was his slave name. Malcolm had a difficult childhood. In his teens, he moved to Boston and then to New York City, where he became involved in drugs and crime and landed in prison on burglary charges at age 21.
While in prison, Malcolm became a convert to the Nation of Islam, a religious sect headed by Elijah Muhammad. The group prescribed strict rules of behavior, including no drugs or alcohol, and demanded a separation of the races.
After his release from prison, Malcolm became the Nation of Islam’s most prominent minister. In this role, he preached a message of self-reliance and selfprotection. He called for black pride and spread the idea of black nationalism, a belief in the separate identity and racial unity of the African American community. Malcolm was a “charismatic speaker who could play an audience as great musicians play instruments.” His dynamic speeches won many adherents to his cause.
In 1964, Malcolm X broke away from the Nation of Islam and formed his own organization. He then made a pilgrimage to Mecca, the holy city of Islam, afterward adopting the religious name el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz. Returning to the United States, he seemed willing to consider limited acceptance of whites. In February 1965, however, Malcolm X was shot and killed. Three members of the Nation of Islam were convicted of the murder.
Civil Rights and Reform in the 1960s	510	8.3 Successes and Setbacks
The “Black Power” Movement Many young African Americans saw themselves as heirs of the radical Malcolm X. They began to move away from the principle of nonviolence. They also began to question the goal of integration. As SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael put it:
Integration . . . has been based on complete acceptance of the fact that in order to have a decent house or education, blacks must move into a white neighborhood or send their children to a white school. This reinforces the notion . . . that ‘white’ is automatically better and ‘black’ is by definition inferior.
—Stokely Carmichael. “What We Want,’1 1966
Carmichael first used the term “black power” in 1966. In that year, James Meredith had set off on a "March Against Fear” across the state of Mississippi to encourage African Americans to register and vote. Meredith traveled only 20 miles before he was shot and left for dead by a white supremacist. SNCC, CORE, and SCLC members vowed to continue the march.
When they reached Greenwood, Mississippi, Carmichael and some other marchers were arrested. After his release, Carmichael told a crowd that African Americans needed “black power."
He later said that black power meant African Americans should collectively use their economic and political muscle to gain equality. Yet many white Americans felt threatened. They believed that black power meant black violence.
The Black Panthers’ Approach Not long after Carmichael’s "black power” speech, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale formed the Black Panther Party in Oakland, California. Almost overnight, the Black Panthers became the symbol of young militant African Americans. The Black Panthers organized armed patrols of urban neighborhoods to protect people from police abuse. They also created antipoverty programs, such as free breakfasts for poor African American children. The Black Panthers gained national attention when they entered the state capitol in Sacramento carrying shotguns and wearing black leather jackets and berets to protest attempts to restrict their right to bear arms.
The Panthers’ style appealed to many young African Americans, who began to wear their hair in Afros” and to refer to themselves as “black” rather than Negro” or “colored.”
» At the University of California at Berkeley, Stokely Carmichael advocated combining the economic, social, and political power of African Americans to achieve civil rights.
» Members and sympathizers demonstrate their support for Black Panther leader Huey Newton as he stands trial for the murder of an Oakland police officer in Alameda County, California.

Some, following the lead of Malcolm X, changed their name and celebrated their African heritage. At the same time, the Panthers’ militancy often led to violent confrontations with police. Each side accused the other of instigating the violence.
ET EXPLAIN
What effect did Malcom X have on the civil rights movement? King Expands His Dream
Martin Luther King understood the anger and frustration of many urban African Americans whose lives had changed little despite the civil rights reforms of the 1960s. However, he disagreed with the call for “black power” and sought a nonviolent alternative to combat economic injustice.
After spending about a year in Chicago’s slums to protest conditions there, King made plans for a massive "Poor People's Campaign.” The campaign’s goal was to broaden civil rights’ goals to address economic inequality in America.
King’s Assassination: A Turning Point As part of this effort, King journeyed to Memphis, Tennessee, in early April 1968. There, he offered his assistance to sanitation workers who were striking for better wages and working conditions.
On April 3, King addressed his followers. He referred to threats that had been made against his life. "Like anybody, I would like to live a long life,” King declared. “But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will.”
The following day, as King stood on the balcony outside his motel room, he was struck by a shot from a high-powered rifle. He died at a hospital shortly afterward, at the age of 39. James Earl Ray, a white exconvict, was later charged with King’s murder.
King’s assassination marked an important turning point. His efforts had increased minority participation in the political process and encouraged racial integration. Yet much racist hostility persisted. For example, Lester Maddox, a restaurant owner in Atlanta, Georgia, gained national attention when he closed his business rather than comply with 1964 Civil Rights Act that banned discrimination against African Americans. Hoping to maintain the status quo, Maddox then ran for and was elected governor of Georgia. After King’s assassination, Governor Maddox would not even allow the civil rights leader’s body to lie in state in the Georgia state capitol building.
The protests for black freedom and racial equality that began in the mid-1950s crested in the late 1960s

Robert F. Kennedy Responds Robert F. Kennedy was campaigning for the presidency in Indianapolis when he heard of King’s death. RFK stopped his campaign speech to give the audience the sad news. He reminded them that he had lost his own brother to an assassin’s bullet. Kennedy asked those assembled to honor King’s memory by replacing their anger and desire for revenge “with an effort to understand with compassion and love.” Despite Kennedy’s plea, riots broke out in hundreds of cities after King’s assassination. Two months later, Robert Kennedy’s life, too, was cut short by an assassin.

Results of the Civil Rights Movement
The civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s succeeded in eliminating legal, or de jure, segregation and knocking down barriers to African American voting and participation in the political process. During the same period, African American poverty rates fell and the median income of African American men
and women rose rapidly, as did the number of African Americans who graduated from high school.
One symbol of the progress that had been made was the appointment of Thurgood Marshall as the first African American Supreme Court Justice in 1967. The following year, in the wake of King's murder, Congress passed one final civil rights measure, the Fair Housing Act, which banned discrimination in housing. Yet, in spite of these efforts to create economic opportunity, the social and economic gap between many blacks and whites remained. New measures aimed at closing this gap tended to provoke more controversy than consensus in America.
Controversies over Busing and Affirmative Action Attempts to increase economic opportunities for African Americans and to integrate neighborhoods and schools encountered great difficulties. To achieve desegregated schools, the federal courts had ordered the use of forced busing. Richard Nixon, who succeeded Lyndon Johnson as president, criticized busing as a means of attaining racial balance.
At the same time, the Nixon administration formally established affirmative action as a means of closing the economic gap between blacks and whites.
In a short period of time, colleges and universities, businesses, and local and state governments followed the federal government’s lead and implemented their own affirmative action plans to increase African American representation in schools and the workforce.
Affirmative action proved controversial almost from the start. Some whites argued that it constituted

through the regular admissions process at less selective institutions.
Changes to the Voting Rights Act The Voting Rights Act of 1965 continues to encourage minority participation in the democratic process. Congress has renewed the law four times—for 5 years in 1970, for 7 years in 1975, for 25 years in 1982 and, most recently, for 25 years in 2006.
In recent years, however, the Supreme Court has redefined the scope of the Act’s provisions. In 1993, the Court ruled that the first district in North Carolina to elect an African American to Congress was shaped in a way that violated the rights of white voters. In 2013, the Court severely weakened the heart of the act, Section 5, which empowered the federal government to oversee election practices in states where voting rights are at risk. In a 5-4 decision, the Court released nine states, seven of them in the South, from federal supervision. The ruling cited the gains those states had made since 1965 in black voter registration as rationale for the decision.

What gains had the civil rights movement made by the early 1970s? reverse discrimination and violated the goal of creating a colorblind society. Justice Thurgood Marshall disagreed. “Three hundred and fifty years ago, the Negro was dragged to this country in chains to be sold into slavery,” Marshall wrote. “The position of the Negro today in America is the tragic but inevitable consequence of centuries of unequal treatment.” Until the nation addressed the legacy of this unequal treatment, Marshall asserted, it would not fulfill its promise of providing equal rights and opportunities to all.
Affirmative action remains a divisive social policy. Critics—and even some supporters—contend that the practice has had unintended consequences, sometimes hurting the very people it is intended to help.
For example, some studies show that minority students accepted through affirmative action at the nation’s most selective universities do not have as high a graduation rate as minority students accepted

The civil rights movement had begun gaining momentum in the 1950s, when President Dwight Eisenhower was presiding over a time of peace and prosperity. But even during this optimistic Eisenhower era, there were a number of issues that caused Americans grave concern. The launch of Sputnik 1 showed that the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was still intense.

Kennedy’s Reforms
2.D, 9.A
The Torch is Passed to a New Generation
Kennedy Versus Nixon In the presidential election of I960, Democrat John F. Kennedy and Republican Richard M. Nixon were quite similar in a variety of ways. For the first time in U.S. history, both candidates had been born in the twentieth century, Nixon in 1913 and Kennedy in 1917. Both had served in the navy during World War II. Both had been elected to Congress in 1946 and to the Senate in the early 1950s. Both were passionate about foreign affairs and supported the Cold War fight against communism. Young and energetic, intelligent and hardworking, both wanted to be the first of their generation to lead the country.
Their differences, however, were as significant as their similarities. Kennedy was the son of a wealthy Boston businessman. His grandfather had been a state senator, and his father had served as the ambassador to Great Britain. Kennedy attended Harvard University. Although he was a Catholic and his religion was an issue in the election, he insisted that what church he attended should not be a factor.
Nixon, born in California, did not enjoy the advantages of a wealthy upbringing. His father struggled to make a living. As a young man, Nixon had to balance his time between his school studies and work

to help support the family. Many voters, however, respected him for his experiences as Vice President under Eisenhower.
Television Influences Voter Opinion The 1960 election highlighted the growing power and influence of television. The candidates agreed to four televised debates. During the campaign, Nixon was hospitalized with a knee infection. After getting out of the hospital, he committed himself to a grueling schedule of public appearances.
By the time of the first debate, held in late September in Chicago and watched by about 70 million people, Nixon looked pale and exhausted. He arrived at the television studio an hour early, but he refused the offer to have makeup applied to hide his newly growing beard. By contrast, Kennedy, tanned from open-air campaigning in California, looked healthy and confident. His relaxed manner, easy charm, and quick sense of humor added to his appeal.
In many ways, the debate boiled down to how the candidates looked and spoke, rather than what they said. Most Americans who listened to the debate on radio believed that Nixon had won. But the larger audience who watched the debate on television concluded that Kennedy was the clear victor. Although Nixon tried to change his image in the later debates, he was unable to significantly alter the country’s initial impression of him. Kennedy’s “victory” in Chicago proved crucial in the election.
Kennedy Wins a Close Election Kennedy not only looked better on television, but he also demonstrated an ability to react more quickly to unexpected events. For example, several weeks before the election, civil rights leader Martin Luther King. Jr., and a group of African American students were jailed during a protest in Atlanta, Georgia. Nixon said nothing publicly about the episode. Kennedy, however, telephoned King’s
wife, Coretta Scott King, to voice his concern. He also worked behind the scenes to obtain King’s release on bail. Kennedy’s actions attracted the strong support of African Americans in the election.
The election of 1960 was the tightest presidential election since 1888. In an election that witnessed the largest voter turnout in the country’s history, Kennedy won by less than 120,000 of the 68 million votes cast. His electoral victory was more convincing. He carried enough states to give him 303 electoral votes to Nixon’s 219. However, had a few thousand people voted differently in Illinois and Texas, the electoral vote and the election would have gone to Nixon.

President’s Unique Charisma Kennedy’s determination to change life at home resulted in his domestic agenda, called the New Frontier. Faced with a conservative Congress, Kennedy met with opposition as he fought to turn his vision into a reality. Still, he had some success in making changes in Social Security benefits, dealing with poverty and racial discrimination, and spurring new interest and expectations for the space program.
As John Kennedy showed in his 1960 campaign and in his Inaugural Address, he had a special charm—or charisma—that separated him from other politicians. With his exquisitely tailored clothes, quick smile, and sense of humor, he seemed closer to a movie star than to a run-of-the-mill politician. Although he suffered many health problems, he projected youthful health and energy.

brightest.” They came from some of the country’s most prestigious businesses and universities. Robert McNamara, president of Ford Motor Company, agreed to serve as Secretary of Defense. Dean Rusk, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, signed on as Secretary of State. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a Pulitzer Prizewinning historian, worked at the White House as a spokesperson for liberal causes and was a source of ideas for the President.
President Kennedy promised Americans that his administration would blaze a “New Frontier.” The term described Kennedy’s proposals to improve the economy, education, healthcare, and civil rights. He also hoped to jump-start the space program. In his nomination acceptance speech on July 15,1960, in Los Angeles, California, Kennedy said,
I stand tonight facing west on what was once the last frontier. . . . From the lands that stretch three thousand miles behind me, the pioneers of old gave up their safety, their comforts and sometimes their lives to build a new world here in the West. . . .
But the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won, and we stand today on the edge of a new frontier—the frontier of the 1960s—the frontier of unknown opportunities and perils—a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats.

Kennedy, July 15, 1960 BI IDENTIFY CENTRAL IDEAS
Why did many feel that Kennedy was a different kind of politician?
Domestic Priorities
Early in his presidency, occupied by events in Cuba and Berlin, Kennedy devoted most of his attention to foreign affairs. But by 1963 he had become more concerned about pressing problems at home.
Kennedy—like millions of other Americans—was troubled by the high levels of poverty in the United States. The Other America, Michael Harrington’s bestselling and influential 1962 expose of poverty in America, shocked Kennedy and many other Americans.

While Kennedy failed to get Congress to accept his more ambitious social programs, he did push through an increase in the minimum wage, an extension in Social Security benefits, and improvements in the welfare system.
In addition, in 1962 Kennedy established the President’s Commission on the Status of Women, a blue-ribbon panel that studied how poverty and discrimination affected women. The difference in wages received by men and women for the same work was an especially glaring problem. The Equal Pay Act (1963) required equal wages for “equal work” in industries engaged in commerce or producing goods for commerce. Although it contained various loopholes, the law was a crucial step on the road to fair and equal employment practices. The next year Congress would prohibit discrimination by employers on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.
One Approach to Economic Stimulus Kennedy believed that increased prosperity would help to eliminate some of the nation’s social problems. When he became President, the country was suffering from a high unemployment rate and a sluggish economy. To help the sagging economy, Kennedy proposed tax credits to encourage business investment in new factory equipment. At the same time, increased military spending created new jobs and boosted the economy.
In addition, Kennedy accepted the “new economics” of theorist John Maynard Keynes that advocated deficit spending to stimulate the economy. Deficit spending is the government practice of borrowing money in order to spend more than is received from taxes. In 1963, Kennedy called for dramatic tax cuts for middle-class Americans as a way to put more money in the pockets of more people. At the same time, he increased the tax burden on wealthier citizens. Kennedy’s economic initiatives jump-started the tremendous economic growth of the late 1960s.
Cautious Steps toward Civil Rights Kennedy pursued a timid approach toward civil rights. He had narrowly won the 1960 election, and he had little real influence in Congress or even complete partisan support. He did not want to anger conservative, white southern members of Congress in his own party. They stood ready to block any civil rights legislation.
While Kennedy remained largely passive on civil rights issues, African Americans and their white allies challenged segregation in the South. In 1961, they took “freedom rides” to desegregate interstate bus travel.
In 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr., took the civil rights struggle to Birmingham, Alabama. Such actions took courage and were met by angry, oftentimes violent, responses by white southerners.
In early 1963, Kennedy introduced a civil rights bill that demanded prosecution for voting-rights violations and federal money to aid school desegregation. Further

violence in the South prompted Kennedy to introduce stronger civil rights legislation.
First to the Moon The launching of the satellite Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957 called into question American technological superiority. Although Congress created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958, the Soviets’ space program remained several steps ahead of the American program. In April 1961, for example, the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit Earth.
Kennedy recognized that the United States and the Soviet Union were locked in a “space race.” Space race was the term used to describe the competition between the Soviet Union and the United States to develop technology to successfully land on the moon. In May 1961, NASA put astronaut Alan Shepard into a suborbital space flight aboard the Project Mercury space capsule Freedom 7. Encouraged by the success of Project Mercury, Kennedy committed the United States to landing a man on the moon by 1970.
America’s quest to reach the moon was punctuated by enormous successes and heartbreaking failures. Astronaut John Glenn became the first American to orbit Earth in February 1962. But astronauts Virgil Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee burned to death when their docked capsule exploded in fire during a routine test. Finally, in July 1969, astronaut Neil Armstrong left his spacecraft Columbia's landing
vehicle and became the first man to step on the moon. The mission was a successful completion of Kennedy’s bold dream.
The moon landing in 1969 was a turning point in the space race. Never again would the Soviet Union rival the United States for supremacy in space. In addition, the space program’s many innovations improved Americans’ quality of life. For example, materials developed for the visors on the moon astronauts’ helmets allowed eyeglass manufacturers to replace glass lenses with lighter, scratch-resistant ones. Today's cordless tools use the same technology that astronauts used on the moon. Manufacturers of athletic shoes applied high-tech features found in the astronauts’ boots. Memory foam, enriched baby food, and freeze-drying technology are also among the hundreds of ways that space exploration has benefited society and improved the quality of life.

the need to move toward a peaceful future. In domestic affairs he finally came to the conclusion that the federal government had to lead the struggle for civil rights. Added to his new maturity was his ability to inspire Americans to dream noble dreams and work toward lofty ends.
In November 1963, Kennedy traveled to Dallas, Texas, to mend political fences for his 1964 reelection bid. He never lived to see 1964. While his motorcade moved through the city, assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, perched by a window on the sixth floor of the Texas
School Book Depository, fired three shots at the President. The third shot hit Kennedy in the back of his head. A half hour later, doctors at Parkland Memorial Hospital pronounced him dead.
Texan Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy’s Vice President, was sworn in as the new President. Although many people would later question whether Oswald acted alone, the Warren Commission, which conducted the official investigation of the assassination, described Oswald as the “lone killer.”
The senseless murder deeply saddened Americans across the nation. Millions of people watched Kennedy’s funeral procession on television, and many reacted as if they had lost a family member. It seemed as if part of America’s innocence had died with him.

With Johnson’s ability to build consensus, or agreement on an issue by a group, the Civil Rights Act became law in the summer of 1964. It outlawed discrimination in voting, education, and public
accommodations. The act demanded an end to discrimination in hospitals, restaurants, theaters, and other places open to the public. It also created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to fight discrimination in hiring.
African Americans and Mexican Americans who faced almost daily discrimination benefited immeasurably from the legislation. Finally, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex.
The Fight to Expand Economic Opportunity
Johnson made his intentions clear in his first State of the Union address when he said it was time to “declare an unconditional war on poverty.” The new President planned to fuse his own dreams for America onto Kennedy’s legislative agenda. Although Kennedy had failed to get Congress to approve his tax bill calling for dramatic tax cuts for middle-class Americans, Johnson was able to maneuver it through. In addition, he had added a billion-dollar War on Poverty to the bill.
Johnson’s War on Poverty introduced measures to train the jobless, educate the uneducated, and provide healthcare for those in need. The 1964 Economic Opportunity Act created the Job Corps to train young men and women between the ages of 16 and 21 in the work skills they needed to acquire better jobs and move out of poverty.

The act also established Volunteers in Service to America,, or VISTA, patterned after Kennedy’s Peace Corps, which sent American volunteers into poverty-stricken American communities in an effort to solve the country’s pressing economic, educational, and medical problems. The volunteers served in inner city schools and on Indian reservations. They worked in rural health clinics and urban hospitals.
Perhaps the most successful element of the Economic Opportunity Act was the Head Start program. Funds were provided for play groups, day care, and activities designed to help underprivileged children get ready for elementary school. Head Start enjoyed bipartisan support for decades.
Johnson Defeats a Conservative Challenger If
Johnson was to continue his War on Poverty and other social goals, he needed to win the 1964 presidential election. In that year, the Republicans nominated Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, whose economic and social views were directly opposed to Johnson’s.
Whereas Johnson believed the federal government could best regulate the economy and promote social justice, Goldwater maintained that the federal government was the problem, not the solution. According to Goldwater, social and economic issues, such as racism and poverty, should not be addressed by the federal government.
Goldwater promised to rein in the federal government by reducing its size and restricting its activities. He favored significant tax cuts and right-to-work laws, and he opposed social welfare legislation and government spending on educational, public housing, and urban renewal programs.
In 1964, most Americans were not ready for Goldwater’s conservative message. In addition, Johnson’s campaign portrayed Goldwater as an extremist, suggesting that his election would ensure the repeal of civil rights legislation and economic ruin.
Johnson had prosperity on his side, as well as his own impressive legislative record and the legacy of Kennedy. In the November election, he won a landslide victory capturing more than 60 percent of the popular vote and carrying all but six states.
Goldwater carried only Arizona and five southern states— Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Furthermore, the outcome of the election was significant. The South was no longer solidly Democrat. Not only had Johnson won a ringing victory but Democrats had captured both houses of Congress.
Although Goldwater suffered a crushing political defeat in 1964, his conservative ideas resonated with

many. Support for Goldwater’s message remained strong in parts of California, propelling Ronald Reagan to the governor's office in 1966. When a conservative tide swept Reagan into the White House in 1981, Goldwater regained some influence and continued to be a strong voice on behalf of modern American conservatives.

How did Johnson continue Kennedy's plan to eliminate poverty in the United States?
Creating the Great Society
In the spring of 1964, in a speech at the University of Michigan, Johnson outlined his vision for America, calling it the Great Society. He said that during the past hundred years, Americans had spread across the continent, developed industrially, and created great wealth. But the work of America was not complete. He added,
The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use that wealth to enrich and elevate our national life, and to

increasing Access to Healthcare In the first half of 1965, Congress passed parts of Johnson’s Great Society legislation. Kennedy had supported similar legislation that failed to win congressional support. Johnson’s agenda amended the Social Security Act by adding the Medical Care for the Aged Program, or Medicare, as it was more popularly called. Medicare provided basic health insurance for Americans in the Social Security system who were age 65 and older. It was funded by a new tax on workers’ earnings and by payments from the Social Security benefits of retirees.
» President Johnson gave healthcare special attention. With Medicare and Medicaid, more Americans would be able to receive basic healthcare.
The new law also included a Medicaid feature that provided basic medical services to poor and disabled Americans who were not part of the Social Security system. Johnson signed the bill into law in Independence, Missouri, home of former President Harry Truman, who had called for a national health insurance program almost 20 years earlier.
When the Social Security Act was amended, few questions were raised about how programs like Medicare and Medicaid would be paid for in the years to come. Medicare has become increasingly expensive as medical costs have risen, the percent of retirees in the population relative to workers has increased, and because people live longer now than they did in 1965.
Investing in Public Education Along with health, education was one of the centerpieces of the Great Society program. Improved healthcare and education were necessary steps toward the goal of ending poverty
The 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act was designed to aid schools in poorer communities. It provided federal funds to improve school libraries, learning centers, language laboratories, and services in impoverished school districts. The act dramatically increased funding for Indian, inner city, and Mexican American schools.
Environmental and Consumer Protection The
Great Society program extended to improving the overall quality of American life. In the early 1960s, several best-selling books raised Americans’ awareness about environmental and consumer problems. Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1962) detailed how chemical fertilizers and pesticides were damaging the fragile ecosystem. Ralph Nader’s Unsafe at Any Speed (1965) attacked the automotive industry for its lack of concern for passenger safety.
Both these books helped to foster environmental and consumer activity and led to several important pieces of legislation. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (1966) established safety standards for automotive vehicles and created the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to administer them. The Water Quality Act (1965), the Clean Water Restoration Act (1966), and the Air Quality Act (1967) aimed at improving water and air standards in the country. The U.S. Public Health Service was empowered to enforce air quality standards, but dealing with water pollution was largely left to the states. Not until the Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1970 did the federal government gain significant regulatory power to protect the environment.

Less Restrictive Immigration Policies Meanwhile, the civil rights movement was raising questions about America’s long-standing immigration policy. The National Origins Acts of 1921 and 1924 had established a quota system that favored Western European immigrants and limited immigrants from other parts of the world. Such a discriminatory policy was clearly out of touch with the mood of the country in the early 1960s.
The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 altered America’s quota system. Nearly 170,000 immigrants from the Eastern Hemisphere were allowed into the country. Nearly 120,000 immigrants from the Western Hemisphere were welcomed. Immigrants from Latin America, Central America, the Caribbean, and Asia soon began to pour into the United States, providing the country with a pool of ideas, talent, and skills.
The doors of America were once again open to immigrants from around the world. During the 1960s and 1970s, millions of immigrants would arrive on American shores. Like earlier immigrants, many came seeking economic opportunity. Others were fleeing war or social unrest or were in search of political or religious freedom. As in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, New York and the urban East and West coasts attracted many of the country’s newest immigrants.
The Legacy of the Great Society Although critics said that Great Society programs did not work, many point out that these programs have improved the lives of millions of individual Americans. Poverty and infant mortality rates declined. Medicare and Medicaid delivered needed healthcare to millions of elderly and poor Americans. Head Start and other antipoverty programs provided the educational tools many underprivileged Americans needed to escape poverty. Furthermore, Congress also provided artists and scholars with assistance through the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, created in 1965.
The better future that the Great Society envisioned inspired many Americans, including women and minorities, to take action to expand their economic opportunities. Latino farm workers formed a union and organized national boycotts of farm products to win better wages. Latino students boycotted their schools to demand better education. Meanwhile, Asian Americans made economic gains unmatched by any other minority group. Women, too, made great advances during this time. By 1970 the percentage of women with college degrees was nearly double what it had been in 1950.
The Great Society victories may not have been as grandiose as Johnson predicted, but they were victories. The simple fact that 22.2 percent of all Americans lived
Civil Rights and Reform in the 1960s	525	8.5 Reform Under Johnson

below the poverty line in 1960 and 12.6 percent lived below the poverty line in 1970 says something about the triumphs of the Great Society.

The Impact of the Warren Court
During the 1960s, the Supreme Court demonstrated a willingness to take the lead on controversial social, religious, and political issues. Led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Supreme Court at this time—often called the Warren Court—became the most liberal in American history. Its decisions supported civil rights, civil liberties, voting rights, and personal privacy.
A
Principle of Voting Rights In several decisions the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the “one man, one vote” principle. The problem was one of apportionment » The Warren Court issued many landmark rulings in the areas of civil rights, criminal justice, the First Amendment, and legislative districting.
Interactive Gallery
of seats in state legislatures. During the twentieth century, large numbers of voters moved from rural to urban areas, but many state governments had not changed, or reapportioned, electoral districts to reflect the new conditions.
This led to an electoral imbalance. In many states, rural areas had more power and urban areas had less power than their populations actually mandated.
In Baker v. Carr (1962), the Supreme Court ruled in favor of reapportionment on the basis of “one man, one vote.” Electoral districts, it said, had to reflect the numbers of people in those districts. In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the Court reaffirmed its decision, adding that any arrangement other than “one man, one vote" violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Redefining Civil Rights and Liberties In several decisions, the Warren Court expanded the definition of what constitutes free speech. For example, in Tinker v. Des Moines School District (1969), the Court ruled that wearing black armbands in school to protest the Vietnam War was protected as “symbolic” speech. The decision also made it clear that students do not give up all of their rights to free speech while in school.
In the Tinker decision, critics complained that the Court interpreted the Constitution too loosely, taking their judicial interpretation of the Constitution too far. The Court applied what critics have called judicial interpretation to the Constitution. That is, the Justices expanded the Constitution’s meaning beyond the framers’ original intent. In this case, the Court expanded the definition of free speech to include more than the spoken word. A narrow, or strict, construction of the First Amendment would have protected only actual speech.
The Warren Court also showed a heightened concern for the constitutional rights of accused lawbreakers. In four landmark cases, the Court broadened the individual rights of accused criminals and narrowed those of federal, state, and local government officials. In Mapp v. Ohio (1961), the Court ruled that evidence obtained illegally violated the Fourth Amendment and had to be excluded from federal and state trials. In Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), the Court decided that all accused criminals had the right to a lawyer whether or not they could pay for one.
In Escobedo v. Illinois (1964), the Warren Court expanded on Gideon v. Wainwright by adding that every accused lawbreaker had to be offered access to a lawyer before questioning, and all evidence obtained from a suspect who had not been informed of his or her right to a lawyer could not be used in court. Finally in Miranda v. Arizona (1966), the Court ruled that an
Civil Rights and Reform in the 1960s	526	8.5 Reform Under Johnson
accused criminal had to be informed of his or her Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights before being questioned.
Critics of these decisions argued that the Warren Court had tipped the balance of justice in favor of the rights of accused criminals. Today, many conservative justices still side with this opinion. The majority of the members of the Warren Court, however, countered that the rights of individuals had to be protected, especially when freedom hung in the balance.
Church and State in the Public Sphere The Warren Court addressed the separation of church and state in the case of Engel v. Vitale (1962). The case involved whether or not a public school could require students to recite a state-sanctioned prayer. The Court ruled that school prayer was a violation of the First Amendment and an attempt by a governmental body to promote religion. The next year, the Court ruled in Abington v. Schempp that Bible reading in public schools also violated the First Amendment. The two decisions divided religious groups and the American people. Some welcomed the rulings, saying the government should have no say in personal religious matters. Others insisted the decisions were hostile to religion. The two decisions ignited, and continue to ignite, controversy. For more than 40 years, various religious groups have railed against these decisions.

During a May Day rally in Havana, Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro stokes public distrust of the United States, accusing it of preparing to attack Cuba through nearby Latin American countries.
Interactive Flipped Video
John Kennedy’s 1960 campaign stressed the need for the United States to move forward with vigor and determination. Kennedy argued that during the Eisenhower years America had lost ground in the Cold War struggle against communism. He pointed to the new communist regime under Fidel Castro in Cuba and charged that there was now a “missile gap’’ that left the U.S. nuclear missile force inferior to that of the Soviet Union. The first goal of the Kennedy administration would be to build up the nation’s armed forces.

Kennedy Strives to Win the Cold War
Nowhere was the difference between Eisenhower and Kennedy more evident than in two important 1961 addresses. In his farewell address, Eisenhower counseled caution in foreign affairs. “The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist,” he said.
As the first President born in the twentieth century, Kennedy proclaimed that a "new generation of Americans” was ready to meet any challenge. In his inaugural address, Kennedy warned his country's enemies:

As the Cold War continued into the 1960s, Kennedy took office facing the spread of communism abroad and the threat of nuclear war. Determined to succeed where he felt Eisenhower had failed, Kennedy’s enthusiasm and commitment to change offered the hope that with hard work and persistence the United States could win the Cold War. Kennedy issued a challenge to Americans: "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.”
Significant National Decisions Impact the Cold War Eisenhower’s defense policy of “massive retaliation” had emphasized the construction of nuclear weapons. Although Kennedy did not ignore the possibility of a nuclear war, he wanted to make sure that the United States was prepared to fight both conventional wars and conflicts against guerrilla forces. Kennedy therefore gave increased funding to conventional U.S. Army and Navy forces as well as to Army Special Forces, such as the Green Berets. He wanted a “flexible response” defense policy, one that prepared the United States to fight any type of conflict.
Important International Decisions Shape the Cold War The “Third World,” as it was known at the time, was made up of the developing nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America that did not align themselves with the United States or the Soviet Union. According to Soviet propaganda, Western capitalism created poverty and inequalities in the Third World, whereas communism promoted equality.
Like previous American leaders, Kennedy believed that democracy combined with prosperity would contain or limit the spread of communism. Therefore, he initiated programs to economically and politically strengthen the nations of the Third World. The Peace Corps, created in 1961, sent American volunteers around the world on “missions of freedom” to assist developing countries. They worked to provide technical, educational, and health services. The first Peace Corps volunteers arrived in Ghana, Africa, in 1961, to work as teachers. By the end of the year, the Peace Corps had volunteers working in two other countries in Africa— Nigeria and Tanzania. The program celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2011 and had 8,073 volunteers in 76 countries in 2012.
Other programs stressed purely economic development. One such project, the Alliance for Progress promised to resurrect America’s Good Neighbor policy toward Latin America. During the 1950s, many Latin Americans had grown increasingly resentful of the United States, claiming that it had too cauch influence in their region. Kennedy hoped the Alliance for Progress would change that view.
» President-elect Kennedy meets President Eisenhower at the White House in December, 1960. After he took office, Kennedy increased defense spending by $6 billion.
» By 1963, the Peace Corps had over 7,300 volunteers serving in over 40 countries, including Togo. President Kennedy appointed his brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, as the Peace Corps’s first director.
The Vietnam War Era 543	9-1 The Cold War and Vietnam
At its start in 1961, the program pledged $20 billion to help 22 Latin American nations raise their per capita income, distribute income more equitably, and improve industry, agriculture, health, and welfare. Unlike the Peace Corps, however, the Alliance for Progress was not successful.
H CONTRAST
How did the message of Kennedy’s inaugural address differ from that of Eisenhower’s farewell address?
Kennedy Responds to Communism in Cuba
In 1959, Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro succeeded in overthrowing the regime of Fulgencio Batista. Initially, the United States attempted to cultivate good relations with Castro. However, it soon became clear that the Cuban leader was determined to nationalize land held by U.S. citizens, enforce radical reform measures, and accept Soviet economic and military aid. Thousands of wealthy and middle-class Cubans fled their country, many settling in Miami and southern Florida. Proud of their heritage and deeply anticommunist, they made new lives for themselves and their families in the United States.
Bay of Pigs Invasion After breaking diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961, the Eisenhower administration authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to plan an invasion of Cuba to overthrow Castro. The CIA recruited Cuban exiles and trained them in Guatemala. But when Eisenhower left office, the invasion plan was still that—an unexecuted plan.
Pressured by members of the CIA and his own aides, Kennedy decided to implement the plan. On April 17, 1961, a CIA-led force of Cuban exiles attacked Cuba in the Bay of Pigs invasion. The invasion was greatly mismanaged. The poorly equipped forces landed at the site with no protective cover. All but 300 of the 1,400 invaders were killed or captured. Not only did the Bay of Pigs invasion fail, it probably strengthened Castro’s position in Cuba. It also turned many Cuban Americans against Kennedy.
Kennedy took personal responsibility for the failed invasion. He emphasized, however, that the United States would continue to resist “communist penetration” in the Western Hemisphere.
Kennedy’s Role in the Cuban Missile Crisis
Kennedy’s efforts to contain communism were severely threatened during the Cuban missile crisis. In August and September of 1962 U.S. intelligence discovered that the Soviets were building nuclear missile sites in Cuba,

apparently to protect Castro from another American invasion. When the sites were completed, major East Coast cities and the Panama Canal would be in range of the missiles.
In response to this Soviet aggression, Kennedy demanded the removal of the missiles. In a dramatic television address on October 22, 1962, he blamed Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet premier, for causing a "reckless and provocative threat to world peace.” He also announced that he had approved a naval quarantine (blockade) of Cuba to prevent the Soviets from completing the bases. Behind the scenes, however, Kennedy worked toward a diplomatic settlement. He indicated that he would remove U.S. missiles in Turkey and Italy if the Soviets removed their missiles in Cuba.
After six tense days during which nuclear war seemed a real possibility, Khrushchev agreed to honor the blockade and remove the missiles. As Secretary of State Dean Rusk later told a reporter, "Remember, when you report this, that, eyeball to eyeball, they blinked first.”
The Impact of the Crisis During the Cuban missile crisis, Kennedy and Khrushchev stood on the edge of a nuclear war and then slowly backed away. In the Soviet Union, Khrushchev lost prestige and more hard-line leaders chipped away at his power. In the United States, Kennedy emerged as a more mature and thoughtful leader, one who had faced a frightening test and had remained calm and resolute. The crisis prompted both leaders to move toward detente—a relaxing of tension between rivals. They installed a “hot line” telephone system between Moscow and Washington, D.C., to improve communication. In 1963, the year after the crisis, the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the first nuclear-weapons agreement, which ended aboveground nuclear tests. Thirty-six other nations soon signed the agreement.
H IDENTIFY SUPPORTING DETAILS
What diplomatic enticement did Kennedy offer the Soviets to help solve the Cuban Missile Crisis?
The Causes and Outcomes of the Berlin Crisis
Since 1958, Khrushchev wanted to sign a peace treaty that would put the western zones of Berlin under control East Germany. His actions were motivated by the steady flow of skilled East German workers into West Berlin. Desiring to show his strength, Kennedy stood firm on America’s commitment to defending the rights

of West Berliners and West Germans. At a conference in Vienna in June 1961, Kennedy and Khrushchev focused on Berlin as the key issue. Khrushchev called the present situation “intolerable.”
He demanded that the United States recognize the formal division of Germany and end its military presence in West Berlin. Kennedy refused. He did not want to give up occupation rights he considered critical to defending Western Europe. In a tense atmosphere, Khrushchev said, “I want peace, but if you want war, that is your problem.” Kennedy answered, “It is you, not I who wants to force a change.” The meeting ended abruptly. The conference, meant to relax Cold War tensions, only increased them.
After returning home, both world leaders made moves that threatened the peace. Kennedy asked Congress to dramatically increase military spending. Khrushchev ordered the construction of a wall between East and West Berlin. The Berlin Wall became a visible symbol of the reality of the two Germanys and the gulf between the communist East and the democratic West. Kennedy responded by sending 1,500 U.S. troops to West Berlin. For a time, Russian and American tanks moved within sight of each other. Yet, neither side could fully claim a victory.

Reasons for U.S.
Involvement in Indochina
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson shared a vision for a better America in the 1960s. They also shared a vision for a better world in which America would emerge victorious from its Cold War struggle against global communism. As part of this strategic and ideological battle, the United States established a new line of defense against communism in Vietnam. The conflict in Southeast Asia would grow to be one of the most costly wars in American history.
Situated far away in Southeast Asia, Vietnam did not attract significant American attention until the 1960s. Television news shows rarely mentioned it, and many Americans could not locate it on a map. But over a span of more than ten years, the United States sent several million soldiers to fight in Vietnam. America’s involvement in Vietnam had roots in European colonialism, Cold War politics, and Vietnamese calls for national independence.

The Vietnam War Era 546	9.1 The Cold War and Vietnam
French Control of Indochina in Southeast Asia In
the 1800s, French military forces established control over Indochina, a peninsula in Southeast Asia that includes the modern countries of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Slightly larger than the state of Texas, Indochina included almost 27 million people by the end of World War II. French colonial officials ruled Vietnam with an iron fist. They transplanted French laws into Vietnam and imposed high taxes. French business people acquired large rice and rubber plantations and controlled the mineral wealth of the country. Some Vietnamese, especially wealthier members of society, benefited from western culture and technology. Many others, however, were impoverished by colonialism.
Some Vietnamese rebelled against France’s exploitative rule. Ho Chi Minh became the most important voice demanding independence for Vietnam. Born in 1890, Ho became involved in anti-French organizations as a young man and fled Vietnam in 1912.
He traveled the world, visiting American ports and living periodically in London, Paris, and Moscow. During his 30-year absence, Ho constantly thought and wrote about Vietnam, and he searched for westerners who would support his plans for Vietnamese independence. Ho embraced communism, and eventually Soviet communists rallied to his cause.
The French Fight Nationalism and Communism
During World War II, Japan had undermined French control over Vietnam. But when the conflict ended, France reasserted its colonial claims there. France's problem, however, was that colonialism was a dying institution. World War II had strengthened nationalist movements while weakening the economic and military positions of traditional European powers. In Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh clamored for independence as France struggled to maintain its dwindling global power.
Meanwhile, the United States faced a difficult decision. On the one hand, it supported decolonization. On the other hand, America wanted France as an ally in its Cold War effort to contain the Soviet Union.
President Harry S. Truman believed that if he supported Vietnamese independence, he would weaken anticommunist forces in France. So, to ensure a strong, anticommunist Western Europe, Truman sacrificed his own anticolonial sentiments.
Vietnam thus became a pawn in Cold War politics. To ensure French support in the Cold War, Truman agreed to aid France’s efforts to regain control over Vietnam. After communist forces won the civil war in China in 1949, America increased its aid to the French in Vietnam. Truman did not want to see another

communist victory in Asia. Between 1950 and 1954, the United States contributed $2.6 billion to France’s war efforts. Containing Ho Chi Minh’s communist Vietminh—an abbreviation of the League for the Independence of Vietnam— became a national priority.
The Domino Theory Spurs U.S. Involvement in Vietnam When President Dwight D. Eisenhower took office in early 1953, he continued Truman’s policies toward Vietnam. He sent monetary aid to the French, arguing that by battling Ho Chi Minh, they were containing the spread of communism.
Eisenhower told a journalist that the fight in Vietnam involved more than the future of just one country:
You have a row of dominoes set up, you knock over the first one, and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly. So you could have a beginning of a disintegration that would have the most profound influences.
D.
Eisenhower, Arpil 7, 1954 The Vietnam War Era
9.1 The Cold War and Vietnam
The domino theory was the idea that if Vietnam fell to communism, its closest neighbors would follow. This in turn would threaten Japan, the Philippines, and Australia. In short, stopping the communists in Vietnam was important to the protection of the entire region.
In 1954, however, the French lost their eight-year struggle to regain Vietnam. The Vietminh trapped a large French garrison at Dien Bien Phu, a military base in northwest Vietnam, and laid siege to it for 55 days. During the siege, which one Frenchman described as “hell in a very small place,” Vietminh troops destroyed the French airstrip, cut French supply lines, and dug trenches to attack key French positions. Finally, on May 7,1954, after suffering some 15,000 casualties, the French surrendered.
The very next day at an international peace conference in Geneva, Switzerland, France sued for peace. According to the Geneva Accords, France granted independence to Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The accords also divided Vietnam at the seventeenth parallel into two countries, North Vietnam and South Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh’s communist forces ruled in North Vietnam, and an anticommunist government, supported by the United States, assumed
power in South Vietnam. The accords also called for free elections in 1956 to unify Vietnam.

Responds to Communism in Vietnam
During the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, France appealed to the United States for military support. President Eisenhower was willing to supply money but not soldiers. Ike would not commit American troops to defend colonialism in Asia. Nevertheless, the President firmly supported the new anticommunist government of South Vietnam.
The U.S. Escalates Involvement in South Vietnam America channeled aid to South Vietnam in different ways. In 1954, the United States and seven other countries formed the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Similar to NATO’s goal in Europe, SEATO’s goal was to contain the spread of communism in Southeast Asia.

The Vietnam War Era = 548	9-1 The Cold War and Vietnam
The United States provided economic and military aid to the South Vietnamese government led by Ngo Dinh Diem. Diem was an ardent nationalist and anticommunist. Although he lacked popular appeal, his anticommunism guaranteed American support. When it came time for the 1956 unification elections, American intelligence analysts predicted that Diem would lose to the more popular Ho Chi Minh. Rather than risk losing, Diem refused to participate in the elections, a move made with the support of the U.S. government.
Impact of the Communist Insurgency By 1957, a communist rebel group in the South, known as the National Liberation Front (NLF), had committed itself to undermining the Diem government and uniting Vietnam under a communist flag. NLF guerrilla fighters, called Vietcong, launched an insurgency in which they assassinated government officials and destroyed roads and bridges. Supplied by communists in North Vietnam, the Vietcong employed surprise hit-and-run tactics to weaken Diem’s hold on South Vietnam.
Diem’s own policies also weakened his position in South Vietnam. A devout Roman Catholic in an overwhelmingly Buddhist nation, Diem did little to build a broad political base. Instead, he signed anti-Buddhist legislation and refused to enact significant land reforms. His lack of popular support hurt him in the civil war against North Vietnam. Only the support of the United States kept the unpopular leader in power.
Kennedy Sends U.S. Troops to Vietnam After his election in 1960, President John F. Kennedy took a more aggressive stand against the communists in Vietnam. Beginning in 1961, he sent Special Forces troops to South Vietnam to advise the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) on more effective ways to fight the communist forces. By 1963, more than 15,000 American military personnel were fighting in Vietnam.
Although U.S. military personnel fought bravely and achieved some success, Diem continued to alienate South Vietnamese citizens. By late 1963, his regime was in shambles. Buddhists protested his restrictive policies, occasionally by setting themselves on fire. The Kennedy administration eventually concluded that South Vietnam needed new leadership. Working behind the scenes, Americans plotted with anti-Diem generals to overthrow Diem’s government. On November 1, 1963, Diem was removed from power; he was assassinated the following day.

Johnson was sworn in as the new President. Johnson was a Cold War traditionalist who held a monolithic view of communism. For this “Cold Warrior,” communism in the Soviet Union, China, and Vietnam were all the same. He did not recognize subtle differences. He also knew that the American people expected victory in Vietnam. Reasons for Escalating Conflict In 1964, President Johnson faced his first crisis in Vietnam. On August 2, North Vietnamese torpedo boats fired on the American destroyer USS Maddox as it patrolled the Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of North Vietnam. The Maddox was not hit, and it returned fire on the North Vietnamese boat. Johnson promptly responded to the attack and to other North Vietnamese provocations. He announced that “aggression by terror against peaceful villages of South Vietnam has now been joined by open aggression on the high seas against the United States of America.” Troubled by increasing strikes against an American
ally, Johnson ordered an airstrike against North Vietnam.
Congress Gives Johnson Broad Military Powers
The President next asked Congress to authorize the use of force to defend American troops. With little debate and only two senators voting against it, Congress agreed to Johnson’s request and passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. The resolution authorized the President “to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.” The resolution gave Johnson tremendous war powers. It allowed him to commit U.S. troops to South Vietnam and fight a war against North Vietnam without ever going back to Congress to ask for a declaration of war. By authorizing the resolution, Congress had handed its war powers as expressed in the Constitution to the executive branch. This raised questions about the relationship between the legislative and executive branches of government. Presidents Johnson and Nixon used the resolution as the legal basis for their military policies in Vietnam.

In February 1965, President Johnson dramatically altered the U.S. role in the Vietnam War. In response to a Vietcong attack that killed American troops at Pleiku, Johnson ordered the start of Operation Rolling Thunder, the first sustained bombing campaign against North Vietnam. Johnson hoped that this new strategy of intensive bombing would convince North Vietnam to stop reinforcing the Vietcong in South Vietnam.
The bombs caused widespread destruction, but they failed to convince North Vietnam to make peace. As the communist forces continued to fight, the United States committed more troops to battle them on the ground. American soldiers moved beyond their advisory roles and assumed greater combat responsibilities, while South Vietnamese troops accepted a secondary, more limited role in the war. U.S. military and civilian leaders hoped that American airstrikes, along with the troops on the ground, would eventually force the communists to the peace table.

McNamara and General William Westmoreland, the American commander in South Vietnam. These two advisors believed that the United States needed to increase its military presence in Vietnam and do more of the fighting in order to win the war. Operation Rolling Thunder and increased troop commitments fulfilled this need to “Americanize” the war effort.
Beginning in March 1965, U.S. airstrikes hammered North Vietnam and Vietcong strong points in South Vietnam. Between 1965 and 1973, American pilots dropped more than 6 million tons of bombs on enemy positions—almost three times the tonnage dropped by all the combatants during World War II. In addition to conventional bombs, American pilots dropped napalm and sprayed Agent Orange. Napalm is a jellied gasoline which was dropped in large canisters that exploded on impact, covering large areas in flames. It clung to anything it touched and was difficult to extinguish. Agent Orange is an herbicide meant to kill plant life. U.S.
forces used it to defoliate forest areas that might conceal enemy fighters and to disrupt the enemy’s food supply. Almost half of South Vietnam’s forested areas were sprayed at least once, and the ecological impact was devastating. There also may have been a hidden human cost, as many scientists believe that Agent Orange causes cancers and other physical problems.

As airstrikes intensified, American ground troops landed in South Vietnam. On March 8, 1965, U.S. Marines arrived to defend the airbase at Da Nang. They were soon followed by other troops. The soldiers accepted a wide range of missions. Some guarded bases. Others conducted search-and-destroy missions to kill as many Vietcong guerrillas as they could. Helicopters ferried commandos to and from remote locations for quick strikes against enemy positions.
Vietcong Tactics and Strategies Large-scale battles against Vietcong or North Vietnamese Army units were not typical of America’s strategy in Vietnam. American soldiers generally fought lightly armed Vietcong guerrillas in small engagements.
Ho Chi Minh’s military doctrine hinged on fighting only when victory was assured, which meant never fighting on his opponents’ terms. He compared his troops to a tiger, while the Americans were like an elephant. If the tiger stands still, the elephant will crush it. But if the tiger keeps moving and occasionally jumps on the elephant to take a bite out of it, the elephant will slowly bleed to death.
During the war, the Vietcong behaved like Ho’s tiger. They traveled light, often carrying just a rifle and a few handfuls of rice. They hid in tunnels during the day and emerged at night to ambush American patrols. They infiltrated American bases and set off explosives. They

set booby traps that maimed and crippled American troops. Their strategy was to wear the Americans down. The leaders of North Vietnam and the Vietcong remained convinced that if they could just avoid losing the war, the Americans would eventually leave.
American Casualties Escalate American strategy during this stage of the war yielded limited results. U.S. bombers did disrupt North Vietnamese industry and slow the movement of supplies to the Vietcong. But when the communists did not sue for peace, American troop commitments and battlefield deaths escalated rapidly. By the end of 1965, there were 184,300 U.S. troops in Vietnam, and only 636 American soldiers had died in the war. Three years later, there were more than 500,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, and the number of American dead had risen to more than 30,000.
Each year, the war claimed more American lives and cost more American dollars. But at the end of each year, the United States seemed no closer to success. America’s mission was to help South Vietnam build a stable noncommunist nation and thereby win the “hearts and minds” of its citizens. But corruption Plagued the South Vietnamese administrative structure. Outside of the major cities, the government enjoyed little support. Although American forces won most of the larger battles, they did not achieve a successful end to the war. By 1967, the war had devolved into a stalemate. Some U.S. critics of the war

Patriotism, Heroism, and Sinking Morale
For American soldiers in the field, the Vietnam War presented difficult challenges that demanded courage and patience. Unlike World War II, the Vietnam War did not emphasize territorial acquisition. The United States and its allies did not invade North Vietnam, march on Ho Chi Minh’s capital of Hanoi, or attempt to destroy the communist regime. As in the Korean War, the United States was wary of triggering both Chinese and Soviet entry into the conflict. Instead, U.S. forces supported the survival and development of South Vietnam, which was besieged by the Vietcong and their North Vietnamese allies. In this fight, U.S. troops could never fully tell their friends from their

enemies. Yet from the outset, they faced the dangers of Vietnam’s battlefields with dedication and bravery.
New Battlefield Dangers and Guerrilla Warfare Although American troops won numerous battles, they could not win the war outright. The problem was that the Vietcong and North Vietnamese avoided significant engagements. Rather than expose themselves to superior American firepower, the communists employed guerrilla warfare tactics, fighting smaller skirmishes where their small-unit abilities and their knowledge of the landscape bettered their chances for victory.
U.S. forces often had no alternative but to fight indecisive battles in the jungles, rice paddies, and mountains of Vietnam. Most of these battlefields abounded with natural cover. Clad in black clothing, Vietcong gunmen would spring out of the dense foliage, attack with automatic rifles and grenades, and disappear back into the landscape. Much of this fighting took place at night, which reduced the effectiveness of American planes, artillery, and troop tactics.
American Soldiers Fulfill Their Duty
Despite the trials of war, American soldiers adapted to adverse conditions in Vietnam and fought with the same intensity that U.S. forces had shown in World Wars I and II. Many fought to prevent the spread of communism. Some fought to protect villagers in South Vietnam and win their trust and respect. Others fought because their country was at war, and they felt it was their duty. A medic in the First Infantry Division explained his reason for going to Vietnam:
I volunteered. . . . Ever since the

Women also displayed courage and valor. About 10,000 American military women served in Vietnam during the war. Most female military personnel were nurses.
Not only did they face danger working close to the front, but they also had to cope with the emotional toll of constantly working with injured and dying soldiers and civilians.
Lynda Van Devanter volunteered to go to Vietnam and spent a year there as a nurse. Like other nurses, she confronted war and death on a daily basis. However, on one occasion she had to deliver a baby. She later recalled:
It was creation of life in the midst of all that destruction. And creation of life restored your sanity. . . . Those were the things that kept you going. That there was life coming. There was still hope.
—Lynda. Van Devanter, United States Army nurse
Questioning the Cause As the war lengthened, many Americans began to question U.S. involvement. The earliest soldiers in Vietnam had been volunteers, men committed to the fight against communism. But
by the end of 1965, most American soldiers in Vietnam had been drafted into military service, and they were not as certain that preserving the government in South Vietnam was crucial to American interests. They sensed that many South Vietnamese people were indifferent—if not openly hostile—to their own nation. Increasingly, it seemed that Americans were dying to defend a nation whose people were unwilling to die to defend themselves.

Doubt Grows on the Home Front
The lack of progress toward victory in Vietnam also led to doubt in the United States. When President Johnson had begun to send troops to war, Americans had expected a relatively quick victory. After all, the United States was a militarily powerful, technologically advanced country, and North Vietnam was a poor country with comparatively little technology. Over the next few years, the Johnson administration kept asserting that an American victory was close at hand. But when that did not come, many began to question the President’s foreign policy.
Impact of Defense Spending on the Economy The
war strained government finances. President Johnson’s
The Vietnam War Era 555	9.2 America’s Role Escalates
Great Society plan called for enormous domestic spending to eliminate poverty, improve education and medical care, and fight racial discrimination. The costs of fighting a war on the other side of the world were just as mammoth. Although massive government spending lowered the unemployment rate, it also led to rising prices and inflation. The combination of heavy government spending, rising prices, and inflation forced Johnson to raise taxes. Ultimately, Johnson had to cut back on his Great Society reform initiatives to help pay for the war.
An Antiwar Movement Emerges As long as America’s involvement in Vietnam had been small and relatively inexpensive, few politicians voiced serious opposition. Congress offered bipartisan support for the Vietnam policies of Johnson’s predecessors. Soon after the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, however, Congressional support began to waver over the President’s escalation of the war.
Beginning in 1967, Congress—and eventually most of the nation—divided into two camps: hawks and doves. The mostly conservative hawks supported Johnson’s war policy. Believing strongly in the containment of communism and the domino theory, they accepted rising troop levels, escalating costs, and increasing numbers of battlefield deaths. For the hawks, Vietnam was a crucial front in the Cold War. Doves, however, broke with Johnson’s war policy. A diverse group that included liberal politicians, pacifists, student radicals, and civil rights leaders, doves questioned the war on both moral and strategic grounds. For them, the conflict was a localized civil war, not a vital Cold War battleground.
Senator J. William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, emerged as the
early leader of the doves in Congress. A Democrat who had supported the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Fulbright soon came to believe that the war in Vietnam was a national civil war, not a Cold War conflict directed from Moscow or Beijing. In 1967 and 1968, Fulbright held public hearings on the war, providing a platform for critics of the conflict.

President Johnson sent more American troops to Vietnam in order to win the war. But with each passing year, casualty lists got longer and victory seemed further away. As soldiers died abroad and hawks and doves argued at home, the Vietnam War opened up a deep emotional rift in American society. After the war ended, it would take years for the country to heal itself.

Movement
Antiwar Sentiment Grows
The war in Vietnam divided Americans more deeply than any conflict since the Civil War. Although most Americans initially supported President Johnson’s bombings and troop deployments, by 1966 critics began speaking out. Senator Fulbright’s opposition to the war hurt Johnson in Congress, and the senator was soon joined by like-minded activists who believed that American soldiers were dying in a war that had little to do with American interests.
Protesting the Draft By 1965, most of the troops sent to Vietnam were no longer volunteers who had enlisted in the army. Instead, they were draftees—young men drafted into military service—who had been assigned a tour in Vietnam. In accordance with the Selective Service Act of 1948, the government drafted more than 1.5 million men into military service during the Vietnam War. All males had to register the draft when they turned 18, and the Selective Service System
called up draftees based on projected military needs.
Critics of the Selective Service System argued that the draft was
not fair. The system gave local draft boards considerable influence in selecting men for service, and it also granted deferments to college

students and men who worked in certain designated occupations. Most of the 2.5 million men who served in Vietnam came from working-class and poor backgrounds.
During the Johnson presidency, the number of African American troops fighting and dying in Vietnam was also disproportionately high. At the beginning of the war, African Americans suffered more than 20 percent of the total combat deaths, roughly twice the percentage of the U.S. population. Additionally African American soldiers were more likely to serve in combat positions and less likely to become commissioned officers.
Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., spoke out against the added war burden shouldered by African American soldiers. Speaking at a New York church in 1967, King said that the war was hurting both poor blacks and whites. Vietnam was drawing human and economic resources away from America’s other wars on poverty and discrimination. He added that it hindered poor Americans in other more direct ways:
It was sending their sons and their brothers and their husbands to fight and to die in extraordinary high proportions relative to the rest of the population. . . . [W]e have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools.
—Martin Luther King, Jr., 1967
Perceived inequities in the draft led to widespread resistance. Antiwar advocates sponsored Stop the Draft Week in October 1967, and some draft-eligible males burned their draft cards in protest. Finally in 1969, the Selective Service System adopted a lottery that was designed to eliminate deferment abuses and create a more diverse army of draftees.
Protests on College Campuses Across America, college campuses became centers of antiwar sentiment. Professors and students criticized the war for a variety of reasons, ranging from pacifism and the war’s effects on the economy to a personal desire to avoid military service. Antiwar activity on college campuses did not, however, reflect the attitudes of all Americans.
In fact, many professors remained vocal in their defense of the war effort during lectures and at
The Vietnam War Era 558	9.3 The Antiwar Movement
protest rallies. For the most part, though, colleges and universities were focal points of the strongest antiwar opinion.
Antiwar activities were part of more significant changes taking place on college campuses. Never before the 1960s had so many Americans entered colleges and universities. Between 1946 and 1970, the number of students enrolled in institutions of higher education increased from 2 million to 8 million. Many college students became a class unto themselves— segregated from the workforce, free from many adult responsibilities, and encouraged by their professors to think critically. Many of the students who embraced the antiwar cause came from middle-class families. Students from working-class families were less likely to protest against the war.
The University of Michigan and the University of California at Berkeley became important hubs of the antiwar movement. The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was founded in 1960 at the University of Michigan. Originally formed to campaign against racism and poverty, the SDS soon began campaigning to end the war in Vietnam. By 1964, SDS had organized campus "teach-ins” and demonstrations against the war and encouraged draft-age males to sign “We Won’t Go” petitions.
The 26th Amendment Although today people take for granted that 18- to 20-year-olds can vote, this was not the case until 1971. The drive to gain voting rights for young adults was yet another instance of people during this era demanding equality of political rights. In addition, since the issue concerned rights for young people, student activism played a key role in getting out the movement’s key message: "old enough to fight, old enough to vote.”
This idea was not exactly new. President Eisenhower, the former Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in WWII, backed the idea in his 1954 State of the Union message. In it, he said that since 18- to-20-year-old citizens were again and again summoned to risk their lives for our nation, “they should participate in the political process that produces this fateful summons.”
But it was not until the issue was pressed by young people whose lives might soon be on the line in Vietnam that support for this area of voting rights gained steam. Once the proposed constitutional amendment won congressional support on March 23, 1971, it was quickly ratified by the states. By July 7, 1971, once the ratification was certified, the 26th Amendment was in place.

enlisted in the antiwar cause. Hawks and doves drifted farther apart. More groups organized against the war, their names corresponding with whom they represented—Vietnam Veterans Against the War, Catholic Peace Fellowship, Another Mother for Peace, and so on.
Antiwar sentiment was to some degree the result of the news media’s extensive coverage of the war. A large majority of American households now had television sets. Most Americans learned the news of the war by watching TV news reports. Thus, the war in Vietnam became the first “living-room war.” Americans watched its progress—or lack of it—in their living rooms on nightly newscasts.
For the first time, the brutal reality of war was broadcast into Americans’ homes. They saw what the TV cameramen saw: death, destruction, horrible injuries, civilian casualties, and chaos. Horrific images also filled newspapers and news magazines. War correspondents issued reports, not of a string of great American victories leading to a clear goal, but of a messy conflict that seemed to lack a clear objective. As early as 1962, the printed the following gloomy forecast: “The United States seems inextricably committed to a

Yet television and print journalists also broadcast and reported on government officials issuing optimistic statement after optimistic statement. Soon, a “credibility gap” emerged between what the Johnson administration said about the war and what many journalists reported about it. This gap referred to the American public’s growing distrust of the statements made by the government.

The Tet Offensive
In November 1967, President Johnson brought General Westmoreland home from Vietnam to address the nation’s concerns about the war. Westmoreland said that the Vietcong were declining in strength and could no longer mount a major offensive. As Westmoreland made his claims, however, the North Vietnamese and Vietcong were planning just such an attack.
Widespread Attacks In early 1968, U.S. officials anticipated a communist offensive. As expected, on January 21, the North Vietnamese Army hit Khe Sanh in northwest South Vietnam. However, ten days later, the communists expanded their attack by hitting U.S. and ARVN positions throughout South Vietnam. The Tet Offensive—named after the Vietnamese lunar new year—was a coordinated assault on 36 provincial capitals and 5 major cities, as well as the U.S. embassy in Saigon.
The communists planned to take and hold the cities until the urban population took up arms in their support. They thought the Tet Offensive had a good chance of ending the war.
The fighting was fierce, but in the end, American and South Vietnamese forces repelled the offensive, and there was no popular uprising against the government of South Vietnam. Although U.S. forces won a tactical victory by preventing the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army from achieving their primary objectives, the Tet Offensive was a strategic blow to the Americans. It demonstrated that the communists had not lost the will or the ability to fight on.
Shifting Policy from Victory to Peace After the Tet Offensive, American military leaders seemed less confident of a quick end to the war. When Westmoreland requested more troops, President Johnson asked his

new Secretary of Defense, Clark Clifford, to take an objective look at the military and political situation in Vietnam. The deeper Clifford delved into the matter, the more pessimistic he became. Sending more troops would inevitably require raising taxes, increasing draft rolls, and calling up reserves. It would lead to increased casualties in the field and dissent at home. And it still might not lead to victory. Clifford, calling the war “a bottomless pit,” concluded that the President should radically shift U.S. policy from one that pursued victory to one that pursued a negotiated peace.
Johnson Refuses to Seek Reelection While Clifford deliberated, many Americans began to turn dramatically against the war. Some marched in protest and engaged in antiwar activities. Others registered their disapproval at the polls. In early 1968, Minnesota senator Eugene McCarthy, the antiwar candidate for the Democratic Party nomination, made a surprisingly strong showing in the New Hampshire primary. Sensing that Johnson was in a politically weakened position, New York’s Democratic senator Robert Kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidency. Both McCarthy and Kennedy believed that the war had divided America and drained resources away from the fights against poverty and discrimination. What Johnson feared most was happening: The war was undermining his presidency.
On March 31, 1968, two months after the Tet Offensive, the President addressed the nation on television. He announced that America would limit its bombing of North Vietnam and seek a negotiated settlement to the war. Johnson then shocked the nation by announcing that he would not run for another term as President. The speech marked another turning point in the war. The fight for victory was over. Peace was now the official government policy.

time of new ideas and new plans. But the optimism and high hopes of the early campaign would soon die amidst political infighting, violence, and assassination.
King and Kennedy Assassinated In the spring and summer of the campaign season, bullets struck down two Americans who spoke out eloquently for peace in Vietnam and peaceful change in American society. Martin Luther King Jr., the most prominent leader of the civil rights movement, had publicly turned against the war in 1967. He contributed compelling social and moral reasons to the argument for peace. But his voice was tragically silenced on April 4, 1968, when a racist assassin shot and killed him in Memphis, Tennessee.
Robert Kennedy was the next leader to fall. He had based his campaign for the presidency on compassion and idealism, and millions of Americans rallied to his camp. On June 5, 1968, at a rally celebrating his victory in the California primary, Kennedy asserted that “we are a great country, an unselfish country, a compassionate country,” and that he intended “to make that the basis of my running.” Minutes later, a Palestinian immigrant named Sirhan Sirhan shot Kennedy in the head, killing him instantly. Sirhan may have wanted revenge for America’s support for Israel in that country’s war with Egypt the year before.
» Chaos ensued as police clashed with protestors outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago.
The Chicago Democratic Convention The murders of King and Kennedy cast a dark shadow over the election campaigns. In August 1968, the Democrats convened in Chicago to choose a presidential candidate to represent their party in the November election. As the delegates arrived, so too did antiwar protesters. Chicago’s mayor deployed police and members of the National Guard to prevent any outbreaks of violence.
Inside the convention, the Democrats angrily debated placing an antiwar plank in the party platform. They chose Hubert Humphrey, Johnson’s Vice President, over Eugene McCarthy, who had garnered support from many antiwar groups. As the delegates cast their votes, violence between police and protesters erupted outside the convention. After police beat activists with nightsticks, some protesters retaliated by throwing rocks and bottles at the onrushing tide of police.
The television coverage of the fierce fighting in the streets and the bitter arguments on the convention floor shocked Americans. Chaos and civil disorder appeared to have replaced civil debate in the political arena. The divisions and violence in Chicago mirrored the deep divisions in American politics and the heartbreaking violence on the front lines in Vietnam.
Richard Nixon Wins the Presidency At a much more peaceful convention in Miami, Republicans nominated Richard M. Nixon, who promised if elected he would deliver “peace with honor.” He wanted the United States out of Vietnam, but he also demanded honorable peace terms.
He promised to listen to “the great, quiet forgotten majority—the nonshouters and the nondemonstrators.” This large group of Americans, described by one commentator as “the unyoung, the unblack, and the unpoor,” was dubbed the “silent majority.” Throughout his campaign, Nixon used a “Southern strategy” of courting more conservative Southern voters with appeals to law and order, striving to pull them away from their traditional support of the Democratic Party
Alabama governor George Wallace also ran for the presidency on a third-party ticket. A lifelong Democrat prior to his entry into the race, Wallace said that neither of the traditional political parties represented Southern voters who were unsettled by the cultural and social changes in the country. He had no sympathy for the demands of antiwar radicals, counterculture hippies, or African American militants. He represented the "white backlash” against the civil rights movement and the desire to press forward to victory in Vietnam.
The combination of Nixon’s “Southern strategy” and Wallace’s third-party candidacy siphoned traditionally Democratic votes away from Humphrey. In a close

election, Nixon captured victory by winning 43.6 percent of the popular vote and 301 electoral votes. Humphrey received 42.5 percent of the popular vote and Wallace 13.6 percent. The election marked the end of the Democratic “Solid South” and signaled significant changes in the nation’s political landscape.

Nixon’s defenders argued that he was a hard-working patriot with a new vision for America. His critics charged that he was a deceitful politician bent on acquiring power and punishing his enemies. There were elements of truth to both views. But defenders and critics alike agreed that Richard Nixon was a determined man with abundant political talent. From his first day in office, the new President realized that ending the Vietnam War was the key to everything else he hoped to achieve.
Peace Talks Stall Though formal peace talks between the warring parties had begun in May 1968, the talks bogged down from the outset due to disagreements and a lack of compromise. When Richard Nixon took office in January 1969, his peace delegation firmly believed they could break the impasse. The Americans and South Vietnamese wanted all communist troops out of South Vietnam.

Vietnam that would include representatives from the Vietcong. Still hoping to win the war in the field, North Vietnam refused to budge from its initial position. And South Vietnam refused to sign any agreement that compromised its security.
Vietnamization President Nixon refused to accept the North Vietnamese peace terms. He was committed to a policy of “peace with honor” and believed that there were still military options.
He continued a gradual pullout of American troops, and expressed faith in the ability of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) to assume the burden of war. He called his approach Vietnamization—U.S. forces would withdraw as ARVN troops assumed more combat duties. The hope was that with continued American aid behind the front lines, the ARVN would fight its own battles to secure South Vietnam.
To reduce the flow of communist supplies to the Vietcong, Nixon ordered the secret bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Cambodia. This was a controversial move because it widened the scope of the war and helped to undermine the neutral government in Cambodia. In the end, neither Vietnamization nor secret bombings dramatically improved South Vietnam's chances of winning a war against the communists.

Antiwar Movement
Nixon inherited two things from Lyndon Johnson: an unpopular war and a vocal American opposition to it. The new President wanted “peace with honor,” security for America’s ally South Vietnam, and international respect for U.S. foreign policy. Antiwar activists wanted the war ended and American troops out of Vietnam— on any terms. Nixon found it increasingly difficult to achieve his goals and satisfy the snowballing antiwar movement.
The War Widens into Cambodia More than a year into office, Nixon had grown impatient with the snail s pace of the peace negotiations. In 1970, he attempted to break the stalemate by ordering a ground attack on North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong bases in Cambodia. Nixon also hoped to aid the pro-American Cambodian government in its fight against the Khmer Rouge, a communist movement supported by North Vietnam.

On the evening of April 30, Nixon addressed the American people, informing them of his decision to carry the war into Cambodia. He stressed that the war had become a measure of how committed the United States was to preserving freedom around the world:
If, when the chips are down, the world’s most powerful nation, the United States of America, acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations . . . throughout the world.
—-President Richard Nixon, 1970
The next morning, U.S. and ARVN forces crossed the border into Cambodia. These soldiers captured large stockpiles of weapons and supplies, but they did not break the stalemate. North Vietnam remained determined to have peace on its terms or no peace at all.
The Kent State Killings The Cambodian incursion had a profound impact on the peace movement at home. It stirred antiwar activists, who argued that Nixon had

widened the war and made the world a more dangerous place. Throughout the country, college campuses erupted with protests. Several demonstrations prompted the police and National Guard to step in to preserve order.
On two campuses, confrontations between students and armed authorities led to deaths. Four days after Nixon’s speech, demonstrators at Kent State University in Ohio threw rocks and bottles at members of the National Guard. When one guardsman thought he heard a sniper’s shot, he fired his rifle. The shot prompted other National Guardsmen to discharge a volley of gunfire into a group of protesters, killing four youths. The Kent State killings led to demonstrations on other campuses. At Jackson State University, a historically African American college in Mississippi, a confrontation between students and police ended with two students dead.
College demonstrations against the war sometimes prompted counterprotests by Americans who supported the President. In response to a May 8, 1970, antiwar rally in downtown New York City, construction workers staged a counter-demonstration, carrying American flags and chanting ‘All the Way USA.”
Believing that some anti-war demonstrators had spit on the American flag, they pushed into the crowd and started hitting the antiwar protesters. The clash drew national attention. Days later, thousands of construction workers, businessmen, secretaries, and housewives marched peacefully through Manhattan’s streets in support of Nixon and the war effort. One man expressed his feelings about the march:
I’m very proud to be an American, and I know my boy that was killed in Vietnam would be here today if he was alive, marching with us. ... I know he died for the right cause, because in his letters he wrote to me he knew what he was fighting for: to keep America free. . . .
—Robert Geary, May 20, 1970
As the fighting continued in Vietnam, the American home front became its own physical and emotional battlefield.
The My Lai Massacre In 1971, two events increased the pressure on Nixon to pull U.S. troops out of Vietnam. The first event had roots in a U.S. action in South Vietnam three years earlier.
The Vietnam War Era 566	9.4 The War’s End and Effects
On March 16, 1968, American forces searching for enemy troops in an area with a strong Vietcong presence came upon the village of My Lai. By this point in the war, many American troops had been injured and killed by Vietcong fighters posing as civilians. It was a recipe for disaster at My Lai, where Lieutenant William Calley’s unit began shooting and killing unarmed civilians. During the assault, U.S. soldiers killed between four and five hundred Vietnamese.
Lt. Calley later maintained that he was following orders, but many of the soldiers present did not participate in the massacre. At least one risked his own life to stop it. The tragedy was made even worse by an inadequate military investigation of the incident. Life magazine eventually published disturbing photos taken during the event, and in March 1971, a military court convicted Lt. Calley of his participation in the attack. News of the My Lai massacre, the coverup, and Calley’s trial shocked many Americans and added fuel to the burning antiwar fire.
The Pentagon Papers On the heels of My Lai came the 1971 publication of the Pentagon Papers in The New York Times. The papers were a classified government history of America’s involvement in Vietnam. The study was leaked to The Times by one of its coauthors, Daniel Ellsberg. Nixon tried to block the full publication, but in New York Times v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled against the administration. The study revealed that American leaders involved the United States in Vietnam without fully informing the American people and occasionally even lied to Congress. Along with the invasion of Cambodia, the killings on college campuses, and the My Lai Massacre, the Pentagon Papers turned even more Americans against the war.
fej CHECK UNDERSTANDING Why did the Nixon
administration try to stop publication of the Pentagon Papers?
The Vietnam War Ends
The failings of Vietnamization and growing dissent at home forced President Nixon to search for some final way out of the conflict. A 1971 public-opinion poll revealed that two thirds of Americans favored withdrawing American troops, even if it meant a communist takeover of South Vietnam. Sensitive to the public mood, Congress pressed Nixon to bring the troops home. Many believed that to win reelection in 1972, he had to end the war.

came to terms on a peace settlement. One month later, with lasting peace almost at hand, Nixon easily defeated the antiwar Democrat George McGovern for reelection. But Nixon’s triumph was short-lived. The Vietnamese peace fell apart when North Vietnam refused to sign the agreement. Talks broke off, but renewed American bombing in North Vietnam finally induced the North Vietnamese to resume negotiations.
At last, in January 1973, the United States, South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and the Vietcong signed the Paris Peace Accords. The parties agreed to a ceasefire and a U.S. troop withdrawal from South Vietnam. POWs would be exchanged, but North Vietnamese troops would remain in South Vietnam. The National Liberation Front (Vietcong) would become a legitimate political party in South Vietnam, and South Vietnam's noncommunist government would remain in power pending a political settlement. With the war ended, the last American troops came home. Among the returning soldiers were more than 550 POWs, most of whom were pilots shot down during the war.
The Fall of Saigon For the United States, the war in Vietnam was over. For the Vietnamese, however, it continued. Neither North nor South Vietnam honored the cease-fire or worked toward a diplomatic settlement of their differences. In the spring of 1975, minor fighting
escalated when North Vietnam launched an offensive against the South.
Without American aid and ground support, the ARVN was no match for the Soviet-supplied North Vietnamese Army. By the end of April, the communists had taken Saigon. After decades of fighting and millions of deaths, Vietnam was unified under one flag.

Effects of the Vietnam War
More than 58,000 American soldiers gave their lives serving their country in Vietnam; another 300,000 were wounded. Although figures are not exact, the Vietnamese death toll most likely exceeded 2 million. Peace, however, did not mean the end of pain and hardship. The end of the war created other problems in Southeast Asia. The war also affected American attitudes toward world affairs.

would spread to other nations in Southeast Asia. In a limited sense, they were right. Communist regimes eventually came to power in both Laos and Cambodia. In Cambodia, the ruling Khmer Rouge unleashed a genocide on the populace, killing everyone who had ties to the West or previous Cambodian governments. Between 1975 and 1979, upwards of 2 million Cambodians were executed or died in labor camps.
In an expanded sense, however, many American foreign-policy strategists misjudged the spread of communism. They concluded it was a monolithic global movement controlled by Moscow and Beijing. However, as the war’s aftermath would attest, communist movements in Southeast Asia were nationalistic and intolerant of outside influences. In 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and installed a pro-Vietnamese government. China supported the ousted Khmer Rouge. For more than ten years that followed, the U.S. supported a coalition of anti-communist Cambodian opposition groups that included the Khmer Rouge.
American Veterans Return Home The war and the
peace divided Americans. Some argued that the United States should never have entered the war and that their leaders had lied to them. Others countered that the war was part of an ongoing struggle against communism and that in the end, the United States betrayed South Vietnam. An unfortunate result of the controversy was that the nation never fully expressed its appreciation to the returning veterans.
Overwhelmingly, the 2.5 million enlisted men who served in Vietnam did so with honor and distinction. Yet, unlike the soldiers that returned to the United States after World Wars I and II—the famed Doughboys and G.I. Joes—few Vietnam vets enjoyed the warmth and adulation of victory parades. In addition to the indifference that some veterans encountered, some also suffered from physical and psychological ailments for years when they returned home.
Not until almost a decade after the end of the war did Americans begin to fully honor the courage and sacrifice of these veterans. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, dedicated in Washington, D.C., in 1982, stands as an eloquent testament to the men and women who served and died in Vietnam.
Individuals of all races and genders served their country during the Vietnam War. There were countless actions of heroism and sacrifice, some of which were singled out for the Congressional Medal of Honor. For example, Army Sergeant Peter C. Lemon fought off numerous enemy assaults even after being seriously wounded three times. Marine Sergeant Rodney M. Davis was one of an astounding number of soldiers who

gave his life to save the lives of others by diving on a live grenade and absorbing the explosion. Green Beret Sergeant Roy P. Benavidez was also decorated for his bravery in combat. Despite terrible injuries, he rescued the lives of at least eight men. For his outstanding gallantry, he was awarded the nation’s highest military award: the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Sergeant Benavidez’ gallant choice to join voluntarily his comrades who were in critical straits, to expose himself constantly to withering enemy fire, and his refusal to be stopped despite numerous severe wounds, saved the lives of at least eight men. His fearless personal leadership, tenacious devotion to duty, and extremely valorous actions in the face of overwhelming odds were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service, and reflect the utmost

The Impact on U.S. Domestic and Foreign Policies
The war was costly both monetarily and in the human toll of shattered lives. The war also altered American domestic and foreign policies. Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society campaign against poverty and racism fell victim to the conflict. Increasingly, between 1964 and 1968, Johnson could not pay for both the Vietnam War and the Great Society. Paying for more guns left less money to pay for textbooks, school lunches, and prenatal care.
Additionally, the war undermined Americans’ trust in their leaders and fragmented the Cold War consensus on foreign affairs. In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Act. The act restricted the President’s warmaking powers by requiring him to consult with Congress within 48 hours of committing American forces to a foreign conflict. The act was a congressional attempt to check the unilateral formation of American foreign policy and stop the growth of the “imperial presidency.”
» The voting age was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1971. Draw Conclusions Why did the war focus attention on the voting age?
Thus, the Vietnam War had an important impact on the relationship between the legislative and executive branches of government. With the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Congress had years earlier granted the President a great deal of power to conduct war using “all necessary measures” without further legislative approval.
The War Powers Act was an attempt to regain some of that power from the executive branch and return it to the legislative branch. Ultimately, the question of where war-making power lies is a constitutional issue. On one hand, the Constitution gives the power to declare war to Congress. On the other, it makes the President commander in chief of the armed forces.
The Vietnam War had an impact on America foreign policy, as well. The deaths and costs and ultimate failure of the war left many Americans with “war fatigue.” Even those who had not been personally touched by the war had grown weary of the conflict. This weariness of war became a social factor that would be reflected in the U.S. role in the world from the 1970s through 1990. Throughout this time, American citizens would cite the Vietnam War as a cautionary tale whenever the country considered using force abroad. Many Americans would view conflicts in Central America, Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East through a lens tinted by the fear of “another Vietnam.”
U ANALYZE INFORMATION
What effect did the quagmire in Vietnam have on U.S. foreign policy through 1990?
The Impact on the American Economy The United States spent about $738 billion (in 2011 dollars) to fight the Vietnam War. Since that time, the government has spent an additional $270 billion on benefits for veterans and their families. These payments continue, costing the federal government more than $20 billion every year. Therefore, the Vietnam War can be said to have cost the country more than $1 trillion—and the price keeps going up.
This is a staggering amount of money, and it has had an enormous impact on the American economy. Many economists view the spending on the Vietnam War as marking the end of the prosperity of post-World War II America. War spending meant war production, and so American factories made military goods instead of consumer goods, warping American industry. Although the relationships are complex, war spending was a factor in federal budget deficits, inflation, higher interest rates, and a weaker dollar.
Interestingly, this greatly increased amount of defense spending did not cut into the amount of money the nation spent on education. By one estimate, public school expenditures actually increased by 58 percent in the 1960s and 27 percent in the 1970s. Federal aid outlays to college students also increased between 1965 and 1975. All in all, however, the American economy in

In the later 1960s, “love-ins”—events celebrating love as a kind of social activism—showcased the countercultural desire to reject norms of behavior and dress.
Many of the generation born after the challenging times of the Great Depression and World War II embraced a different worldview than that of their parents—a worldview that found dramatic expression in the counterculturemovement that arose in the 1960s. Members of the counterculture adopted values that ran counter to mainstream culture. They rebelled against long-standing customs in dress, music, and personal behavior. The counterculture both challenged the values of mainstream American society and provoked a countermovement to reassert traditional values.

A
Counterculture Emerges Countercultural Values The counterculture was rooted in the social and political events of the preceding decade. In the 1950s, the Beat movement had rejected materialism and emphasized the importance of personal experience. The civil rights movement introduced the idea of social and political protest, which intensified the Vietnam antiwar movement. Both movements prompted many people to challenge a range of traditional social behavior, from restrictions on rights to cultural norms in dress or hairstyles. The counterculture also heightened distrust of authority, leading some young people to warn their peers, “Don’t trust anyone over 30.”
Members of the counterculture valued youth, spontaneity, and freedom of expression. In the mid-1960s a subculture known as the hippies emerged. These young people claimed to value peace, love, and freedom. They experimented with new styles of dress and music, freer sexual relationships, and the recreational use of drugs. Their values were so different from traditional ones that many social analysts described America as experiencing a generation gap, in which there was a lack of understanding and communication between the old and

Young kids identify short hair with • authority, discipline. . . . Wherever
we go, our hair tells people where we stand on Vietnam, Wallace, campus disruption, dope. . . . Yesterday I was walking down the street.

The baby boom that followed World War II resulted in a huge student population in the 1960s. Through their numbers alone, the baby boomers became a force for social change. The music industry rushed to produce the music they liked; clothing designers copied the styles they introduced; universities were forced to change college courses and rules to accommodate them.
The Generation Gap The large population of baby boomers and their emerging influence emphasized the growing divide between the younger and older generations. In the 1960s and 1970s, many parents and their children had little in common apart from their genes. Parents of boomer children were heavily influenced by the two major events of their own childhoods, the Depression and World War II. Boomers’ parents had learned to live frugally through years of rationing during the Depression and war.
As teens, they had listened to big-band music. They generally valued loyalty and authority, and respected the military and veterans. Many also married at a young age, choosing to take on the responsibilties of a family. As a result, many in this so-called “silent generation,” sought stability by conforming.
Their baby-boomer children on the other hand rejected tradition and authority in favor of individuality. “Do your own thing!” became the catchphrase of the young. Boomers did not want to fit in; they wanted to stand out. With the economic difficulties of the 1930s and 40s a distant memory, boomers grew up in a time of prosperity for much of the nation. Many embraced political activism and opposed the Vietnam War. The boomer generation also expressed a distrust of tradition and authority, which was expressed in popular
magazines like MAD. Rock-and-roll music shaped their worldview and set them apart from their parents, who had grown up in a very different world.

a triumphant visit to the United States in 1964, more than 70 million Americans watched the English rock band perform on Ed Sullivan’s television show. The Beatles also had an impact on folk musicians like Bob Dylan, whose protest songs highlighted the civil rights and peace movements.
As radical poet and activist John Sinclair put it, rock became “a weapon of cultural revolution,” that urged listeners to reject conventions and, in many cases, the political policies of the government. Even after the counterculture had declined in significance, rock music remained popular among baby-boomers as well as their children.
The art and literature of the 1960s and 1970s also displayed a rebellious side. Andy Warhol’s realistic paintings of ordinary grocery items, such as Campbell’s soup cans, questioned traditional ideas of art and mocked the values of consumerism. In literature, the novels of Tom Wolfe and Hunter S. Thompson blurred the lines between reporting and political activism.
Experiments in Living and the Sexual Revolution
Members of the counterculture rejected many traditional restrictions on sexual behavior in what became known as the “sexual revolution.” They called for the enjoyment of sex for its own sake and often advocated new living

patterns. For example, many hippies lived together in communes, or small communities in which the people have common interests and share resources.
The sexual revolution was one of the strongest indicators of the generation gap. One poll showed that nearly two-thirds of all Americans over the age of 30 opposed premarital sex, whereas a majority of those under age 29 did not. Eventually, however, the sexual revolution led to a more open discussion of sex in the mainstream media.
Impact of the Hippie Culture in San Francisco In
1967, as many as 2,000 people flocked to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, a center of the counterculture. Hippies there experimented with drugs, wore unconventional clothing, and listened to rock music and speeches by political radicals such as Timothy Leary, a one-time Harvard researcher. He preached that drugs could free the mind, and he encouraged American youths to “tune in,” "turn on" to drugs, and “drop out” of mainstream society. The hippies of San Francisco attracted a great deal of media attention, much of it critical of the lifestyles they advocated. Life in Haight-Ashbury did lead to negative consequences. As in other enclaves of hippie culture, it experienced high rates of drug abuse that led to increased crime.
Seeking New Forms of Spirituality Some members of the counterculture sought spiritual enlightenment outside of the Judeo-Christian traditions in which they had been raised. Many explored Buddhism and other Eastern religions, while others sought spirituality by living in harmony with nature. Particularly in the late 1960s and early 1970s, some hippies established rural communes, seeking to live off the land as Native Americans had in the past. These beliefs had a lasting impact on the budding environmental movement.
Positive and Negative Effects of the Counterculture By the end of the 1960s, many people, even those within the counterculture, had become disillusioned with some of its excesses. The utopian urge to discover a more authentic way of living had an unfortunate underside. Drug addictions and deaths from overdoses rose. The hedonism and violence of rock-and-roll seemed to be having a negative effect, as a number of rock musicians, most famously Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, died of drug overdoses while only in their twenties. The downward spiral continued in 1969 with a tragedy at a music festival in Altamont, California.

to provide security, stabbed to death a black man who had approached the stage. The ugly violence contradicted the values of “peace and love” that many hippies embraced.
At the same time, the movement's values were becoming increasingly shallow and self-centered.

New Feminist Movement Pushes for Equality
Historians often refer to the women's movement of the 1960s and 1970s as the second wave of feminism, or the theory of political, social, and economic equality of men and women. The struggle for women’s rights in the United States has had a long history, going back at least to the 1840s, when women drafted the Declaration of Sentiments at Seneca Falls, New York.
The phrase second wave of feminism also reminds us that the first wave, which culminated with women winning the right to vote in 1920, ended well before the nation addressed the call for full equality In the decades that followed, women made little legal or social headway in the battle for equal rights. In fact, after World War II, most women gave up their jobs to returning servicemen and went back to their homes to take care of their families. During the 1950s, social analysts and popular culture portrayed women, especially suburban housewives, as the personification of America’s achievement of the good life. By the 1960s, attitudes like these had begun to change.

Seeking to Redefine Traditional Roles Several factors influenced the rebirth of the women’s movement in the 1960s and 1970s. The civil rights struggle prompted women to look at the ways in which society judged and discriminated against them as a group. As Casey Hayden and Mary King, two veterans of that movement, put it: “Sex and caste. There seem to be many parallels that can be drawn between the treatment of Negroes and the treatment of women in society as a whole.” Hayden and King used the phrase "Jane Crow” to emphasize a link between racial and gender discrimination.
The civil rights movement both inspired women to demand gender equality and taught them how to achieve it. It also brought black and white women together, strengthening their shared cause.
Women also wanted to redefine how they were viewed. Many women objected to the inaccuracy of the housewife stereotype. Some needed to work to support themselves or their families. Others wanted more opportunities than their lives as housewives could offer. Betty Friedan powerfully articulated this message in her groundbreaking book The Feminine Mystique.
The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction. .
. . Each suburban wife struggled with it alone.
As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night—she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question—‘Is this all?’
—Betty Friedan, The Feminine Mystique, 1963
Fighting Workplace Discrimination Despite the stereotypes, the number of women in the workforce grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Yet working women often found themselves in dead-end jobs. Regardless of the quality of their work, women found it difficult to advance or even retain their positions. Pregnancy, for example, was all too often seen as grounds for dismissal or demotion. In many cases, pregnant women were routinely denied leave or forced to take unpaid leave.
Even women with advanced training and education had their access to careers or advancement blocked, in many cases, by blatantly discriminatory employers. Sandra Day O’Connor, who ultimately became the first female Supreme Court Justice, graduated near the top of her class at Stanford Law School in the early 1950s.

Yet while she found few employment opportunities upon graduation, her male counterparts won job offers at prestigious law firms. Facing such restrictions, women increasingly demanded equal treatment in the workplace.
B IDENTIFY MAIN IDEAS
What was an essential goal of the feminist movement?
The Role of Women’s Civil Rights Organizations
Several years after she wrote The Feminine Mystique, Betty Friedan helped establish the National Organization for Women (NOW). The organization— which dedicated itself to winning “true equality for all women” and to attaining a “full and equal partnership of the sexes”—galvanized the women’s movement.
NOW
Works to Expand Rights Through Lobbying NOW was formed to compel the federal government to enforce the part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that outlawed sex discrimination in employment. The organization set out to break down barriers of discrimination in the workplace and in education. It attacked stereotypes of women in the media and called

for more balance in roles in marriages. Its major goal in the 1970s was to bring about passage of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), an amendment to the Constitution that would guarantee gender equality under the law. The ERA initially had been proposed in the early 1920s but had never passed. NOW also wanted to protect reproductive rights, especially the right to an abortion. NOW worked within the existing political system, lobbying for political reforms and readying court cases to compel the government to enforce existing legislation that banned discrimination. For some women, NOW seemed too extreme; for others, it was not extreme enough. Still, NOW served as a rallying point to promote equality for all women.
Feminists Raise Society’s Awareness Through Different Methods Finding NOW too tame, radical feminists sought a more fundamental restructuring of society. Rather than seeking legislative change, these protesters sought to show the way society trapped women into adopting restrictive roles. Like the civil rights campaigners, they adopted a variety of nonviolent methods. In addition to public protests of the Miss America Pageant, radical feminists engaged in small-scale consciousness-raising efforts. Other feminists sought to raise public awareness by making personal issues political. Charlotte Bunch, for example, wrote that “there is no private domain of a person’s life that is not political and there is no political issue that is not ultimately personal.”
Some feminists, like Gloria Steinem, tried to change awareness through the mass media. After graduating from college, Steinem worked as a freelance writer, including a stint of undercover work at a club run by Playboy magazine. While society tended to view Playboy bunnies in glamorous terms, Steinem revealed how much humiliation they had to endure to make a living. In 1972, she helped co-found Ms., a feminist magazine. Its title was meant to protest the social custom of identifying women by their marital status rather than as individuals.
Phyllis Schlafly and Conservatives Oppose the Women’s Movement Some Americans—both men and women—openly challenged the women’s movement. Phyllis Schlafly, for example, is a conservative political activist who denounced women’s liberation as "a total assault on the family, on marriage, and on children.” She worked hard to defeat the ERA, arguing that the act would compel women to fight in the military, end sex-segregated bathrooms, and hurt the family. Her argument resonated with many conservatives. Due to conservative opposition, the

The Impact of the
Women's Movement
The women’s movement affected all aspects of American society. Women’s roles and opportunities expanded. Women gained legal rights that had been denied them. And feminists sparked an important debate about equality that continues today. Yet the issues they raised continue to divide Americans. Some say that women haven’t made enough gains. Others fear that the movement has actually harmed society.
Achieving Equality of Political Rights Through Litigation Before the 1960s, there were no federal laws prohibiting gender discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, however, gave feminists a legal tool. It included a clause, called Title VII, that outlawed discrimination on the basis of sex. The clause was actually inserted by civil rights opponents, who thought it was so outlandish that it would make the entire bill look ridiculous.
When the bill actually passed, however, women used Title VII to challenge discrimination. The bill also set up the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce the federal prohibition on job discrimination.
Enforcing Title VII, even with the EEOC, was often difficult. Still, NOW and other feminist organizations tirelessly filed suits against employers who refused to hire women or to pay them fairly, compelling the federal government to act. President Kennedy established the Commission on the Status of Women in 1961 to examine workplace discrimination. Title IX of the Higher Education Act of 1972 banned discrimination in education. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, passed in 1974, made it illegal to deny credit to a woman just because of her gender.
Title IX applied to many facets of educational opportunities but had an especially profound impact on collegiate athletics. In effect, Title IX said that the ratio of women to men participating in collegiate athletics had to mirror the ratio of women to men enrolled in the school.
Participation by women in college athletics has increased dramatically since 1972. Since then, however, the number of women coaches has decreased significantly. As women’s sports gained in popularity and became revenue-generating sports, male coaches
» The battle for women’s rights took place in many venues. In 1973, tennis player Billie Jean King demonstrated women’s equality with men by defeating Bobby Riggs in The Battle of the Sexes.
» As a result of Title IX, women’s athletics increased dramatically in the 1980s. Many, like the Women’s USA Basketball Team, now dominate international competitions.
An Era of Change 591	10.2 The Women’s Rights Movement
were drawn to these higher-profile positions. In 1972, the number of women coaching collegiate women’s sports was over 90 percent. By 2010, that number was down to approximately 42 percent. This is one of the ways in which Title IX created unintended consequences that have been difficult to counteract.
Some feminists considered their most important legal victory to be the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, which assured women the right to legal abortions. Prior to Roe, most states outlawed or severely restricted abortion. Some women turned to illegal and often dangerous ways to end their pregnancies. The case and its decision were highly controversial at the time and still are today.
Expanding Economic and Employment Opportunities The women’s movement fostered a shift in attitudes among both men and women, and the American workplace today reflects this change. The percentage of women in the workforce has grown, from about 30 percent in 1950 to more than 60 percent in 2000. So, too, has the number of married female workers. Fields long closed or severely limited to women—such as medicine, law, and accounting—have opened up as well. The general shift in attitudes symbolized by these
changes has created a world of possibilities for many young women who never knew a time when women were not allowed to do these things.
Despite these gains, the average woman still earns less than the average man, partly because many women continue to work in fields that pay less. Some people have referred to this situation as a “pink-collar ghetto.” Whether this is because of discrimination, or because women who shoulder family responsibilities often have limited job choices, remains a matter of debate. Many studies suggest that a “glass ceiling” exists, limiting the advancement of even the most highly educated and skilled women workers.
Most troubling, the United States has witnessed a feminization of poverty over the past 30 years. This means that the majority of the nation’s poor people are single women. These are the women in the lowest-paying jobs, with the fewest benefits. Many of these poor women are single mothers, who must bear the costs and responsibilities of raising children alone while also working.

Latino Immigration Surges
After World War I, the United States passed legislation limiting European immigration. Yet during and after World War II, the country faced a growing demand for cheap labor. At the same time, the populations of Mexico and other Latin American nations grew steadily while job opportunities there declined. The combination of these factors created a steady stream of new immigrants to the United States. Some immigrants came legally, but others crossed the border illegally.
Latinos in the United States People whose family origins are in Spanish-speaking Latin America are called Latinos or Hispanics. They come from many different places, but they share the same language and some elements of culture. Spanish-speaking people lived in many parts of western North America before settlers from the United States arrived, and their numbers have grown steadily. Mexican Americans, known as Chicanos, have always made up the largest group of U.S. Latinos.

Impact of Legal and Illegal Immigration Beginning in 1942, Mexican immigrants came to the United States under the bracero, or farmhand, program. This program granted Mexican migrants temporary guest worker status, and over a period of 25 years, more than 4 million entered the United States. The braceros played a crucial role in sustaining American agriculture during and after World War II.
Along with Mexicans who had migrated to the United States illegally in search of work, braceros who had outstayed their permits were targeted for deportation in the 1950s. In 1965, however, the government passed the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments, eliminating national-origin quotas for immigrants. In the decades that followed, the number of legal Mexican and Asian immigrants surged. More than 400,000 Mexicans arrived during the 1960s, another 630,000 in the 1970s, and more than 1.5 million in the 1980s.
Latino Communities on the East Coast After World War II, large numbers of Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, and Cubans migrated to the United States. As citizens of a United States territory, Puerto Ricans came legally, leaving their homeland in search of better-paying jobs. In contrast, most Cuban and Dominican immigrants came to America as political refugees, fleeing their countries to escape the harsh rule of dictators. Most Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican immigrants
settled in urban areas, especially in New York City and Miami, Florida, which had notable effects on the demographic patterns in these cities.

Latino Organizations Fight for Rights
Like other minorities, Latinos had long faced discrimination. After World War II, Latino veterans began agitating for equal treatment. Veteran Hector P. Garcia, for example, formed the American G.I. Forum to battle discrimination. In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by the growing civil rights movement, Latinos increasingly fought for equal rights. They demanded better working conditions, salaries, and educational opportunities. Like African Americans, they sought federal protection of their right to vote and campaigned to elect politicians who represented their interests.

farm laborers, who were among the most exploited workers in the nation. Because they migrated from farm to farm—and often from state to state—to pick fruits and vegetables, they were known as migrant farmworkers. They labored for long hours in deplorable conditions, with no benefits.
Dolores Huerta was another activist who shared Cesar Chavez’s concerns about migrant farmworkers. Huerta worked as a leader of a community service organization in Stockton, California. During this time she founded the Agricultural Workers Association, which organized voter registration drives and worked to improve Hispanic neighborhoods. In 1962, Chavez and Huerta organized a farmworkers’ union in Delano, California. In the late 1960s, Chavez and Huerta merged the union with a separate union of Filipino farm laborers to form what became the United Farm Workers (UFW).
Committed to nonviolent tactics, the UFW implemented a workers’ strike and consumer boycott of table grapes. With the help of Huerta, Chavez’s top aide, the UFW urged people across the nation to boycott California grapes in order to win recognition from the growers. In 1975, California passed a law requiring collective bargaining between growers and

union representatives. Farmworkers finally had a legal basis to ask for better working conditions.
Actions Taken to Improve Economic, Educational, and Political Opportunities While Chavez focused on farmworkers’ rights, a broader Mexican American social and political effort grew, which came to be known as the Chicano movement. Part of it was dedicated to increasing Latinos’ awareness of their history and culture. The Chicano Mural Movement, in which Mexican-American culture was celebrated in large, outdoor paintings, sprang up at this time. At California colleges and high schools, and in other states with a Mexican American population, Chicano students demanded that educators teach more about their heritage. Others in the movement focused on quality-of-life issues. For example, the National Council of La Raza was founded in 1968 with the goal of reducing poverty and discrimination and providing better opportunities for Latinos.
Much of the movement’s energy was concentrated on attaining political strength for Latinos, or what some called “brown power.” In Texas, Jose Angel Gutierrez organized the political party La Raza Unida. The party worked for better housing and jobs, and it successfully supported Latino political candidates. By 1980, six Hispanics sat in Congress, representing districts from New York to California. Moreover, Hispanics gained greater representation in state, county, and city governments.

Native Americans and Asian Americans Battle Discrimination
Native Americans had a long history of discrimination and suffered high rates of poverty, unemployment, and suicide. Inspired by the struggle for civil rights, they forged their own protest movements in the 1960s and 1970s. At the same time, Asian Americans fought longstanding discrimination.
American Indian Civil Rights Organizations Emerge As with the civil rights movement, the movement demanding change for American Indians was led by young people. In 1961, the National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) formed, with the goal of preserving native fishing rights in the Northwest. Over time, the group expanded its aims to include broad civil rights for Native Americans.
An Era of Change : 596 ;	10.3 Expanding the Push for Equality
In 1968, the Chippewa activists Dennis Banks and George Mitchell helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM). At first, AIM focused on helping Indians living in urban ghettos. Before long, however, AIM was addressing all civil rights issues, particularly the securing of land, legal rights, and self-government for Native Americans.
Activism Leads to Confrontation As Indians dissatisfaction with the government grew, their activism became more militant. In late 1969, a group of American Indians occupied the island of Alcatraz, the site of a federal prison in San Francisco Bay that had closed in 1963. Members of the Sioux tribe asserted that the island belonged to them under a treaty provision granting them unused federal land. About 100 American Indians representing 50 tribes joined the occupation. In spite of efforts by the Coast Guard and other federal authorities to evict them, the Indians maintained control of the island until mid-1971.
The 1970s saw another series of confrontations. In 1972, led by Dennis Banks and Russell Means, AIM orchestrated a “long march” from San Francisco to Washington, D.C. Upon arriving in the capital, they took control of the Bureau of Indian Affairs building. They temporarily renamed it the Native American Embassy, suggesting Native Americans are treated as foreigners.
Tragedy Returns to Wounded Knee In 1970, Dee Brown published Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, which includes a chapter about the 1890 massacre of Sioux at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Brown noted that in all the history of the American West,
Only occasionally was the voice of an Indian heard, and then more often than not it was recorded by the pen of a white man. The Indian was the dark menace of the myths, and even if he had known how to write in English, where would he have found a printer or a publisher?
The best-selling book raised public consciousness about the historic mistreatment of Native Americans. Building on this momentum, AIM planned a dramatic confrontation at Wounded Knee.
In late February of 1973, AIM took over the village and refused to leave until the government agreed to investigate the condition of reservation Indians. Federal authorities put Wounded Knee under siege, and

two AIM members died in the resulting gunfire. The standoff ended in May when the government pledged to reexamine native treaty rights.
Fighting Discrimination Through Litigation
Several landmark cases in the 1940s paved the way for Native Americans to fight discrimination through litigation. In 1947, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision in Mendez v. Westminster, ruling that the segregation of Mexican American students in schools in California was unconstitutional. The 1948 decision in Delgado v. Bastrop I.S.D. ended segregation in the Texas public school system. The ruling stated that the segregation of children of Mexican descent in Texas was illegal.
Native American activism spurred the passage of several laws in the 1970s. The Indian Self-Determination Act of 1975, for instance, fulfilled one of the main demands of the American Indian movement by granting tribes greater control over resources and education on reservations. Native Americans also continued to win legal battles to regain land, mineral, and water rights. Yet the protests staged by AIM and other militant groups also provoked a political backlash, with some contending that the federal government gave special treatment to American Indians. While politicians
An Era of Change 597	10.3 Expanding the Push for Equality
debated how the government should treat Native Americans, the Indians themselves continued to suffer from disproportionately high rates of unemployment and other social ills.
Asian Americans Fight Discrimination Prejudice against people of Japanese and Chinese ancestry, who had come to the United States as laborers, had long been part of the American social and economic climate. The Japanese American Citizens League, founded in 1929 to protect Japanese Americans' civil rights, worked for decades to receive government compensation for property lost by Japanese Americans interned in camps during World War II.
In the 1960s and 1970s, in the wake of the expanding rights revolution, many other groups formed to combat discrimination and protect the rights of all Asian Americans. The Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments (1965) also aided Asian immigrants.

Activists Win Rights
for Consumers and the Disabled
In the same way that many activists worked to extend rights to women and minorities and to protect the environment, others worked to protect the rights of consumers and Americans with disabilities.
A
New Movement for Consumer Rights During the Progressive Era, reformers had pushed for measures to protect consumers, ranging from the Pure Food and Drug Act to the Meat Inspection Act. The consumer rights movement reemerged during the 1960s and 1970s. It was led by Ralph Nader, a lawyer who began to investigate whether flawed car designs led to increased traffic accidents and deaths. His book, Unsafe at Any Speed (1965), attacked automakers whose thirst for profits produced unsafe vehicles that endangered the public. Nader’s best-selling book stirred the nation and prompted Congress to pass the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act in 1966. Among other things, the act made safety belts standard equipment in all cars. Nader went on to form several consumer advocacy groups. Under his influence, consumer advocacy adopted many of the practices that shape it today, including research and government lobbying. Advocacy for workers began to gain more prominence as well. The Nixon administration proposed the idea

Historically the nation had treated people with disabilities as defective. FDR hid the fact that he could not walk because he did not want society to assume he was incapable of serving as President. Yet by the 1970s, Americans with disabilities were making great strides toward expanding their rights. Disabled veterans from the Korean and Vietnam wars took part in this activism. The Kennedy administration called for change by establishing the Panel on Mental Retardation in 1961 to explore ways for the government to help people with intellectual disabilities.
The next year, Eunice Shriver, President Kennedy’s sister, began an athletic camp for young people with disabilities that eventually became the Special Olympics. Over the next few years, the government passed a number of Congressional acts guaranteeing equal access to education for people with disabilities.

In 1962 a book called Silent Spring by biologist Rachel Carson pointed out that human actions were harming not only the environment but people themselves. Public awareness of environmental issues prompted an important debate about the government’s role in environmental regulations.

Environmental Activists Sound the Alarm
In the 1920s, Progressives had worked to conserve public lands and parks. But few worried much about the ill effects of industrialization. In 1952, however, a blanket of deadly smog, caused by coal fires, engulfed the city of London, killing some 12,000 people. Ten years after London’s Great Smog, a book sparked the modern environmental movement.
Silent Spring Launches a Movement Coal smog is just one kind of toxic waste, or poisonous byproduct of human activity. Another is acid rain, or moisture in the air caused by the mixing of water with chemicals produced by the burning of fossil fuels. Toxic wastes are also produced when nuclear power is generated. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, scientists learned more about toxic wastes and other environmental threats.
Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring described the deadly impact that pesticides were having on birds and other animals. Her book caused a sensation. Though the chemical industry fought back, the public was convinced by her argument. Carson did more than point

to the dangers of chemicals and toxic waste. She also insisted that human activity drastically altered the environment and that humans had a responsibility to protect it. Her work eventually compelled Congress to restrict the use of the pesticide DDT. It also spurred widespread environmental activism among Americans.
When a fire erupted on the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1969, activists instantly spoke out. The fire occurred when a spark ignited floating oil and debris—byproducts of industrialization—on the river’s surface. Time magazine reported that the river "oozes, rather than flows.” Even more luridly, the magazine remarked that in the Cuyahoga, a person “does not drown but decays.”
A
Grassroots Movement Creates Earth Day Events like the Cuyahoga River fire seemed to confirm the dire predictions of Silent Spring. One response to growing environmental concerns was a nationwide protest called Earth Day. Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson, who played the leading role in organizing the protest, wanted "to shake up the political establishment and force this issue [the environment] onto the national agenda.” On April 22,1970, close to 20 million Americans took part in Earth Day events across the nation. The yearly event attracted the support of many of the same people who had advocated civil and women’s rights.
It was also backed by a number of grassroots groups, including the Sierra Club, founded by John Muir in 1892, and the Wilderness Society, established in 1935. Historically, these groups had focused on conservation. With the rise of the environmental movement, however, they called for broader environmental protections.
Nixon Creates Government Entities to Manage the Environment In 1969, President Nixon declared that the 1970s “must be the years when America pays its debts to the past by reclaiming the purity of its air, its water and our living environment.” Nixon had not come into office as an environmental activist. But the public’s increasing concern with protecting the environment convinced him to support environmental reforms.
Under Nixon’s leadership, Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in
1970. This federal agency’s mission was to protect the "entire ecological chain.” In addition to cleaning up and protecting the environment, the EPA sought to limit or to eliminate pollutants that posed a risk to the public’s health, such as toxic substances that cause cancer. Nixon also signed a number of environmental laws.

President Gerald Ford continued in Nixon’s footsteps. In 1974, he created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to make sure nuclear materials would be handled safely without harmful impacts on people or the environment.

Impact of Environmental Regulations
As the 1970s drew to a close, a series of environmental crises made the headlines. They reinforced the public’s concern about the environment and produced calls for even more far-reaching actions. Yet, at the same time, a number of people began to wonder if the government had enacted too many regulations and was threatening property rights. Rather than calling for more federal actions, they tried to limit the government's role in environmental protection.
The EPA Investigates Love Canal In 1978, a resident of Love Canal, a community near Niagara Falls in upstate New York, hung a sign from his home that read: “Give me Liberty. I’ve Already Got Death.”
This sign referred to the fact that residents of the community had exceptionally high rates of birth defects and cancer. Newspaper reporters and EPA investigators determined that these illnesses were caused by thousands of tons of toxic chemicals, which industries had been dumping in the ground for decades. One EPA administrator recalled the scene he witnessed following a heavy rain that sent toxic chemicals percolating up through the ground.

The Love Canal contamination, along with other events involving hazardous waste, prompted Congress to establish Superfund in 1980.
Meltdown at Three Mile Island Alters Public Opinion Shortly after the investigation at Love Canal, an accident occurred in the nuclear energy industry. On March 28, 1979, the core of the nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, began to melt after the reactor malfunctioned. When the plant threatened to release radioactive gas, the governor declared a state of emergency and shut it down. To reassure the public that plant managers had contained the accident, President Jimmy Carter and his wife traveled to Three Mile Island and toured the reactor.
Even though the incident was contained and there proved to be no health risks, it had profound effects on America’s energy policy. In the wake of the accident, public opinion shifted against nuclear energy, as Americans became fearful of possible disasters. The government temporarily stopped building new nuclear power plants. Even though it later lifted the ban, no new American nuclear plants were ordered for more than a quarter of a century. In the 2000s, with the nation threatened by energy shortages, many Americans began to call for building new nuclear plants.
Governmental Actions Challenge Fifth Amendment Rights As more environmental regulations were passed, opposition to them grew. Based on an understanding of the Fifth Amendment, which holds that citizens shall not be deprived of property without due process of law, many complained that environmental regulations stripped individuals, the businesses they owned, and the communities they lived in of their property rights by restricting what they could or could not do with their land. Some argued that private property owners would do a better job of protecting the environment than the government because the owners had an interest in preserving the profitability of their land. Many people—and especially industry leaders—also worried that too much environmental regulation would hamper business and jobs by diverting funds to cleaning up the air and water. Therefore, as the 1970s came to a close—and, indeed, to this day—Americans remained divided about what

Nixon’s New Approach to Foreign Policy
Nixon’s Cold War Foreign Policy During his years in office, Richard Nixon fundamentally reshaped the way the United States approached the world. Before Nixon took office, most American leaders shared a common Cold War ideology.
They stressed that a basic conflict existed between democratic, capitalist countries and totalitarian, communist ones. They divided the world into “us” and “them,” and they established policies based on an assumption commonly held that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” Therefore, a country opposed to communism was, by this definition, a friend of the United States. In a number of ways, Nixon and Henry Kissinger, his leading advisor on national security and international affairs, altered this Cold War policy approach.
At first glance, Richard Nixon's partnership with Henry Kissinger seemed improbable. Nixon was a conservative California Republican, suspicious of the more liberal East Coast Republicans and exhausted with the political and strategic theories of Ivy League intellectuals. Kissinger was a Harvard-educated Jewish emigre from Germany and

a prominent figure in East Coast intellectual circles. In several prior presidential campaigns, Kissinger had actually worked against Nixon. However, both men were outsiders, equipped with an outsider’s readiness to question accepted orthodoxy.
Kissinger and Realpolitik In foreign affairs, Nixon and Kissinger embraced the idea of realpolitik, a German word meaning “real politics.” According to realpolitik, political goals should be defined by concrete national interests instead of abstract ideologies. The two statesmen argued that if Americans would put aside their Cold War biases and look at the world with fresh eyes, U.S. global interests could be surveyed not in black and white but in shades of gray. For example, China and the Soviet Union—America’s ideological enemies—had the potential to become excellent trading partners. At the same time, West Germany and Japan—America’s ideological friends—were fast developing into economic rivals.
Nixon and Kissinger also questioned some lingering Cold War assumptions. For instance, they concluded that there was no united worldwide communist movement, as Lyndon Johnson and other Presidents had believed. There were important differences between the unique ideologies of the Soviet Union and China and other communist countries, such as Yugoslavia, North Korea, and North Vietnam, which often behaved quite independently. As President, Nixon insisted on a flexible, pragmatic foreign policy that avoided ideological absolutes.

Opening Relations With China
From his first days in office, Nixon seemed determined to leave his mark on the nation’s international affairs. Lyndon Johnson focused primarily on domestic affairs—the nuts and bolts of legislation and political deal-making. Nixon was more a man of the world, fascinated by global politics and shifting alliances. Johnson believed his Great Society would solidify his reputation as a great President. In stark contrast, Nixon thought his reorientation of American foreign policy would cement his legacy in the annals of U.S. history.

10.5 The Two Sides of the Nixon Presidency
People’s Republic of China was the most populous country in the world, but it was not officially recognized by the United States. Nor had it been admitted to the United Nations. The China that the United States recognized as the official representative body of the Chinese people was the Nationalist Chinese government exiled on the island of Taiwan. Nixon built his impressive career as a hard-line “Cold Warrior,” a vigilant opponent of communism. He was the last politician Americans could imagine to extend the olive branch of recognition—and thus peace—to the communists.
Ever the political realist, however, Nixon knew that the People’s Republic of China could not be ignored forever. He recognized that establishing diplomatic relations with the Chinese communists would benefit the United States. From an economic standpoint, improved relations would bring significant trade agreements, especially benefiting California and the Pacific Coast. Politically, U.S. normalization would drive a wedge between China and the Soviet Union, who had strayed from their traditional alliance and become rivals for territory and diplomatic influence. Finally, if the United States forged stronger relations with the Chinese, they might pressure North Vietnam to accept a negotiated peace to end the conflict still raging at the time.
Normalizing U.S.-China Relations With so much to gain and so little to lose, Nixon quietly pushed ahead
with his plans. In public, the Chinese made symbolic overtures toward a meeting. In April 1971, China invited an American table-tennis team to play against its athletes. This small action demonstrated China’s willingness to talk. Henry Kissinger worked behind the scenes, talking with Chinese leaders and ironing out sensitive issues with Premier Zhou Enlai. Then, in July 1971, Nixon announced that he would make an official state visit to China.
In February 1972, the President made the trip and toured the Great Wall, the Imperial Palace, and other historic sites. Nixon sat down for lengthy talks with Zhou Enlai and Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong. He even learned enough Chinese to make a toast in the language of his host country. The visit was a great success and an important step toward normalizing diplomatic relations with China.
The following year, American tourists started visiting and American companies set up a thriving trade with China. Nixon’s China trip was the high point of his presidency. It bridged, as Zhou Enlai said, “the vastest ocean in the world, twenty-five years of no communication.” In 1979, the United States and China established full diplomatic relations.

Nixon’s Policy of Detente
Nixon’s trip to the People’s Republic of China prompted an immediate reaction from the Soviet Union, which had strained relations with both countries. Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev feared that improved U.S.-Chinese relations would isolate Russia. Therefore, he invited Nixon to visit Moscow. Nixon made the trip in May 1972. Afterward, the President reported to Congress that he and Brezhnev had reached agreements in a wide variety of areas:
Recognizing the responsibility of the advanced industrial nations to set an example in combating mankind’s common enemies, the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to cooperate in efforts to reduce pollution and enhance environmental quality.
We have agreed to work together in the . . . conquest of cancer and heart disease.
—Richard Nixon, speech to Congress, June 1, 1972
Nixon also announced plans to conduct a joint U.S.-Soviet space mission. However, by far the high point of the summit was the signing of the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. Otherwise known as SALT I, the treaty froze the deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and placed limits on antiballistic missiles (ABMs), but it did not alter the stockpiling of the more dangerous multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs). SALT I did not end the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. But it was a giant step in the right direction.
The importance of SALT I stemmed first and foremost from U.S. and Soviet efforts to reduce tensions
between them. A policy aimed at easing Cold War tensions, detente, had replaced previous diplomatic efforts based on suspicion and distrust. With his visits to China and the Soviet Union coming within six months of each other, Richard Nixon dramatically altered America’s global strategy. He relaxed the nation’s inflexible stance toward communism and applied a more pragmatic approach to foreign policy. In the short term, the new relationships he forged helped the United States to end the Vietnam War. In the long term, Nixon’s foreign-policy breakthroughs moved the world a step closer to the end of the Cold War.
U EXPLAIN
How did SALT I support Nixon’s new policy for dealing with the Soviet Union?
Nixon’s Domestic Policy
Having eased tensions with the nation’s two great Cold War adversaries, Richard Nixon stood at the summit of his long government career when he was reelected President in a landslide in November 1972. Yet, less than two years later, Nixon left office in disgrace—the first time a President of the United States had resigned. The Watergate scandal gripped the nation and shaped the values and attitudes toward government that many Americans hold today.
Nixon’s Long Political Career Richard Nixon’s political career had more ups and downs than a roller coaster ride. Brought up in hard times, he worked his way through college and law school. After service in the navy during World War II, Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and then to the Senate in 1950. As Dwight Eisenhower’s running mate in 1952, he became Vice President with Eisenhower’s victory. Nixon was not yet 40 years old.

» A 1972 re-election campaign poster of President Nixon suggests that the country urgently needs his leadership.
» Richard Nixon displays his signature victory signal to supporters during a 1968 rally. After he took office, he proposed to establish “new federalism,” that would restructure American government.
Then came the defeats. In 1960, Nixon narrowly lost to John F. Kennedy in the race for the White House. Two years later, Nixon’s career hit bottom when he lost an election to become governor of California. In 1968, however, Nixon made a dramatic comeback. Calling himself “the new Nixon,” he narrowly defeated Democrat Hubert Humphrey to win the presidency.
Nixon’s “New Federalism” During the campaign for President, Nixon cast himself as the spokesperson for those he called Middle Americans, or the silent majority. As Nixon put it at the 1968 Republican convention, he sought to speak for the “non-shouters, the non-demonstrators,” the men and women who “work in America’s factories . . . run America’s businesses . . . serve in the Government . . . provide most of the soldiers . . . [and] give life to the American dream.”
Winning the support of Middle America proved a tricky task. Nixon believed that Americans had tired of the “big” government of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. However, he also believed that the American people still wanted the government to address various social ills, ranging from crime to pollution.
Nixon’s solution was to call for the establishment of a “new federalism.” As he explained in his 1971 State of the Union address, the nation needed “to reverse the flow of power and resources from the States and communities to Washington and start power and resources flowing back from Washington to the States and communities.” Nixon proposed revenue sharing with the states. Under revenue sharing, the federal government gave the states the money to fund social programs. The states then controlled the operations of these programs.
Increasing the Size and Role of Government
However, while returning power and money to the states, Nixon also sponsored many programs that increased the size and role of the federal government. During his presidency, a number of powerful new federal agencies and laws came into existence. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSH A) regulates workplaces to make them safer for workers. The DEA, or Drug Enforcement Administration, administers the federal war against illegal drugs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforces federal environmental standards. The Clean Air Act, signed into law in 1970, gives the EPA the power to set air quality standards.
Nixon’s welfare policies also reflected his complicated domestic strategy. To decrease the power of the federal government, Nixon began to dismantle the Office of Economic Opportunity, the cornerstone of Lyndon Johnson’s “war on poverty.” Yet, Nixon also

In 2012, the MBDA helped create and maintain 16,730 jobs.
Environmental Protection Agency (1970)
The EPA establishes federal standards to protect the environment. Today, the EPA continues working toward reducing water and air pollution and promoting human health. In 2009, the EPA made the first official finding regarding greenhouse gases and their detrimental effects on human health and the environment.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (1971)
OSHA's goal is to protect citizens from death, illness, and injury sustained on the job. Between 1970 and 2013, employment in the United States has doubled; meanwhile, workplace fatalities have fallen more than 65 percent and on-the-job injuries and illnesses have been reduced by 67 percent.
Drug Enforcement Administration (1973)
The DEA provides a unified front against the global war on drugs. At its inception, the DEA had a budget of $75 million with 1,470 special agents. Today, these figures have risen to $2.02 billion and 5,000 special agents.

proposed creating a Family Assistance Plan (FAP), which called for providing a guaranteed or minimum income to every American family. Although the FAP did not become law, federal spending on other social programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and public housing, grew steadily.
A 1970 reform added yearly cost-of-living increases to the checks of Social Security recipients. In 1972, Nixon signed legislation that increased the Social Security benefits of widows and widowers of retirees. He also signed the largest expansion of Medicare in the program’s history. The legislation extended Medicare coverage to nearly 2 million Americans under age 65 who were receiving Social Security disability payments. The costs of these programs continues to rise, prompting many to voice their concerns about the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare.
The Struggling Economy As his presidency progressed, Nixon grappled with an increasingly troublesome economy. After decades of strong growth and low inflation, the U.S. economy experienced both recession and inflation at the same time. These symptoms began during the Johnson administration, but they grew stronger during the Nixon years, thanks partly to Vietnam War defense spending under both administrations. The combination of recession and inflation baffled economists and led them to coin a new
term, stagflation, to describe the dual conditions of a stagnating economy and inflationary pressures.
Stagflation had several causes. Expanding federal budget deficits caused by spending for the Vietnam War produced inflation. Another cause was rising foreign competition, which cost thousands of Americans their jobs. Heavy industries such as steel and auto production, which had enjoyed a dominant position since World War II, proved especially vulnerable to foreign competition. Yet the factor that caused most Americans pain was the rapid increase in the price of oil.
In 1973, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a multinational organization that sells oil to other nations and cooperates to regulate the price and supply of oil, raised oil prices by 70 percent. Then, in October, in response to the United States’ support of Israel during the 1973 Arab war against Israel, OPEC’s Arab members, who had formed OAPEC (Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries), placed an embargo on Israel’s allies, including the United States. Dependent on imports for nearly one third of their energy, Americans soon felt the sting of this embargo as oil prices skyrocketed 400 percent in a single year. The embargo lasted until the spring of 1974 and resulted in gas lines at the pumps that stretched for blocks. With the end of the embargo, gas prices remained high.
An Era of Change 609	10.5 The Two Sides of the Nixon Presidency
Nixon fought stagflation in a variety of ways. In August 1971, he ended the Bretton Woods system of monetary management, in which other countries’ currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar, which in turn was pegged to a set amount of gold. Because this system was increasingly difficult to maintain and was unbalancing the U.S. economy, Nixon ended the convertibility between dollars and gold, meaning that dollars were no longer tied to gold prices. To fight stagflation, Nixon also placed a 90-day freeze on all wages and prices. The controls worked for a short time, causing a spurt of economic growth. However, price controls do not work well in a free economy, and the economy went into a tailspin in the mid-1970s.

Nixon’s “Southern
Strategy”
Having narrowly won the presidency in 1968, Richard Nixon set out to expand his base of support. He targeted blue-collar workers and southern whites, both of whom had traditionally voted for Democrats. Even before the election, he nominated Spiro Agnew, a relatively unknown Governor from Maryland, to serve as his
running mate, in order to attract southern voters. By winning the support of southern whites, Nixon hoped to make the Republican Party a powerful force in the South. Commentators called this Nixon’s southern strategy.
As part of his southern strategy, Nixon tried to place a number of conservative southerners as judges in federal courts. Most prominently, he nominated Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Both men failed to win Senate confirmation, in part because both had supported segregation in the past.
The School Busing Controversy Criticizing court-ordered busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood was another way Nixon reached out to southern whites and urban blue-collar workers. For years, many school districts in both the South and the North had resisted desegregation. In 1971, federal courts ordered school districts to bus students to achieve greater racial balance. Recognizing the unpopularity of busing, Nixon made a nationally televised address in which he called for a moratorium, or freeze, on court-ordered busing. By speaking forcefully, Nixon won the support of many busing opponents.

mixed. In 1969, the Nixon administration initiated the Philadelphia Plan, a program that required labor unions and federal contractors to submit goals and timetables for the hiring of minorities. It was a type of affirmative action, a policy that gives special consideration to women and minorities in the fields of education and employment, in order to make up for past discrimination.
Nixon’s Assistant Secretary of Labor, Arthur Fletcher, who designed the Philadelphia Plan, argued:
The Federal Government has an obligation to see that every citizen has an equal chance at the most basic freedom of all—the right to succeed. . .
. Segregation didn’t occur naturally—it was imposed. . . . The gap . . . between black and white . . . was growing wider and wider. . . . Visible, measurable goals to correct [these] imbalances are essential.
—Arthur Fletcher, Assistant Secretary of Labor, speech on affirmative action, 1969
Nixon’s Strategy Succeeds By the 1972 election, Nixon enjoyed high approval ratings. Some of this popularity was based on his trips to the Soviet Union and China. Some was based on his domestic policies.
Nixon ran a masterful political campaign in 1972, positioning himself as a moderate. He portrayed his opponents—George McGovern, an antiwar senator from South Dakota, and Alabama governor George Wallace—as extremists.
(Wallace’s campaign was cut short when he was shot and left paralyzed by a would-be assassin.) Nixon and his Vice President, Spiro Agnew, successfully cast themselves as spokespersons for the silent majority. On election day, Nixon won almost 61 percent of the popular vote and nearly all of the electoral votes. He became the first Republican presidential candidate to sweep the entire South.

secrecy from the Watergate scandal. The two reporters followed tips provided by a secret government informant known as “Deep Throat," who was later revealed to be a top official of the FBI. Woodward and Bernstein reported that the men who had attempted to burglarize the Watergate hotel had close ties to Nixon’s reelection committee.
Nixon repeatedly proclaimed his innocence. For example, in November 1973, long after evidence had implicated his top aides and forced them to resign, Nixon declared, “I am not a crook.” Yet the polls indicated that the public disagreed. One poll, taken the next month, showed that fewer than one in five Americans believed that he was being honest about the Watergate affair.
The Watergate scandal created a crisis in the relationship among the three branches of government. How far would Congress go to investigate the President? Would the courts demand that the President turn over information that might implicate him? And if the courts sided with Congress, would the President comply with its decisions?
The Limits of Executive Privilege The Watergate scandal came to a climax with a dizzying array of developments. In the fall of 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in the face of an unrelated corruption scandal. According to the procedures established by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which deals with presidential succession, Nixon nominated Gerald Ford to become his new Vice President.
Nixon’s troubles multiplied when, in the summer of 1973, it was revealed that he had been secretly taping Oval Office conversations for many years. Many commentators speculated that these tapes would show that the President had played a leading role in trying to cover up the break-in.
Nixon refused to turn over these tapes to the special prosecutor investigating the scandal. The President justified withholding the tapes by claiming executive privilege. Executive privilege is the principle that the President has the right to keep certain information confidential. It took almost a year for the courts to sort out the matter. On July 24, 1974, in the case of United States v. Nixon, the Supreme Court disagreed that the tapes fell under the principle of executive privilege and ordered Nixon to turn them over. Chief Justice Warren Burger made it clear that the Court rejected Nixon’s claim of executive privilege in this instance:
The expectation of a President to the confidentiality of his conversations and correspondence . . . has all the

values to which we accord deference for the privacy of all citizens. . . . But this presumptive privilege must be considered in light of our historic commitment to the rule of law [the principle that all citizens are bound by the same laws]. . . .
The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts, within the framework of the rules of evidence.
—U.S. Supreme Court, United States v. Nixon, 1974
Nixon Resigns When investigators listened to the tapes, they found that crucial parts of the conversations were missing. Nixon claimed his secretary had mistakenly erased them. Still, the tapes provided enough evidence of Nixon’s involvement in the coverup to lead the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives to vote to impeach the President. The committee charged Nixon with obstructing justice in the coverup of the Watergate break-in, misuse of power, and refusing to comply with House subpoenas. A number of Republican committee members joined the Democrats in voting for impeachment.
Recognizing that the full House of Representatives would vote in favor of impeachment and that many Republicans would vote to convict him in a trial in the Senate, Nixon decided to resign. In a speech to the American public on August 8, 1974, Nixon informed the nation that he would step down the following day in the hope that he “will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in America.” The long ordeal of Watergate had finally come to an end. With it, Nixon became the first and only President to resign the presidency.
Historians disagree about whether Nixon knew beforehand of the decision to burglarize Democratic Party headquarters. Few doubt, however that he took part in the coverup. Testimony by his top aides, the Watergate tapes, and evidence gathered in the prosecution of the burglars all show that Nixon sought to quash the investigation.
Moreover, investigations revealed that Nixon had committed other abuses of presidential power. His reelection team had engaged in dirty tricks to secure his election. He had developed an “enemies list

and used federal agencies to go after his enemies. The President had ordered the FBI to place wiretaps on the telephones of those government employees and reporters he suspected of leaking information unfavorable to the administration.
Watergate’s Lasting Impact In pursuit of personal power, Richard Nixon damaged the reputation of the presidency and shook the public’s confidence in government. One conservative commentator, formerly a supporter of Nixon, echoed the disillusionment of many Americans:
The lies, the lies, the lies! . . . What a pity, what a pity! Here was a President who got us out of Vietnam, ended the draft . . . and by his bold overtures to Red China opened new avenues toward world peace. Now the good vanishes in the wreckage of the bad. The swearing-in of Gerald Ford can’t come one hour too soon.

Polls revealed that from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, the percentage of Americans who believed in the truth of government statements plummeted from 80 percent to 33 percent.
In the wake of Watergate, Congress enacted numerous reforms to try to restore the public’s confidence in government and to prevent abuses of power in the future. It established a procedure for naming an independent counsel to investigate charges against the White House. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 sought to limit the amount of money that individuals could give candidates, in order to prevent the corruption of the political process.
Yet, the Watergate affair also demonstrated that the nation could weather such a crisis. It showed the strength of the system of checks and balances. Both Congress and the Supreme Court had successfully checked the power of the President. According to Time magazine, Nixon’s resignation represented an "extraordinary triumph of the American system.” Watergate demonstrated that no person, not even
a President, is above the law. As Gerald Ford said when he became President: "Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men.”

These changes contributed to a growing sense among Americans that something had gone wrong, that the nation had gotten off the right track. This sense of disquiet is even now a part of the nation’s political dialogue.

Ford Governs Through Difficult Times
Gerald Ford had been Nixon’s Vice President and became President when Nixon resigned. Although only recently appointed as Vice President following the resignation of Nixon’s two-term Vice President, Spiro Agnew, Ford brought a long record of public service to the presidency. A star football player at the University of Michigan, Ford enlisted in the United States Navy and fought in World War II. Following the war, Ford successfully ran for a seat in the U.S.
Congress, where he served for 25 years, rising to the position of House Minority Leader in 1965. Democrats as well as Republicans supported Ford’s nomination for Vice President because he had a stellar reputation for hard work, integrity, and dependability.
Ford stepped into a delicate situation when he became President after Richard Nixon’s resignation. Watergate had scarred the public's faith in government. Furthermore, the nation struggled with the most severe economic problems it had faced since the Depression. Ford wrestled with these problems but not very successfully. He left office with the economy still suffering and the public’s distrust of government still high.

» President Ford’s “WIN,” or Whip Inflation Now, strategy called for a combination of personal saving and discipline coupled with government action to stabilize the economy.
Pardoning Nixon Ford moved quickly to try to restore confidence in government. He selected Nelson Rockefeller, a former governor of New York State, to serve as his Vice President. He also promised to continue the foreign policy approaches of the Nixon administration.
Whatever support he gained from these steps was lost when Ford announced that he had pardoned, or officially forgiven, Richard Nixon for any crimes he may have committed as President. Though the pardon was meant to heal the nation’s wounds, in some ways it achieved just the opposite. Ford's critics accused him of having made a secret deal, promising Nixon the pardon in exchange for the vice presidential nomination. Though Ford strongly denied this, his popularity declined dramatically.
The congressional election results of 1974 indicated the public’s disapproval of the pardon and the impact of Watergate in general. The Republicans lost 48 seats in the House of Representatives, including Ford’s longtime district in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Stagflation Continues President Ford might have overcome this backlash if not for the troubled economy. The stagflation that plagued the nation during Nixon's presidency continued under Ford. Inflation hit double digits in 1974 and early 1975. To fight skyrocketing prices, Ford promoted a mostly voluntary plan known as WIN, or Whip Inflation Now. Unfortunately, WIN was a clear failure. Instead of improving, the economy took a turn for the worse. Factories closed down, consumer demand for goods dropped sharply, and the rate of unemployment rose steadily. Ford’s popularity plummeted.

Ford Continues Nixon’s Foreign Policies
The ordeal of the Vietnam War led many to question the direction of American foreign policy. They asked: Why was the United States so concerned with fighting communism that it ended up supporting oppressive anticommunist governments? Should the United States continue to pursue detente with the Soviets? Or should it instead demand that the Soviet government grant its people more freedoms? Although the Soviet Union no longer exists, similar debates over the relationship between foreign policy and human rights continue to be heard today.
An Era of Change 616	10.6 Ford and Carter Struggle
Relations with the Soviet Union remained central to U.S. foreign policy during the Ford administration. Upon assuming the presidency, Gerald Ford made clear that his foreign policy would differ little from that of Richard Nixon’s. He retained Henry Kissinger as his Secretary of State and continued to pursue detente with the Soviet Union and China.
Continuing to Pursue Detente Ford and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev met in late 1974 and again the next year, when the two leaders endorsed the Helsinki Accords. This document put the nations of Europe on record in favor of human rights, or the basic rights that every human being is entitled to have. Some thought that President Ford would try to compel the Soviet Union to allow more political freedoms, but Ford decided to put arms control ahead of human rights. At his direction, the United States continued disarmament talks with the Soviets. These talks eventually led to an agreement known as SALT II, in which the two nations pledged to limit nuclear arms production. However, the U.S. Senate never ratified the treaty.
Trouble in Southeast Asia Under Ford, the United States sought to put the turmoil of the Vietnam War behind it. When the communist Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia began a genocidal slaughter of civilians, killing about 1.5 million people between 1975 and 1979, the United States did not intervene.
The main exception to this policy of noninvolvement came in May 1975, when the Khmer Rouge seized an American merchant ship, the Mayaguez, which had been steaming just outside Cambodian waters. Ford responded by sending in some United States Marines, who freed the ship.
South Vietnam fell to North Vietnam during Ford’s presidency. As the communists took over, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, many of whom had worked with the United States, tried to escape. Many refugees took to the seas in rickety, unseaworthy boats. These boat people represented the largest mass migration of humanity by sea in modern history. Over a 20-year period, more than one million men, women, and children braved storms, pirates, and starvation in search of refuge abroad. Their immediate destinations were in other nations of Southeast Asia, but many eventually found refuge in the United States and Canada.

A
New President Faces Challenges Prior to the mid-1970s, few Americans outside Georgia had ever heard of Jimmy Carter, a one-time governor of that state. But on election day 1976, Americans elected Carter President of the United States. He won a slim popular majority, receiving slightly more than 50 percent of the vote to Ford’s 48 percent. In the electoral college, Carter won 297 votes compared to 240 for Ford.
Carter’s rise was the result of several factors. Most important was the turmoil of the 1960s and Watergate, which created a backlash against professional politicians. Carter seized this opportunity by casting himself as a fresh face, a “Washington outsider” with no ties to Washington, D.C. A born-again Christian who taught Sunday school, Carter won the support of many Christian fundamentalists, people who believe in a strict, literal interpretation of the Bible as the foundation of the Christian faith. This group became increasingly involved in politics in the 1970s.
The Cost of Inexperience From the beginning of his presidency, Jimmy Carter sought to portray himself as a “citizens’ President.” He became the first President since William Henry Harrison to walk all the way from

the Capitol to the White House during the inaugural parade. He held town meetings, wore casual clothes, and carried his own suitcase.
However, Carter’s inexperience, which helped him get elected, hurt him during the early days of his presidency. As an outsider, he did not have close ties with the Democratic leadership in Congress. He also surrounded himself with aides whose experience in Washington was limited. Carter submitted numerous bills to Congress, but few of them passed without major changes by his own party.
Just one day after his inauguration, Carter fulfilled one of his campaign pledges by granting amnesty, or political pardons, to Americans who had evaded the draft during the Vietnam War. Carter hoped this act would help the nation move beyond the divisions caused by that war.
Yet the war remained an emotional issue, and many Americans criticized the President for forgiving those who had refused to fight. Republican senator Barry Goldwater called the amnesty “the most disgraceful thing that a President has ever done.”
Economic Problems Sap Confidence Like Ford, Carter contended with the energy crisis and severe inflation. Inflation ate away at people’s savings, raised the prices of necessities, and made American goods more costly abroad. The U.S. automobile industry, long a symbol of the nation’s economic power, became a symbol of its ills. Japanese car companies vastly expanded their sales in the United States by selling better-built and more fuel-efficient cars at reasonable prices. The situation grew so bad that Chrysler, one of the three major American automobile companies, needed a federal loan to survive.
At the center of the nation’s economic ills lay the ongoing energy crisis. In 1973, a gallon of gas cost about 40 cents. By the end of the decade, it cost close to $1.20. To make matters worse, the winter of 1976-1977 was an especially bitter one in parts of the United States, increasing the need for heating oil.
Fuel shortages caused factory closings and business losses. The 1979 Oil Crisis caused another spike in gas prices and inflation.
Carter responded to the oil crisis by calling on Americans to conserve and by asking Congress to raise taxes on crude oil, which he hoped would encourage conservation. However, the bill that finally passed in the Senate had few of the President’s ideas in it. Critics saw this as one more example of Carter’s poor leadership skills.
Carter did implement several domestic policies that his successors would build on during the 1980s. To fight inflation, Carter nominated Paul Volcker to head

the Federal Reserve Board. Under Volcker’s lead, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. In the long term, this policy helped to bring an end to the inflation that had plagued the nation for so long.
The Community Reinvestment Act which Congress passed and Carter signed into law in 1977, also helped address the nation’s economic woes.
In order to create economic opportunity for citizens, this law required banks to make loans in the same neighborhoods where they took deposits. This requirement enabled many low- to moderate-income Americans, especially ethnic minorities, to become homeowners for the first time. The law remains in effect today. Whether it has had unintended consequences, possibly contributing to the mortgage crisis that triggered the Great Recession of 2007 to 2011 is an issue hotly debated in the business community.
E2 LIST
What challenges did President Carter face? Foreign Policy Changes Under Carter
Early in his presidency, Jimmy Carter proclaimed that as much as possible, American foreign policy would be guided by a concern for human rights. Carter hoped to make his foreign policy into a tool to end acts of political repression such as torture, murder, and imprisonment without trial. This policy direction helped reaffirm the position of the United States as a nation of freedom and justice. However, it undercut the goal of better relations with the Soviet Union.
Soviet-American Relations Cool At first, Carter continued Nixon’s and Ford’s policies toward the Soviet Union. He worked to achieve detente. He continued efforts at arms control, meeting with Leonid Brezhnev in June 1979 and signing the SALT II treaty.
However, relations between the two superpowers soon took a decidedly frosty turn. The SALT II treaty was bitterly debated in the United States Senate, where its opponents argued that it put the national security of the United States in jeopardy. Then, in December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded the neighboring country of Afghanistan to prop up a tottering communist government. Carter responded by withdrawing the SALT II treaty from Senate consideration and by imposing sanctions, or penalties, on the Soviets. The sanctions included a U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympic Games held in Moscow as well as a suspension of grain sales to the Soviet Union.
Attempts to Protect Human Rights Since the end of World War II, American Presidents had tended to see the developing world—the less developed nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America—as another stage for the Cold War. Carter broke with that approach and insisted that foreign policy toward the developing world should revolve around the expansion of human rights. Carter believed that U.S. relations with foreign countries should be determined by how a country treated its citizens.
Carter’s emphasis on human rights led him to alter the U.S. relationship with a number of dictators. In Nicaragua, the Somoza family had ruled the country with an iron grip since the mid-1980s, most of the time with the support of the United States. In 1978, a leftist group known as the Sandinistas began a

rebellion against the country’s ruler, General Anastasio Somoza. His brutal response to the rebellion helped convince Carter to withdraw U.S. support. Without U.S. aid, General Somoza had to flee Nicaragua, and the Sandinistas came to power.
Other Foreign Policy Initiatives in Latin America
The Carter administration briefly sought to improve relations with communist Cuba, ruled by Fidel Castro since 1959. U.S.-Cuban relations soured in 1980, however, when Castro announced that any Cuban could leave the island from the port of Mariel for the United States. However, Castro insisted that any boats headed to the United States would also have to take criminals from Cuba’s prisons.
Because of this requirement, the Mariel boatlift developed a bad reputation in the eyes of many Americans. Fewer than 20 percent of the people transported had spent time in prison, and many of those were political prisoners. Still, Americans were repelled by Castro’s lack of concern for the welfare of the emigrants and by the idea that he would send criminals to the United States.
Carter’s most controversial foreign policy move involved his decision to return the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. You will recall that in 1903, Panama had given the United States control of a wide strip of land across the middle of the country that later became the site of the Panama Canal. In 1977, Carter negotiated a set of treaties to return the Canal Zone to Panama by 1999. Many Americans worried that the loss of control over the canal would threaten American shipping and security. Nonetheless, the United States Senate narrowly ratified the treaties in 1978, and all control of the canal was ultimately turned over to Panama.

Success and Setback in the Middle East
Carter’s greatest achievement in foreign policy came in the region that also saw his greatest setback. He helped negotiate a historic peace agreement between Israel and Egypt, but he failed to win the release of Americans held hostage by Iranian radicals.
The Camp David Accords Egypt had opposed Israel’s existence since Israel’s founding in 1948. As recently as 1973, Egypt and Syria had attacked Israel. By 1977, eager to improve relations, Egyptian President Anwar

el-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin met in Jerusalem to negotiate a peace agreement.
To help continue the negotiations, Carter invited the two leaders to Camp David, the presidential retreat. For nearly two weeks, the three leaders carried on the difficult negotiations that produced what is known as the Camp David Accords. These agreements provided the framework for a peace treaty in which Egypt formally recognized the nation of Israel, becoming the first Arab nation to do so. In return, Israel withdrew its troops from the Sinai Peninsula, which it had controlled since the 1967 war. The preamble to the Accords states:
After four wars during 30 years, despite intensive human efforts, the Middle East, which is the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of three great religions, does not enjoy the blessings of peace. . . . [Israel and Egypt] recognize that for peace to endure, it must involve all those who have been most deeply affected by the conflict. They therefore agree that this framework, as appropriate, is intended by them to constitute a basis for peace not only between Egypt and Israel, but also between Israel and each of its other neighbors. . . .
—Camp David Accords, September 19, 1978
The Iran Hostage Crisis Carter hoped that the Camp David Accords would usher in a new era of cooperation in the Middle East. Yet, events in Iran showed that troubles in the region were far from over. Since the 1950s, the United States had supported the anticommunist rule of the Shah, or emperor, of Iran. In the 1970s, however, opposition to the Shah began to grow within Iran. Anger toward the nation that had long propped up the Shah's repressive regime—the United States—would soon boil over as well.
Dying of cancer, the Shah fled Iran in January 1979. Fundamentalist Islamic clerics, led by the Ayatollah Khomeini (i yuh TOH luh koh MAYN ee), took power. Carter allowed the Shah to enter the United States to seek medical treatment. Enraged radical Iranian students invaded the U.S. Embassy and took 66

Interactive Timeline
Americans as hostages. The Khomeini government took control of both the embassy and the hostages to defy the United States.
The hostage crisis consumed Carter’s attention during the last year of his presidency. To many Americans, his failure to win the hostages’ release was evidence of American weakness. As Peter Bourne put it in his biography of Jimmy Carter, “Because people felt that Carter had not been tough enough in foreign policy ... some bunch of students could seize American diplomatic officials and hold them prisoner and thumb their nose at the United States.”
The hostage crisis began to change the way Americans viewed the world outside their borders. Nuclear war between the two superpowers was no longer the only threat to the United States. Although the Cold War still concerned Americans, the threats posed by conflicts in the Middle East threatened to become the greatest foreign policy challenge of the United States.

Unease Over Changing Values
Social and cultural changes that had begun in the 1950s and 1960s continued unabated in the 1970s. As a result, by the end of the decade, the United States was a very different society from the one it had been a generation earlier. These differences gave rise to an ongoing debate about the nation's values.
Migration, Immigration, and Politics After World War II, there had been a demographic shift as American moved to the southern and western states, in search of jobs and a better climate. The migration of Americans to the Sunbelt and the continued growth of the suburbs, both of which had begun in the post-World War II years, continued during the 1970s. As northern industries suffered, many blue-collar workers and their families moved from the Rust Belt states of the Northeast and Midwest to the Sunbelt of the South and West.
They sought work in the oil fields of Texas and Oklahoma and in the defense plants of southern California, the Southwest, and the Northwest. These changing demographic patterns changed the face of the United States.
The elections of Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter demonstrated the growing political power of the
Sunbelt. Earlier in the century, Presidents tended to come from the large northern industrial states, such as New York and Ohio. In the latter decades of the twentieth century, Presidents tended to come from the Sunbelt.
The influx of immigrants from Latin America and Asia represented a different kind of demographic change. Even before the 1970s, hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans had migrated to the United States in search of work and a better life. This migration, both legal and illegal, especially from Mexico and other Latin American countries, showed continued strength in the 1970s. The growing power of the Latino vote did not escape the notice of politicians. Richard Nixon was the first presidential candidate to seriously court the Spanish-speaking vote.
Countercultural Styles Spread in the “Me Decade” During the 1960s, radicals had challenged many of society's traditional values. They questioned restrictions on premarital sex and drug use. They sported casual clothing and long hairstyles that many of their parents’ generation found improper. Yet the counterculture remained a relatively isolated phenomenon during the 1960s. By the end of the 1970s, in contrast, these behaviors had become more widespread. Nationwide, the divorce rate had more than doubled between 1965 and 1979, and twice as many

An Era of Change
children were born out of wedlock. To some Americans, the new ways were a sign of troubled times.
Some critics called the 1970s the "me decade” because many Americans appeared to be absorbed with improving themselves. This trend was reflected in the rise of movements like Transcendental Meditation (TM), a practice based in Eastern religious ideas. Those who practiced TM sought to find inner relaxation and vitality by chanting their personal mantras for about half an hour twice a day.
The seventies also witnessed an increasing interest in personal fitness and health. Millions began to jog for exercise and to eat natural, or less processed, foods. In 1970, just over 100 men and women ran in the New York City Marathon. Ten years later, more than 14,000 ran in the race. Body building took off, too, largely due to the influence of Arnold Schwarzenegger. A charismatic personality, Schwarzenegger went on to become one of Hollywood's most popular actors and, later, governor of California.
Conservatives Call for a Return to Traditional Values The 1970s witnessed a resurgence of fundamentalist Christianity, partly as a response to the shift in values. To some commentators, it seemed as if the nation was experiencing another Great Awakening, like the great religious movements of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Although the total number of Americans who attended church on a regular basis did not change much, the number of men and women who belonged to evangelical churches rose rapidly. One in five Americans considered himself or herself a religious fundamentalist by 1980.
Religious conservatives firmly opposed many of the social changes begun in the 1960s that had gone mainstream in the 1970s. They opposed the Supreme Court's rulings that legalized abortion and restricted prayer in school. Religious conservatives saw the latter as an unfair curtailment of religious freedom. In 1972, however, the Court upheld religious freedom in Wisconsin v. Yoder when it ruled that the state could not compel Amish children to attend school beyond the eighth grade because doing so violated Amish religious principles.
In opposing some Supreme Court rulings and what they believed were the negative effects of social change, evangelical ministers used the media to gain a broader following. Those who preached on television, such as Jerry Falwell, Oral Roberts, and Marion “Pat” Robertson, became known as televangelists. These preachers reached millions of television viewers. Falwell’s weekly television show, for example, was broadcast to 1.5 million viewers.
» Televangelists, such as Reverend Jerry Falwell, were opposed to social changes that began in the 1960s and took root in the 1970s. They felt America was deviating from its moral path.

In 1979, Falwell formed a prominent Christian conservative organization known as the Moral Majority. He voiced the concerns of many fundamentalists:
We must reverse the trend America finds herself in today. Young people . . . have been born and reared in a different world than Americans of past worlds. . . . They have learned to disrespect the family as God has established it. . . . They have been taught that the Bible is just another book of literature. . . . They have been introduced to the drug culture.
—Reverend. Jerry Falwell, Listen America, 1980
During the 1970s, religious conservatives began forming alliances with other conservatives. They worked with economic conservatives, who sought to cut taxes and government spending, as well as with supporters of a stronger foreign policy, who favored increasing defense spending. Together, they began forging a new political majority. By 1980, Ronald

The year 2000 brought an end to Clinton’s two terms as President. Clinton’s legacy of a strong economy coupled with personal scandal polarized voters. As candidates geared up for the 2000 presidential race, it promised to be a close election.
On October 17, 2000, Republican candidate George W. Bush (left) and Democratic candidate A1 Gore (right) appeared in their third and final debate of the presidential campaign.

The George W. Bush Presidency
Controversy in the 2000 Election
The Candidates Clinton’s Vice President, A1 Gore, Jr., of Tennessee, ran for the Democrats. Gore selected Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman as his Vice President. Lieberman was the first Jewish person to be on the ticket of a major party.
The Republicans chose George W. Bush as their candidate. A son of George H.W. Bush and a former governor of Texas, Bush was popular with conservatives. As governor, Bush had worked with Democrats as well as Republicans. He struck many Americans as sincere.
Ralph Nader, a third-party candidate from the left-of-center Green Party, also joined the presidential race in 2000. Many Democrats urged Nader to withdraw from the race, pointing out that any vote for him would likely be a vote taken away from Gore. Nader’s candidacy would end up having a profound impact on the election.
A
Close Vote The campaigns focused mainly on how to spend the federal budget surplus. Bush favored widespread tax cuts. Gore proposed strengthening Social Security and paying down the national debt. On election night, Americans voted mainly by party affiliation. PEARSON 1

The vote margin in the Electoral College was razor thin. Although Gore received a half million more votes than Bush, both fell short of winning the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency. The issue was Florida’s 25 electoral votes. The popular vote in Florida was so close that a state law mandated an automatic statewide recount. Bush led by a margin of 537 popular votes. He was awarded 271 electoral votes, one more than was needed to win the election. Ralph Nader received more than 97,000 votes in the state of Florida. If, as many Democrats believe, the vast majority of votes for Nader would have otherwise gone to Gore, then Gore would have garnered Florida’s 25 electoral votes and won the presidency.
The Supreme Court Steps In Given the extreme closeness of the votes, Democrats demanded a hand recount in several Florida counties. Republicans countered by suing in a Miami court to prevent the recount.
For more than a month, confusion reigned. The election was now affecting the relationships among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.
Finally, the Supreme Court ruled on the issue. In the case of Bush v. Gore, the court ended the re-recounting by a 5-to-4 decision. On December 12, 2000, Gore

conceded defeat, and Bush delivered a conciliatory victory speech.
The election showed an interesting geographical pattern. The Democrats captured votes in their traditional strongholds: the two coasts and large cities. Republicans won a large bloc of voters in the Midwest and the South.

The Bush Domestic
Agenda
Once in office, Bush turned his attention to domestic issues. Like most Republicans, Bush believed that tax cuts would stimulate the economy and create new jobs. In 2001, Bush pushed a highly controversial $1.3 trillion tax cut through Congress. The tax cut put more money in the hands of consumers. But most of the benefits of the tax cut went to the wealthiest Americans. As a result, the federal budget deficit increased.

» In 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act, fulfilling his campaign promise to pursue a domestic agenda that improved educational opportunities for America’s children.
Focus on Education Bush’s other domestic priority was education. He supported legislation that tied the federal funding of schools to academic achievement. The 2002 No Child Left Behind Act penalized schools that did not reach federal performance standards. It also called for improving teacher quality and other reforms.
Bush also addressed the concerns of older Americans who faced rising costs for prescription drugs. In 2003, Congress extended Medicare to cover prescription drugs for senior citizens. The measure was controversial. It was expensive, and many seniors found its provisions confusing and its coverage inadequate.
Reforming Entitlements In his inauguration address, Bush promised to reform Social Security and Medicare, the government-run health plan for senior citizens. Together these programs account for about one third of the federal budget. Bush was concerned that because of a rapidly aging U.S. population and the rising cost of Medicare, these government programs would eventually become insolvent unless changes were made. Bush was able to make some progress on Medicare with the Medicare Act of 2003. But Democratic opposition to Social Security reform thwarted Bush’s efforts.

The September 11, 2001 Attacks and the War on Terror
As the first anniversary of Bush’s election victory approached, the nation faced a number of important but typical problems. No one was expecting a devastating attack that would stun the nation and usher in a new era in U.S. history. Shortly before 9 a.m. Eastern time on September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 slammed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. Soon another hijacked plane hit the World Trade Center. Just over an hour after the first crash, the World Trade Center towers began to collapse, spewing dust and debris over the city, and trapping the hundreds of firefighters and police who had gone into the towers to rescue people. As panicked people fled the area around the site, stunned Americans watched the horrific scenes unfold on their televisions. These two crashes were not accidents, but part of a carefully planned assault on the United States
At 9:40 a.m. a third airliner that had been hijacked after leaving Washington, D.C., crashed into the Pentagon. Meanwhile, passengers on a fourth hijacked

plane learned of the earlier crashes on their cellphones. They bravely stormed the cockpit, refusing to allow the hijackers to target another building. At 10:03 a.m., this fourth airliner crashed in a field near Pittsburgh. That same day, it was confirmed that the al Qaeda Islamist terrorist group had spearheaded the attacks. In time, Americans also learned that nearly 3,000 people had died as a result of the attacks on 9/11.
Al Qaeda’s Campaign of Terrorism The suddenness, surprise, and cruelty of the 9/11 attacks against thousands of defenseless people was unprecedented in American history. However, Americans soon began to realize that the 9/11 attacks were the most destructive in a series of attacks that al Qaeda had launched against the United States. Al Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden, the son of a wealthy businessman from Saudi Arabia, was a terrorist group committed to an extreme form of Islam. One of its goals was to end all American involvement in Muslim countries.
Throughout the 1990s, al Qaeda had been targeting Americans at home and abroad, and in fact, it had attempted to blow up the World Trade Center once before. In 1993 it exploded a bomb at the site, killing six people and injuring more than a thousand. In 1998, the organization set off car bombs at American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 225 people and injuring more than 5,500. In 2000, al Qaeda bombed the , an American ship anchored off the coast of Yemen, killing 17 American sailors. In 2001, al Qaeda chose to attack the World Trade Center and the Pentagon because these buildings represented American economic and military power.
Americans responded to the 9/11 attacks as a unified, determined people. On the day of the attacks, President Bush addressed the nation:
“Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, and our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. .
. . Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror.
. . . These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed.
. . . Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel,
» In addition to the September 11 attacks in New York City, hijackers crashed a plane into the Pentagon in northern Virginia, taking the lives of more than one hundred government employees.
» Osama bin Laden was a member of a wealthy Saudi Arabian family and a founder of the al Qaeda terrorist network.

but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve.”
—President George W. Bush, September 11, 2001
Americans Unite in Troubling Times Americans were shocked by the 9/11 attacks, but they rallied to defend their nation. Millions of Americans rushed to donate money, supplies, services, and their own blood. Throughout the country, Americans put up flags to show their patriotism and determination. Many held candlelight vigils and prayer services for the dead and bereaved. Continued fears of more terrorist attacks, however, kept the nation on edge. In October 2001, a newspaper editor in Florida died from an anthrax infection. Anthrax is a type of bacteria that has been used by several countries to create biological weapons. Traces of anthrax then appeared in news offices in New York City and in the office of a U.S. senator in Washington. Two postal workers who had handled materials containing anthrax died. Although the FBI investigated, no terrorists were caught.
The Legacy of 9/11 September 11, 2001, became a watershed in modern American history, when
» Flags lined a freeway overpass in California on September 11, 2006, the fifth anniversary of the attacks. Identify Cause and Effect How does this photograph express the continuing impact of the September 11 attacks on American society?
Americans’ confidence in their nation’s security was deeply shaken. Americans came together to grieve, rebuild, and decide how to deal with the threat of terrorism. The name “9/11” quickly entered the national lexicon, with people viewing historical events and even ideas as “before 9/11” or “after 9/11.”
The 9/11 attacks also had great impact on the nation’s economy. Despite increased airport security, some Americans remained wary of air travel, which hurt the airline and travel industries. Businesses and households entered a period of uncertainty during which spending decreased. Estimates indicate that the attacks cost the economy one million jobs and reduced the country’s output by three percent.
The War on Terror and the Invasion of Afghanistan
President Bush had been in office less than a year when these attacks occurred. The al Qaeda terrorist attack against the nation challenged the new President in unforeseen ways and led to a major shift in American foreign policy. In the wake of September 11, Bush and his advisers agreed that the most important priority should be finding and prosecuting the people behind 9/11. This would be just the first step in what Bush called the “war on terror.” American government officials had determined that Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda network had been behind the attacks. Bin Laden opposed the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. economic boycott against Iraq, and U.S. support for Israel. Bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders were in Afghanistan, where the Islamist Taliban government allowed them to operate training camps for terrorists.
Bush believed that any government that sponsored terrorism should be held accountable. He demanded that the Taliban turn bin Laden over to U.S. custody. When the Taliban refused, American forces, joined by Great Britain, invaded Afghanistan. Allied forces quickly overthrew the Taliban. Although American troops captured several of al Qaeda’s leaders, Osama bin Laden escaped.
Ensuring National Security Bush moved quickly to prevent future terrorist attacks. Soon after September 11, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act to give law enforcement broader powers to monitor suspected terrorists. Critics claimed that the USA PATRIOT Act violated civil liberties. But many Americans were willing to give up some freedoms in return for improved security. Congress also approved Bush’s call for the creation of a new Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security to coordinate security matters among federal, state, and local agencies.
The Bush administration exercised broad powers fighting the war on terror. The U.S. operations in

Afghanistan led to the capture of alleged members of the Taliban and others fighting against the United States. These prisoners were sent to a U.S. base located at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Many of these prisoners were held for years without formal charges brought against them.
Controversy surrounded the holding of the prisoners, mostly on the grounds that their detentions violated the writ of habeas corpus. Because of the constitutional issues raised by federal government policy changes, the Supreme Court heard a series of cases dealing with this issue and the Bush administration’s use of military tribunals rather than civilian courts to prosecute enemy combatants. In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, the Court ruled that the Bush administration’s use of military courts violated the Geneva Conventions and U.S. federal law, including the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice.
War on Terror Moves to Iraq Bush next contemplated invading Iraq as part of his wider war on terrorism. Many people believed that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was building nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Despite many Americans’ belief that UN weapons inspectors should be allowed to continue their search for Iraqi WMD, Congress authorized Bush to use military force against Iraq. On March 19, 2003, American and British military forces invaded Iraq in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Saddam’s forces collapsed almost immediately. As the Iraqi capital of Baghdad fell, Saddam and other Iraqi leaders went into hiding.

Bush’s Second Term
The Iraq war, terrorism, and the federal budget deficit weighed heavily on Americans’ minds as they voted in the 2004 presidential election. Bush campaigned as a “war president,” saying he had proved his competency as commander-in-chief. Bush defeated the Democratic candidate for president, Massachusetts senator John Kerry, by a comfortable margin.
Among those casting ballots for Bush in 2004 were the nation’s Latino voters. The Bush campaign turned to a Texas advertising agency run by Lionel Sosa. With Sosa's help, Bush captured an estimated 40 percent of Latino voters in 2004. Just 8 years earlier, Republican candidate Bob Dole could attract only 21 percent of Latino voters.
Problems Surface in Iraq Iraq remained a major focus of Bush’s second term as the war raged on.

However, by late 2005, Iraq had a new constitution and the beginnings of a democracy. The following year, Saddam Hussein was tried and executed. Saddam’s brutal rule had kept fighting in check among Iraq's three major groups: Sunnis, Shi’a, and Kurds. Now these groups fought bitterly for power. An American troop surge in 2007 lessened the violence. However, Iraq’s democracy remained fragile.
In 2008, a Senate Intelligence Committee report determined that there was no credible evidence to support claims that Iraq was developing WMD or had ties to terrorist groups. Some accused the Bush administration of deliberately misleading Congress and the American people to win support for the war.
Troubles at Home Meanwhile, Bush faced domestic challenges. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. Katrina caused much destruction in New Orleans. As fierce as the winds and rains of Katrina had been, New Orleans suffered even more after the storm passed. Rising waters soon breached levees protecting the low-lying city. Citizens were forced onto rooftops to await rescue and thousands of others sought shelter at the Superdome stadium. The government’s slow response to the damage was widely criticized. National discontent was reflected in the 2006 elections. For the

first time in 12 years, Democrats won control of the House and the Senate.
Bush Reaffirms American Sovereignty In February 2005, the Kyoto Protocol went into effect around the world. The treaty signed by 140 nations is aimed at controlling global warming linked to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Negotiations took place in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, with the help of the United States. Just months after assuming the presidency in 2001, George W. Bush announced that the United States would not abide by the treaty. The Bush administration argued that the treaty did not place emission limits on developing countries and that it could harm the U.S. economy. Many considered the Kyoto Protocol as yet another example of an international treaty undermining U.S. sovereignty.

The Financial Crisis of 2008
During the autumn of 2008, Americans faced a potentially disastrous economic crisis centered on the financial industry. The crisis stemmed in part from “subprime" home mortgage loans that banks had made to less-qualified, low-income borrowers. The higher interest rates on these loans made them more profitable for banks. The loans were then sold as mortgage-backed securities to investors.
The U.S. Slides into Recession After the U.S economy slid into a recession in late 2007, unemployed Americans could no longer pay their mortgages. Foreclosures—seizures of property from borrowers who are unable to repay their loans—increased.
As a result, housing prices fell and mortgage-related investments lost their value. Several large banking and investment firms collapsed or were sold.
Too Big to Fail—The Financial Industry Bailout
In September 2008, the stock market plunged. The country faced its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke proposed a $700 billion bailout of the banks that had engaged in risky lending practices. The Troubled Asset Relief

Contrasting Candidates John McCain, the son and grandson of navy admirals, served as a pilot in the Vietnam War. He endured six years as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down. He won election to the House of Representatives in 1982. McCain was elected to the United States Senate in 1986.
A graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, Barack Obama had been a community organizer in Chicago. The son of a white woman from Kansas and a black man from Kenya, Obama served in the Illinois state legislature before being elected to the United States Senate.
A
Historic Moment On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama became the 44th U.S. President and the first African American to hold the office. At a huge victory rally in Chicago in November, his words captured the historic moment: “If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.” www.PearsonTexas.com

The election drew a large voter turnout, with 62 percent of voters citing the economy as their main concern. Bush’s low approval ratings, combined with McCain's missteps, made a Republican victory seem almost impossible. In Congress, Democrats expanded their majority.
Id RECALL Describe Barack Obama’s background
before he assumed the presidency in 2008.
President Obama Takes Action
Before taking office, President Obama had developed an economic stimulus package to pump money into the sinking economy. The $787 billion bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, was approved by Congress in February 2009. The stimulus package included tax cuts, aid to state and local governments, and funds for infrastructure projects.
Obama’s Appointments Elected with the help of a coalition of minority voters, women, and young voters, President Obama sought to reflect the country's diversity in his cabinet appointments. Perhaps his most prominent appointment was that of Hillary Clinton,
his former Democratic primary opponent. Clinton, the wife of President Bill Clinton and a senator from New York, served as Secretary of State during Obama’s first term in office.
President Obama’s first Supreme Court nomination added diversity to the Court. He nominated Sonia Sotomayor, the daughter of Puerto Rican parents. Sotomayor grew up in a public housing project in the Bronx and had overcome a difficult childhood. A federal judge since 1992, Sotomayor was confirmed in 2009, becoming the first Hispanic to serve as a Supreme Court justice. In 2010, Obama nominated Elena Kagan to fill a vacancy in the Court. Kagan was known for working with both conservatives and liberals and had built a reputation as a passionate advocate of civil rights, including gay rights.
Healthcare Reform In 2008, more than 46 million Americans had no health insurance. During the campaign, Obama had pledged to create a national health plan to provide affordable coverage. He assigned Congress the job of fixing the healthcare system.
In November 2009, the House approved an overhaul of the nation’s healthcare system. The Senate passed its own healthcare bill in December. However, after Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, healthcare reform was in jeopardy. President

B
Obama campaigned for the bill and won the support of wavering Democrats. In March 2010, in a dramatic vote, the House approved the Senate's healthcare bill. Despite unanimous Republican opposition in the House and Senate, it was the most significant federal healthcare legislation since Medicare was passed in 1965.
The bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, quickly became known as “Obamacare.”
It extends coverage to the uninsured, prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing medical conditions, and provides subsidies to help low-income earners buy insurance. Still, many Americans opposed the new plan. They argued that it cost too much, put too great a burden on small businesses, and gave the federal government too much power.
Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya In August 2010, Obama announced, “The American combat mission in Iraq has ended.” When the final pull-out took place in late 2011, more than 4,000 Americans had been killed and more than 31,000 wounded. During the American troop surge, Iraq was significantly more stable, although acts of terrorism continued. About 50,000 American troops remained behind in support roles.
» Some Americans hoped that “Obamacare” would quickly be repealed. They felt it was not only too expensive but that its provisions went beyond the powers given to the government by the Constitution.
Interactive Chart
At the same time, Obama increased the American military presence in Afghanistan. American and allied troops had gone into Afghanistan shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but they had never rid the country of the Taliban forces that had protected Osama bin Laden. Now, Obama asserted, American forces would focus on the Taliban in Afghanistan and their allies in Pakistan.
In May 2011, President Obama announced the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. In a secret operation lasting less than an hour, Navy SEALS raided a compound in Pakistan and killed bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks. However, Americans were well aware that the death of bin Laden did not end the threat of terrorism. Intelligence officers examined computer files and other evidence seized at bin Laden’s compound in the hopes that such materials would aid the continuing war on terrorism.
During the spring and summer of 2011, the United States also participated in an international coalition aiding the rebels who were fighting to overthrow the Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi. Qaddafi had long supported terrorist groups, and was finally overthrown and executed by rebel fighters.
Economic Issues and Reforms America’s economic problems continued. Unemployment had risen throughout 2009, peaking at 10.2 percent. Although the economy had stabilized by the spring of 2010, sluggish economic growth and a high unemployment rate left many Americans fearful about the future.
In July 2010, Obama signed into law a sweeping financial reform bill aimed at changing the Wall Street practices that had contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. The new law increased federal oversight of banks, hedge funds, and other financial institutions. It also created a consumer protection agency to oversee credit card rates, bank fees, mortgages, and car loans. Critics argued, however, that the 2,300-page bill was too complex and too confusing to yield significant results. They said it would tighten credit and lead to further economic woes.
The 2010 Congresssional Elections As the
2010 congressional elections approached, the nation seemed increasingly divided. While many Americans supported President Obama, others were angered by his actions. The strongest challenge came from the Tea Party Movement which emerged during Obama’s first year in office. The movement took its name from the Boston Tea Party, a colonial protest against British taxes. The Tea Party Movement was made up of many local groups, united by a common desire to reduce the size and scope of the federal government.

Although they ran as Republicans, they were not traditional party candidates. They criticized many other Republicans as big spenders and urged a phase-out of programs such as Social Security and Medicare. In the 2010 elections, more than 40 candidates endorsed by the Tea Party were elected to the House and Senate.
Republicans won back control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 mid-term elections. Leaders of the new Republican-controlled House announced that their first priority would be to repeal Obama’s healthcare bill. Meanwhile, in the final months of 2010, Congress passed a number of important measures, including extensions of the Bush tax cuts and an arms-control treaty with Russia.

Obama’s Second Term
As the 2012 presidential election approached, the nation’s economy remained a major concern. Continued economic worries led to political polarization, and the
established political parties were criticized by activists on the left and right. On the right, the Tea Party Movement urged Republicans to reduce taxation and the power of the federal government. On the left, critics from the Occupy Movement claimed that democracy was threatened by the accumulation of wealth and power in the hands of 1 percent of the population. For several months in late 2011 and early 2012, the mainly young people of the Occupy Movement set up tented encampments in American cities to draw attention to their cause.
Although the economic situation did not seem to be improving, the Obama administration received good news on another front. In June 2012, the Supreme Court, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, granted Obama a judicial victory by ruling that it was within Congress’s power to introduce most provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The ruling surprised many observers who were convinced that the Act was unconstitutional.
The Election of 2012 The Democrats used the issue of income inequality in President Obama’s 2012 election campaign against the Republican candidate Mitt Romney, whom they portrayed as out of touch with ordinary people. After a deeply divisive campaign, Romney was defeated by Obama, who received 51.1 percent of the popular vote and 332 electoral votes. Exit polls offered an insight into America’s changing

demographics: Obama’s victory rested partly on a coalition of minority voters and the young. With surveys showing a shrinking white population, some suggested that the Republican party would have to broaden its appeal to minority voters and young people in order to win future elections.
Obama began his second term amidst a continuing economic recession at home and lingering military problems abroad, his power weakened by a divided electorate. Many conservative voters still questioned the wisdom of his universal healthcare act and leadership in the war against terrorism.
Continuing Economic Problems With an unemployment rate of just under eight percent, and job creation lagging behind presidential expectations, Obama faced a difficult task. The problems were significant. America imported more than it exported, creating an unfavorable balance of trade. In addition there were charges, and some evidence, that the country’s economic competitors were guilty of unfavorable trade practices. Slow economic growth and failure to significantly reduce spending added to the woes.

debt. Yet Democrats and Republicans in Congress showed little incentive to negotiate in order to pass effective legislation. In the autumn of 2013, negotiations to raise the borrowing limit for the government stalled as Republicans demanded a number of political concessions that Democrats refused to give. Among these Republican demands were a postponement of the Affordable Care Act, tax reform, and energy deregulation. As the parties could not agree on a budget bill to fund the government, certain government services were forced to shut down temporarily.
Foreign Policy During Obama’s Second Term
Revolutions and civil wars in the Middle East continued to challenge American policy. Although the scheduled pull-out of American troops from Iraq was completed in 2011, the country remains politically unstable and wracked by sectarian violence. In Afghanistan, U.S. combat troops may leave at the end of 2014, but military personnel may remain in that country indefinitely. Meanwhile, as civil war raged in Syria, the Obama administration found itself in a difficult position, wary of sending arms that might find their way into the hands of terrorists and reluctant to become involved in another war in the Middle East. Tensions also remained high over Iran’s nuclear program, which many observers believe is intended to produce weapons rather than domestic energy. In November 2013, President Obama and other Western leaders persuaded Iran to accept an interim agreement to halt elements of its nuclear program and agree to weapons inspections in exchange for Western nations lifting some sanctions against that country.
The Boston Marathon Bombings The issue of America’s involvement in the Middle East was cited as the motive behind a horrific terrorist attack in Boston. On April 15, 2013, two pressure cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.
The explosions transformed a day of celebration into grief, as Americans mourned the three people who were killed and the 264 who were injured. Authorities soon identified the bombers as two brothers, Islamist extremists upset by America’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of the brothers died as he fled from authorities. Police captured the other, who was an American citizen. The attack traumatized and stunned millions of American citizens who followed the events on the news and social media.

Immigration Changes American Society
It is often said that the United States is a nation of immigrants. Over the centuries, American protection of religious and personal freedom, along with opportunities for social and economic mobility, has attracted huge numbers of immigrants, both legal and illegal. Such a steady flow of immigrants has ensured that American demographics are in a state of constant change. Over time, however, the nature of immigration has changed.
Expanding Immigration For years, the government limited immigration to mainly northern and western Europeans. In the 1960s, however, laws began to relax immigration limitations. The Immigration Act of 1990 increased quotas by 40 percent and eased most remaining restrictions. As a result, the period from the 1990s to the 2000s saw the largest numbers of immigrants in the country's history. During that time, almost one million immigrants arrived in America each year from all over the globe, representing a wide variety of cultures and religions. Today, immigrants account for more than 10 percent of the total American population.

Latinos Exert Their Influence Most of the new immigrants were Latinos. In 2000, 27 percent of the total immigrant population were Mexicans, with people from the Caribbean and Central America making up almost 17 percent. Mexicans and Central Americans settled largely in the South and Southwest. Caribbean immigrants, many of them Cubans, settled in Florida. The census of 2000 showed that a third or more of the residents of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California were Latinos.
Like all immigrants, Latinos have varying educational and employment backgrounds. Often they are forced to take lower-paying jobs with no healthcare benefits. However, Latino immigrants have had a profound social, cultural, and political impact. By 2001, Latinos held about 5,000 political offices and 4 percent of the seats in Congress, primarily as Democrats. Cuban Americans in Florida, generally Republican, have had an enormous influence on American political policy concerning Cuba.
The Growing Asian Population Asians make up the second-largest source of the new immigration. In 2000, they were nearly 23 percent of the total immigrant population, with the largest numbers coming from China, the Philippines, and India. The majority of Asian immigrants have settled in California, adding to the large Asian population in that state.
As a group, Asian immigrants have come from widely varying backgrounds, but overall they have the highest level of education. Some came to America with college degrees and marketable skills and found professional jobs. Others came from war-torn countries, with very little education.
Effects of Immigration on American Society
Immigration has long been debated in this country. People who would restrict it worry that immigrants take jobs and social services away from native-born Americans. They generally oppose bilingual education, in which students are taught in their native languages as well as in English, as they believe that immigrants should learn English in order to assimilate into American society. Proponents point out that immigrants contribute to the economy, often by taking jobs no one else wants. They also argue that with the U.S. birthrate falling, immigrants help the country by maintaining its population.
Much of the debate concerns illegal immigrants. A large number of immigrants to the United States, especially Latinos, have come illegally. They labor in low-paying jobs, such as migrant farmwork, and receive no benefits. The goal of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was to stop the flow of immigrants who were entering the country illegally by penalizing employers who hired them and by granting

resident status to those living in the United States since 1982. But immigrants still regularly cross U.S. borders illegally. How to treat these unauthorized workers is an ongoing debate. In 2008, the Bush administration proposed changes that would make it easier for farm employers to legally hire immigrant workers. Bush also proposed a process by which immigrants who entered illegally or whose visitation documents expired could eventually gain citizenship.
Immigration reform became a significant political issue again in 2013. A new comprehensive immigration reform bill brought before Congress provided a conditional path to citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants already living in the country.
It also provided money to secure the borders against future illegal immigration as well as strategies for fixing various aspects of visa programs. But while the bill passed in the Senate, the House of Representatives declined to vote on it. House Republicans were not in favor of the bill. President Obama continued in 2014 to call immigration reform a priority, but prospects for the bill’s success were not good. However, as with so many other difficult issues that Americans have faced
throughout their history, time will surely bring about some kind of resolution.

Why do some Americans oppose bilingual education? American Demographics in Transition
At the beginning of 2000, Americans were on the move more than ever. Coastal cities as well as the Sunbelt, or the region of warm southern and southwestern states, saw rapid population and economic growth as people left the cold Northeast and the Rust Belt. Meanwhile, the family itself was changing.
New and Diverse Families In 1960, more than 70 percent of American households were headed by a working father and a nonworking mother, neither of whom had ever been divorced. By 2000, fewer than 15 percent of households fit this model.
In 2000, one out of every two marriages ended in divorce, and in a high percentage of households both parents worked outside the home. Single-parent households were far more common, with a quarter of all children growing up in a single-parent household. The number of children born to unmarried mothers

also rose. In I960, only 5 percent of children were born out of wedlock. In 2011, one out of every four white babies, one out of every three Latino babies, and two out of every three African American babies were born to unmarried mothers.
Debating and Challenging Affirmative Action In
the 1960s, President Johnson introduced the idea of affirmative action, or improving opportunities for women and minorities by giving preference to them in school admissions and job applications. Since that time, affirmative action has been hotly debated. Proponents argue that without such initiatives, minorities cannot overcome generations of discrimination. Opponents say that the policy is unfair and that one of its unintended consequences is that it discriminates against nonminorities. In 1996, Californians voted to end affirmative action in state hiring and education.
That same year, a federal court struck down an affirmative action admissions program at the University of Texas. In 2003, however, the Supreme Court decided in two cases involving the University of Michigan that while race could not be the deciding factor in admissions, it could be one of several factors. One of these cases was Grutter v. Bollinger, in which it was decided that such considerations did not constitute a quota system.
In 2013, the Supreme Court allowed affirmative action to survive in college admissions Fisher v. University of Texas but imposed a tough legal standard, ruling that schools must prove that “available, workable race-neutral alternatives” are failing before race can be taken into account in admission decisions. The case was sent back to a federal appeals court for review.
During this same session, the Court heard a case that tests whether voters can ban affirmative action programs through a referendum. The successful referendum at issue in this case was passed in Michigan in 2006, and it was a backlash to the University of Michigan rulings in 2003.
Expanding and Protecting the Rights of All Americans Social advocacy groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the National Organization for Women (NOW) continued the fight to ensure African Americans and women continued to make social and political gains. By 2002, 33 percent of African American families enjoyed incomes of at least $50,000, placing them in the middle class. Also in 2002, 17 percent of African Americans over the age of 25 held bachelor’s degrees. At the same time, legislation to enforce equal pay for equal work, address child-care needs for working women, and end sexual harassment in the workplace

has improved the lives of working women. Outside of the world of work, women have also achieved victories. Issues such as spouse abuse and date rape are now widely discussed. Incidents of violence against women are more often reported and more often punished than ever before. The 1994 Violence Against Women Act increased federal resources to apprehend and prosecute men guilty of violent acts against women.
Civil rights are also expanding for members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community (LGBT), helped by social and political advocacy organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and Lambda Legal. In 2011, the ban against openly gay service members in the U.S. military was lifted. An increasing number of states and towns have passed laws against anti-gay discrimination, while many states now allow same-sex couples to marry. In 2013 a major supreme court case, the United States v. Windsor, resulted in the Supreme Court striking down part of a law that banned federal recognition of same-sex marriages. The ruling means that same-sex couples who are married in states that allow gay marriage are now entitled to the same rights enjoyed by heterosexual married couples. These rights include Social Security benefits, hospital visitation rights, healthcare benefits, and military family benefits.

An Aging Population While the life expectancy of an American born in 1900 was less than 50 years, an American born in 2011 can expect to live to age 79. By 2000, older Americans tended to retire earlier, live longer, and exert more political influence. These factors have strained the country’s social welfare system, especially Social Security and Medicare. In 1960, the federal government spent less than $100 billion on social welfare. By 2013, the amount had increased to $1.9 trillion.
With the large baby-boom generation reaching retirement age, the issue of elder care has become critical. Falling birthrates over the past two decades have meant that when the huge population of baby boomers retires, there will not be enough workers to cover their Social Security benefits. Politicians have been debating how to deal with this impending reality.
In his second term, President Bush called for privatizing Social Security by allowing younger workers to invest some of their earnings in individual retirement accounts. Critics defeated the measure, saying that it would put younger workers at the mercy of fluctuating stock market returns without addressing the shortfall of funds. Today the debate continues.

Energy and the
Environment
On June 25, 2013, President Obama addressed an audience at Georgetown University on the subject of the environment. Briefly mentioning that the twelve warmest years in recorded history had occurred over the course of the previous fifteen years, he focused on the problems of global warming:
Last year, temperatures in some areas of the ocean reached record highs, and ice in the Arctic shrank to its smallest size on record—faster than most models had predicted it would. These are facts.
—President Obama, Georgetown University, June 25,
2013
In his speech, Obama suggested that the answer to the problems rested in stronger federal environmental legislation, including higher pollution standards and reducing the dumping of carbon pollution from the nation’s power plants. Ending his address, he called on Americans to “stand up and speak out” and to do what “this moment demands.” His speech seems to call on both government entities and private citizens to manage the environment.

accepting global warming as fact, deny that such warming is the product of human activity. Those who believe that human activity is the cause of global warming have urged the Obama administration to move forcefully to pass environmental legislation. But given the variety of opinion on environmental matters, it is not surprising that the administration’s policies have attracted plenty of opposition. The main argument against environmental legislation is that it hurts the economy and the nation’s industries.
Regulations have been passed to control emissions from power plants, prompting many coal industry officials to condemn the administration for waging a “war on coal.” In 2013, a major battle was brewing as Obama prepared to limit greenhouse gas emissions from existing utilities. Many Republicans also criticized the president’s efforts to support renewable energy. In recent years, billions of dollars have been invested in the renewable energy industries, although Republicans accuse the government of wasting taxpayers’ money, for example by supporting the failed solar manufacturer Solyndra.
Environmental Protection, Energy, and the Economy Most Americans, including Democratic and Republican politicians, agree that environmental protection is an important concern. However, environmental problems require a global response. But how does one reach a global consensus? Populous countries such as China, India, and Russia are largely immune to American calls for environmental protection. Nations that are developing economically have made little effort to improve air and water quality. Many point out that the destruction of the rain forest in Brazil will have a potentially greater catastrophic impact on the planet than anything done—or not done—in the United States.
As the world’s population increases, and living standards rise, there is also mounting pressure on the physical environment and resources such as oil. And as the human dependency on oil increases, so do the possibilities of accidents. Throughout the world, oil drilling has led to oil spills that have had devastating effects. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico (often referred to as the BP oil spill) created environmental problems in Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. Such spills are even more of a problem in more underdeveloped oil nations.
The Deepwater Horizon spill has helped intensify the controversy surrounding the Keystone XL pipeline project, which would transport crude oil from Canada to the oil refineries of the Gulf of Mexico. Critics have condemned this project for its possible damage to the

environment, while the project's supporters promise that it will bring jobs and a reliable oil supply.
Controversies like these will no doubt continue, however, as no economically viable alternative to oil has been discovered. In fact, scientists and engineers are busy developing other ways of extracting and transporting oil. Fracking (or hydrofracturing) has increased the amount of oil and gas extracted from the earth and in the United States, has helped to reduce American dependency on imported oil. It has had positive economic results. So has the use of pipelines to move oil from one section of America (or Canada) to another. But the long-range ecological impact of fracking is still under debate, and the use of pipelines comes with the risk of spills and accidents. In short, the United States and the world face a delicate balancing act between the need to maintain the environment and the necessity of promoting the economy and boosting people's standard of living.
Recycling and Green Architecture Although controversies over energy use remain, the environmental movement has achieved victories at a local level. These have often focused on the strategy of “reduce,

reuse, recycle” to conserve resources and decrease the amount of waste going into landfills. State and local governments drive recycling efforts. Several states have a deposit policy on recyclable cans and glass bottles to encourage recycling. In addition, by 2011, more than 9,800 communities in the United States had curbside recycling programs, and the United States recycled nearly 35 percent of its total trash.
The 2000s also saw a heightened interest in "green architecture,” or architecture that integrates technology with environmental concerns to lesson the human impact on the environment. Green buildings might feature recycled materials, increased insulation to cut down on heating and cooling energy use, and alternative sources of energy, such as solar or wind power.
For example in Boston, Massachusetts, a rooftop farm has been installed on top of the huge Design Center building beside the harbor. A layer of rooftop soil in which crops grow also insulates the building. The crops will be distributed to local stores where fresh produce is hard to come by.
As buildings become more energy-efficient, environmental groups are working to make cities healthier places to live. After decades of urban decline, American cities have become safer and more

Technology Transforms Life
The United States continues to benefit from its free enterprise system, which applies technological innovation in the marketplace. Digital technology in the form of cellphones, laptops, and tablet devices have all brought about rapid change in our way of life and have improved our standard of living. The microchips that were developed for computers have become essential components of modern televisions, CD players, VCRs, fax machines, dishwashers, refrigerators, washing machines, and hundreds of other appliances. This technology helps to regulate traffic, entertain millions of people, and facilitate shopping through home shopping sites.
Computers, telephone and satellite communications have shaped the economic development of the United States. Technological innovation, driven by the free enterprise system, has changed all of our lives in countless ways. It has also created new industries and employment opportunities at home, while increasing the competitiveness of American products in world markets. For example, the Dell Corporation uses just-in-time inventory management, an innovation that helps the company maintain lower inventories. Minimizing excess inventory helps businesses such as Dell run more efficiently and be more responsive to market demands. Various technological and management innovations such as robotics and computer management allow American companies to produce high-tech exports including computers, pharmaceuticals, electrical machinery, and scientific instruments, as well as products for the aerospace industry. In the years to come, America’s renewable-energy industry may surpass China’s. The United States is now profiting from its solar, wind, and smart-grid technology exports.

That’s good news for the American economy and for the planet!
Mobile Technology Connects America and the World A revolution in information technology is underway as technology transforms the ways we obtain information. More and more people are getting their news online rather than through traditional print media such as newspapers and magazines. This has led to major disruptions and transformations in the media industry. The information revolution is not only limited to world news. We can now access social media sites for information about friends or celebrities. Never in human history has so much information been so easily obtained.
Meanwhile, technology is also changing the way we gain access to entertainment. Music, movies, and television shows can be retrieved in seconds on a personal computer linked to the Internet or with a smart phone. At times it seems as if streaming videos and podcasts are helping the Internet replace television as our main entertainment machine. But the Internet is also spreading that entertainment wider than television ever could, by making American culture accessible to much of the world’s population. Through films and videos, American freedoms and economic opportunities are being broadcast to a growing audience worldwide. This trend is not without its dangers, as it has provoked violent reactions from radical groups who fear that local culture and traditions are being overwhelmed by American political and social ideals.
The American civic values of religious tolerance, respect for diversity, and freedom of speech are particularly threatening to extremists worldwide. Many foreign governments are also alarmed by this diffusion of American culture. But the open nature of the Internet has made it difficult for authoritarian regimes to block the flow of information.
As American culture continues to be broadcast throughout the world via various media, people abroad are inspired by the example of individuals who have made important political, social, and economic contributions to society. One of these is Oprah Winfrey, the influential television host. Although Winfrey was born into poverty in Mississippi, she overcame the trauma and hardships of her early life to become a world-famous talk-show host and producer. She is now a billionaire, philanthropist, social leader and role model for people everywhere who long to improve their lives and the lives of others.
Advances in Science The application of scientific discoveries and technological innovations by the free enterprise system continues to improve the standard

of living in the United States. Just as American high-tech research has made the country the leader in computer and other digital technology, American research and development laboratories have ensured that the country remains on the cutting-edge of medical and scientific innovation. No country spends more on medical research, and none has introduced more advances in the field. In particular, new research in genetics is opening up promising new possibilities for the treatment of cancer and other ailments. Genetic research will lead to safer pharmaceutical drugs.
Today, Americans have a wider range of medical options than ever before. From heart, kidney, and other organ transplants to microsurgery using micro video and fiber-optic cameras, American advanced medical treatment is the envy of the world. In addition, such American companies as Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Eli Lilly, and Pfizer have ensured that the United States leads the world in pharmaceutical innovation.
Concerns and Hopes Americans today are concerned about jobs and the solvency of long-term entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, In addition, the nation is passing through a confusing time of rapid technological change. The revolution in digital and information technologies is
America in the Twenty-First Century 711	12.4 Americans Look to the Future
comparable to the earlier industrial revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. These eras of change were characterized by disruption, anxiety, and fears but also by hopes and opportunities. Americans today are particularly worried about changing patterns of employment, and the growing strength of economic competitors. But the shifting ground is also providing new perspectives and opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship, activities that have always stood the nation in good stead. Throughout the country’s history, America’s resourcefulness and initiative have always been one of its greatest strengths.
The American ethos, or character, is made up of many other strengths that will continue to guarantee success in these changing times. U.S. citizens, whatever their origins or ancestry, hold a common bond in standing for certain self-evident truths. In a world torn apart by sectarian strife, America’s great advantage lies in its religious and ethnic diversity and tolerance, and in its concept of a nation based not on a single, monolithic religious or ethnic identity but on civic virtues and ideals. These virtues and ideals are the foundation of the republic. In contrast to many other countries, whose governments retain power through brutal political repression, the American political system provides a unique advantage. American representative democracy allows great flexibility—to decide what policies to adopt or when to change political course. Unlike more authoritarian political systems, where
only one party or group remains in control, America is open to diversity of thought and action and to peaceful political change. "We, the people” have the civic and patriotic responsibility to participate in this democratic process, and the commitment to political education and voting is a reflection of this patriotism.
In a very real sense, Americans work together to make a "more perfect union.” These are the civic ideals that will continue to ensure success in a changing world.

At the 1980 Republican National Convention, presidential candidate Ronald Reagan and running mate George H. W. Bush emphasized the need for tax cuts, a balanced budget, and increased defense spending.
ItOl Interactive Flipped Video^M
The two major political parties in the United States in the late twentieth century were the Democrats, many of whom were “liberals,” and the Republicans, who were often labeled “conservatives.” Liberals generally favored government intervention to help the needy, whereas conservatives generally favored allowing the free market, private organizations, and individuals to do that. Although the two parties did agree on many basic issues, including core American values such as freedom and equality, they diverged on many others. In addition, individual members within both parties did not always conform to the views of their party’s majority.

In order to understand the Republican party of the late twentieth century, one has to revisit the 1964 election, which marked a low point for conservatives. Republican Barry Goldwater, a favorite of the conservative movement, lost the election in a landslide to liberal Democrat Lyndon Johnson. Nonetheless, conservatives were not discouraged by this loss at the polls. On the contrary, they set out to build an organization and to put forth a clear vision of their goals and values that would enable them to win in the future.
Meanwhile, Goldwater returned to the Senate, where he continued to be the voice of conservatism and to forcefully advocate for conservative views. Goldwater found a supporter in California Governor Ronald Reagan, who was emerging as a conservative leader. By 1980, the conservatives' efforts had paid off. Their new standard bearer, Ronald Reagan, was elected president. The modern conservative movement that Reagan spearheaded shaped the nation’s policies for decades.

Liberalism’s Ideas and Goals In the late 1970s, liberals tended to believe that the federal government should play a significant role in improving the lives of all Americans. They valued social programs that helped the poor, unemployed, elderly, and others. They also sponsored laws that protected the rights of minorities and women, especially in the post-World War II period. They supported greater government regulation of industry. In the foreign policy realm, liberals tended to favor cooperating with international organizations like the United Nations.
Conservatism’s Ideas and Goals In contrast, some conservatives felt that a large central government endangered economic growth and individual choice. They felt the liberal policies of the 1960s and 1970s left a legacy of rising inflation and enormous waste. Furthermore, some conservatives criticized the liberal solution of “throwing money” at social problems. They sought to reduce taxes and limit government regulation of industry in order to promote economic growth.
As conservative economist Milton Friedman and his wife Rose Friedman wrote in their book Free to Choose, “The story of the United States is the story of an economic miracle. . . . What produced this miracle? Clearly not central direction by government.”
Other conservatives, neoconservatives or traditionalists, warned about the dangers posed to society by abandoning traditional values in favor of the new freedoms exemplified by the counterculture and advertised by the mass media. This concern with
social issues, such as the perceived degeneration of modern youth, dovetailed with many conservatives’ religious beliefs.
Anticommunism formed the third leg of modern conservatism. Most anticommunists focused on the dangers posed to the United States by the Soviet Union. They questioned the wisdom of the detente policy followed by Republican presidents Nixon and Ford, and by Democrat Jimmy Carter. They also fought against the SALT II treaty in the Senate.

According to conservatives, what is the best way to promote economic growth?
The Increasing Popularity of the New Right
During the 1940s and 1950s, the lines separating Republicans and Democrats had blurred. The two parties had developed a bipartisan foreign policy aimed at containing communism. Both favored a relatively significant role for the government in domestic affairs. However, during the 1960s and 1970s, many Republicans became increasingly critical of the liberal policies of the Democrats. They advanced a new conservative agenda. The differences between the two major parties grew more pronounced. The New Right, as the resurgent conservative movement was called, grew rapidly and was a coalition of several different groups with varying ideas and goals.

America in the 1980s and 1990s	639	11.1 The Conservative Movement Surges
The Decline of Liberalism One reason for the revival of the Republican Party was the unraveling of the Democratic Party. The Vietnam War and urban riots of the 1960s divided the same people who had rallied around President Johnson’s vision of the Great Society.
The rise of the counterculture alienated many midwestern Americans and white conservative Christians in the South. Feminist advances were opposed by social leaders like Phyllis Schlafly. Watergate, the oil crises of the 1970s, and the Iran hostage crisis further weakened the public’s faith in the federal government.
Just as importantly, the shifts in the economy of the 1970s, including the decline in northern industries, dampened America’s optimism about the future. America had supported the Great Society, in part, because Johnson had suggested that the war on poverty and other new programs would not demand higher taxes. When the economy stagnated, liberal ideas lost their pull and conservative beliefs became more attractive.
Criticizing Liberal Programs Many conservatives believed that liberal policies were responsible for stagflation and other economic problems of the late 1970s. They believed that the government taxed citizens and businesses too heavily and spent too much on the wrong programs. They complained about
unfunded mandates, programs required but not paid for by the federal government.
Some conservatives also criticized federal welfare programs, arguing that they rewarded lack of effort. Furthermore, they thought that Great Society programs did not work and that these programs had made the problem of poverty worse, not better. They pointed to other unintended consequences of such programs. For example, they charged that welfare contributed to the rise in the number of children born out of wedlock and therefore encouraged the decline of the traditional family—consisting of a married father and mother and their children. They also felt that affirmative action programs went too far and contributed to reverse discrimination.
Another group that supported the conservative platform was the “sagebrush rebels.” Sagebrush rebels were activists who believed that the federal government controlled too much land in Western states. They thought the federal government should give control of this land to the states, to be used to their best economic advantage. Most environmentalists opposed the movement, because they did not want to expose preserved lands to possible development.
The Religious Right Emerges At the same time, concern with cultural change caused more religious groups to become actively involved in politics. The Moral Majority, founded by Reverend Jerry Falwell

in 1979, was a political organization working to fulfill religious goals. It also worried about the decline of the traditional family. The Moral Majority opposed the 1962 Supreme Court decision Engel v. Vitale, which forbade government-written prayers in public schools, as well as the historic 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion. It also condemned the Equal Rights Amendment and gay rights.
The Moral Majority boosted the Republican Party’s chances of winning the presidency by reaching out to Americans who had traditionally not participated in the political process. With other groups like it, the Moral Majority registered at least 2 million new voters before the 1980 presidential election. One of their tactics was to distribute Moral Majority “report cards” on candidates, which almost always favored Republicans.
Changing Demographic Patterns Boost Conservatism Demographic, or population, trends also strengthened the conservative movement. Historically, northern cities stood as strongholds of liberal Democrats. When an increasing number of Americans moved to the suburbs, their attachment to liberalism waned as they struggled financially during the tough economic days of the late 1970s. At the same time, Republicans emphasized issues that they believed would convince moderate liberals to switch their party allegiance. For instance, Republicans attacked school busing as a form of social engineering that threatened the long-cherished ideal of neighborhood schools.
Republicans benefited from the migration of Americans from the Rust Belt to the Sunbelt. This demographic shift, which began in the 1950s and continued through the 1970s, had many causes, including the sunny climate and opportunities for jobs in aerospace, technology, and other growing industries. Republicans also benefited from a historical realignment of white voters in the Deep South. Since the Civil War, most white southerners had voted for the Democratic Party.
Following the enactment of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, however, many white southerners began to shift their party allegiance. The effect of these shifts in demographics and voter loyalties was that by the 1980s, the Republicans had become the dominant political party in the South.
RECALL
Why did the Moral Majority oppose the 1962 Supreme Court Engel v. Vitale decision?
» Ronald Reagan, shown here in a 1951 Hollywood studio shot, originally supported New Deal policies. He later became a conservative, believing that Americans should oppose the expansion of the federal government.
A
Conservative Wins the White House The growing conservative movement swept the Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, to victory in the 1980 election. Much more charismatic and polished than Goldwater, Reagan made clear his opposition to big government, his support for a strong military, and his faith in traditional values. Just as importantly, he radiated optimism, convincing Americans that he would usher in a new era of prosperity and patriotism.
Reagan’s Path to the Presidency Born in Tampico, Illinois, in 1911, Reagan suffered the hardships of the Great Depression as a young adult before landing a job in Hollywood as a movie actor. Never a big star, Reagan appeared in many “B” or low-budget films. His most famous starring role was in Knute Rockne, a film based on the life of Notre Dame’s legendary football coach.
When his acting career began to wane, Reagan became a spokesperson for General Electric and toured the nation giving speeches. Although once a staunch New Dealer, Reagan had become a Goldwater conservative. In these speeches he began to criticize big government and high taxes and warned of the
America in the 1980s and 1990s	641 H-l The Conservative Movement Surges
dangers of communism. In 1964, near the end of Goldwater's presidential campaign, Reagan delivered a nationally televised address in which he spelled out these views:
“This is the issue of this election, whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.”
—Ronald Reagan, “A Time for Choosing,” 1964
While the speech failed to bolster Goldwater’s campaign, it won the admiration of many conservatives. Two years later, Reagan won the governorship of California. He served for two terms as governor and nearly won the Republican presidential nomination in 1976. In 1980, he won the nomination by a landslide. His opponent was Jimmy Carter, the Democratic incumbent.
inflation, the Iran hostage crisis, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan made it easy for Reagan to cast the Carter presidency in a negative light. “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” Reagan asked audiences on the campaign trail, knowing that most Americans would answer, “No.”
The race remained relatively close until about one week before the election, when Reagan and Carter held their only presidential debate. In this debate, Reagan’s gifts as a communicator shone. He appeared friendly and even-tempered and calmed fears that he did not have enough experience to serve as president. On Election Day, Reagan won 50.7 percent of the popular vote. Because most states award electoral votes on a “winner-takes-all” basis, Reagan won an overwhelming majority of electoral college votes despite the narrow margin by which he won the popular vote. Even though the Democrats maintained control of the House of Representatives, Republicans captured the U.S. Senate for the first time since 1955. The conservatives were back.

A
New Direction for the American Economy Tax Cuts and Deregulation Reagan and his advisors based their economic policies on the theory of “supply-side economics,” sometimes called "Reaganomics.” The theory of supply-side economics rests on the assumption that if taxes are reduced, the wealthy would invest more and thus create jobs.
The new jobs would give people more money to spend, causing the economy to grow. The government will then collect more in taxes. To cut taxes while still balancing the federal budget, however, Reagan also needed to reduce federal spending on programs favored by both Democrats and Republicans.
Congress approved most of Reagan’s plan to institute supply-side economics by passing the Economic Recovery Act of 1981, which reduced taxes by 23 percent over three years. The richest Americans received the largest tax cuts. Reagan justified this move by saying that the wealthy would use the money they saved to invest in new businesses, which would help everyone. Reagan also convinced Congress to cut about $40 billion from the federal budget, mostly by cutting spending for social programs.

In addition to cutting taxes, Reagan also reduced the government’s role in the economy by calling for deregulation, or the removal of government control over industry. By the mid-1980s, Congress had deregulated the airline, telecommunications, and banking industries. The Reagan administration also cut funding for federal agencies that oversaw many other industries.
Significant Societal Issues Shortly after Reagan took office, the economy experienced a severe recession from 1980 to 1982. Unemployment rose to more than 10 percent in 1982. The recession hit blue-collar workers particularly hard. Many farmers, facing overseas competition, lost their farms. The policies that Paul Volcker, as head of the Federal Reserve Board, had introduced to tame the great inflation of the 1970s contributed to the recession in the early 1980s. Beginning in early 1983, however, the economy began to turn around. Inflation fell dramatically. The Gross National Product, or the annual income earned by Americans and American businesses, expanded at a healthy pace. America's economy seemed revitalized.
Despite this, the number of poor people, including the working poor, actually increased. In addition, immigrants from Latin America and Asia, attracted by employment prospects and political freedom, continued to pour into the United States. Among the
Asian immigrants were the Sikhs, a religious group that originated in the Punjab, a region in Pakistan and northern India. In the 1980s, more than 7.3 million legal immigrants and hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants entered the country. Many of these newcomers worked in low-paying jobs and struggled to make ends meet. Meanwhile, the richest Americans grew richer.
In Texas, tensions from this economic disparity reached a head in 1984 when a poor, largely Mexican American school system sued the state commissioner of education over inequalities in the education of minorities. After a nearly 10-year struggle, the case, Edgewood I.S.D. v. Kirby, led to a school funding system where some tax money from more affluent, largely white school districts was transferred to less affluent, largely minority districts to help these poor districts provide better education to their students.
Problems With Deficits Reagan increased defense spending but failed to win the huge cuts in government spending that he wanted in other areas. These were some of the factors, along with a recession, that caused the federal budget deficit, or the shortfall between the amount of money spent and the amount taken in by the government, to skyrocket from about $79 billion in 1981 to more than $221 billion in 1986. The national debt,

the amount of money the federal government owes to owners of government bonds, rose to $2.5 trillion.
In response to persistent budget deficits, Congress passed the Gramm Rudman-Hollings Act in 1985. The act sought to balance the budget by 1990 by requiring automatic cuts in federal spending if the deficit exceeded a certain amount. The federal budget deficit set new records, however, into the early 1990s.
The Savings and Loan crisis (also called the S&L crisis) in 1989 exacerbated deficit problems. In the late 1980s, about 1,000 Savings and Loan banks failed, some because of fraudulent behavior and others because they made too many risky loans. Critics blamed Reagan’s deregulation policies for encouraging the banks to invest in riskier propositions. To prevent a broader panic, the federal government spent upwards of $200 billion to bail out depositors at the failed banks.
In the 1980s, the rising cost of Social Security also caused concern. As the number of elderly people in America grew, the Social Security system began to collect less money than it paid out. In 1983, Reagan signed the Social Security Reform Act, which raised the minimum retirement age and increased payroll taxes for Social Security. It provided a temporary fix but did not solve the long-term problems of the Social Security program.
Trade Imbalance With Japan Another deficit that alarmed Americans was the nation’s growing
imbalance in world trade. American exports had been falling steadily since the 1970s due to a decline in domestic automobile, electronics, and other manufacturing industries.
Japan began to dominate the American market in televisions, automobiles, and other consumer products. At the same time, Japan’s markets remained closed to many American-made goods.
When Japan refused to ease its restrictions on American imports, Reagan placed a tariff on Japanese electronics that doubled their price in American stores. Japanese trade restrictions eased in a deal to get this tariff removed. However, the United States continued to import many more Japanese products than American companies were able to sell in Japan.
Reagan and Organized Labor In 1981 when thousands of air-traffic controllers went on strike, Reagan refused to negotiate with the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) and fired the striking workers because they were violating a law forbidding federal employees from striking. Many Americans admired Reagan's strong, decisive stance. Some union supporters, however, claimed that Reagan’s action represented an assault on the labor movement.
The PATCO strike marked a turning point for organized labor. As the nation became more conservative, anti-union feelings grew. By 1980, the labor movement was already shrinking from its high

levels of memberhip in the 1950s and 1960s. After the PATCO strike’s highly visible failure, however, the decline became more rapid. Reagan's actions also signaled that it was acceptable for businesses to get tough with unions.
The Private Sector Creates Economic Opportunities Reagan believed that volunteerism and private initiative could create economic opportunities for citizens. In 1981, he praised an organization called the Clearinghouse on Corporate Social Responsibility for their work in improving Americans’ quality of life. The Clearinghouse had evolved from the committee of insurance company CEOs who had first met in response to the urban riots of the late 1960s. One of the unintended consequences of this meeting was that by 1981, the organization had expanded to include life and health insurance trade associations. It actively supported community projects, employment of women and minorities, environment and energy conservation, and socially responsible investments. In 1982 it changed its name to the Center for Corporate Public Involvement.
B IDENTIFY MAIN IDEAS
What is the central theory of Reaganomics, or supply-side economics?
Conservative Momentum Continues
Despite budget and debt problems, the economic recovery improved the national mood and helped Ronald Reagan’s popularity. Reagan used his time in office to strengthen the conservative cause. Private conservative educational and research groups, such as Washington D.C.’s Heritage Foundation, supported Reagan and lobbied Congress on behalf of his programs.
Winning a Second Term During his 1984 campaign for reelection, President Reagan used the phrase “It is morning in America” as a campaign slogan:
“It’s morning again in America. In a town not too far from where you live, a young family has just moved into a new home. . . . Right down the street, one of the neighbors has just bought himself a new car with all the options. The factory down the river is working again. . . . Life is better, America is

back. And people have a sense of pride
they never felt they’d feel again.”
—Campaign commercial for the reelection of Ronald Reagan, 1984
This theme dovetailed nicely with Reagan’s upbeat spirit, which he displayed even in his darkest moments. For example, on March 30, 1981, a disturbed man named John Hinckley, Jr., tried to assassinate the president. One bullet from Hinckley’s gun lodged in Reagan’s chest. According to one account, Reagan joked to his doctors, “I hope you are all Republicans.”
Americans voted overwhelmingly to reelect Reagan in 1984. He easily defeated Walter Mondale, the Democratic presidential nominee, and his running mate, Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to be nominated for vice president by a major political party. However, Reagan’s momentum did not lead to a total triumph for conservatives, as Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives.
Creating Conservative Courts During his two terms, Reagan appointed judges who he hoped would reverse the liberal drift of the federal courts. He appointed three new Justices — Sandra Day O’Connor, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony Kennedy—to the Supreme Court and elevated William Rehnquist, a well-

known conservative, to the position of Chief Justice in 1986. Sandra Day O’Connor, nominated in 1981, was the first female Justice and a moderate conservative. Although she voted with other conservatives on many issues, she consistently voted to uphold Roe v. Wade, which Reagan opposed.
Near the end of Reagan’s first term, Congress passed the Equal Access Act. This act required public secondary schools to allow any group equal access to school facilities. Conservative Christian groups supported the act’s passage because many public schools did not allow religious groups to meet on school property. The Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Equal Access Act in 1990 in Board of Education of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens.
George H.W. Bush Becomes President Reagan used his personal popularity to promote George H.W. Bush, his Vice President for eight years, as Bush campaigned for the presidency against Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis in 1988. Bush had enjoyed a long and distinguished political career. He had served the nation in many ways: as a member of Congress from Texas, ambassador to the United Nations under Nixon, American envoy to China under Ford, and head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Despite these impressive credentials, Bush lacked the support of conservatives in the Republican Party, who questioned his commitment to their cause.
Although Bush called for a “kinder, gentler nation” in his campaign, both candidates attacked each other in negative campaign ads. Bush cemented his support among conservatives by promising not to raise taxes and by casting himself as a defender of traditional values. Although Bush defeated Dukakis in the presidential election, Democrats won a majority of seats in both houses of Congress.
President Bush sought to control federal spending by encouraging Americans to volunteer. Government, he asserted, could take a smaller role in daily life if, “like a thousand points of light,” community organizations and volunteers provided more help to the disabled, illiterate, and poor.
When Congress passed the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) in July 1990, Bush signed it into law. The act ensured that persons with disabilities would receive the same opportunities in employment as well as access to public places and transportation that other Americans took for granted. It benefited

more than 43 million people and represented another step in the quest to protect the rights of all Americans.
B CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Did President Reagan’s appointees to the Supreme Court follow his conservative agenda in full? Explain.
Culture, Challenge, and Change
Despite Reagan’s vision of “morning in America” and Bush’s “thousand points of light,” in truth a great cultural and economic divide existed in 1980s society—a division partially defined by race, ethnicity, and gender. The economic recovery of the mid-1980s did not affect all segments of society equally. As the number of poor increased, so did violence and drug use in the nation’s inner cities. At the same time, a culture of acquisition intensified among Americans.
Material Culture in the 1980s “I am a material girl,” sang Madonna in her 1985 hit. For many Americans, her anthem to acquiring things characterized the decade.
Material acquisition especially defined a segment of society that came to be known as young urban professionals, or “yuppies”—Americans born in the baby boom that followed World War II and who made $40,000 a year or more in the 1980s. Because there were so many people in this demographic, their spending habits were noticed and often criticized by the media. Yuppies were characterized by their attachment to flashy cars and other possessions and for their obsession with making and spending money.
Another trend of the 1980s was a new obsession with physical fitness. Being “fit,” however, meant more than just being healthy. It also meant looking good. Americans spent more than ever before on diet drinks and vitamins, sportswear, health club memberships, and home fitness videos and equipment. Some large companies, recognizing that healthy employees were more productive, opened in-house fitness facilities. They also sponsored programs and provided other incentives to help their employees get healthier. By the mid-1980s, nearly half of Americans exercised daily, compared to just 24 percent 20 years earlier. Critics observed that these trends embodied the materialistic values of the 1980s. They complained that instead of trying to improve society, Americans were focused on improving themselves both physically and financially.
The Space Program in the 1980s The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) added

a new type of spacecraft to its fleet in 1981. Unlike rockets that fell to earth and were discarded after a single use, the new space shuttle looked and landed like an airplane. It could take off again and again to complete multiple missions.
The promising shuttle program suffered a disastrous setback in January 1986, however, when the space shuttle Challenger exploded in midair less than 2 minutes after takeoff from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Its entire crew of seven astronauts was killed. The crew included New Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, the first private citizen to go into space. The explosion halted NASA’s shuttle program for two years while scientists worked to eliminate technical problems. Nevertheless, space program technology continued to inspire many products—such as improved radial tires, the portable cordless vacuum cleaner, and better firefighting gear—that improved Americans’ quality of life.
Cold War Culture in the 1980s The ongoing Cold War also shaped the 1980s culture in the United States. The Olympic Games were held in Los Angeles in 1984. It was the first time the summer Olympics had come to this country in nearly 50 years. The festive opening

ceremonies typified the Reagan era’s emphasis on the renewal of America’s greatness and patriotism.
The Olympics became a tool in the nation’s Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union. Along with most other communist countries, the Soviet Union boycotted the Los Angeles games. The Soviet-led boycott was in retaliation for President Carter’s boycott of the 1980 games in Moscow to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The United States won an unusually high number of medals at the Los Angeles games, an outcome that contributed to the Reagan era's sense of a revival in American strength and patriotism.
Confronting Challenging Issues at Home One of
the most troubling problems the nation faced in the 1980s was a dramatic increase in the use of illegal drugs. The main culprit in this increasing drug use was the spread of cocaine. Once a problem largely confined to crime-infested areas of the nation’s inner cities, cocaine use became much more widespread among other classes of American society during this time.
Reformers called for stopping the seemingly unrestricted flow of drugs into the United States and for harsher penalties for drug dealers. President Reagan responded by enlisting the Army and Navy to help stop the cocaine smuggling route into south Florida. The effort was successful. But by 1985, drug smugglers had shifted their operations to the U.S. border with Mexico. In 1986, Congress made the possession of drugs for sale an offense punishable by a minimum of 10 years in prison.
Many Americans also worried about the state of America’s public education system. In 1983, the Department of Education issued A Nation at Risk. This study showed that students were consistently scoring lower on standardized tests as time passed. The report argued that America’s schools failed to prepare students adequately to compete with students around the globe.
Even before the report appeared, conservatives called for providing vouchers, or government checks, that could be used by parents to pay tuition at private schools. Conservatives argued that vouchers would force public schools to improve in order to attract and retain students. Liberals in Congress argued that vouchers would take much-needed money away from public schools.
In addition, the nation faced the threat of a new disease, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which first came to doctors’ attention in 1981. AIDS is the last stage of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which attacks the immune system of its victims. There is no known cure. When AIDS first

reached the United States, it spread mainly among homosexual men and intravenous drug users. Later, the virus began infecting various other groups of people. By 1994, AIDS had killed more than 250,000 Americans.
President Reagan was criticized for the government’s lack of response to the AIDS epidemic. Congress consistently felt that Reagan’s requests for funds to battle the epidemic were too low and nearly doubled the money earmarked for AIDS research and education.
Meanwhile, AIDS activist groups demonstrated throughout the country. In Washington, D.C., they unveiled a memorial quilt containing the names of some 2000 people who had died of AIDS. But not until George H.W. Bush’s presidency did funding for research on the disease rise substantially.
The attempt on Reagan’s life in a 1981 shooting and the serious wounding of his aide, James Brady, renewed calls for stronger controls on handguns. These efforts were opposed by the National Rifle Association (NRA), led by Harlon Carter, which casted itself as the defender of Americans’ Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. In spite of the efforts of this powerful conservative group, attempts in the 1980s to ban armor-piercing bullets and plastic handguns that could get by airport metal detectors were eventually passed by Congress.

President Ronald Reagan believed that the United States had lost its way in the wake of the Vietnam War. Rather than detente, he felt the United States should seek to roll back Soviet rule in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. Reagan believed that peace would come through strength. Although Reagan’s foreign policies initially increased tension between the two superpowers, they contributed to the end of the Cold War.
The Cold War Ends
Reagan Leads with “Peace
Through Strength”
President Reagan believed that the United States needed to weaken communism by challenging it as much as possible without provoking war. To this end, he devised policies aimed at toppling communist nations, ranging from building new nuclear missile systems to funding covert operations against Soviet troops and allies around the globe.
Reagan Decides on U.S. Military BuildupUnder Reagan, the United States committed itself to the largest peacetime military buildup in its history. Reagan dedicated billions of dollars to the development and production of B-l and B-2 bombers, MX missile systems, and other projects. In spite of massive protests by the nuclear freeze movement in the United States and abroad, the Reagan administration placed a new generation of nuclear missiles in Europe.
Reagan supported this massive military buildup, in part, because he did not believe that the Soviet Union could afford to spend as much on defense as the United States could. Reagan felt this applied particularly to the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a proposed program in which land and space-based lasers would destroy any missiles aimed at the United States before they could reach their targets. Some dubbed the missile program “Star Wars,” after the

popular science-fiction movie trilogy, and claimed that it was unrealistic.
Reagan Involves the U.S. in the Middle East and Central America Reagan also sought to weaken the Soviet Union by supporting anticommunist rebellions around the globe. To this end, the United States funded and trained the mujahadeen (moo jah huh deen), anti-Soviet rebels in Afghanistan. Reagan’s advisors believed that with U.S. help, these guerrillas could drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan. In 1988, Soviet forces finally began to withdraw after years of fierce Afghan resistance.
Closer to home, Secretary of State Alexander Haig feared that the newly formed Sandinista government in Nicaragua provided the Soviets with a “safe house” in America’s backyard. To counter this threat, the administration backed a group of anticommunist counterrevolutionaries, known as the Contras. At the same time, the United States supported a right-wing government in El Salvador that was battling leftist rebels.
Many human rights activists strongly objected to this policy; even U.S. Ambassador Robert White described the legal system in El Salvador as “rotten” and called for the United States to suspend aid to the nation. Instead, Congress made funding for El Salvador’s
government dependent on the nation making progress on human rights.
In 1983, Reagan acted to counter another perceived threat in the Western Hemisphere. Members of a radical leftist movement, with some help from Cuba, had violently ousted the Grenadian prime minister. On October 25,1983, U.S. troops invaded Grenada to prevent the island nation from becoming a communist outpost and to protect the lives of American medical students. Even though the legal grounds for this invasion proved questionable, most Americans approved of Reagan’s decision.
Economic Pressures Force Gorbachev to Pursue Reforms In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev (mee kah eel GOR buh chawf) became the president of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev ushered in a new Soviet era by pursuing the twin policies of glasnost and perestroika. Glasnost means “a new openness,” and perestroika refers to reforming the Soviet system—for instance, by moving away from a socialist, or state-controlled, economy. Gorbachev’s reforms created an opening for a shift in relations between the two superpowers. Gorbachev started these reforms mostly because the Soviet Union’s economy had fundamentally failed. The nation faced regular shortages of food. Its factories and workers could not compete with their Western counterparts. A huge chunk of the Soviet economy’s

money went toward paying for the military. The war in Afghanistan had drained Soviet resources. Gorbachev realized that his nation could not match the military buildup initiated by the Reagan administration.
Reagan and Gorbachev Reevaluate Their Positions Gorbachev’s policies and personality helped soften the Soviet Union’s international image. Reagan responded to this change by moderating his own stance toward the Soviet Union. While the two nations had held no summits during Reagan’s first four years in office, their leaders met four times between 1985 and 1989.
During their final meeting in Moscow, Reagan and Gorbachev toasted each other at a state dinner, toured the sights like old friends, and held a joint press conference. At the press conference, a reporter asked Reagan about his description of the Soviet Union as an “evil empire.” Reagan responded, “I was talking about another era.” Then, Gorbachev allowed President Reagan to address students at Moscow State University on the benefits of the free-enterprise system and democracy:
“Your generation is living in one of the most exciting times in Soviet

history. It is a time when the first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart beats to the accelerated rhythm of hope, when the accumulated spiritual energies of a long silence yearn to break free. . . . We do not know what the conclusion of this journey will be, but we’re hopeful that the promise of reform will be fulfilled . . . leading to a new world of reconciliation, friendship, and peace,”
—Ronald Reagan, May 31, 1988
Even before this summit, the two nations had signed a historic nuclear arms pact and had begun negotiations on the START I Treaty, which would reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world.
H CHECK UNDERSTANDING
Aside from his overall idea of “peace through strength,” what other motivation did Reagan have for his massive military spending?
Impact of the End of the Cold War
1991 was a turning point in American and world history. In a little over three years’ time after Reagan’s speech in Moscow, the Cold War had come to an end. The Berlin Wall came down; Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary held democratic elections; and the Soviet Union disintegrated into numerous separate republics. Time magazine observed: “It was one of those rare times when the tectonic plates of history shift beneath men’s feet, and nothing after is quite the same.”
Communist Governments Fall in Eastern Europe
More so than any other event, the fall of the Berlin Wall symbolized the end of communism in Europe. For decades, the wall had blocked travel from communist East Berlin to democratic West Berlin. Guards shot those who attempted to escape over the wall to West Berlin. Then, in November 1989, following the fall of East Germany’s communist government, East German authorities opened the wall’s gates.
Thousands climbed atop the wall; some even took sledgehammers and chipped away at the barricade. Within a year, East and West Germany would reunite as one single nation. Communists also lost power in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and

The Soviet Union Disintegrates In August 1991, hard-liners in the Soviet Union attempted to stage a coup in a last-gasp attempt to maintain communist rule. But when millions of Russians, led by Boris Yeltsin, rallied in the streets of Moscow in support of Gorbachev, the coup fell apart. Not long afterward, the Communist Party lost power, and the Soviet Union separated into 15 independent republics. Boris Yeltsin became the new leader of the largest new republic, the Russian Federation.
Historians do not totally agree on what caused the Soviet Union to collapse. Most acknowledge that Gorbachev’s policy of glasnost opened the floodgates to rebellions against Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. Likewise, they note that his policy of perestroika fostered a challenge to communist rule within the Soviet Union.
Yet, a number of scholars give Reagan credit for bringing an end to the Cold War. By dedicating America to a massive arms buildup, they argue, he hastened the collapse of the Soviet economy. In turn, this compelled Gorbachev to promote reform at home and relinquish control of Eastern Europe.
The key rival, competitor, and enemy of the United States for so many years had suddenly disappeared.
President George H.W. Bush met and signed agreements with first Gorbachev and then Yeltsin to scale down and even eliminate certain types of nuclear weapons. Bush and Yeltsin issued a joint statement in 1992 pledging friendship and cooperation. The long Cold War, which had absorbed so much of the energy and resources of the Soviet Union and the United States since 1945, was finally over.

(moo uh mahr al kuh dah fee), whom Reagan described as the “mad dog of the Middle East."
U.S.-Libya relations fell apart as American leaders became increasingly frustrated with Qaddafi’s support of terrorist groups. In response, the United States placed economic sanctions on Libya.
In April 1986, following a terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub, which Reagan blamed on Qaddafi, U.S. warplanes bombed Libya. Although Qaddafi survived unharmed, the air raid killed one of his family members. In the period following the attack, Qaddafi’s criticism of the United States dwindled. Tensions between the countries continued through the early 1990s, though, as U.S. leaders suspected the Qaddafi regime of producing chemical weapons.
Reagan Sends Marines Into Lebanon Even as the Soviet Union collapsed and conflicts with Libya ignited, the United States faced additional problems in the Middle East. In 1982, Reagan sent a group of 800 United States Marines to Lebanon as part of an international force trying to bring peace to that nation, which was torn by civil war.
On October 23,1983, a truck loaded with thousands of pounds of explosives smashed through barriers at the headquarters of the United States Marines in Beirut (bay root), Lebanon's capital, and into a four-story building that housed hundreds of military personnel. The explosion killed 241 marines. Reagan withdrew the remaining marines in February 1984. The incident illustrated, once again, the complicated and dangerous nature of Middle Eastern politics.
The Iran-Contra Affair Shakes the Presidency
Reagan's presidency started with a breakthrough in the Middle East. Twenty minutes after he took the oath of office on January 20, 1981, Iran released all 52 Americans it had held hostage since 1979. But during his second term, the Iran-Contra affair tarnished Reagan’s reputation.
The Iran-Contra affair began when the United States sold weapons to Iran in 1985 in exchange for Iran’s promise to pressure terrorist groups in Lebanon to release some American hostages. The plan didn’t work, and it contradicted the administration's policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists.
Then, the administration used the money from the sale to fund the Contras in Nicaragua, despite the fact that in 1983 Congress had banned sending funds to the Contras. News of these deals became public in 1986. Although President Reagan accepted responsibility for the actions of his administration, he never admitted to ordering his aides to support the Contras. Ultimately several leading administration officials and a top aide,

Oliver North, were convicted on charges stemming from the scandal, although many of the convictions were later overturned on technical grounds. In spite of this, Reagan left office with high approval ratings.

New Era in Foreign Policy Bush Forges a New Role in the World
When the Soviet Union collapsed, the United States became an unopposed superpower—poised to take a leading role in world affairs under the leadership of President George H.W. Bush. Few leaders entered the White House with as much foreign policy experience as Bush. A graduate of Yale and a veteran of World War II, Bush had served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, as director of the CIA, and as Ronald Reagan’s vice president. His experience would be put to the test as the United States faced a series of difficult international crises during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Political Changes and the War on Drugs in Latin America In
the late 1980s and early 1990s, Latin America experienced a wave of democracy. In Central America, a peace plan devised by Costa Rican leader Oscar Arias (ah ree uhs) brought free elections in Nicaragua and the end of a long civil war in El Salvador. In Chile, the notorious military dictator Augusto Pinochet (ah GOO stoh pee noh shay) gave up power.

Not all developments in Latin America, however, pleased the Bush administration. Since the Nixon administration, the government had been waging a "war on drugs,” or an attempt to stop illegal drug use by going after both sellers and users. Groups of racketeers in Latin America supplied a significant amount of the illegal drugs in the United States. The Bush administration arrested and tried several international drug figures, including Eduardo Martinez Romero, the reputed financier of a Colombian drug cartel.
Even more spectacularly, in December 1989, Bush sent more than 12,000 U.S. troops to invade Panama and arrest Panama’s military strongman Manuel Noriega. Brought to the United States for trial, Noriega was convicted of several charges of drug trafficking and sentenced to 40 years in prison.
China Resists Calls for Democracy Meanwhile, in the spring of 1989, Chinese students captured the world’s attention by staging pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing. Many Americans hoped that these protests might result in the fall of communism in China. Instead, on June 4, Chinese tanks rolled into Beijing, killed hundreds of protesters, crushed the demonstrations, and imprisoned many pro-democracy activists.
The Bush administration condemned this action and suspended arms sales to China. However, Bush did not believe that stiffer penalties would influence Chinese leaders. He made the pragmatic choice to remain engaged with China economically and diplomatically, rather than cut off ties with the country.
Pressures Force Changes in South Africa
While China resisted changes, long overdue ones were taking place in South Africa. For years, the South African government, controlled by whites, had maintained an oppressive system of rigid segregation known as apartheid. The leader of the antiapartheid movement, Nelson Mandela (man dehl uh), had been imprisoned since 1962. In the late 1980s, protests against apartheid within South Africa and around the globe grew. In the United States, many private firms divested, or withdrew investments, from South Africa. Congress imposed economic sanctions instead of fully divesting, not wanting to destabilize the struggling nation. President Bush met with Mandela after his release from jail in 1990 and endorsed the drive to bring democracy to South Africa. Soon after, apartheid began to be dismantled, and in 1994, South Africans elected Mandela as their leader in their first free elections.

New Era in Foreign Policy disintegrated into a bloody civil war. During this new crisis in the Balkans, Bush chose not to send troops because he feared that the tangled conflict could embroil the United States in another Vietnam. Not until 1992, however, did he back a modest UN plan to restore peace in Bosnia, one of the new republics carved out of Yugoslavia. By then, more than 150,000 civilians had died.
The Bush administration acted more swiftly to protect human rights in Somalia. As part of “Operation Restore Hope,” United States Marines landed in this East African nation in December 1992 to help establish a cease-fire between rival warlords and to deliver food to hundreds of thousands of starving people. The American humanitarian mission reinforced UN efforts at peacekeeping and relief. Even some of Bush’s most persistent critics applauded his decision to intervene in Somalia.

» Hypothesize Why was Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 considered such a threat by so many nations?
The Persian Gulf War
The most important foreign-policy challenge faced by the Bush administration took place in the Persian Gulf. On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded its tiny neighbor Kuwait. Nearly 150,000 Iraqi troops quickly overran Kuwaiti forces.
A
Dictator’s Thirst for Power Leads to War Saddam Hussein, Iraq’s ruthless dictator, had run the Middle Eastern nation with an iron fist since 1979. By invading Kuwait, Hussein sought to take over Kuwait’s rich oil deposits. With Kuwait in his power, Hussein would control nearly 20 percent of the oil produced around the world. The United States feared how Hussein would use the influence that controlling such a large amount of oil would give him. In addition, nearby Saudi Arabia possessed even greater oil reserves. The United States did not want Hussein to seek to gain control of those reserves next. Oil drove much of the world’s economies, including America’s. In 1970, the United States consumed around 14 million barrels of oil each day. By 1990, that number had increased to 17 million barrels a day.
President Bush made it clear that he would not tolerate Iraq’s aggression against its neighbor. He worked to build an international coalition and backed a UN resolution demanding that Iraqi troops withdraw.
U.S.
Spearheads Operation Desert Storm By late fall, about 700,000 troops had assembled in Saudi Arabia, including nearly 500,000 American forces. Britain, France, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, among others, also sent troops. Other nations, for example Japan, agreed to help pay for the costs of the operation. Initially, Bush hoped that the presence of these troops, along with the economic sanctions against Iraq, would convince Hussein to withdraw his soldiers. At the same time, the president asked for and received from Congress the authority to use force, if necessary, to back up the UN’s resolution that Iraq leave Kuwait.
Operation Desert Storm, the name given to the American-led attack on Iraqi forces, began on January 16, 1991. General Colin Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Norman Schwarzkopf devised and executed a strategy that began with five weeks of devastating aerial bombardment on Iraqi forces. Iraq countered by launching Scud missiles on both coalition forces and Israel. Although these missiles did little serious damage, they struck terror in the hearts of many who feared they were armed with chemical warheads.

Iraqi troops surrendered or fled, setting fire to Kuwaiti oil rigs along the way. Less than five days after the ground war began, Iraq agreed to a UN-brokered cease-fire. It had lost an estimated 25,000 soldiers. American deaths totaled 148. "We’ve kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all,” proclaimed Bush. He then chose to limit American actions to enforcing the UN resolution. The coalition’s forces would compel Iraq to leave Kuwait but would not continue on to Baghdad, Iraq’s capital, to topple Saddam Hussein. As a result, Hussein and his regime survived the war. Bush’s public approval rating skyrocketed.
The United States remained in the region to help Iraqi refugees, establishing no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq. However, Saddam Hussein and his supporters resented the U.S. presence. During Operation Desert Storm, similar resentment toward U.S. forces also grew in Saudi Arabia, where many troops were stationed. This resentment may have helped attract new recruits to the anti-American propaganda of the terrorist organization al Qaeda.
H DRAW CONCLUSIONS
Why did Saddam Hussein’s regime survive the war?
Clinton Wins the 1992 Election
After the 1991 Persian Gulf War ended, President George H.W. Bush's approval rating reached 91 percent. In less than one year, however, public opinion had changed. Saddam Hussein had stayed in power, continuing to threaten peace in the Middle East. The American economy had gone into recession and the federal deficit had risen. People were angered by Bush’s betrayal of his 1988 campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bush's sinking popularity opened up the way for the Democratic challenge.
“New Democrats” Emerge The Democrats nominated William Jefferson Clinton, governor of Arkansas, as their presidential candidate. Clinton was born in 1946 into a humble home and had worked his way through college and law school before being elected governor of Arkansas in 1978. To widen his appeal and distance himself from the stereotype of “tax and spend” liberals, Clinton promoted himself as a “New Democrat.” New Democrats were centrists who sought to reconcile liberal and conservative ideals. They believed in strong national defense, tough stands on crime, free trade, welfare reform, and closer ties with corporations. They believed that government was necessary and important but that it had grown large

New Era in Foreign Policy and inefficient. Clinton’s centrist position attracted conservative and liberal Democrats as well as moderate Republicans. His position as a moderate, practical Democrat had broad appeal for a wide range of voters.
Winning the White House By 1992, Clinton was poised to capitalize on Bush’s political problems. He entered the presidential race along with Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot, who led a self-funded independent party and promised to govern by sound business principles. Ross Perot, a self-made billionaire, built his campaign on economic populism and an appeal to Americans dissatisfied with the traditional two-party political system.
Clinton’s campaign focused on economic and social opportunity. Clinton charged that Bush’s economic policies had made the rich richer. He also pointed out that, unlike Bush, he came from a family that had struggled through hard times and knew what it was like to worry about paying bills. Bush responded by attacking Clinton’s character. Republicans accused the governor of draft-dodging, marital infidelity, and other moral laxities. Bush also suggested that Clinton and his vice presidential candidate, A1 Gore, were too inexperienced to lead the nation. Unlike his opponents, Perot opposed free-trade agreements with Mexico and Canada and stressed the importance of eliminating the U.S. government’s budget deficit and national debt.
In the end, Clinton’s message carried the election. In the largest voter turnout since 1960, more than 100 million Americans turned out at the polls. Clinton received 43 percent of the popular vote to Bush’s 37 percent and Perot’s 19 percent. Democrats also retained control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Although Perot and his third party did not win any electoral votes, he garnered nearly 20 million votes. Some historians think Perot’s presence on the ballot may have cost Bush the election by attracting voters who otherwise would have voted for the Republican candidate.

Clinton Intervenes With Mixed Success

The United States needed to develop a role for itself in the post-Cold War world. Americans were willing to provide economic aid, as they did to nations of the former Soviet Union. But many of them questioned military intervention abroad, fearing a costly commitment like the Vietnam War.

U.S.
Intervention in Somalia and Haiti In the late 1980s, civil war broke out in Somalia. By 1991, the government had disintegrated and the fighting had caused widespread famine. In 1992, the United States led a multinational force, later joined by the UN, to bring about peace and distribute food. The coalition fell apart in 1994 when several countries, including the United States, suffered steep casualty rates and withdrew their troops. Eventually, the UN also withdrew, and civil war dragged on for several more years in the devastated country.
Meanwhile, conflict was simmering in Haiti. In 1990, Haitians brought Jean Bertrand Aristide to the presidency, in the nation's first free elections. Less than a year later, a military coup overthrew Aristide, plunging the country into turmoil. Thousands of Haitians left the country by boat to immigrate to the United States as political refugees. Many were sent back by American immigration officials, causing a public outcry. In 1994, Clinton sent American troops to Haiti to restore Aristide to power. Although American action improved the situation, within a decade Haiti faced a sinking economy and rising rates of disease and crime.
U.S.
Involvement in the Balkans Crisis In the Balkans, the collapse of communism broke up the country of Yugoslavia. For decades, the communist leader Josip Broz Tito had contained ethnic and religious strife.
But his death in 1980, and the collapse of communism in 1989, left the country with no unifying forces. Soon, four of Yugoslavia’s six major republics broke away and became independent nations, and long-suppressed ethnic and religious hostilities came boiling to the surface.
In newly independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, ethnic and religious rivalries among Eastern Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats, and Bosnian Muslims eventually led to civil war. Serbs, with the help of Serbia-dominated Yugoslavia, attacked Bosnians and Croats. In many cases, they forcibly removed Bosnians and Croats from their homes and later murdered them. This state-sanctioned mass murder, violence, and rape, known as ethnic cleansing, shocked the world. The UN intervened with humanitarian aid. Yet atrocities continued on all sides of the struggle, and years went by before the world community intervened to stop the slaughter.
Clinton Galvanizes NATO Forces Finally in the late summer of 1995, Clinton encouraged NATO to bomb Serbian strongholds. This was the first time
America in the 1980s and 1990s	663	11.4 A New Era in Foreign Policy
the organization had gone into combat, and its use of force quickly brought about a cease-fire. In December 1995, the Dayton Accords established a federated, multinational Bosnia. Although the ethnic cleansing had ended, the enforced peace had not solved the problems of the region. In 1998, violence flared up anew—this time in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia that borders on Albania. The fighting once again involved ethnic cleansing and also spread to the neighboring countries of Macedonia and Albania. NATO forced Serbs to withdraw from Kosovo.
The Rwanda Genocide As ethnic hatred led to atrocities in the Balkans, mass murder was also underway far to the south in the African nation of Rwanda. Between April and July of 1994, Rwanda’s majority Hutu population committed genocide as they exterminated more than 800,000 members of the Tutsi population. The bloodbath in turn forced 2,000,000 people to flee Rwanda, creating a major humanitarian crisis. The UN was unable to bring about a cease-fire, and President Clinton and other world leaders were criticized for their silence on this tragedy. Eventually, Tutsi-led forces gained ground and established a
government of national unity, bringing the genocide to an end.

In the 1990s, Israel’s military responded to attacks by Palestinians. The level of violence grew increasingly fierce. Meanwhile, instability had increased in the region as a whole. As Clinton worked to address it, violence originating in the region spread outward, with the United States increasingly a target.
Small Steps Toward Peace in Israel In 1993, Palestinians and Israelis conducted secret negotiations in Oslo, Norway. The resulting Declaration of Principles promised Palestinian self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, as well as security for the Israelis. The declaration did not adequately address the issues of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, nor did it placate extremists on either side, who had no interest in compromise.
» Analyze Maps What city is located on the border between Israeli and Palestinian territory?
America in the 1980s and 1990s	664	11.4 A New Era in Foreign Policy
Chronic violence continued even though Israel withdrew from much of the West Bank, and later from Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who had agreed to the declaration, fell victim to the fury in 1995 when an Israeli religious extremist assassinated him.
In 2000, Clinton invited Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak to Camp David to work on a peace agreement. They came close to signing one, but Arafat was not satisfied with any of the proposals. Back in Israel, Barak was replaced as prime minister by Ariel Sharon, a “hawk” who once opposed any concessions to the Palestinians. In 2005, however, Sharon withdrew all Israeli settlers from Gaza. Nonetheless, Palestinian suicide bombings increased, and with them so did crackdowns by the Israeli military.
Terrorists Hit U.S. Targets In 1993, an Islamist terrorist group called al Qaeda exploded a truck bomb in the parking garage beneath the World Trade Center in New York City, killing six people and injuring more than one thousand others. Al Qaeda was led by a wealthy man from Saudi Arabia named Osama bin Laden.
Bin Laden had fought in Afghanistan in the 1980s on the side of Islamists who sought to expel the Soviet Union. By the late 1990s, he had formed al Qaeda with the purpose of ending American involvement in Muslim countries.
Five years after the 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center, al Qaeda set off car bombs within minutes of each other at American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The blasts killed 225 people and injured more than 5,500 others. In 2000, al Qaeda bombed the USS Cole an American warship anchored off the coast of Yemen, killing 17 American sailors. In spite of these attacks, most Americans remained much more focused on domestic issues than on the threat of international terrorism. No one fully understood the threat that al Qaeda posed to American interests and world peace.

When Bill Clinton took the presidential oath of office on January 20,1993, he faced a great challenge. Since 1968, Americans had chosen Republican presidents in five out of six elections. The Republican argument that government needed to be smaller and less intrusive resonated with many Americans. Clinton therefore needed to chart a middle course between the limited role for government advocated by Republicans and the traditional Democratic reliance on government programs to address social problems.

Clinton Enacts New Domestic Policies
Family Medical Leave Act Becomes Law Early in his presidency, Clinton signed the Family Medical Leave Act, which had been vetoed by President Bush despite having bipartisan support. The act guaranteed most full-time employees 12 workweeks of unpaid leave each year for the birth and care of a newborn child, to recover from a serious illness, or to care for an immediate family member with one. The Clinton administration also raised the minimum wage, increased access to college loans, and expanded tax credits for higher education.
An Uphill Battle on Healthcare Reform Healthcare reform headed Clinton’s list of priorities. The United States was the only developed country without national healthcare. Though Clinton did not advocate socialized medicine, he wanted a program that would guarantee care for all Americans. His wife, Hillary Clinton, was appointed to head a healthcare task force to investigate the issue. The task force conducted highly publicized hearings and produced a long, detailed proposal that attracted immediate criticism from diverse interest groups. The bill never won congressional support and was ultimately dropped after about a year of debate.

Clinton had miscalculated Americans’ faith in the federal government to solve the country's social problems. Many Americans simply did not feel that enlarging the federal bureaucracy and allowing the government to run healthcare was a good idea.
Fighting Crime and Violence Clinton also tried to address the issue of violence in American society. In 1993, he signed the Brady Bill, a gun-control act named for presidential aide James Brady, who had been wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan. Under Clinton, Congress also passed a $30 billion anticrime bill that increased funding for police and banned several kinds of assault weapons.
Still, violence continued to haunt the nation. In 1995, Americans were horrified by the bombing of a government building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people and injured more than 800 others. The mass murder was not committed by foreign terrorists, but rather by homegrown anti-government extremists.
To ward off similar terrorist attacks, federal buildings in major cities were surrounded with barriers. New laws were passed to deter terrorism and impose stiffer penalties.
In 1999, yet another act of senseless violence stirred nationwide debate. At Colorado’s Columbine High School, two heavily armed students killed 12 fellow students and a teacher, as well as wounding 24 others, before taking their own lives. In the aftermath of this tragedy, many schools across the nation installed metal detectors and other security measures. Still other schools instituted new anti-bully policies and “zero tolerance” approaches to school violence.

people thought that Gingrich’s goal of the Republicans gaining control of the House of Representatives in 1994 was a nearly impossible task. After all, the Democrats had controlled the House for 58 of the previous 62 years.
Gingrich, however, galvanized Republicans around his Contract With America, a plan that attacked big government and emphasized patriotism and traditional values. The Contract With America called for congressional term limits, reduction of the federal bureaucracy, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and large tax cuts, as well as increased defense spending, significant welfare reform, and tough anti-crime legislation. The idea was to capture the votes of Americans who felt the federal government was too big, too wasteful, and too liberal.
Republicans Sweep the 1994 Elections Although most eligible voters did not vote in 1994, there was a strong turnout among Republicans. For the first time in 40 years, the Republicans won control of the House. They also captured the Senate and most of the governorships.
Newsweek magazine observed:
“Last week in one of the most profound electoral routs in American history, Republicans won the right to occupy the Capitol and mount what their . . . commanders think of as a counterrevolution: a full-scale attack on the notion that a central government should play a central role in the life of the nation.”
Once in office, Republicans in the House passed most of Gingrich’s program. Getting the program
through the Senate and signed by Clinton was not as successful, with only a handful of contract points becoming law. In addition, Republican attempts to slash Medicare and other government programs proved unpopular. Many Americans were also upset when the government shut down in 1995 because Congress would not pass Clinton’s budget. Meanwhile, Clinton incorporated some of the conservative agenda into his own 1996 reelection bid. He signed a bill to reform welfare, passed legislation that appropriated more money for law enforcement, and called for stiffer sentencing for criminals. Finally, he made balancing the budget and reducing the federal deficit a priority.
A
Strong Economy Lifts Clinton to Reelection Beginning in the mid-1990s, the American economy broke out of recession and began to soar, starting the longest period of sustained growth in the country’s history. Americans benefited from low unemployment, low inflation levels, and the government’s efforts to balance the budget and reduce the deficit. In 1994, Clinton’s disapproval rating had exceeded 60 percent, and few expected him to win a second term. As the 1996 election approached, however, the booming economy meant that few Americans had a compelling reason to change leadership.
The Republicans nominated Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, a World War II hero and a moderate Republican. H. Ross Perot entered the race as the Reform Party candidate. Clinton skillfully captured the middle ground, labeling Dole as out-of-touch and Perot as a political quack. On election day, Americans chose Clinton by a wide margin. The House of Representatives and Senate, however, retained their Republican majorities.

Scandals, Impeachment, and Trial
President Clinton had dodged scandals from his first days in office. One, a sexual harassment suit, had stemmed from his years as governor of Arkansas. Another concerned investments that Bill and Hillary Clinton had made in the Whitewater Development Corporation, an Arkansas real estate company, in the 1970s and 1980s.
Investigating Clinton Leads to New Scandal A
special prosecutor appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno investigated the Whitewater investment case and recommended that no criminal charges be filed. However, in July, Congress passed a new law requiring that special prosecutors be selected by a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals. As a result, in August of 1994, special prosecutor Kenneth Starr was appointed to investigate the case again. In seven years of investigation, Starr failed to uncover any conclusive evidence of the Clintons’ guilt, though some of their associates were convicted.
In the process of prosecuting Whitewater, Starr began investigating Clinton’s relationship with o White House intern. Clinton had denied under oath that the two had an affair. Eventually, Clinton admitted that he had lied. The Whitewater case was
quickly overshadowed by the new scandal. In 1998, Starr recommended impeachment proceedings on a number of counts, all related to the intern scandal rather than to Whitewater.
Impeaching and Acquitting the President Most Americans condemned Clinton’s actions but opposed impeachment. Congressional Democrats, similarly, did not believe his behavior met the standard of “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors” required by the Constitution for the impeachment and removal of a president. Nevertheless, the House of Representatives, led by the Republican majority, impeached Clinton on the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
In January 1999, the Senate tried the president. The removal of a president requires a two-thirds majority of senators, and from the beginning, it was clear that Clinton’s opposition did not have the necessary votes. After a short trial, the president was acquitted on both counts on February 12. However, the political scandal shook the trust of U.S. citizens in the federal government and its leaders.

Digital Technology
Changes American Life
During the twentieth century, the rate of technological change sped up dramatically. New technology touched every aspect of life, including how Americans worked, played, and communicated. At the same time, globalization transformed the American economy, bringing both new challenges and new opportunities.
The 1900s was a century of unparalleled change. In 1903, Orville Wright flew the first airplane. Less than 70 years later, astronaut Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. During that same span of time, television went from a novelty at a World’s Fair to a standard household possession, and sophisticated microscopes and telescopes unveiled previously hidden worlds. One of the most important innovations was the development of the computer.
Microchips and Microprocessors Lead to the Modern Computer Intense rivalry between enemies during World War II brought about a life-and-death race to develop new technologies, such as the computer. The U.S. government funded research that led to the creation of the first modern computer in 1946. This huge machine occupied the entire basement of the research
» Popular computers of the 1980s and early 1990s were produced by Commodore, Texas Instruments, and Coleco.
lab. It calculated artillery ranges and performed computations for the atomic bomb.
Soon after World War II, universities and corporations joined government agencies to develop smaller, faster, more powerful computers that could perform a range of functions. The IBM company developed one of the first commercially successful computers in 1954. In the 1960s, a few companies located south of San Francisco, California, focused on developing improved technology for running the computer. Their efforts led to the microchip, a tiny fragment of silicon containing complex circuits, and the microprocessor, a silicon chip that held a central processing unit. These chips made possible the development of small computers, called personal computers.
Transforming Business and Industry At first, personal computers were a novelty item, used mainly by hobbyists. But by the 1980s, computers were transforming industries, research labs, and businesses. Personal computers could perform many different tasks but were small and simple enough for the average person to use. The technology that created them eventually spread to many other industries. Video games, cellular telephones, and other electronics all depended on microchips and microprocessors. Entrepreneurs played a large role in accelerating the use of personal computers. Steve Jobs’s Apple Computers and Bill Gates’s Microsoft made computers and software affordable for millions of Americans. Jeff Bezos’s Amazon.com ushered in buying and selling products by computer. Like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller a century before, these entrepreneurs amassed great fortunes by pioneering new technologies.
The great demand for newer, faster, and more versatile digital devices—coupled with the potential fortunes awaiting those who successfully delivered them—motivated a new breed of inventors and entrepreneurs. Improvements in technology and manufacturing helped develop faster-working and smaller components that drove down costs, allowing a great number of people to use these new technologies.
Science and Agriculture Innovations Medical science also moved ahead by gigantic leaps in the late twentieth century, often aided by computer technology. Scientists developed drugs that extended patients’ lives, reduced pain, and battled a huge number of diseases. They made artificial hearts and learned how to successfully transplant body organs. Such advancements, along with biotechnology, or the use of living organisms in the development of new products, produced a level of healthcare far above that known to

The Rise of Technology
any previous generation. Many of the advances in the biological sciences were spurred by federal research grants, such as those from the National Institute of Health and the National Science Foundation.
Advances in agricultural technology, including improved machinery, irrigation techniques, and growing methods, have brought profound changes to American society. While farms have grown larger and more productive, fewer people are needed to work them. In 1900, 50 percent of the labor force worked on farms. At the end of the century, only 2 percent did.
Satellite Technology Transforms Communication and Navigation Satellite technology increased the speed of global communications. Satellites are mechanical devices that orbit Earth in space, receiving and sending information-filled signals that are then relayed to televisions, telephones, and computers. Originally developed for military purposes during the Cold War, satellite technology was used in the 1970s by businessman Ted Turner to run the first “superstation.” In 1980, Robert Johnson launched BET (Black Entertainment Television) using technology to broadcast into cable-equipped households across the country. Also in 1980, Turner began the 24-hour-per-day, all-news Cable News Network (CNN). Cellular telephones used similar satellite technology, allowing people to communicate away from their homes.
Scientists and engineers in the U.S. Department of Defense also applied satellite technology to develop the first Global Positioning System (GPS). They developed the system for use in the American military, but nonmilitary use later became widespread.
In GPS, a receiver on Earth measures how long radio signals from multiple satellites take to arrive at its location. Using this information, the receiver performs the necessary calculations to determine the user's latitude, longitude, or even altitude. Since its inception, the accuracy of GPS (and the fact that its signals are available for free) has caused a massive change in navigation for industrial and everyday users.
Creating the Internet In the 1970s, various branches of the U.S. government along with groups in several American universities led efforts to link computer systems together via cables and satellites. By the 1980s, the Internet, or World Wide Web, had been born, reaching the general public in the 1990s.
The Web made communication and access to information almost instantaneous. This breakthrough completely and profoundly transformed commerce, education, research, and entertainment. Email provided great advantages over the delays of postal mail and the expense of telephones. The impact has been especially great on people living in rural areas. The Internet’s immense storage capacity also changed the world of

research. In the 1980s, scientists and scholars primarily used the Internet to share information. By the early 1990s, they were using it as a research tool and an online database.
The Tech Boom Fuels Economic Growth In many ways, the free enterprise system drives technological innovation and has filled the marketplace with inexpensive personal computers, global positioning products, and cell phones. Such technological innovations have improved the standard of living in the United States. Fueled in part by the high-tech boom, the U.S. economy in the 1990s flourished. The strong economy produced the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years and high home-ownership rates. In addition, the federal government operated on the first balanced budget since the late 1960s and held the largest budget surplus in U.S. history. The era became America’s longest peacetime expansion.

12.1
\2z With the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the sole superpower in a dramatically changing world. No longer defined by its role as the leading opponent of communism, the United States had to carve out new roles for itself in a world of globalization and increasing regional conflict. President Clinton, the nation’s first baby-boomer President, ushered in this new period of American soul-searching. The free trade agreements made during his presidency showed how clearly he understood the impact of government policies on the economy. These policies will continue to shape the American economy in the twenty-first century.

Free Trade and Treaties
In the 1990s, the United States was both an important promoter of global trade and an example for newly industrializing nations. As more nations participated in economic globalization, the United States adjusted its own policies to ensure it would remain an economic powerhouse.
U.S.
International Trade Policies and the Role of Free Trade As an economic leader and champion of the free enterprise system, America has had a major role in globalization. Free trade—the guiding principle of globalization—has been hotly debated in American politics. Americans want the lower costs that free trade creates but worry about the loss of American jobs to other countries. Generally, Republicans have supported the interests of business and free trade agreements. Democrats have been more sympathetic to labor interests and have often opposed legislation that would cost American workers’ jobs. Depending on which party has been in power, free trade has either been encouraged or opposed by social and political advocacy organizations across the political spectrum.

Bill Clinton challenged the traditional Democratic thinking by supporting free trade blocs, which in theory would increase the economic prosperity of particular regions. Europe is an example of a region in which such a bloc was setup. In 1993, a number of European nations established the European Union (EU) to coordinate monetary and economic policies. By the end of the century, the EU had adopted a single currency, the euro, to promote economic efficiency. The EU’s combined resources both encouraged trade among its members and challenged the economic leadership of the United States. North American free trade proponents believed a similar bloc would stimulate their own region.
The United States Joins NAFTA The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a
direct response to the EU, was originally proposed during the Bush administration. President Bush and leaders of the other nations signed the agreement in 1992, but Congress blocked it. It called for a gradual removal of trade restrictions among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. NAFTA’s supporters maintained that creating a free trade zone in North America would promote economic growth, reduce prices, increase exports, and encourage economic investment. Most labor leaders, environmentalists, and liberal Democrats argued that NAFTA would force American manufacturers to relocate to Mexico, where wages
were lower and environmental controls were less rigid. They feared that hundreds of thousands of American jobs would be lost. President Clinton embraced NAFTA and pushed it through Congress. It went into effect in 1994, and since then the three countries have also signed agreements covering environmental protection, safety standards, and workers’ rights. Fourteen years later, with the removal of remaining trade restrictions between the United States and Mexico, the final provisions of NAFTA went into effect in January 2008.
Expanding Global Trade Through the Free Enterprise System Clinton signed a total of 270 free trade agreements, including the revision of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994 and the accords of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. GATT’s goal was to reduce tariffs to promote free trade. The WTO replaced GATT, expanding the organization’s authority to negotiate trade agreements, settle disputes, and enforce compliance with them. Clinton also continued the strong U.S. support of the World Bank.
Critics complain that the WTO and World Bank favor business interests over environmental concerns and workers’ rights. At the 1999 WTO meeting in Seattle, protesters filled the streets, disrupting the proceedings.
Yet most people agree that economic globalization has had a number of positive effects, such as exposing

people to new ideas, technologies, and communications. Another positive effect is that nations involved in free trade have often become more democratic. Normalizing trade—engaging in free trade with countries rather than imposing sanctions based on disagreements— can also tend to strengthen economic ties. For example, normalizing trade with China has encouraged that country to adopt free market reforms.

Technological and
Management Innovations in the American Economy
Today, technological changes continue to have a dramatic effect on the American economy, raising the standard of living. New technology influences how and where people do their jobs. In this changing economy, one sector—the service industry—has grown rapidly. A lower percentage of Americans than ever before work
on assembly lines or on farms. Instead, they provide services.
The Impact of Multinational Corporations on the 21st Century Economy New communications infrastructures—especially satellites and computers— have made it easier for companies to do global business. This has increased globalization, or the process by which national economies, politics, cultures, and societies become integrated with those of other nations around the world. Multinational corporations are one example of a globalized business. Such a corporation might have its financial headquarters in one country and manufacturing plants in several others and may obtain its raw materials from many different places. The company then sells the products it makes to a worldwide market. When properly implemented, these innovations in how business operations are managed can lead to greater productivity both for individual workers within the corporation and for the corporation as a whole.
Globalization has made more products and services available to greater numbers of people, often at lower prices. It has hastened the development of some nations. But it has also had some drawbacks. Industrial nations have seen their manufacturing jobs flow out to less developed nations. Steel that was once manufactured in Pittsburgh, for example, might now

be made in South Korea. In less developed nations, workers often do not enjoy the protections that workers have in industrial nations. Finally, the interconnection of world economies almost guarantees that economic problems in one region will be felt in others.
Technology Transforms Workplaces Computer technology has also changed the nature of the American economy. Many workers have found that they need computer skills to get jobs. Banking, stockbroking, programming, and the many other occupations dependent on information and computers have added millions of jobs to the service economy.
Many white-collar workers in the information economy have seen their jobs radically change. Professional workers are linked by a network of computers, fax machines, television screens, and cellphones. They often telecommunicate, holding meetings that involve participants sitting in offices around the world.
Computers have had a huge impact on American industry. Computer-driven industrial robots perform tasks such as welding, loading, packaging, and assembling cars and electronics. Because they can deliver high quality work around the clock, they have enhanced productivity, allowing many businesses to become more competitive. Computers also allow managers to accurately forecast demand for their goods. Applying just-in-time inventory strategies, producers can receive goods as they are needed, increasing efficiency by reducing their inventory costs and waste.
The Service Sector Expands With the production of services increasing faster than the production of goods, some economists say that America now has a service economy. Jobs in the service sector vary widely. Lawyers, teachers, doctors, research analysts, police officers, professional athletes, and movie stars are all service workers, as are salespeople and the people behind fast-food counters. Service workers are among the lowest paid and the highest paid people in the United States.
The transition from an industry-based economy to a service-based one has created opportunities for small business entrepreneurs to achieve the American dream. Sergey Brin and Larry Page launched Google in 1998 to help Internet users locate information as efficiently as possible. The success of Google has made both men billionaires. Mark Zuckerberg and several college roommates launched Facebook while still students at Harvard University. Facebook enables its users to build networks among people with similar interests, activities, and backgrounds. The worlds

interest in social media made Zuckerberg one of the wealthiest people in America.
Individuals like Zuckerberg continue to have an impact on the twenty-first century economy. Computer and mobile communication technology continues to push small entrepreneurs to develop innovative products and services.
The Decline of Organized Labor The rise of the service economy and the decline in American coal mining, steelmaking, and automobile manufacturing has had a strong impact on organized labor. When union membership was at its peak in 1945, about 35 percent of all American workers belonged to unions. In 2013, less than 12 percent of workers did. Blue-collar jobs, once the mainstay of American labor, declined dramatically in the second half of the twentieth century. As a result, the political power of labor unions, as well as farm organizations, has fallen. At the same time, workers’ average wages—especially those of nonprofessional workers—have fallen.

The Role of the United States in the Future Economy
Since the 1920s, the United States has had the world’s largest national economy. The reasons are many and varied, but include political stability, abundant natural resources, high worker productivity, favorable immigration policies, and a culture that emphasizes hard work, free enterprise, education, and innovation. All of these advantages have almost guaranteed America’s economic success. Today, however, the United States faces new challenges in a rapidly changing world economy.
New Economies Rise During the past decade, strong new economic competitors have emerged in China, India, and Brazil—large, populous nations with abundant natural resources and developing industrial bases. The United States has formed economic ties with these growing economies, while engaging in healthy competition with them. Of these three major competitors, China is the nation that causes the greatest concern. Because unlike Western European nations and Japan, which have democratic systems similar to that of the United States, China’s government is communist, with harsh restrictions on freedom of
expression. However, China has been moving rapidly toward a modified free market. Although there has been friction between the United States and China over issues such as patents and intellectual property, as well as industrial spying and computer hacking, the two powerful nations have forged mutually profitable trade agreements.
Competing in a Global Economy For more than a century, successful competition in the global economy has depended on three factors: producing better, less expensive goods; staying on the cutting edge of research and development; and educating and preparing students for work in high-tech industries. Ultimately competitions among nations are won by people of intelligence and strong work ethics who are encouraged by governments that value progress and innovation.
But winning does not mean that other nations must lose. Cooperation between nations is essential, especially in a global economy. Since the passage of NAFTA and GATT in the 1990s, economic borders have become more flexible. The outsourcing of jobs and the growth of multinational corporations have changed the nature of economic nationalism. To be sure, the new global economy is still in its infancy, and many problems remain to be resolved, but increasingly,
