Chapter 34 Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Shadow of War, 1933–1941


 sacriﬁce the possibility of domestic recovery for the sake of international cooperation. While vacationing on a yacht along the New Eng land coast, he dashed off a radio message to London, scolding the conference for attempting to stabilize currencies and essentially declaring America’s withdrawal from the negotiations. Roosevelt’s bombshell announcement yanked the rug from under the London Conference. The delegates adjourned empty-handed, amid cries of American bad faith. Whether the conference could have arrested the worldwide economic slide is debatable, but Roosevelt’s every-man-for-himself attitude plunged the planet even deeper into economic crisis. The collapse of the London Conference also strengthened the global trend toward extreme nationalism, making international cooperation ever more difﬁcult as the dangerous decade of the 1930s unfolded. Reﬂecting the powerful persistence of American isolationism, Roosevelt’s action played directly into the hands of the power-mad dictators who were determined to shatter the peace of the world. Americans themselves would eventually pay a high price for the narrow-minded belief that the United States could go it alone in the modern world.

 Freedom for (from?) the Filipinos and Recognition for the Rus sians Roosevelt matched isolationism from Europe with withdrawal from Asia. The Great Depression burst the fragile bubble of President McKinley’s imperialistic dream in the Far East. With the descent into hard times, American taxpayers were eager to throw overboard their expensive tropical liability in the Philippine Islands. Organized labor demanded the exclusion of low-wage Filipino workers, and American sugar producers clamored for the elimination of Philippine competition. Remembering its earlier promises of freedom for the Philippines, Congress passed the Tydings-McDufﬁe Act in 1934. The act provided for the independence of the Philippines after a twelve-year period of economic and political tutelage—that is, by 1946. The United States agreed to relinquish its army bases, but naval bases were reserved for future discussion—and retention. In truth, the American people were not so much giving freedom to the Philippines as they were freeing themselves from the Philippines. With a selﬁsh eye to their own welfare, and with apparent disregard for the political situation in Asia, they proposed to leave the

 Philippines to their fate, while imposing upon the Filipinos economic terms so ungenerous as to threaten the islands with economic prostration. Once again, American isolationists rejoiced. Yet in Tokyo, Japa nese militarists were calculating that they had little to fear from an inward-looking America that was abandoning its principal possession in Asia. At the same time, Roosevelt made at least one internationalist gesture when he formally recognized the Soviet Union in 1933. Over the noisy protests of anticommunist conser vatives, as well as Roman Catholics offended by the Kremlin’s antireligious policies, Roosevelt extended the hand of diplomatic recognition to the sixteen-year-old Bolshevik regime. He was motivated in part by the hope for trade with Soviet Russia, as well as by the desire to bolster the Soviet Union as a friendly counterweight to the possible threat of German power in Europe and Japa nese power in Asia.

 Roosevelt's Early Foreign Policies

Becoming a Good Neighbor
 Closer to home, Roosevelt inaugurated a refreshing new era in relations with Latin America. He proclaimed in his inaugural address, “I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the Good Neighbor.” Taken together, Roosevelt’s noninvolvement in Europe and withdrawal from Asia, along with this brotherly embrace of his New World neighbors, suggested that the United States was giving up its ambition to be a world power and would content itself instead with being merely a regional power, its interests and activities conﬁ ned exclusively to the Western Hemisphere. Old-fashioned intervention by bayonet in the Caribbean had not paid off, except in an evil harvest of resentment, suspicion, and fear. The Great Depression had cooled off Yankee economic aggressiveness, as thousands of investors in Latin American securities became sackholders rather than stockholders. There were now fewer dollars to be protected by the riﬂes of the hated marines. With war-thirsty dictators seizing power in Europe and Asia, Roosevelt was eager to line up the Latin Americans to help defend the Western Hemisphere. Embittered neighbors would be potential tools of transoceanic aggressors. President Roosevelt made clear at the outset that he was going to renounce armed intervention, particularly the vexatious corollary to the Monroe Doctrine devised by his cousin Theodore Roosevelt. Late in 1933, at the Seventh Pan-American Conference in Montevideo, Uruguay, the U.S. delegation formally endorsed nonintervention. Deeds followed words. The last marines departed from Haiti in 1934. The same year, after military strongman Fulgencio Batista had come to power, restive Cuba was released from the worst hobbles of the Platt Amendment, under which America had been free to intervene, although the United States retained its naval base at Guantánamo (see p. 684). The tiny country of Panama received a similar uplift in 1936, when Washington partially relaxed its grip on the isthmus nation. The hope-inspiring Good Neighbor policy, with the accent on consultation and nonintervention, received its acid test in Mexico. When the Mexican government seized Yankee oil properties in 1938, American investors vehemently demanded armed intervention to repossess their conﬁscated businesses. But Roosevelt successfully resisted the badgering, and a settlement was ﬁ nally threshed out in 1941, even though the oil companies lost much of their original stake.



 Spectacular success crowned Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor policy. His earnest attempts to usher in a new era of friendliness, though hurting some U.S. bondholders, paid rich dividends in goodwill among the peoples to the south. No other citizen of the United States has ever been held in such high esteem in Latin America during his lifetime. Roosevelt was cheered with tumultuous enthusiasm when, as a “traveling salesman for peace,” he journeyed to the special InterAmerican Conference at Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1936. The Colossus of the North now seemed less a vulture and more an eagle.

 Secretary Hull’s Reciprocal Trade Agreements Intimately associated with Good Neighborism, and also popular in Latin America, was the reciprocal trade policy of the New Dealers. Its chief architect was idealistic Secretary of State Hull, a high-minded Tennessean of the low-tariff school. Like Roosevelt, he believed that trade was a two-way street, that a nation can sell abroad only as it buys abroad, that tariff barriers choke off foreign trade, and that trade wars beget shooting wars. Responding to the Hull-Roosevelt leadership, Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934. Designed in part to lift American export trade from the depression doldrums, this enlightened mea sure was aimed at both relief and recovery. At the same time, it activated the low-tariff policies of the New Dealers. (See the tariff chart in the Appendix.) The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act avoided the dangerous uncertainties of a wholesale tariff revision; it merely whittled down the most objectionable schedules of the Hawley-Smoot law by amending them. Roosevelt was empowered to lower existing rates by as much as 50 percent, provided that the other country involved was willing to respond with similar reductions. The resulting pacts, moreover, were to become effective without the formal approval of the Senate. This novel feature not only ensured speedier action but sidestepped the twin evils of high-stakes logrolling and high-pressure lobbying in Congress. Secretary Hull, whose zeal for reciprocity was unﬂagging, succeeded in negotiating pacts with twentyone countries by the end of 1939. During these same years, U.S. foreign trade increased appreciably, presumably in part as a result of the Hull-Roosevelt policies. Trade agreements undoubtedly bettered economic

 and political relations with Latin America and proved to be an inﬂuence for peace in a war-bent world. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was a landmark piece of legislation. It reversed the traditional high-protective-tariff policy that had persisted almost unbroken since Civil War days and that had so damaged the American and international economies following World War I. It also paved the way for the American-led free-trade international economic system that took shape after World War II, a period that witnessed the most robust growth in the history of international trade.

 space for its teeming millions, cooped-up in their crowded island nation. Japa nese navalists were not to be denied. Determined to ﬁ nd a place in the Asiatic sun, Tokyo gave notice in 1934 of the termination of the twelve-yearold Washington Naval Treaty. A year later at London, the Japa nese torpedoed all hope of effective naval disarmament. Upon being denied complete parity, they walked out of the multipower conference and accelerated their construction of giant battleships. By 1935 Japan, too, had quit the League of Nations. Five years later it joined arms with Germany and Italy in the Tripartite Pact.

Storm-Cellar Isolationism
 Post-1918 chaos in Europe, followed by the Great Depression, spawned the ominous spread of totalitarianism. The individual was nothing; the state was every thing. The communist USSR led the way, with the crafty and ruthless Joseph Stalin ﬁ nally emerging as dictator. In 1936 he began to purge his communist state of all suspected dissidents, ultimately executing hundreds of thousands and banishing millions to remote Siberian forced-labor camps. Blustery Benito Mussolini, a swaggering Fascist, seized the reins of power in Italy during 1922. And Adolf Hitler, a fanatic with a toothbrush mustache, plotted and harangued his way into control of Germany in 1933 with liberal use of the “big lie.” Hitler was the most dangerous of the dictators, because he combined tremendous power with impulsiveness. A frustrated Austrian painter, with hypnotic talents as an orator and a leader, he had secured control of the Nazi party by making political capital of the Treaty of Versailles and Germany’s depression-spawned unemployment. He was thus a misbegotten child of the shortsighted postwar policies of the victorious Allies, including the United States. The desperate German people had fallen in behind the new Pied Piper, for they saw no other hope of escape from the plague of economic chaos and national disgrace. Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of Nations in 1933 and began clandestinely (and illegally) rearming. In 1936 the Nazi Hitler and the Fascist Mussolini allied themselves in the Rome-Berlin Axis. International gangsterism was likewise spreading in the Far East, where imperial Japan was on the make. Like Germany and Italy, Japan was a so-called have-not power. Like them, it resented the ungenerous Treaty of Versailles. Like them, it demanded additional

 Egging his people on with theatrical displays of pomp and ceremony, Hitler had created a vast military machine by 1939, when he started World War II with a brutal attack against Poland.

Isolationism Enthroned


 Jut-jawed Mussolini, seeking both glory and empire in Africa, brutally attacked Ethiopia in 1935 with bombers and tanks. The brave defenders, armed with spears and ancient ﬁ rearms, were speedily crushed. Members of the League of Nations could have caused Mussolini’s war machine to creak to a halt—if they had only dared to embargo oil. But when the League quailed rather than risk global hostilities, it merely signed its own death warrant. Isolationism, long festering in America, received a strong boost from these alarms abroad. Though disapproving of the dictators, Americans still believed that their encircling seas conferred a kind of mystic immunity. They were continuing to suffer the disillusion-



 The thirst of Benito Mussolini (1883–1945) for national glory in Ethiopia is indicated by his remark in 1940:

“


 To make a people great it is necessary to send them to battle even if you have to kick (The Italians were them in the pants. notoriously unwarlike.)

”


 In 1934 Mussolini proclaimed in a public speech,

“ ”


 We have buried the putrid corpse of liberty.

 ment born of their participation in World War I, which they now regarded as a colossal blunder. They likewise nursed bitter memories of the ungrateful and defaulting debtors. As early as 1934, a spiteful Congress passed the Johnson Debt Default Act, which prevented debtdodging nations from borrowing further in the United States. If attacked again by aggressors, these delinquents could “stew in their own juices.” Mired down in the Great Depression, Americans had no real appreciation of the revolutionary forces being harnessed by the dictators. The “have-not” powers were out to become “have” powers. Americans were not so much afraid that totalitarian aggression would cause trouble as they were fearful that they might be drawn into it. Strong nationwide sentiment welled up for a constitutional amendment to forbid a declaration of war by Congress—except in case of invasion— unless there was a favorable popular referendum. With a mixture of seriousness and frivolity, a group of Princeton University students began to agitate in 1936 for a bonus to be paid to the Veterans of Future Wars (VFW) while the prospective frontliners were still alive.

Congress Legislates
Neutrality


 The Wages of Despair Disillusioned and desperate, millions of Germans in the 1930s looked to Adolf Hitler as their savior from the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which had concluded World War I. This Nazi poster reads, “Our Last Hope: Hitler.”

 As the gloomy 1930s lengthened, an avalanche of lurid articles and books condemning the munitions manufacturers as war-fomenting “merchants of death” poured from American presses. A Senate committee, headed by Senator Gerald Nye of North Dakota, was appointed in 1934 to investigate the “blood business.” By sensationalizing evidence regarding America’s entry into World War I, the senatorial probers tended to



Chapter 34 Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Shadow of War, 1933–1941


 shift the blame away from the German submarines onto the American bankers and arms manufacturers. Because the munitions makers had obviously made money out of the war, many a naive citizen leaped to the illogical conclusion that these soulless scavengers had caused the war in order to make money. This kind of reasoning suggested that if the proﬁts could only be removed from the arms trafﬁc—“one hell of a business”—the country could steer clear of any world conﬂ ict that might erupt in the future. Responding to overwhelming popular pressure, Congress made haste to legislate the nation out of war. Action was spurred by the danger that Mussolini’s Ethiopian assault would plunge the world into a new bloodbath. The Neutrality Acts of 1935, 1936, and 1937, taken together, stipulated that when the president proclaimed the existence of a foreign war, certain restrictions would automatically go into effect. No American could legally sail on a belligerent ship, sell or transport munitions to a belligerent, or make loans to a belligerent. This head-in-the-sand legislation in effect marked an abandonment of the traditional policy of freedom

 of the seas—a policy for which America had professedly fought two full-ﬂedged wars and several undeclared wars. The Neutrality Acts were speciﬁcally tailored to keep the nation out of a conﬂ ict like World War I. If they had been in effect at that time, America probably would not have been sucked in—at least not in April 1917. Congress was one war too late with its legislation. What had seemed dishonorable to Wilson seemed honorable and desirable to a later disillusioned generation. Storm-cellar neutrality proved to be tragically shortsighted. America falsely assumed that the decision for peace or war lay in its own hands, not in those of the satanic forces already unleashed in the world. Prisoner of its own fears, it failed to recognize that it might have used its enormous power to shape international events. Instead it remained at the mercy of events controlled by the dictators. Statutory neutrality, though of undoubted legality, was of dubious morality. America served notice that it would make no distinction whatever between brutal aggressors and innocent victims. By striving to hold the scales even, it actually overbalanced them in favor of the dictators, who had armed themselves to the teeth. By declining to use its vast industrial strength to aid its democratic friends and defeat its totalitarian foes, it helped goad the aggressors along their bloodspattered path of conquest.

America Dooms Loyalist Spain


“The Only Way We Can Save Her,” 1939 Even as war
 broke out in Europe, many Americans continued to insist on the morality of U.S. neutrality.

 The Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939—a proving ground and dress rehearsal in miniature for World War II— was a painful object lesson in the folly of neutralityby-legislation. Spanish rebels, who rose against the left-leaning republican government in Madrid, were headed by fascistic General Francisco Franco. Generously aided by his fellow conspirators Hitler and Mussolini, he undertook to overthrow the established Loyalist regime, which in turn was assisted on a smaller scale by the Soviet Union. This pipeline from communist Moscow chilled the natural sympathies of many Americans, especially Roman Catholics, for the republican Loyalists. But other Americans burned with passion to defend the struggling republic against Franco’s fascist coup. Some three thousand young men and women headed to Spain to ﬁght as volunteers in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Washington continued ofﬁcial relations with the Loyalist government. But Congress, with the encour-

The Spanish Civil War


 agement of Roosevelt and with only one dissenting vote, amended the existing neutrality legislation so as to apply an arms embargo to both Loyalists and rebels. “Roosevelt,” remarked the dictator Franco, “behaved in the manner of a true gentleman.” FDR later regretted being so gentlemanly. Uncle Sam thus sat on the sidelines while Franco, abundantly supplied with arms and men by his fellow dictators, strangled the republican government of Spain. The democracies, including the United States, were so determined to stay out of war that they helped to condemn a fellow democracy to death. In so doing they further encouraged the dictators to take the dangerous road that led over the precipice to World War II. Such peace-at-any-price-ism was further cursed with illogic. Although determined to stay out of war, America declined to build up its armed forces to a point where it could deter the aggressors. In fact, it allowed its navy to decline in relative strength. It had been led to believe that huge ﬂeets caused huge wars; it was also trying to spare the complaining taxpayer during the grim days of the Great Depression. When President Roosevelt repeatedly called for preparedness, he was branded a warmonger. Not until 1938, the year

Canute Frankson (1890–194?), an African American
 member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, explained why he went to Spain to ﬁght against the fascist Franco in 1937:

“


 Since this is a war between whites who for centuries have held us in slavery, and have heaped every kind of insult and abuse upon us, segregated and Jim-crowed us; why [am] I, a Negro . . . in Spain today? Because we are no longer an isolated minority group ﬁghting hopelessly against an immense giant. . . . Because if we crush Fascism here we’ll save our people in America, and in other parts of the world from the vicious persecution, wholesale imprisonment, and slaughter which the Jewish people . . . are suffering under Hitler’s Fascist heels. . . . We will build us a new society—a society of peace and plenty. There will be no color line, no jim-crow trains, no lynching. That is why, my dear, I’m here in Spain.

”




 America’s policy toward Spain “had been a grave mistake,” Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882–1945) told his cabinet in early 1939:

“


 The policy we should have adopted was to forbid the transportation of munitions of war in American bottoms [ships]. This could have been done and Loyalist Spain would still have been able to come to us for what she needed to ﬁght for her life against Franco—to ﬁght for her life and for the lives of some of the rest of us as well, as events will very likely prove.

”


 before World War II exploded, did Congress come to grips with the problem when it passed a billion-dollar naval construction act. The calamitous story was repeated of too little, too late.

Appeasing Japan and Germany
 Sulfurous war clouds had meanwhile been gathering in the tension-taut Far East. In 1937 the Japa nese militarists, at the Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing (Peking), touched off the explosion that led to an all-out invasion of China. In a sense this attack was the curtainraiser of World War II. Roosevelt shrewdly declined to invoke the recently passed neutrality legislation by refusing to call the China incident an ofﬁcially declared war. If he had put the existing restrictions into effect, he would have cut off the trickle of munitions on which the Chinese were desperately dependent. The Japa nese, of course, could continue to buy mountains of war supplies in the United States. In Chicago—unofﬁcial isolationist “capital” of America—President Roosevelt delivered his sensational Quarantine Speech in the autumn of 1937. Alarmed by the recent aggressions of Italy and Japan, he called for “positive endeavors” to “quarantine” the aggressors— presumably by economic embargoes. The speech triggered a cyclone of protest from isolationists and other foes of involvement; they feared that a moral quarantine would lead to a shooting quarantine. Startled by this angry response, Roosevelt retreated and sought less direct means to curb the dictators.



Chapter 34 Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Shadow of War, 1933–1941


 America’s isolationist mood intensiﬁed, especially in regard to China. In December 1937 Japanese aviators bombed and sank an American gunboat, the Panay, in Chinese waters, with a loss of two killed and thirty wounded. In the days of 1898, when the Maine went down, this outrage might have provoked war. But after Tokyo hastened to make the necessary apologies and pay a proper indemnity, Americans breathed a deep sigh of relief. Japa nese militarists were thus encouraged to vent their anger against the “superior” white race by subjecting American civilians in China, both male and female, to humiliating slappings and strippings. Adolf Hitler meanwhile grew louder and bolder in Europe. In 1935 he had openly ﬂouted the Treaty of Versailles by introducing compulsory military ser vice in Germany. The next year he brazenly marched into the demilitarized German Rhineland, likewise contrary to the detested treaty, while France and Britain looked on in an agony of indecision. Lashing his following to a frenzy, Hitler undertook to persecute and then exterminate the Jewish population in the areas under his control. In the end he wiped out about 6 million innocent victims, mostly in gas chambers. Calling upon his people to sacriﬁce butter for guns, he whipped the new German air force and mechanized ground divisions into the most devastating military machine the world had yet seen. Suddenly, in March 1938, Hitler bloodlessly occupied German-speaking Austria, his birthplace. The democratic powers, wringing their hands in despair, prayed that this last grab would satisfy his passion for conquest. But like a drunken reveler calling for madder music and stronger wine, Hitler could not stop. Intoxicated by his recent gains, he began to make bullying demands for the German-inhabited Sudetenland of neighboring Czechoslovakia. The leaders of Britain and France, eager to appease Hitler, sought frantically to bring the dispute to the conference table. President Roosevelt, also deeply alarmed, kept the wires hot with personal messages to both Hitler and Mussolini urging a peaceful settlement. A conference was ﬁ nally held in Munich, Germany, in September 1938. The Western European democracies, badly unprepared for war, betrayed Czechoslovakia to Germany when they consented to the shearing away of the Sudetenland. They hoped—and these hopes were shared by the American people—that the concessions at the conference table would slake Hitler’s thirst for power and bring “peace in our time.” Indeed Hitler publicly promised that the Sudetenland “is the last territorial claim I have to make in Europe.”

 What Next? 1938 The Western European democracies looked on helplessly as Nazi Germany swallowed up Austria and part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, and Hitler’s juggernaut seemed unstoppable.

 Appeasement of the dictators, symbolized by the ugly word Munich, turned out to be merely surrender on the installment plan. It was like giving a cannibal a ﬁ nger in the hope of saving an arm. In March 1939, scarcely six months later, Hitler suddenly erased the rest of Czechoslovakia from the map, contrary to his solemn vows. The democratic world was again stunned.

 Hitler’s Belligerency and U.S. Neutrality Joseph Stalin, the sphinx of the Kremlin, was a key to the peace puzzle. In the summer of 1939, the British and French were busily negotiating with Moscow, hopeful of securing a mutual-defense treaty that would halt Hitler. But mutual suspicions proved insuperable. Then the Soviet Union astounded the world by signing, on August 23, 1939, a nonaggression treaty with the German dictator. The notorious Hitler-Stalin pact meant that the Nazi German leader now had a green light to make war

Hitler Launches His War


 on Poland and the Western democracies, without fearing a stab in the back from the Soviet Union—his Communist arch-foe. Consternation struck those wishful thinkers in Western Europe who had fondly hoped that Hitler might be sicced upon Stalin so that the twin menaces would bleed each other to death. It was as plain as the mustache on Stalin’s face that the wily Soviet dictator was plotting to turn his German accomplice against the Western democracies. The two warring camps would then kill each other off—and leave Stalin bestriding Europe like a colossus. With the signing of the Nazi-Soviet pact, World War II was only hours away. Hitler now demanded from neighboring Poland a return of the areas wrested from Germany after World War I. Failing to secure satisfaction, he sent his mechanized divisions crashing into Poland at dawn on September 1, 1939. Britain and France, honoring their commitments to Poland, promptly declared war. At long last they perceived the folly of continued appeasement. But they were powerless to aid Poland, which succumbed in three weeks to Hitler’s smashing strategy of terror. Stalin, as prearranged secretly in his fateful pact with Hitler, came in on the kill for his share of old Russian Poland. Long-dreaded World War II was now fully launched, and the long truce of 1919–1939 had come to an end. President Roosevelt speedily issued the routine proclamations of neutrality. Americans were overwhelmingly anti-Nazi and anti-Hitler; they fervently hoped that the democracies would win; they fondly believed that the forces of righteousness would triumph, as in 1918. But they were desperately determined to stay out: they were not going to be “suckers” again. Neutrality promptly became a heated issue in the United States. Ill-prepared Britain and France urgently needed American airplanes and other weapons, but the Neutrality Act of 1937 raised a sternly forbidding

 President Roosevelt was roused at 3 a.m. on September 1, 1939, by a telephone call from Ambassador William Bullitt (1891–1967) in Paris:

“


 Mr. President, several German divisions are deep in Polish territory. . . . There are reports of bombers over the city of Warsaw.

 FDR replied,

“ ”


 Well, Bill, it has come at last. God help us all.

”




 hand. Roosevelt summoned Congress in special session, shortly after the invasion of Poland, to consider lifting the arms embargo. After six hectic weeks of debate, a makeshift law emerged. The Neutrality Act of 1939 provided that henceforth the European democracies might buy American war materials, but only on a “cash-and-carry basis.” This meant that they would have to transport the munitions in their own ships, after paying for them in cash. America would thus avoid loans, war debts, and the torpedoing of American arms-carriers. While Congress thus loosened former restrictions in response to interventionist cries, it added others in response to isolationist fears. Roosevelt was now also authorized to proclaim danger zones into which American merchant ships would be forbidden to enter. This unneutral neutrality law unfortunately hurt China, which was effectively blockaded by the Imperial Japa nese Navy. But despite its defects, it clearly favored the European democracies against the dictators. As the British and French navies controlled the Atlantic, the European aggressors could not send their ships to buy America’s munitions. The United States not only improved its moral position but simultaneously helped its economic position. Overseas demand for war goods brought a sharp upswing from the recession of 1937–1938 and ultimately solved the decadelong unemployment crisis (see Figure 33.4 on p. 847).

The Fall of France
 The months following the collapse of Poland, while France and Britain marked time, were known as the “phony war.” An ominous silence fell on Europe, as Hitler shifted his victorious divisions from Poland for a knockout blow at France. Inaction during this anxious period was relieved by the Soviets, who wantonly attacked neighboring Finland in an effort to secure strategic buffer territory. The debt-paying Finns, who had a host of admirers in America, were speedily granted $30 million by an isolationist Congress for nonmilitary supplies. But despite heroic resistance, Finland was ﬁnally ﬂattened by the Soviet steamroller. An abrupt end to the “phony war” came in April 1940 when Hitler, again without warning, overran his weaker neighbors Denmark and Norway. Hardly pausing for breath, the next month he attacked the Netherlands and Belgium, followed by a paralyzing blow at France. By late June France was forced to surrender, but not until Mussolini had pounced on its rear for a jackal’s share of the loot. In a pell-mell but successful



Chapter 34 Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Shadow of War, 1933–1941


 Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) promised to win his fellow Germans Lebensraum, or “living space,” and to win it by war if necessary. In his eyes, his nationalist and racist crusade justiﬁed every violent means at hand. As he told his commanders,

“


 When you start a war, what matters is not who is right, but who wins. Close your hearts to pity. Act with brutality. Eighty million Germans must get what is their due. Their existence must be made secure. The stronger man is in the right.

”

 evacuation from the French port of Dunkirk, the British managed to salvage the bulk of their shattered and partially disarmed army. The crisis providentially brought forth an inspired leader in Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the bulldog-jawed orator who nerved his people to ﬁght off the fearful air bombings of their cities. France’s sudden collapse shocked Americans out of their daydreams. Stouthearted Britons, singing “There’ll Always Be an Eng land,” were all that stood between Hitler and the death of constitutional government in Europe. If Britain went under, Hitler would have at his disposal the workshops, shipyards, and slave labor of Western Europe. He might even have the powerful British ﬂeet as well. This frightening possibility, which seemed to pose a dire threat to American security, steeled the American people to a tremendous effort.

 Roosevelt moved with electrifying energy and dispatch. He called upon an already debt-burdened nation to build huge airﬂeets and a two-ocean navy, which could also check Japan. Congress, jarred out of its apathy toward preparedness, within a year appropriated the astounding sum of $37 billion. This ﬁgure was more than the total cost of ﬁghting World War I and about ﬁve times larger than any New Deal annual budget. Congress also passed a conscription law, approved September 6, 1940. Under this mea sure—America’s ﬁ rst peacetime draft—provision was made for training each year 1.2 million troops and 800,000 reserves.

 President Roosevelt made a compelling case against the isolationists in a speech at the University of Virginia on June 10, 1940:

“


 Some indeed still hold to the now somewhat obvious delusion that we of the United States can safely permit the United States to become a lone island, a lone island in a world dominated by the philosophy of force. Such an island may be the dream of those who still talk and vote as isolationists. Such an island represents to me and to the overwhelming majority of Americans today a helpless nightmare of a people without freedom—the nightmare of a people lodged in prison, handcuffed, hungry, and fed through the bars from day to day by the contemptuous, unpitying masters of other continents.

”


 Public-Opinion Polling in the 1930s n 1936 the prominent news publication Literary Digest made a monumental gaffe when it relied on public-opinion polling data to forecast a victory for the Republican candidate, Alf Landon, over the incumbent, Franklin D. Roosevelt. As it happened, Roosevelt racked up a monstrous majority, winning the electoral votes of all but two states. The Digest’s error had been to compile its polling lists from records of automobile registration and telephone directories—unwittingly skewing its sample toward relatively well-off voters in an era when fewer than half of American families owned either a car or a telephone. The Digest’s embarrassing mistake ended an era of informal polling techniques, as new, scientiﬁcally sophisticated polling orga ni zations founded by George Gallup and Elmo Roper forged to the fore.

 From this date forward, polling became a standard tool for marketers and advertisers—as well as for political strategists and historians. Yet controversy has long clouded the relationship between pollsters and politicians, who are often accused of abdicating their roles as leaders and slavishly deferring to public opinion, rather than trying to shape it. Franklin Roosevelt confronted this issue in the 1930s, as polls seemed to conﬁ rm the stubborn isolationism of the American people, even as the president grew increasingly convinced that the United States must play a more active international role. What do the poll results below suggest about Roosevelt’s handling of this issue? About the reliability of polling data? What are the legitimate political uses of publicopinion polls? How valuable are they to the historian?

Chapter 34 Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Shadow of War, 1933–1941


 The act was later adapted to the requirements of a global war. The Latin American bulwark likewise needed bracing. The Netherlands, Denmark, and France, all crushed under the German jackboot, had orphaned colonies in the New World. Would these fall into German hands? At the Havana Conference of 1940, the United States agreed to share with its twenty New World neighbors the responsibility of upholding the Monroe Doctrine. This ancient dictum, hitherto unilateral, had been a bludgeon brandished only in the hated Yankee ﬁst. Now multilateral, it was to be wielded by twentyone pairs of American hands—at least in theory.

 Refugees from the Holocaust Aroused by Adolf Hitler, the ancient demon of antiSemitism brutally bared its fangs. During the late nineteenth century, Jewish communities in eastern Europe were frequent victims of pogroms, mob attacks approved or condoned by local authorities. In modern Germany primeval violence reappeared with shocking

 efﬁciency on the night of November 9, 1938. Instigated by a speech by Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels, mobs ransacked more than seven thousand Jewish shops and almost all of the country’s synagogues. At least ninety-one Jews lost their lives, and about thirty thousand were sent to concentration camps in the turbulent wake of Kristallnacht, the “night of broken glass.” Many Jews attempted to escape from Hitler’s racist juggernaut. To take one poignant case, in May 1939, 937 passengers, almost all of them Jewish refugees, boarded the ship St. Louis in Hamburg and departed for Havana. When they reached Cuba, however, most were denied entry for lack of a valid Cuban visa. The St. Louis then sailed to Miami, which proved no more hospitable. President Roosevelt brieﬂ y showed some interest in accepting the beleaguered passengers, but restrictive immigration laws, together with opposition from southern Democrats and Secretary of State Cordell Hull, convinced him otherwise. After being turned away one last time in Canada, the St. Louis eventually deposited its passengers in Eng land, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where many of them subsequently perished under the Nazi heel.

Aid for Britain


Albert Einstein Arriving in America, 1933
 Sadly, the United States admitted only a trickle of Jewish refugees, while the Holocaust engulfed European Jewry.



 Roosevelt faced a historic decision: whether to hunker down in the Western Hemisphere, assume a “Fortress America” defensive posture, and let the rest of the world go it alone; or to bolster beleaguered Britain by all means short of war itself. Both sides had their advocates. Supporters of aid to Britain formed propaganda groups, the most potent of which was the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies. Its argument was double-barreled. To interventionists it could appeal for direct succor to the British by such slogans as “Britain Is Fighting Our Fight.” To isolationists it could appeal for assistance to the democracies by “All Methods Short of War,” so that the terrible conﬂ ict would be kept in faraway Europe. The isolationists, both numerous and sincere, were by no means silent. Determined to avoid American

 After reports of the Nazi genocide began to be veriﬁed in 1942, Roosevelt created the War Refugee Board, which saved thousands of Hungarian Jews from deportation to the notorious death camp at Auschwitz. But all told, only 150,000 Jews, mostly Germans and Austrians, found refuge in the United States. By the end of the war, some 6 million Jews had been murdered in the Holocaust.

Bolstering Britain
 Before the fall of France in June 1940, Washington had generally observed a technical neutrality. But now, as Britain alone stood between Hitler and his dream of world domination, the wisdom of neutrality seemed increasingly questionable. Hitler launched air attacks against Britain in August 1940, preparatory to an invasion scheduled for September. For months the Battle of Britain raged in the air over the British Isles. The Royal Air Force’s tenacious defense of its native islands eventually led Hitler to postpone his planned invasion indeﬁ nitely. During the precarious months of the Battle of Britain, debate intensiﬁed in the United States over what foreign policy to embrace. Radio broadcasts from London brought the drama of the nightly German air raids directly into millions of American homes. Sympathy for Britain grew, but it was not yet sufﬁcient to push the United States into war.

 bloodshed at all costs, they orga nized the America First Committee and proclaimed, “Eng land Will Fight to the Last American.” They contended that America should concentrate what strength it had to defend its own shores, lest a victorious Hitler, after crushing Britain, plot a transoceanic assault. Their basic philosophy was “The Yanks Are Not Coming,” and their most effective speechmaker was the famed aviator Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh, who, ironically, had narrowed the Atlantic in 1927. Britain was in critical need of destroyers, for German submarines were again threatening to starve it out with attacks on shipping. Roosevelt moved boldly when, on September 2, 1940, he agreed to transfer to Great Britain ﬁ fty old-model, four-funnel destroyers left over from World War I. In return, the British promised to hand over to the United States eight valuable defensive base sites, stretching from Newfoundland to South America. These strategically located outposts were to remain under the Stars and Stripes for ninetynine years. Transferring ﬁfty destroyers to a foreign navy was a highly questionable disposal of government property, despite a strained interpretation of existing legislation. The exchange was achieved by a simple presidential agreement, without so much as a “by your leave” to Congress. Applause burst from the aid-to-Britain advocates, many of whom had been urging such a step. But condemnation arose from America Firsters and other isolationists, as well as from antiadministration Republicans. Some of them approved the transfer but decried Roosevelt’s secretive and arbitrary methods. Yet so grave was the crisis that the president was unwilling to submit the scheme to the uncertainties and delays of a full-dress debate in the Congress. Shifting warships from a neutral United States to a belligerent Britain was, beyond question, a ﬂagrant violation of neutral obligations—at least neutral obligations that had existed before Hitler’s barefaced aggressions rendered foolish such old-fashioned concepts of fair play. Public-opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of Americans were determined, even at the risk of armed hostilities, to provide the battered British with “all aid short of war.”

Shattering the Two-Term
Tradition
 A distracting presidential election, as fate decreed, came in the midst of this crisis. The two leading Repub-

 lican aspirants were round-faced and ﬂat-voiced Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, son of the ex-president, and the energetic boy wonder, lawyer-prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey of New York. But in one of the miracles of American political history, the Philadelphia convention was swept off its feet by a colorful latecomer, Wendell L. Willkie, a German-descended son of Hoosier Indiana. This dynamic lawyer—tousled-headed, longlipped, broad-faced, and large-framed—had until recently been a Democrat and the head of a huge public utility corporation. A complete novice in politics, he had rocketed from political nothingness in a few short weeks. His great appeal lay in his personality, for he was magnetic, transparently trustful, and honest in a homespun, Lincolnesque way. With the galleries in Philadelphia wildly chanting “We Want Willkie,” the delegates ﬁ nally accepted this political upstart as the only candidate who could possibly beat Roosevelt. The Republican platform condemned FDR’s alleged dictatorship, as well as the costly and confusing zigzags of the New Deal. Willkie, an outspoken liberal, was opposed not so much to the New Deal as to its extravagances and inefﬁciencies. Democratic critics branded him “the rich man’s Roosevelt” and “the simple barefoot Wall Street lawyer.” While the rumor pot boiled, Roosevelt delayed to the last minute the announcement of his decision to challenge the sacred two-term tradition. Despite what he described as his personal yearning for retirement, he avowed that in so grave a crisis he owed his experienced hand to the ser vice of his country and humanity. The Democratic delegates in Chicago, realizing that only with “the Champ” could they defeat Willkie, drafted him by a technically unanimous vote. “Better a Third Term Than a Third-Rater” was the war cry of many Democrats. Burning with sincerity and energy, Willkie launched out upon a whirlwind, Bryanesque campaign in which he delivered over ﬁve hundred speeches. At times his voice became a hoarse croak. The country was already badly split between interventionists and isolationists, and Willkie might have widened the breach dangerously by a violent attack on Roosevelt’s aid-to-Britain policies. But seeing eye-to-eye with FDR on the necessity of bolstering the beleaguered democracies, he refrained from assailing the president’s interventionism, though objecting to his methods. In the realm of foreign affairs, there was not much to choose between the two candidates. Both promised to stay out of the war; both promised to strengthen the nation’s defenses. Yet Willkie, with a mop of black

 hair in his eyes, hit hard at Rooseveltian “dictatorship” and the third term. His enthusiastic followers cried, “Win with Willkie,” “No Fourth Term Either,” and “There’s No Indispensable Man.” Roosevelt, busy at his desk with mounting problems, made only a few speeches. Stung by taunts that he was leading the nation by the back door into the European slaughterhouse, he repeatedly denied any such intention. His most speciﬁc statement was at Boston, where he emphatically declared, “Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars”—a pledge that later came back to plague him. He and his supporters vigorously defended the New Deal, as well as all-out preparations for the defense of America and aid to the Allies. Roosevelt triumphed, although Willkie ran a strong race. The popular total was 27,307,819 to 22,321,018, and the electoral count was 449 to 82 (see Map 34.1). This contest was much less of a walkaway than in 1932 or 1936; Democratic majorities in Congress remained about the same. Jubilant Democrats hailed their triumph as a mandate to abolish the two-term tradition. But the truth is that Roosevelt won in spite of the third-term handicap. Voters generally felt that should war come, the experienced hand of the tried leader was needed at the helm. Less appealing was the completely inexperienced hand of the well-intentioned Willkie, who had never held public ofﬁce. The time-honored argument that one should not change horses in the middle of a stream was strong, especially in an era of war-pumped prosperity. Roosevelt might not have won if there had not been a war crisis.

 On the other hand, he probably would not have run if foreign perils had not loomed so ominously. In a sense, his opponent was Adolf Hitler, not Willkie.

Chapter 34 Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Shadow of War, 1933–1941


A
Landmark Lend-Lease Law  By late 1940 embattled Britain was nearing the end of its ﬁ nancial tether; its credits in America were being rapidly consumed by insatiable war orders. But Roosevelt, who had bitter memories of the wrangling over the Allied debts of World War I, was determined, as he put it, to eliminate “the silly, foolish, old dollar sign.” He ﬁ nally hit on the scheme of lending or leasing American arms to the reeling democracies. When the shooting was over, to use his comparison, the guns and tanks could be returned, just as one’s next-door neighbor would return a garden hose when a threatening ﬁ re was put out. But isolationist Senator Taft (who was reputed to have the ﬁ nest mind in Washington until he made it up) retorted that lending arms was like lending chewing gum: “You don’t want it back.” Who wants a chewed-up tank? The Lend-Lease Bill, patriotically numbered 1776, was entitled “An Act Further to Promote the Defense of the United States.” Sprung on the country after the election was safely over, it was praised by the administration as a device that would keep the nation out of the war rather than drag it in. The underlying concept was “Send guns, not sons” or “Billions, not bodies.” America, so President Roosevelt promised, would be

 the “arsenal of democracy.” It would send a limitless supply of arms to the victims of aggression, who in turn would ﬁ nish the job and keep the war on their side of the Atlantic. Accounts would be settled by returning the used weapons or their equivalents to the United States when the war was ended. Lend-lease was heatedly debated throughout the land and in Congress. Most of the opposition came, as might be expected, from isolationists and antiRoosevelt Republicans. The scheme was assailed as “the blank-check bill” and, in the words of isolationist Senator Burton Wheeler, as “the new Triple-A [Agricultural Adjustment Act] bill”—a mea sure designed to “plow under every fourth American boy.” Nevertheless, lend-lease was ﬁ nally approved in March 1941 by sweeping majorities in both houses of Congress. Lend-lease was one of the most momentous laws ever to pass Congress; it was a challenge hurled squarely into the teeth of the Axis dictators. America pledged itself, to the extent of its vast resources, to bolster those nations that were indirectly defending it by ﬁghting aggression. When the gigantic operation ended in 1945, America had sent about $50 billion worth of arms and equipment—much more than the cost to the country of World War I—to those nations ﬁghting aggressors (see Map 34.2). The passing of lend-lease was in effect an economic declaration of war; now a shooting declaration could not be very far around the corner.

 By its very nature, the Lend-Lease Bill marked the abandonment of any pretense of neutrality. It was no destroyer deal arranged privately by President Roosevelt. The bill was universally debated, over drugstore counters and cracker barrels, from Cal i fornia all the way to Maine, and the sovereign citizen at last spoke through convincing majorities in Congress. Most people probably realized that they were tossing the old concepts of neutrality out the window. But they also recognized that they would play a suicidal game if they bound themselves by the oxcart rules of the nineteenth century—especially while the Axis aggressors themselves openly spurned international obligations. Lend-lease would admittedly involve a grave risk of war, but most Americans were prepared to take that chance rather than see Britain collapse and then face the diabolical dictators alone. Lend-lease had the somewhat incidental result of gearing U.S. factories for all-out war production. The enormously increased capacity thus achieved helped save America’s own skin when, at long last, the shooting war burst around its head. Hitler evidently recognized lend-lease as an unofﬁcial declaration of war. Until then Germany had avoided attacking U.S. ships; memories of America’s decisive intervention in 1917–1918 were still fresh in German minds. But after the passing of lend-lease, there was less point in trying to curry favor with the United States. On May 21, 1941, the Robin Moor, an unarmed American merchantman, was torpedoed and destroyed by a German submarine in the South Atlantic, outside a war zone. The sinkings had started, but on a limited scale.

Charting a New World
 Two globe-shaking events marked the course of World War II before the assault on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. One was the fall of France in June 1940; the other was Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union, almost exactly one year later, in June 1941. The scheming dictators Hitler and Stalin had been uneasy yoke-fellows under the ill-begotten Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939. As masters of the double cross, neither trusted the other. They engaged in prolonged dickering in a secret attempt to divide potential territorial spoils between them, but Stalin balked at dominant German control of the Balkans. Hitler thereupon decided to crush his co-conspirator, seize the oil and other resources of the Soviet Union, and then have two free hands to snuff out Britain. He assumed that his invincible armies would subdue Stalin’s “Mongol halfwits” in a few short weeks. Out of a clear sky, on June 22, 1941, Hitler launched a devastating attack on his Soviet neighbor. This timely assault was an incredible stroke of good fortune for the democratic world—or so it seemed at the time. The two ﬁends could now slit each other’s throats on the icy steppes of Russia. Or they would if the Soviets did not quickly collapse, as many military experts predicted. Sound American strategy seemed to dictate speedy aid to Moscow while it was still aﬂoat. Roosevelt immediately promised assistance and backed up his words by making some military supplies available. Several

 months later, interpreting the lend-lease law to mean that the defense of the USSR was now essential for the defense of the United States, he extended $1 billion in lend-lease—the ﬁ rst installment on an ultimate total of $11 billion. Meanwhile, the valor of the red army, combined with the white paralysis of an early Russian winter, had halted Hitler’s invaders at the gates of Moscow. With the surrender of the Soviet Union still a dread possibility, the drama-charged Atlantic Conference was held in August 1941. British prime minister Winston Churchill, with cigar embedded in his cherubic face, secretly met with Roosevelt on a warship off the foggy coast of Newfoundland. This was the ﬁ rst of a series of history-making conferences between the two statesmen for the discussion of common problems, including the menace of Japan in the Far East. The most memorable offspring of this get-together was the eight-point Atlantic Charter. It was formally accepted by Roosevelt and Churchill and endorsed by the Soviet Union later that year. Suggestive of Wilson’s Fourteen Points, the new covenant outlined the aspirations of the democracies for a better world at war’s end. Arguing for the rights of individuals rather than nations, the Atlantic Charter laid the groundwork for later advocacy on behalf of universal human rights. Many were surprised by how speciﬁc the document was. Opposing imperialistic annexations, the charter promised that there would be no territorial changes contrary to the wishes of the inhabitants (selfdetermination). It further afﬁrmed the right of a people to choose their own form of government and, in particular, to regain the governments abolished by the dictators. Among various other goals, the charter declared for disarmament and a peace of security, pending a “permanent system of general security” (a new League of Nations). Liberals the world over took heart from the Atlantic Charter, as they had taken heart from Wilson’s compa-

 Senator (later president) Harry S Truman (1884– 1972) expressed a common reaction to Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941:

“


 If we see that Germany is winning, we ought to help Russia, and if we see Russia is winning, we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible.

 rable Fourteen Points. It was especially gratifying to subject populations, like the Poles, who were then ground under the iron heel of a conqueror. But the agreement was roundly condemned in the United States by isolationists and others hostile to Roosevelt. What right, they charged, had “neutral” America to confer with belligerent Britain on common policies? Such critics missed the point: the nation was in fact no longer neutral.

U.S.
Destroyers and  Hitler’s U-boats Clash Lend-lease shipments of arms to Britain on British ships were bound to be sunk by German wolf-pack submarines. If the intent was to get the munitions to Eng land, not to dump them into the ocean, the freighters would have to be escorted by U.S. warships. Britain simply did not have enough destroyers. The dangerous possibility of being “convoyed into war” had been mentioned in Congress during the lengthy debate on lendlease, but administration spokespeople had brushed

America Enters the War


 the idea aside. Their strategy was to make only one commitment at a time. Roosevelt made the fateful decision to convoy in July 1941. By virtue of his authority as commander in chief of the armed forces, the president issued orders to the navy to escort lend-lease shipments as far as Iceland. The British would then shepherd them the rest of the way. Inevitable clashes with submarines ensued on the Iceland run, even though Hitler’s orders were to strike at American warships only in self-defense. In September 1941 the U.S. destroyer Greer, provocatively trailing a German U-boat, was attacked by the undersea craft, without damage to either side. Roosevelt then proclaimed a shoot-on-sight policy. On October 17 the escorting destroyer Kearny, while engaged in a battle with U-boats, lost eleven men when it was crippled but not sent to the bottom. Two weeks later the destroyer Reuben James was torpedoed and sunk off southwestern Iceland, with the loss of more than a hundred ofﬁcers and enlisted men. Neutrality was still inscribed on the statute books, but not in American hearts. Congress, responding to public pressures and confronted with a shooting war, voted in mid-November 1941 to pull the teeth from the now-useless Neutrality Act of 1939. Merchant ships could henceforth be legally armed, and they could enter the combat zones with munitions for Britain. Americans braced themselves for wholesale attacks by Hitler’s submarines.

Surprise Assault on
Pearl Harbor
 The blowup came not in the Atlantic, but in the faraway Paciﬁc. This explosion should have surprised no close observer, for Japan, since September 1940, had been a formal military ally of Nazi Germany— America’s shooting foe in the North Atlantic. Japan’s position in the Far East had grown more perilous by the hour. It was still mired down in the costly and exhausting “China incident,” from which it could extract neither honor nor victory. Its war machine was fatally dependent on immense shipments of steel, scrap iron, oil, and aviation gasoline from the United States. Such assistance to the Japa nese aggressor was highly unpopular in America. But Roosevelt had resolutely held off an embargo, lest he goad the Tokyo warlords into a descent upon the oil-rich but defense-poor Dutch East Indies.



 Washington, late in 1940, ﬁ nally imposed the ﬁ rst of its embargoes on Japan-bound supplies. This blow was followed in mid-1941 by a freezing of Japa nese assets in the United States and a cessation of all shipments of gasoline and other sinews of war. As the oil gauge dropped, the squeeze on Japan grew steadily more nerve-racking. Japa nese leaders were faced with two painful alternatives. They could either knuckle under to the Americans or break out of the embargo ring by a desperate attack on the oil supplies and other riches of Southeast Asia. Final tense negotiations with Japan took place in Washington during November and early December of 1941. The State Department insisted that the Japa nese clear out of China, but to sweeten the pill offered to renew trade relations on a limited basis. Japa nese imperialists, after waging a bitter war against the Chinese for more than four years, were unwilling to lose face by withdrawing at the behest of the United States. Faced with capitulation or continued conquest, they chose the sword. Ofﬁcials in Washington, having “cracked” the topsecret code of the Japa nese, knew that Tokyo’s decision was for war. But the United States, as a democracy committed to public debate and action by Congress, could not shoot ﬁ rst. Roosevelt, misled by Japa nese ship movements in the Far East, evidently expected the blow to fall on British Malaya or on the Philippines. No one in high authority in Washington seems to have believed that the Japa nese were either strong enough or foolhardy enough to strike Hawaii. But the paralyzing blow struck Pearl Harbor, while Tokyo was deliberately prolonging negotiations in Washington. Japa nese bombers, winging in from distant aircraft carriers, attacked without warning on the “Black Sunday” morning of December 7, 1941. It was a date, as Roosevelt told Congress, “which will live in infamy.” About three thousand casualties were inﬂicted on American personnel, many aircraft were destroyed,

 Roosevelt’s war message to Congress began with these famous words:

“


 Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.

”




Chapter 34 Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Shadow of War, 1933–1941


The Battleship West Virginia
 The shocking Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, propelled the United States into World War II. One of the ﬁrst ships to be hit, the USS West Virginia quickly sank at its mooring, taking at least seventy sailors down with it. By September 1944 the West Virginia had been repaired and was back in service.

 the battleship ﬂeet was virtually wiped out when all eight of the craft were sunk or otherwise immobilized, and numerous small vessels were damaged or destroyed. Fortunately for America, the three priceless aircraft carriers happened to be outside the harbor. An angered Congress the next day ofﬁcially recognized the war that had been “thrust” upon the United States. The roll call in the Senate and House fell only one vote short of unanimity. Germany and Italy, allies of Japan, spared Congress the indecision of debate by declaring war on December 11, 1941. This challenge was formally accepted on the same day by a unanimous vote of both Senate and House. The unofﬁcial war, already of many months’ duration, was now ofﬁcial.

 America’s Transformation from Bystander to Belligerent Japan’s hara-kiri gamble in Hawaii paid off only in the short run. True, the Paciﬁc ﬂeet was largely destroyed or immobilized, but the sneak attack aroused and united America as almost nothing else could have

 done. To the very day of the blowup, a strong majority of Americans still wanted to keep out of war. But the bombs that pulverized Pearl Harbor blasted the isolationists into silence. The only thing left to do, growled isolationist Senator Wheeler, was “to lick hell out of them.” But Pearl Harbor was not the full answer to the question of why the United States went to war. This treacherous attack was but the last explosion in a long chain reaction. Following the fall of France, Americans were confronted with a devil’s dilemma. They desired above all to stay out of the conﬂ ict, yet they did not want Britain to be knocked out. They wished to halt Japan’s conquests in the Far East—conquests that menaced not only American trade and security but international peace as well. To keep Britain from collapsing, the Roosevelt administration felt compelled to extend the unneutral aid that invited attacks from German submarines. To keep Japan from expanding, Washington undertook to cut off vital Japa nese supplies with embargoes that invited possible retaliation. Rather than let democracy die and dictatorship rule supreme, most citizens were evidently determined to support a policy that might lead to war. It did.

America in
World War II

1941–1945
 Never before have we had so little time in which to do so much. FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, 1942

 he United States was plunged into the inferno of World War II with the most stupefying and humiliating military defeat in its history. In the dismal months that ensued, the democratic world teetered on the edge of disaster. Japan’s fanatics forgot that whoever stabs a king must stab to kill.
