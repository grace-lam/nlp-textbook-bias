A
False Start for Reform  Badly overestimating his electoral mandate for liberal reform, the young president made a series of costly blunders upon entering the White House. In one of his ﬁ rst initiatives on taking ofﬁce, he stirred a hornet’s nest of controversy by advocating an end to the ban on gays and lesbians in the armed ser vices. Confronted with ﬁerce opposition, the president ﬁ nally had to settle for a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that quietly accepted gay and lesbian soldiers and sailors without ofﬁcially acknowledging their presence in the military. Even more damaging to Clinton’s political standing, and to his hopes for lasting liberal achievement, was the ﬁasco of his attempt to reform the nation’s health-care system. In a dramatic but personally and politically risky move, the president appointed his wife, nationally prominent lawyer and children’s advocate Hillary Rodham Clinton, as the director of a task force charged with redesigning the medical-ser vice in-

 dustry. Their stupefyingly complicated plan was dead on arrival when it was presented to Congress in October 1993. The First Lady was doused with a torrent of abuse, although she eventually rehabilitated herself sufﬁciently to win election as a U.S. senator from New York in 2000—the ﬁ rst First Lady ever to hold elective ofﬁce. Her bid to win the Democratic nomination for president in 2008 proved equally as historic, if less successful. Clinton had better luck with a deﬁcitreduction bill in 1993, which combined with an increasingly buoyant economy by 1996 to shrink the federal deﬁcit to its lowest level in more than a decade. By 1998 Clinton’s policies seemed to have caged the ravenous deﬁcit monster, as Congress argued over the unfamiliar question of how to manage federal budget surpluses. The new president also induced Congress in 1993 to pass a gun-control law, the “Brady Bill,” named for presidential aide James Brady, who had been wounded and disabled by gunﬁ re in the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981. In July 1994 Clinton made further progress against the national plague of ﬁ rearms when he persuaded Congress to pass a $30 billion anticrime bill, which contained a ban on several types of assault weapons that continued until the law expired in 2004. With these mea sures the government struggled to hold the line against an epidemic of violence that rocked American society in the 1990s. A huge explosion destroyed a federal ofﬁce building in Oklahoma City in 1995, taking 168 lives, in retribution for a 1993 standoff in Waco, Texas, between federal agents and a fundamentalist sect known as the Branch Davidians. That showdown had ended in the destruction of the sect’s compound and the deaths of many Branch Davidians, including women and children. Events like the Oklahoma City bombing brought to light a lurid and secretive underground of paramilitary private “militias” composed of alienated citizens armed to the teeth and ultrasuspicious of all government. Even many law-abiding citizens shared to some degree in the antigovernment attitudes that drove the militia members to murderous extremes. Thanks largely to the disillusioning agony of the Vietnam War and the naked cynicism of Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, the conﬁdence in government that had come naturally to the generation that had licked the Great Depression and won the Second World War was in short supply by century’s end. Reﬂecting that pervasive disenchantment with politics and politicians,

Violence in America




 Bombing of Federal Building in Oklahoma City, 1995 A truck bomb killed 168 people in this federal ofﬁce building in the worst act of terrorism in the United States until September 11, 2001. Convicted on eleven counts for the attack, antigovernment militant Timothy McVeigh became the ﬁrst person executed by the federal government in nearly forty years in 2001.

 several states passed term-limit laws for elected ofﬁcials, although the Supreme Court ruled in 1995 that the restrictions did not apply to federal ofﬁceholders. Before the decade was out, the logic of Clinton’s emphasis on gun control was tragically conﬁ rmed. On an April morning in 1999, two students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, killed twelve fellow students and a teacher. Debate ﬂared over the origins of school violence. Some observers targeted the violence portrayed in movies, TV shows, and video games; others pointed to the failings of parents. But the culprit that attracted the most sustained political attention was guns—their abundance and accessibility, especially in suburban and rural communities. Clinton engaged in a pugnacious debate with the progun National Riﬂe Association over the need to toughen gun laws, and ﬁ lmmaker Michael Moore agi-

 tated for gun control in his popular 2002 documentary, Bowling for Columbine. The “Million Mom March” in Washington, D.C., in May 2002 and the tragic killing of thirty-two people by a disturbed student at Virginia Tech in 2007 further drove calls for new antigun mea sures, but reform was slow in coming.

The Politics of Distrust
 Clinton’s failed initiatives and widespread antigovernment sentiment afforded Republicans a golden opportunity in 1994, and they seized it aggressively. Led by outspoken Georgia representative Newt Gingrich, Republicans offered voters a Contract with America that promised an all-out assault on budget deﬁcits and radical reductions in welfare programs. Their campaign

 succeeded fabulously, as a right-wing tornado roared across the land in the 1994 congressional elections. Every incumbent Republican gubernatorial, senatorial, and congressional candidate was reelected. Republicans also picked up eleven new governorships, eight seats in the Senate, and ﬁ fty-three seats in the House (where Gingrich became speaker), giving them control of both chambers of the federal Congress for the ﬁ rst time in forty years. But if President Clinton had overplayed his mandate for liberal reform in 1993, the congressional Republicans now proceeded to overplay their mandate for conser vative retrenchment. In 1996 the new Congress achieved a major conser vative victory when it compelled a reluctant Clinton to sign the Welfare Reform Bill, which made deep cuts in welfare grants and required able-bodied welfare recipients to ﬁ nd employment. The new welfare law also tightly restricted welfare beneﬁts for legal and illegal immigrants alike, reﬂecting a rising tide of anti-immigrant sentiment as the numbers of newcomers climbed toward an alltime high. Old-line liberal Democrats howled with pain at the president’s alleged betrayal of his party’s heritage, and some prominent administration members resigned in protest against his decision to sign the welfare bill. But Clinton’s acceptance of the welfare reform package was part of his shrewd political strategy of accommodating the electorate’s conser vative mood by moving to his right. President Clinton was at ﬁ rst stunned by the magnitude of the Republican congressional victory in 1994. But many Americans gradually came to feel that the Gingrich Republicans were bending their conser vative bow too far, especially when the new Speaker advocated provocative ideas like sending the children of welfare families to orphanages. In a tense confrontation between the Democratic president and the Republican Congress, the federal government actually had to shut down for several days at the end of 1995 until a budget package was agreed upon. These outlandishly partisan antics bred a backlash that helped President Clinton rebound from his political neardeath experience. As the 1996 election approached, the Republicans chose Kansas senator Robert Dole as their presidential candidate. A decorated World War II veteran, Dole ran a listless campaign. Clinton, buoyed by a healthy economy and by his artful trimming to the conser vative wind, breezed to an easy victory, with 47,401,898 popular votes to Dole’s 39,198,482 (see Map 41.2). The Reform party’s egomaniacal leader, Ross Perot, ran a sorry third, picking up less than half the votes he had

 garnered in 1992. Clinton won 379 electoral votes, Dole only 159. But Republicans remained in control of Congress.

Clinton Again
 As Clinton began his second term—the ﬁ rst Democratic president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt to be reelected—the heady promises of far-reaching reform with which he had entered the White House four years earlier were no longer heard. Still facing Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, he proposed only modest legislative goals, even though soaring tax revenues generated by the prosperous economy produced in 1998 a balanced federal budget for the ﬁrst time in three decades. Clinton cleverly managed to put Republicans on the defensive by claiming the political middle ground. He now warmly embraced the landmark Welfare Reform Bill of 1996 that he had initially been slow to endorse. Juggling the political hot potato of afﬁ rmative action, Clinton pledged to “mend it, not end it.” When voters in Cal i fornia in 1996 approved Proposition 209, prohibiting afﬁ rmative-action preferences in government and higher education, the number of minority

Post-Cold War Foreign Policies




 Protesting NAFTA, 1993 These members of the Teamsters Union feared that the adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement would mean the replacement of high-paying American jobs with low-wage, nonunion Mexican labor. More than a decade later, the treaty still rankled. Policymakers disagreed about whether NAFTA had been damaging to American workers. In the 2008 election, the Republicans endorsed it, while the Democrats attacked it.

 students in the state’s public universities temporarily plummeted. A federal appeals court decision, Hopwood v. Texas, had a similar effect in Texas. Clinton criticized these broad assaults on afﬁ rmative action but stopped short of trying to reverse them, aware that public support for afﬁrmative action, especially among white Americans, had diminished since the 1970s. Clinton’s major political advantage continued to be the roaring economy, which by 2000 had sustained the longest period of growth in American history, driven by new Internet (“dot-com”) businesses and other high-tech and media companies. While unemployment crept down to 4 percent and businesses scrambled madly for workers, inﬂationary pressure remained remarkably low. Prosperity did not make Clinton immune to controversy over trade policy. During his ﬁrst term, he had displayed political courage by supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), creating in 1993 a free-trade zone encompassing Mexico, Canada, and the United States. In doing so, he reversed his own stand in the 1992 election campaign and bucked the opposition of protectionists in his own party, especially labor leaders fearful of losing jobs to lowwage Mexican workers. Clinton took another step in 1994 toward a global free-trade system when he vigorously promoted the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and a cherished goal of free-trade advocates since the end of the Second World War. Simmering discontent over trade policy boiled over in 1999 when Clinton hosted the meeting of the WTO in Seattle. The city’s streets ﬁ lled with protesters

 railing against what they viewed as the human and environmental costs of economic “globalization.” Trade talks ﬁ zzled in Seattle, with Clinton taking a hefty share of the blame. Money spurred controversy of another sort in the late 1990s. Campaign ﬁ nance reform, long smoldering as a potential issue, suddenly ﬂared up after the 1996 presidential contest. Congressional investigators revealed that the Clinton campaign had received funds from many improper sources, including contributors who paid to stay overnight in the White House and foreigners who were legally prohibited from giving to American candidates. But Republicans and Democrats alike had reason to avoid reform. Both parties had grown dependent on vast sums to ﬁ nance television ads for their candidates. Clinton did little more than pay lip ser vice to the cause of campaign ﬁ nance reform. But within the ranks of both parties, a few mavericks proposed to eliminate the corrupting inﬂuence of big donors. Senator John McCain from Arizona made campaign ﬁ nance reform a centerpiece of his failed 2000 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and ultimately succeeded in passing the McCain-Feingold Act of 2002 that more strictly regulated how money ﬂowed to candidates.

Problems Abroad
 The end of the Cold War dismantled the framework within which the United States had conducted foreign policy for nearly half a century. Clinton groped for a diplomatic formula to replace anticommunism as the basic premise of American diplomacy.



Chapter 41 America Confronts the Post–Cold War Era, 1992–2009


 Absorbed by domestic issues, President Clinton at ﬁ rst seemed uncertain and even amateurish in his conduct of foreign policy. He followed his predecessor’s lead in dispatching American troops as part of a peacekeeping mission to Somalia and reinforced the U.S. contingent after Somali rebels killed more than a dozen Americans in late 1993. But in March 1994, the president quietly withdrew the American units, without having accomplished any clearly deﬁ ned goal. Burned in Somalia, Washington stood on the sidelines in 1994 when catastrophic ethnic violence in the central African country of Rwanda resulted in the deaths of half a million people. Clinton also struggled to deﬁ ne a policy with respect to China, which was rapidly emerging as an economic and political powerhouse. Candidate Clinton had denounced George Bush in 1992 for not imposing economic sanctions on China as punishment for Beijing’s wretched record of human rights abuses. But

 President Clinton learned what Bush had long known: China’s economic importance to the United States did not permit Washington the luxury of taking the high road on human rights. Clinton soon soft-pedaled his criticism of the Beijing regime and instead began seeking improved trade relations with that robustly industrializing country and potential market bonanza. By 2000 Clinton was crusading for a controversial China trade bill. Congress passed it in May 2000, making the Asian giant a full-ﬂedged trading partner of the United States. Clinton’s approach to the tormented Balkans in southeastern Europe showed a similar initial hesitation, followed eventually by ﬁrm leadership. In the former Yugoslavia, as vicious ethnic conﬂ ict raged through Bosnia, the Washington government dithered until ﬁ nally deciding to commit American troops to a NATO peacekeeping contingent in late 1995. Deadlines for removing the troops were postponed and then ﬁ-

 Intifada Against Israeli Control, 1994 Beginning in 1987, Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled territories of the West Bank and Gaza rose up in protest. As the stalemate dragged on, the likelihood of Middle East peace receded, despite repeated international diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement. These young Palestinians in East Jerusalem wave Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) ﬂags outlawed by Israel.

 nally abandoned altogether as it became clear that they were the only force capable of preventing new hostilities. NATO’s expansion to include the new member states of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in 1997, and its continuing presence in Bosnia, failed to pacify the Balkans completely. When Serbian president Slobodan Milosević in 1999 unleashed a new round of “ethnic cleansing” in the region, this time against ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo, U.S.-led NATO forces launched an air war against Serbia. The bombing campaign initially failed to stop ethnic terror, as refugees ﬂooded into neighboring countries, but it eventually forced Milosević to accept a NATO peacekeeping force on the ground in Kosovo. Milosević was arrested in 2001 and put on trial before the International Criminal Court in The Hague, where he died in 2006 before the trial was completed. The Middle East remained a major focus of American diplomacy right up to the end of Clinton’s tenure. In 1993 Clinton presided over a historic meeting at the White House between Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasir Arafat. They agreed in principle on selfrule for the Palestinians within Israel. But hopes ﬂ ickered two years later when Rabin fell to an assassin’s bullet. Clinton and his second-term secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, spent the rest of the 1990s struggling in vain to broker the permanent settlement that continued to elude Israelis and Palestinians. Arafat died in 2004 with his dream of creating a Palestinian state still unrealized. In his ﬁ nal year as president, Clinton stepped up his efforts to leave a legacy as an international peacemaker. Along with his work in the Middle East, he sought to bring peace to Northern Ireland and the Korean peninsula, and he traveled to India and Pakistan in hopes of reducing the rivalry between the two nuclear powers of southern Asia. But the guiding principles of American foreign policy in the post–Cold War era remained ill-deﬁ ned and elusive

Scandal and Impeachment
 Scandal had dogged Bill Clinton from the beginning of his presidency. Critics brought charges of every thing from philandering to illegal ﬁ nancial transactions. Allegations of corruption stemming from a real estate deal called Whitewater while he was governor of Arkansas triggered an investigation by a special prosecutor, but no indictment ever materialized.



 All the previous scandals were overshadowed by the revelation in January 1998 that Clinton had engaged in a sexual affair with a young White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, and then blatantly lied about it when testifying under oath in another woman’s civil suit accusing him of sexual harassment. Caught in his bold lie, the president made a humiliating confession, but his political opponents smelled blood in the water. In September 1998 the special prosecutor investigating Whitewater, who had broad powers to investigate any evidence of presidential malfeasance, presented a stinging report, including lurid sexual details, to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. That report presented eleven possible grounds for impeachment, all related to lying about the Lewinsky affair. The House quickly cranked up the rusty machinery of impeachment. As an acrid partisan at mosphere enveloped the Capitol, House Republicans in December 1998 passed two articles of impeachment against the president: perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice. Crying foul, the Democratic minority charged that, however deplorable Clinton’s personal misconduct, sexual transgressions did not rise to the level of “high crimes and misdemeanors” prescribed in the Constitution (see Art. II, Sec. IV in the Appendix). The House Republican managers (prosecutors) of impeachment for the Senate trial replied that perjury and obstruction were grave public issues and that nothing less than the “rule of law” was at stake. As cries of “honor the Constitution” and “sexual McCarthyism” ﬁ lled the air, the nation debated whether the president’s peccadilloes amounted to high crimes or low follies. Most Americans apparently leaned toward the latter view. In the 1998 midterm elections, voters reduced the House Republicans’ majority, causing ﬁery House speaker Newt Gingrich to resign his post. Although Americans held a low opinion of Clinton’s slipshod personal morals, most liked the president’s political and economic policies and wanted him to stay in ofﬁce. In early 1999, for the ﬁ rst time in 130 years, the nation witnessed an impeachment proceeding in the U.S. Senate. Dusting off ancient precedents from Andrew Johnson’s trial, the one hundred senators solemnly heard arguments and evidence in the case, with Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding. With the facts widely known and the two parties’ political positions ﬁ rmly locked in, the trial’s outcome was a foregone conclusion. On the key obstruction of justice charge, ﬁve northeastern Republicans joined all fortyﬁve Democratic senators in voting not guilty. The ﬁ fty

The Legacy of Impeachment
 Time magazine’s cartoonist asked how future generations would judge the Clinton impeachment episode—and how it might be treated in history textbooks.

 Republican votes for conviction fell far short of the constitutionally required two-thirds majority. The vote on the perjury charge was forty-ﬁve guilty, ﬁ fty-ﬁve not guilty.

 Clinton’s Legacy and the 2000 Election Beyond the obvious stain of impeachment, Clinton’s legacy was mixed. His sound economic policies encouraged growth and trade in a rapidly globalizing

 post–Cold War world. Yet as a “New Democrat” and avowed centrist, Clinton did more to consolidate than to reverse the Reagan-Bush revolution against New Deal liberalism that had for half a century provided the compass for the Democratic party and the nation. Further, by setting such a low standard in his personal conduct, he replenished the sad reservoir of public cynicism about politics that Vietnam and Watergate had created a generation before. Nonetheless, as the end of the Clinton term and the beginning of the new millennium approached, the Democrats stayed on their political course and nom-

The Controversial Election of 2000




 Counting Chads With Bush and Gore neckand-neck in Florida’s presidential vote count, election ofﬁcials in Broward County examined by eye paper ballots disqualiﬁed by machine because the punched chads had not fully separated from the ballots. They hoped that close scrutiny would reveal the voters’ intentions.

 inated loyal vice president Albert Gore for president. Gore faced the tricky challenge of linking himself to Clinton-era peace and prosperity while at the same time distancing himself from his boss’s personal foibles. He chose as his running mate Connecticut senator Joseph Lieberman, an outspoken Clinton critic and the ﬁrst Jew nominated to a major national ticket. Their Republican challenger, George W. Bush, won the nomination on the strength of his father’s name and his years as governor of Texas. Bush surrounded himself with Washington insiders, including vice-presidential nominee Richard Cheney, and, in a clear jab at Clinton, promised to “restore dignity to the White House.” Rosy estimates that the federal budget would produce a surplus of some $2 trillion in the coming decade set the stage for the presidential contest. Echoing the Republican creed of smaller government, Bush argued for returning the budget surplus to “the people” through massive tax cuts and for promoting privatesector programs, such as school vouchers and a reliance on “faith-based” institutions to help the poor. Gore proposed smaller tax cuts, targeted at middleand lower-class people, and strengthening Social Security. In an era of peace, foreign policy ﬁgured hardly at all in the campaign, although Bush struck a moderate note when he urged that America should act like “a humble nation.” Pollsters predicted a close election, but none foresaw the epochal cliffhanger that the election would become. On election day the country split nearly evenly between the two candidates, and it was soon clear that Florida’s electoral votes would determine

 the winner. Television news programs announced that Bush had won the Sunshine State, and Al Gore called the Texas governor to concede defeat. Yet just an hour later, Gore’s camp decided that Florida was too close to call, and the vice president—in perhaps the most awkward phone call in modern politics—retracted his concession. What ensued was a ﬁve-week political standoff over how to count the votes in Florida. Democrats argued that some ballots were confusing or had been misread by machines and asked for recounts by hand in several counties. Republicans claimed that such recounts would amount to “changing the rules in the middle of the game” and thus thwart the rule of law. After weeks of legal bickering with the presidency in the balance, the Supreme Court ﬁ nally intervened. By a ﬁve-to-four vote along partisan lines, the Court reasoned that since neither Florida’s legislature nor its courts had established a uniform standard for evaluating disputed ballots, the hand counts amounted to an unconstitutional breach of the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause. That ruling gave Bush the White House but cast a dark shadow of illegitimacy over his presidency. Bush ofﬁcially won Florida by 537 votes out of 6 million cast, and he squeaked by in the Electoral College, 271 to 266 (see Maps 41.3 and 41.4). The national popular vote went decisively to Gore, 50,999,897 to 50,456,002. For the ﬁ rst time since 1888, a candidate won the White House with fewer popular votes than his opponent. Calls to abolish the Electoral College, however, were few and muted (see Art. V of the Constitution).

The 2.7 million popular votes won by Green party candidate and consumer activist Ralph Nader almost surely deprived Gore of victory, casting Nader in the role of spoiler. Bush’s failure to win the popular vote inspired critics to protest at his inauguration with placards reading “Hail to the Thief.”

Democratic candidate Albert Gore won a popular majority by carrying just 676 mostly urban counties, heavily populated by union members, minorities, and prosperous, educated white-collar workers. Republican George W. Bush won the election by taking 2,477 mostly rural counties, where feelings about “social issues” such as abortion and gun control ran high and shaped solid conservative constituencies.

George W. Bush as President


Bush Begins
 As the son of the forty-ﬁ rst president, George W. Bush (“43”) became the ﬁ rst presidential offspring since John Quincy Adams to reach the White House. Raised largely in Texas, the younger Bush publicly distanced himself from his family’s privileged New Eng land heritage and affected the chummy manner of a selfmade good ol’ boy—though he held degrees from Yale and Harvard. (His adversaries sniped that he had been born on third base and claimed to have hit a triple.) He promised to bring to Washington the conciliatory skills he had honed as the Republican governor of Texas, where he had worked well with the Democratic majority in the state’s legislature. But as president, Bush soon proved to be more of a divider than a uniter, less a “compassionate conservative” than a crusading ideologue. Religious traditionalists cheered but liberals jeered when he withdrew American support from international health programs that sanctioned abortion, advocated federally ﬁ nanced faith-based social-welfare initiatives, and sharply limited government-sponsored research on embryonic stem cells, which many scientists believed held the key to conquering diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. He pleased corporate chief-

 tains but angered environmentalists by challenging scientiﬁc ﬁndings on groundwater contamination and global warming, repudiating the Kyoto Treaty limiting greenhouse gas emissions (negotiated by the Clinton administration but never ratiﬁed by the Senate), advocating new oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on Alaska’s ecologically fragile north coast, and allowing Vice President Cheney to hammer out his administration’s energy policy in behindclosed-doors meetings with representatives of several giant oil companies. Even many ﬁscal conser vatives thought him reckless when he pressed ahead with a whopping $1.3 trillion tax cut. Together with a softening economy and the increasing costs of war in Iraq, the tax cut turned the federal budget surpluses of the late 1990s into yawning deﬁcits, reaching more than $400 billion in 2004 (see Figure 41.1).

Terrorism Comes to America
 On September 11, 2001, the long era of America’s impregnable national security violently ended. On a balmy late-summer morning, suicidal terrorists slammed two hijacked airliners, loaded with passengers and jet fuel, into the twin towers of New York City’s World Trade Center.

 nerve center of the Pentagon, near Washington, D.C., kill ing 189 people. Heroic passengers forced another hijacked aircraft to crash in rural Pennsylvania, killing all 44 aboard but depriving the terrorists of a fourth weapon of mass destruction. As the two giant New York skyscrapers thunderously collapsed, some three thousand innocent victims perished, including people of many races and faiths from more than sixty countries, as well as hundreds of New York’s policeand ﬁ re-department rescue workers. A stunned nation blossomed with ﬂags, as grieving and outraged Americans struggled to express their sorrow and solidarity in the face of the catastrophic terrorism of 9/11. President Bush responded with a sober and stirring address to Congress nine days later. His solemn demeanor and the gravity of the situation helped to dissipate the cloud of illegitimacy that had shadowed his presidency since the disputed election of 2000.

 While emphasizing his respect for the Islamic religion and Muslim people, he identiﬁed the principal enemy as Osama bin Laden, head of a shadowy terrorist network known as Al Qaeda (“the base” in Arabic). A wealthy extremist exiled from his native Saudi Arabia, bin Laden was associated with earlier attacks on American embassies in East Africa and on the USS Cole in Yemen. He had taken refuge in landlocked Afghanistan, ruled by Islamic fundamentalists called the Taliban. (Ironically, the United States had indirectly helped bring the Taliban to power by supporting religious rebels resisting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s.) Bin Laden was known to harbor venomous resentment toward the United States for its growing military presence in the Middle East (especially on the sacred soil of the Arabian Peninsula), and its unyielding support for Israel in the face of intensifying Palestinian nationalism. Bin Laden also fed on worldwide resentment of America’s enormous economic, military, and cultural power. Ironically, America’s most conspicuous strengths had made it a conspicuous target. When the Taliban refused to hand over bin Laden, Bush ordered a massive military campaign against Afghanistan. Within three months American and Afghan rebel forces had overthrown the Taliban but failed to ﬁ nd bin Laden, and Americans continued to live in fear of future attacks. Confronted with this unconventional, diffuse menace, antiterrorism experts called for new tactics of “asymmetrical warfare,” employing not just traditional military muscle but also innovative intelligence gathering, economic reprisals, inﬁ ltration of suspected orga ni zations, and even assassinations. The terrorists’ blows diabolically coincided with the onset of a recession. The already gathering economic downturn worsened as edgy Americans shunned air travel and the tourist industry withered. Then, while the rubble in New York was still smoldering, a handful of Americans died after receiving letters contaminated with the deadly respiratory disease anthrax. The perpetrators of the anthrax attacks remained unknown, but the gnawing fear spread that biological warfare might be the next threat facing the American people. In this anxious at mosphere, Congress in October 2001 rammed through the USA Patriot Act.* The act

 permitted extensive telephone and e-mail surveillance and authorized the detention and deportation of immigrants suspected of terrorism. Just over a year later, Congress created the new cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security to protect the nation’s borders and ferret out potential attackers. The Justice Department meanwhile rounded up hundreds of immigrants and held them without habeas corpus (formal charges in an open court). The Bush administration further called for trying suspected terrorists before military tribunals, where the usual rules of evidence and procedure did not apply. As hundreds of Taliban ﬁghters captured in Afghanistan languished in legal limbo and demoralizing isolation in the Guantánamo Detention Camp on the American military base at Guantánamo, Cuba, public-opinion polls showed Americans sharply divided on whether the terrorist threat fully warranted such drastic encroachments on America’s venerable tradition of protecting civil liberties. Catastrophic terrorism posed an unprecedented challenge to the United States. The events of that murderous September morning reanimated American patriotism, but they also brought a long chapter in American history to a dramatic climax. All but unique among modern peoples, Americans for nearly two centuries had been spared from foreign attack on their homeland. That unusual degree of virtually cost-free

 national security had undergirded the values of openness and individual freedom that deﬁ ned the distinctive character of American society. Now American security and American liberty alike were dangerously imperiled.

Bush Takes the Offensive
Against Iraq
 On only its second day in ofﬁce, the Bush administration warned that it would not tolerate Iraq’s continued deﬁance of United Nations weapons inspections, mandated after Iraq’s defeat in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had played hideand seek with the inspectors for years. In 1998 he had expelled both the U.N. Monitoring, Veriﬁcation, and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), inducing President Clinton, with congressional approval, to declare that Saddam’s removal (“regime change”) was an ofﬁcial goal of U.S. policy. But no sustained military action against Iraq had followed. Now, in the context of the new terrorist threat, the Bush administration focused on Iraq with a vengeance. In January 2002, just weeks after the September 11 attacks, Bush claimed that Iraq, along with Iran and North Korea, constituted an “axis of evil” that gravely menaced American security. Iran and North Korea were both known to be pursuing nuclear weapons programs, and Iran had long supported terrorist operations in the Middle East. But Iraqi tyrant Saddam Hussein, defeated but not destroyed by Bush’s father in 1991, became the principal object of the new president’s wrath. The elder Bush had carefully assembled a broad international coalition to ﬁght the 1991 Persian Gulf War. He had also spoken so often of “prudence” that late-night television comedians had mocked him for it. In contrast, his son was brashly determined to break with long-standing American traditions and wage a preemptive war against Iraq—and to go it alone if necessary. The younger Bush thus cast off his appeal for America to be a “humble nation” and stood revealed as a plunger, a daring risk-taker willing to embrace bold, dramatic policies, foreign as well as ﬁ scal. In that spirit Bush began laying plans for a war against Iraq, while somewhat halfheartedly pursuing diplomatic initiatives to avoid war. Itching for a ﬁght, and egged on by hawkish Vice President Cheney and other “neoconser vative” advis-

 ers, Bush accused the Iraqi regime of all manner of wrongdoing: oppressing its own people; frustrating the weapons inspectors; developing nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction referred to as “WMD”; and supporting terrorist orga ni zations like Al Qaeda. Perhaps most controversially, he also suggested that a liberated, democratized Iraq might provide a beacon of hope to the Islamic world and thereby begin to improve the political equation in the volatile Middle East. To skeptical observers, including America’s usually reliable European allies, the very multiplicity of Bush’s reasons for war cast doubt on his case, and his ambition to create a democracy in long-suffering Iraq seemed hopelessly utopian. Secretary of State Colin Powell urged caution, warning about the long-term consequences for the United States of invading and occupying an unstable, religiously and culturally divided nation of 25 million people. “You break it, you own it,” he told the president.

 In his 2002 state of the union address, President George W. Bush (b. 1946) declared:

“


 Iraq continues to ﬂaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens—leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections—then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world. “States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.

 Heavy majorities in both houses of Congress nevertheless passed a resolution in October 2002 authorizing the president to employ armed force to defend against Iraqi threats to America’s national security and to enforce United Nations resolutions regarding Iraq. A month later the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to give Iraq “a ﬁnal opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations.” There followed a months-long cat-and-mouse game. U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Iraq. Saddam once again harassed and blocked them. No weapons of mass destruction were found. The inspectors asked for more time. The United Nations declined to authorize the use of force to compel compliance. In this tense and confusing at mosphere, Bush, with Britain his only major ally, launched the longanticipated invasion of Iraq on March 19, 2003. Saddam Hussein’s vaunted military machine collapsed almost immediately. In less than a month, Baghdad had fallen and Saddam had been driven from power and hounded into hiding.

Chapter 41 America Confronts the Post–Cold War Era, 1992–2009


Owning Iraq
 President Bush’s words quickly came back to haunt him and America’s forces in Iraq. “Neoconser vative” pundits in Washington had predicted that American soldiers would be greeted as liberators and that Saddam’s ouster would lead to ﬂowering democracy across the Middle East. In reality post-Saddam Iraq quickly devolved into a seething cauldron of violence. The country’s largest ethnic groups, Sunni and Shia Muslims, clashed violently, especially in the capital city of Baghdad. Both groups attacked American forces, who after their leaders disbanded the Iraqi army, were left to secure the country single-handedly. A locally grown insurgency quickly spread, and occupying Iraq be-

 came ever more perilous for American troops. Hatred for Americans only worsened with revelations in April 2004 that Iraqi prisoners in Baghdad’s Abu Ghraib prison had been tortured and humiliated by their American captors. Amid this chaos, jihadist terrorists from around the region ﬂooded into Iraq and established strong positions there, often fueling the intraIraqi conﬂ icts to further their own radical Islamist vision. Although Al Qaeda had had no link to Iraq under Saddam, as Bush had falsely alleged, the organization certainly moved in afterward. These three battles— Shia-Sunni ethnic violence, counter-occupation insurgency, and jihadist terrorism—created a ceaseless cycle of bloodshed, in which American soldiers found themselves increasingly bogged down. By the end of 2006, more Americans had died in Iraq than in the at-

A
Divided Nation 

 In his 1998 book, A World Transformed, former president George H. W. Bush (b. 1924) explained his rationale for not driving Saddam Hussein from power during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. His words made sobering reading in the context of his son’s subsequent invasion of Iraq:

“


 Trying to eliminate Saddam . . . would have incurred incalculable human and political costs. . . . The coalition would instantly have collapsed, the Arabs deserting it in anger and other allies pulling out as well. Under the circumstances, there was no viable ‘exit strategy’ we could see, violating another of our principles. Furthermore, we had been self-consciously trying to set a pattern for handling aggression in the post–Cold War world. Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the United Nations’ mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression that we hoped to establish.

”


 tacks of September 11. (see “Thinking Globally: America Through Foreign Eyes: Hyperpower or Hapless Power?” pp. 1074–1075). The political situation in the war-torn country took shape unevenly on shaky ground. In the summer of 2004, the American military ceded political power and limited sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government. National elections followed in early 2005, and millions of Iraqis voted for a national assembly to draft a constitution. After a referendum vote on the constitution in October 2005, another round of elections chose parliamentary representatives, a prime minister, and a president. But under the seeming stability of Iraq’s new democratic government lay deep, violent tensions. Sunni Muslims, the minority that had held power under Saddam Hussein, one of their own, feared reprisals and repressions under a majority Shia government. Sunnis largely boycotted the ﬁ rst election and tried unsuccessfully to block the ratiﬁcation of the constitution. Unsuccessful at the ballot box, many Sunnis turned to bombings and political assassinations.



Reelecting George W. Bush
 Americans had rarely been as divided as they were in the ﬁ rst years of the twenty-ﬁ rst century. Civil libertarians worried that the government was trampling on personal freedoms in the name of ﬁghting terrorism. Revelations in 2002 about ﬂagrant corporate fraud at energy giant Enron, telecommunications titan WorldCom, and other prominent ﬁ rms fed rampant popular disillusion with the business community. Cultural tensions brewed over the rights of gay and lesbian Americans when leaders in San Francisco and Massachusetts permitted same-sex couples to marry in 2004. Afﬁ rmative action continued to spark sharp debate, as the Supreme Court permitted some preferential treatment in admitting minority undergraduate and law students to the University of Michigan in 2003. Amid this division George W. Bush positioned himself to run for reelection. He proclaimed that his tax cuts had spurred economic growth by giving citizens more control. Targeting what he called “the soft bigotry of low expectations,” he championed the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, which mandated sanctions against schools that failed to meet federal performance standards. He played to cultural conser vatives in opposing stem cell research (see page 1067) and called for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. But most of all, he promoted himself as a stalwart leader in wartime, warning the country not to “change horses midstream.” After a bruising round of primary elections, the embattled Democrats chose lanky and long-jawed Massachusetts senator John Kerry to represent their ticket. A more old-fashioned liberal than Clinton, Kerry pushed progressive visions of government and counted on his Vietnam War record to counter charges that he would be weak in the face of terrorism. But that plan backﬁ red as Kerry fell under attack for his very public opposition to Vietnam once he had returned from battle in the early 1970s. The Republicans also had success painting the senator as a “ﬂ ip-ﬂopper,” changing his policy positions to ﬁt opinion polls. In spite of increased public misgivings about the war in Iraq, Bush nailed down a decisive victory in November 2004. He received the ﬁ rst popular vote majority in more than a decade—60,639,281 to 57,355,978—and won clearly, if by only one state (this time Ohio), in the Electoral College, 286 to 252 (see Map 41.6). This time his mandate was clear, constitutional, and uncontested.

THINKING GLOBALLY

America Through Foreign Eyes: Hyperpower or
Hapless Power?


W


 hen the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, the Cold War concluded at last. So did an era in the history of American foreign policy, and in the history of the international order. For nearly half a century following World War II, the confrontation with the Soviets had deeply shaped Americans’ conception of themselves—their national identity—as well as their role and reputation in the wider world. In the long twilight struggle against Soviet communism, they had accumulated unprecedented economic, military, and cultural might, and had taken virtuous pride in themselves as the global champions of democracy, justice, and human rights. Now, as the sole surviving “superpower,” they faced no counterbalancing regime and, apparently, no check on their national ambitions. The United States seemed to wield all but limitless power to mold the international environment as it wished. Not since the days of ancient Rome did any people bestride the world so unopposed. Not everyone welcomed the emergence of this international colossus. Australians grumbled that the United States was a “tall poppy” that needed to be cut down to size. French foreign minister Hubert Védrine coined a new term when he described the United States in 1999 not merely as a superpower but as a “hyperpower,” one “that is

 dominant or predominant in all categories,” including not only the traditional domains of politics, economics, and the military, but even including “attitudes, concepts, languages, and modes of life.” He called upon Europeans to create an alternative to the American “steamroller,” to “work in favor of real multilateralism against unilateralism, for balanced multipolarism against unipolarism, for cultural diversity against uniformity.” In the parlance of international relations, Védrine was promoting a “balancing” strategy to cope with U.S. power, rather than the “bandwagon” strategy of simply submitting to American hegemony and making the most of it. Notably, he was not proposing outright opposition. As the last days of the twentieth century slipped through the hourglass, American power surely looked formidable. The United States was the world’s third most populous nation (after China and India), enjoyed the world’s largest economy (more than three times larger than second-ranked Japan), was the acknowledged global leader in high-tech information and biomedical innovations, and spent more on its armed forces than the rest of the world combined. Yet the realities of American power were somewhat less imposing. Uncle Sam struggled to ﬁnd solid footing in the post–Cold War international arena.

Torture at Abu Ghraib Prison,
Baghdad, 2003
 Revelations that American soldiers had brutally tortured Iraqi prisoners contributed to condemnation of the nation’s disregard for human rights and growing disquiet about America’s unilateral policing of the world.



 Washington in the 1990s badly botched a peacekeeping mission in lawless Somalia; stood by helplessly as genocidal militias murdered about a million Rwandans; dithered over how to stabilize chaotic Haiti; fumbled indecisively as nationalist and sectarian violence convulsed the former Balkan nation of Yugoslavia; found no effective response to terrorist attacks on New York City’s World Trade Center, the destroyer USS Cole, and American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania; and notoriously failed to bring any conclusion to the decades-old confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians, who erupted in a bloody intifada (rebellion) against the Jewish state in 2000. The barbarous Al Qaeda assault that ﬁnally toppled the twin towers of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, momentarily brought an outpouring of sympathy from an astonished and outraged world—and also brought a dramatic shift in American foreign policy. Even Le Monde, France’s leading newspaper, declared that in this dangerous hour “Nous sommes tous Américains” (We are all Americans). For the ﬁrst time in history, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) invoked the treaty’s Article Five, conﬁrming that an attack on one member was an attack on all members. But such sentiments proved short-lived. When President George W. Bush in 2002 asserted a new right of preemptive war and then proceeded to invade Iraq for what looked to many observers like the most dubious of reasons,

Table 41.1


 anti-American sentiment swelled the world over. In February 2002 some 10 million people in sixty countries demonstrated against the impending U.S. invasion of Iraq. Exacerbated by Washington’s rejection of the Kyoto Treaty dealing with global warming, and by several American states’ continuing embrace of the death penalty (which had largely disappeared in Europe and elsewhere), America’s standing deteriorated even among its traditional allies and sank to rock-bottom lows in Islamic countries. Simmering resentment over the detention of hundreds of captured Afghans at the U.S. military base in Guantánamo, Cuba; revelations about human rights abuses inﬂicted by American troops on Iraqi prisoners at Baghdad’s Abu Ghraib prison; and “rendition” by American agents of suspected terrorists to the notoriously cruel security ser vices of other countries further drained the depleted reservoirs of America’s moral and political capital. Once a moral beacon and political inspiration to a suffering world, the United States in the early twenty-ﬁrst century had come to be regarded by millions of people the world over as a moral scourge and a political and military danger (see Table 41.1). Recapturing its stature as a legitimate world leader, rebuilding its alliances, restructuring the myriad multilateral institutions it had worked so hard to build in the Cold War era, and recapturing a sense of itself as a just and humane society were tasks that urgently confronted the Republic as the century advanced.

The Election of 2004


 Bush’s Second Term Reelection, George W. Bush announced, gave him “political capital,” which he intended to spend on an aggressive domestic agenda. The appointment of two new conser vative Supreme Court justices upon the retirement of Sandra Day O’Connor and the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist seemed to bode well for his ambitions. But Bush overplayed his hand. Attacking the core of New Deal liberalism, Bush proposed a radical program to privatize much of Social Security, providing incentives for younger Americans to fund their own retirements through personal accounts. A massive outcry led by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and other liberal groups reminded Americans how much they loved Social Security, warts and all. Bush’s proposal faded away within six months of his reelection. The same fate befell a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, which had been a major “values” issue in the 2004 campaign. The president also took aim at the contentious issue of immigration reform, where he parted company with the conser vative wing of his party. Bush opposed arresting and deporting the nearly 12 million undocumented people in the United States, as some nativists proposed. At the same time, he felt that simply nor-



 malizing their status would reward them for entering the country illegally. His compromise plan to establish a guest-worker program and a “path to citizenship” for the undocumented ended up pleasing no one. Congress rejected it in the summer of 2007, and the issue was dead for the rest of Bush’s term (see p. 1095). very second-term president since the 1960s had seen scandal mar his later years in ofﬁce. Nixon had Watergate, Reagan had Iran-contra, and Clinton had Lewinsky. The Bush White House was no exception, but this time the accusations were political, not personal. Bush’s critics claimed that the president’s ﬁerce loyalty to his staff prevented him from recognizing incompetence and that he had unlawfully expanded the power of the presidency under the guise of protecting America in the “War on Terror.” In the fall of 2005, Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff was convicted of perjury in an investigation into the source of a leak that had exposed the identity of an undercover CIA agent as political retaliation against her antiwar husband. In December of that year, journalists discovered that the government was conducting illegal wiretap surveillance on American citizens inside the United States in violation of federal law. In 2007 scandal engulfed the Justice Department over the ﬁ ring, for political reasons, of eight U.S. attorneys. Perhaps the most tragic and avoidable of Bush’s missteps came in the botched response to the deadly Hurricane Katrina,

After the Levees Broke in
New Orleans, August 2005
 When ferocious Hurricane Katrina hammered the Gulf Coast, it overtaxed a deﬁcient levee system and unleashed ﬂoodwaters into New Orleans, submerging 80 percent of the city and destroying more than a quartermillion of its homes. Many families unable or unwilling to ﬂee the city sought refuge in the Superdome, where water, food, and other supplies were soon in very short supply. Experts predicted that it would be years before the city fully recovered, if ever.

 which devastated New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast in late August 2005, ﬂooding 80 percent of the historic city and causing over 1,300 deaths and $150 billion in damages.

Midterm Elections of 2006
 As charges of dictatorial power-grabbing, cronyism, and incompetence mounted during Bush’s second term, Democrats campaigned hard against the president and his party in the midterm elections of 2006. Republicans fell victim to the same anti-incumbency sentiment they had ridden to power twelve years earlier, as Democrats charged that a “culture of corruption” had taken hold in Washington. A series of highproﬁ le arrests and resignations over lobbying, graft, illegal campaign ﬁ nancing, and sexual misconduct among Republican legislators added fuel to the Democrats’ ﬁ re. Democrats narrowly regained control of both houses of Congress for the ﬁrst time since the Gingrich revolution of 1994 (see p. 1059). New Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the ﬁrst woman to hold that post, promised a new era of reform, openness, and a check on the Bush administration. The biggest factor in the Democratic sweep was the perceived mishandling of the war in Iraq. Public approval of the president’s management of the war had declined steadily since early 2005 as the American death toll continued to rise. Prewar claims about

 WMD and Iraq’s connections to Al Qaeda and 9/11 had all proved false. By late 2005 a majority of Americans believed that the war had been a mistake. Even more felt that the Bush administration, particularly the Defense Department under Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, had badly mismanaged events on the ground. Rumsfeld resigned after the Republicans’ “thumping” in the 2006 midterm elections. But the quagmire continued. The Bush administration attempted to bridge it in early 2007 by sending a “surge” of twenty thousand new troops to Iraq to battle insurgents. Though the surge appeared to bring a modest measure of stability to Iraq, as the 2008 election cycle got under way, public opinion solidiﬁed against the war. The major question was how the United States could extract itself while at the same time avoid leaving in its wake a genocidal civil war.

Election of 2008
 The election of 2008 was historic from the beginning. George W. Bush had twice selected Dick Cheney as his running mate for his experience and lack of political ambition after leaving the vice presidency. In his late sixties and with a history of heart problems, Cheney never had any intention of running for president himself. With neither the sitting president nor vice president running, the 2008 election was truly “open” for the ﬁ rst time in 80 years.

The Surge in Iraq


European Disapproval of the Iraq War, 2007


The Presidential Election
 of 2008 With President Bush’s popularity ratings dropping to historic lows, a large ﬁeld of Democratic candidates dove into the primary campaign of 2008 smelling Republican blood in the electoral waters. The Democratic race soon tightened into a ﬁercely fought contest between the 46-year-old, ﬁ rst-term Illinois Senator Barack Obama and the pre-campaign favorite, former First



Lady and New York Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 The ensuing battle, destined to catapult either a black man or a woman into the general election as a major party nominee for the ﬁ rst time, split the party but drew millions of new voters into the Democratic primaries. Obama narrowly prevailed, surviving Clinton’s attacks on his inexperience. Son of a black Kenyan father and a white mother from Kansas, Obama appealed to both the crusading spirit of the civil rights era of old and the newer ethos of tolerance that came more easily to the young in twentieth-ﬁ rst century America. He also capitalized on an army of smartly managed volunteers, a record of early opposition to the war in Iraq, and an astonishing gift for eloquence that he used to advocate a “post-partisan” politics appealing to voters weary of the divisive partisanship of the Bush years. To strengthen his national security credentials, he picked foreign-policy savvy Delaware Senator Joseph Biden as his running mate. In keeping with the country’s anti-Bush mood, Republicans nominated longtime Arizona Senator John McCain, aged 72, a self-styled “maverick” with a record of supporting bipartisan legislation on such issues as normalizing relations with North Vietnam, campaign ﬁ nance, and immigration reform. He had launched his political career as a Vietnam War hero who had endured years of torture as a POW. To rally the conservative and Christian Evangelical wing of his party, quite

And Then There Were
Two, February 2008
 Eight candidates competed for the Democratic nomination in primaries and caucuses beginning in January 2008. By the time of this debate at the University of Texas at Austin in February, only Illinois senator Barack Obama and New York senator Hillary Clinton remained in the race.

 cool to his candidacy, McCain picked Sarah Palin as his running mate. The former beauty queen, small-town mayor, self-proclaimed “hockey-mom,” and staunch abortion rights opponent had served only twenty-one months as Alaska’s governor. As McCain hoped, she galvanized the right-wing Republican base. But when interview gaffes exposed her weak grasp of the issues, Palin became fodder for late-night television comedians and, polls showed, at least as much a liability as an asset to the Republican ticket. Armed with an unprecedented war chest of nearly 700 million dollars, mostly raised from small donors via the Internet, Obama seized the advantage in both the “air war” (television) and the “ground war” (his legions of volunteers). His strong performance in televised debates also lent him an aura of gravitas some voters had doubted he had. What appeared to bolster his chances most, however, was the worldwide economic meltdown in the ﬁ nal six weeks of the campaign. The American housing price bubble had begun to burst in 2006, which in turn led to a huge wave of mortgage defaults, housing foreclosures, and declines in a vast array of mortgage-backed securities held by banks around the globe. Financial institutions from Tokyo to New York to London found themselves with too much debt and too little capital to provide the everyday credit banks worldwide need to function. By early October the credit markets froze, stock values plummeted, and householders watched helplessly as their savings shrunk. Economists of every stripe spoke of the gravest ﬁ nancial crisis, since the Great Depression. In contrast to the 1929 crash, it took days, not years, for a terriﬁed Bush Administration to intervene on a gi-

 gantic scale. The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve System nationalized the countries’ two biggest mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and took over the world’s biggest insurance company, AIG. WA MT

 Map 41.7 Presidential Election of 2008 A record voter turnout, swelled by millions of young new voters, African Americans, and Latinos, gave Senator Barack Obama an Electoral College landslide and the Democratic Party solid control of both houses of Congress. Obama redrew the electoral map by taking nine states won by George W. Bush in 2004. Interactive Map

The Surge in Iraq


 Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson then persuaded Congress to authorize a whopping 700 billion dollars to buy “toxic” mortgages and inject cash directly into the nation’s biggest banks. Suddenly even small-government Republicans spoke of the need to regulate the ﬁnancial sector. This crisis presented the presidential candidates with a challenge and an opportunity. Obama criticized McCain’s plan to extend, and even deepen, the Bush tax cuts, as evidence that the McCain presidency would be “a third Bush term.” McCain countered that Obama’s proposed tax hikes (on the wealthiest 5 percent of households) and plans for big public investments in alternative energy and infrastructure repair were tantamount to “socialism.”



 Huge voter turnouts delivered a historic victory to Barack Obama, who won 53 percent of the national popular vote. By overtaking his rival in such traditional Republican strongholds such as Virginia, Nevada, and Colorado, Obama prevailed in the Electoral College 364 to 175 (see Map 41.7). Democrats gained seats in the House and Senate to enlarge the Congressional majority they had won in 2006. Obama’s election opened a new chapter in the history of country’s race relations. It also presented the nation’s ﬁ rst African American president the daunting challenge of governing a country struggling with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and entering its roughest economic waters since the 1930s.

The American People
Face a New Century





 As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.

W


 ell beyond its two-hundredth birthday as the twenty-ﬁ rst century began, the United States was both an old and a new nation. It boasted one of the longest uninterrupted traditions of democratic government of any country on earth. Indeed, it had pioneered the techniques of mass democracy and was, in that sense, the oldest modern polity. As one of the earliest countries to industrialize, America had also dwelt in the modern economic era longer than most nations. But the Republic was in many ways still youthful as well. Innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking— all characteristics of youth—were honored national values. The twenty-ﬁ rst century began much like the twentieth, with American society continuing to be rejuvenated by fresh waves of immigrants, full of energy and ambition. The U.S. economy, despite problems, pulsated as a driv ing engine of world economic growth. American inventions—especially computer and communications technologies—were transforming the face of global society. Consumers from Lisbon to Tokyo seemed to worship the icons of American culture—

 downing soft drinks and donning blue jeans, watching Hollywood ﬁ lms, listening to rock or country music, even adopting indigenous American sports like baseball and basketball. In the realm of consumerism, American products appeared to have Coca-Colonized the globe. The history of American society also seemed to have increased global signiﬁcance as the third millennium of the Christian era opened. Americans were a pluralistic people who had struggled for centuries to provide opportunity and to achieve tolerance and justice for many different religious, ethnic, and racial groups. Their historical experience could offer valuable lessons to the rapidly internationalizing planetary society that was emerging at the dawn of the twenty-ﬁ rst century. Much history remained to be made as the country entered its third century of nationhood. The great social experiment of American democracy was far from completed as the United States faced its future. Astonishing breakthroughs in science and technology,
