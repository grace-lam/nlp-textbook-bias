 perpetuate a type of medievalism that had died out in Europe—or was rapidly dying out.* Mark Twain later accused Sir Walter Scott of having had a hand in starting the Civil War. The British novelist, Twain said, aroused the southerners to ﬁght for a decaying social structure—“a sham civilization.” The plantation system also shaped the lives of southern women. The mistress of a great plantation commanded a sizable household staff of mostly female slaves. She gave daily orders to cooks, maids, seamstresses, laundresses, and body servants. Relationships between mistresses and slaves ranged from affectionate to atrocious. Some mistresses showed tender regard for their bondswomen, and some slave women took pride in their status as “members” of the household. But slavery strained even the bonds of womanhood. Virtually no slaveholding women believed in abolition, and relatively few protested when the husbands and children of their slaves were sold. One plantation mistress harbored a special affection for her slave Annica but noted in her diary that “I whipt Annica” for insolence.

Slaves of the Slave System
 Unhappily, the moonlight-and-magnolia tradition concealed much that was worrisome, distasteful, and sordid. Plantation agriculture was wasteful, largely because King Cotton and his money-hungry subjects despoiled the good earth. Quick proﬁts led to excessive cultiva-

 tion, or “land butchery,” which in turn caused a heavy leakage of population to the West and Northwest. The economic structure of the South became increasingly monopolistic. As the land wore thin, many small farmers sold their holdings to more prosperous neighbors and went north or west. The big got bigger and the small smaller. When the Civil War ﬁ nally erupted, a large percentage of southern farms had passed from the hands of the families that had originally cleared them. Another cancer in the bosom of the South was the ﬁ nancial instability of the plantation system. The temptation to overspeculate in land and slaves caused many planters, including Andrew Jackson in his later years, to plunge in beyond their depth. Although the black slaves might in extreme cases be fed for as little as ten cents a day, there were other expenses. The slaves

 Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) wrote in 1786,

“


 What a stupendous, what an incomprehensible machine is man! Who can endure toil, famine, stripes, imprisonment & death itself in vindication of his own liberty, and the next moment . . . inﬂict on his fellow men a bondage, one hour of which is fraught with more misery than ages of that which he rose in rebellion to oppose.

”


 Unlike George Washington, Jefferson freed only a couple of his slaves in his will; the rest were sold to pay off his large debts.

Problems in the Cotton South


 Basil Hall (1788–1844), an Englishman, visited part of the cotton belt on a river steamer (1827–1828). Noting the preoccupation with cotton, he wrote,

“


 All day and almost all night long, the captain, pilot, crew, and passengers were talking of nothing else; and sometimes our ears were so wearied with the sound of cotton! cotton! cotton! that we gladly hailed a fresh inundation of company in hopes of some change—but alas! . . . ‘What’s cotton at?’ was the ﬁrst eager inquiry. ‘Ten cents [a pound ],’ ‘Oh, that will never do!’

”




 dug with Yankee shovels. The South furnished the corpse and the hole in the ground. The Cotton Kingdom also repelled large-scale European immigration, which added so richly to the manpower and wealth of the North. In 1860 only 4.4 percent of the southern population was foreign-born, as compared with 18.7 percent for the North. German and Irish immigration to the South was generally discouraged by the competition of slave labor, by the high cost of fertile land, and by European ignorance of cotton growing. The diverting of non-British immigration to the North caused the white South to become the most Anglo-Saxon section of the nation.

The White Majority


 represented a heavy investment of capital, perhaps $1,200 each in the case of prime ﬁeld hands, and they might deliberately injure themselves or run away. An entire slave quarter might be wiped out by disease or even by lightning, as happened in one instance to twenty ill-fated blacks. Dominance by King Cotton likewise led to a dangerous dependence on a one-crop economy, whose price level was at the mercy of world conditions. The whole system discouraged a healthy diversiﬁcation of agriculture and particularly of manufacturing. Southern planters resented watching the North grow fat at their expense. They were pained by the heavy outward ﬂow of commissions and interest to northern middlemen, bankers, agents, and shippers. True souls of the South, especially by the 1850s, deplored the fact that when born, they were wrapped in Yankee-made swaddling clothes and that they spent the rest of their lives in servitude to Yankee manufacturing. When they died, they were laid in cofﬁ ns held together with Yankee nails and were buried in graves

 Only a handful of southern whites lived in Grecianpillared mansions. Below those 1,733 families in 1850 who owned a hundred or more slaves were the less wealthy slaveowners (see Figure 16.1). They totaled in 1850 some 345,000 families, representing about 1,725,000 white persons. Over two-thirds of these families— 255,268 in all—owned fewer than ten slaves each. All told, only about one-fourth of white southerners owned slaves or belonged to a slaveowning family. The smaller slaveowners did not own a majority of the slaves, but they made up a majority of the masters. These lesser masters were typically small farmers. With the striking exception that their households contained a slave or two, or perhaps an entire slave family, the style of their lives probably resembled that of small farmers in the North more than it did that of the southern planter aristocracy. They lived in modest farmhouses and sweated beside their bondsmen in the cotton ﬁelds, laboring callus for callus just as hard as their slaves. Beneath the slaveowners on the population pyramid was the great body of whites who owned no slaves at all. By 1860 their numbers had swelled to 6,120,825—

 1,733 own 100 or more slaves 6,196 own 50–99 29,733 own 20–49 54,595 own 10 –19 80,765 own 5–9 105,683 own 2– 4 68,820 own 1 each

Figure 16.1 Slaveowning Families, 1850
 More than half of all slaveholding families owned fewer than four slaves. In contrast, 2 percent of slaveowners owned more than ﬁfty slaves each. A tiny slaveholding elite held a majority of slave property in the South. The great majority of white southerners owned no slaves at all.

 three-quarters of all southern whites. Shouldered off the richest bottomlands by the mighty planters, they scratched a simple living from the thinner soils of the backcountry and the mountain valleys (see Maps 16.1 and 16.2). To them the riches of the Cotton Kingdom were a distant dream, and they often sneered at the

 lordly pretensions of the cotton “snobocracy.” These red-necked farmers participated in the market economy scarcely at all. As subsistence farmers, they raised corn and hogs, not cotton, and often lived isolated lives, punctuated periodically by extended socializing and sermonizing at religious camp meetings.

Chapter 16 The South and the Slavery Controversy, 1793–1860


 Some of the least prosperous nonslaveholding whites were scorned even by slaves as “poor white trash.” Known also as “hillbillies,” “crackers,” or “clay eaters,” they were often described as listless, shiftless, and misshapen. Later investigations have revealed that many of them were not simply lazy but sick, suffering from malnutrition and parasites, especially hookworm. All these whites without slaves had no direct economic stake in the preservation of slavery, yet they were among the stoutest defenders of the slave system. Why? The answer is not far to seek. The carrot on the stick ever dangling before their eyes was the hope of buying a slave or two and of parlaying their paltry holdings into riches—all in accord with the “American dream” of upward social mobility. They also took ﬁerce pride in their presumed racial superiority, which would be watered down if the slaves were freed. Many of the poorer whites were hardly better off economically than the slaves; some, indeed, were not so well-off. But even the most wretched whites could take perverse comfort from the knowledge that they outranked someone in status: the still more wretched African American slave. Thus did the logic of economics join with the illogic of racism in buttressing the slave system. In a special category among white southerners were the mountain whites, more or less marooned in the valleys of the Appalachian range that stretched from western Virginia to northern Georgia and Alabama. Civilization had largely passed them by, and they still lived under spartan frontier conditions. They were a kind of living ancestry, for some of them retained Elizabethan speech forms and habits that had long since died out in Britain. As independent small farmers, hundreds of miles distant from the heart of the Cotton Kingdom and

 “Arthur Lee, Freeman,” petitioned the General Assembly of Virginia in 1835 for permission to remain in the state despite a law against the residency of free blacks. After asserting his upstanding moral character, he implored,

“


 He therefore most respectfully and earnestly prays that you will pass a law permitting him on the score of long and meritorious service to remain in the State, together with his wife and four children, and not force him in his old age to seek a livelihood in a new Country.

”


 rarely if ever in sight of a slave, these mountain whites had little in common with the whites of the ﬂatlands. Many of them, including future president Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, hated both the haughty planters and their gangs of blacks. They looked upon the impending strife between North and South as “a rich man’s war but a poor man’s ﬁght.” When the war came, the tough-ﬁbered mountain whites constituted a vitally important peninsula of Unionism jutting down into the secessionist Southern sea. They ultimately played a signiﬁcant role in crippling the Confederacy. Their attachment to the Union party of Abraham Lincoln was such that for generations after the Civil War, the only concentrated Republican strength in the solid South was to be found in the southern highlands.

Free Blacks:
Slaves Without Masters
 Precarious in the extreme was the standing of the South’s free blacks, who numbered about 250,000 by 1860. In the upper South, the free black population traced its origins to a wavelet of emancipation inspired by the idealism of Revolutionary days. In the deeper South, many free blacks were mulattoes, usually the emancipated children of a white planter and his black mistress. Throughout the South were some free blacks who had purchased their freedom with earnings from labor after hours. Many free blacks owned property, especially in New Orleans, where a sizable mulatto community prospered. Some, such as William T. Johnson, the “barber of Natchez,” even owned slaves. He was the master of ﬁ fteen bondsmen; his diary records that in June 1848 he ﬂogged two slaves and a mule. The free blacks in the South were a kind of “third race.” These people were prohibited from working in certain occupations and forbidden from testifying against whites in court. They were always vulnerable to being hijacked back into slavery by unscrupulous slave traders. As free men and women, they were walking examples of what might be achieved by emancipation and hence were resented and detested by defenders of the slave system. Free blacks were also unpopular in the North, where about another 250,000 of them lived. Several states forbade their entrance, most denied them the right to vote, and some barred blacks from public schools. In 1835 New Hampshire farmers hitched their oxen to a small schoolhouse that had dared to enroll fourteen black children and dragged it into a swamp. Northern blacks

 were especially hated by the pick-and-shovel Irish immigrants, with whom they competed for menial jobs. Much of the agitation in the North against the spread of slavery into the new territories in the 1840s and 1850s grew out of race prejudice, not humanitarianism. Antiblack feeling was in fact frequently stronger in the North than in the South. The gifted and eloquent former slave Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist and self-educated orator of rare power, was several times mobbed and beaten by northern rowdies. It was sometimes observed that white southerners, who were often suckled and reared by black nurses, liked the black as an individual but despised the race. The white northerner, on the other hand, often professed to like the race but disliked individual blacks.

Plantation Slavery
 In society’s basement in the South of 1860 were nearly 4 million black human chattels. Their numbers had A Market in People (left) Held captive in a net, a slave sits on the Congo shore, waiting to be sold and shipped.

 quadrupled since the dawn of the century, as the booming cotton economy created a seemingly unquenchable demand for slave labor. Legal importation of African slaves into America ended in 1808, when Congress outlawed slave imports. Britain had abolished the slave trade (but not slavery itself) in 1807, a milestone in the continuing struggle to establish human rights as a principle of international law. In the decades thereafter, the Royal Navy’s West Africa Squadron seized hundreds of slave ships and freed thousands of grateful captives. Yet despite that effort, as many as 3 million enslaved Africans were shipped to Brazil and the West Indies in the several decades after 1807. In the United States, the price of “black ivory” was so high in the years before the Civil War that uncounted thousands of blacks were smuggled into the South, despite the death penalty for slavers. Although several slave traders were captured, southern juries repeatedly acquitted them. Only one slave trader, N. P. Gordon, was ever executed, and this took place in New York in 1862, the second year of the Civil War.



Chapter 16 The South and the Slavery Controversy, 1793–1860


 Ironically, the suppression of the international slave trade fostered the growth of a vigorous internal slave trade, as upper South states like Virginia became major sources of supply for the booming cotton economy of the Deep South. Most of the increase in the slave population in the United States came not from imports, but from natural reproduction—a fact that owed something to the accident of geography that the slave South lay outside the area where tropical diseases took such a grisly human toll. The natural reproduction of enslaved African Americans also distinguished North American slavery from slavery in more southerly New World societies and implied much about the tenor of the slave regime and the conditions of family life under slavery in the United States. Above all, the planters regarded their slaves as investments, into which they had sunk nearly $2 billion of their capital by 1860. Slaves were the primary form of wealth in the South, and as such they were cared for as any asset is cared for by a prudent capitalist. Accordingly, they were sometimes, though by no means always, spared dangerous work, like putting a roof on a

 house. If a neck was going to be broken, the master preferred it to be that of a wage-earning Irish laborer rather than that of a prime ﬁeld hand, worth $1,800 by 1860 (a price that had quintupled since 1800). Tunnel blasting and swamp draining were often consigned to itinerant gangs of expendable Irishmen because those perilous tasks were “death on niggers and mules.” Slavery was proﬁtable for the great planters, though it hobbled the economic development of the region as a whole. The proﬁts from the cotton boom sucked ever more slaves from the upper to the lower South, so that by 1860 the Deep South states of South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana each had a majority or near-majority of blacks and accounted for about half of all slaves in the South. Breeding slaves in the way that cattle are bred was not openly encouraged. But thousands of blacks from the soil-exhausted slave states of the Old South, espe-

Life Under Slavery


 cially tobacco-depleted Virginia, were “sold down the river” to toil as ﬁeld-gang laborers on the cotton frontier of the lower Mississippi Valley. Women who bore thirteen or fourteen babies were prized as “rattlin’ good breeders,” and some of these fecund females were promised their freedom when they had produced ten. White masters all too frequently would force their attentions on female slaves, fathering a sizable mulatto population, most of which remained enchained. Slave auctions were brutal sights. The open selling of human ﬂesh under the hammer, sometimes with cattle and horses, was among the most revolting aspects of slavery. On the auction block, families were separated with distressing frequency, usually for economic reasons such as bankruptcy or the division of “property” among heirs. The sundering of families in this fashion was perhaps slavery’s greatest psychological horror. Abolitionists decried the practice, and Harriet Beecher Stowe seized on the emotional power of

 In 1852 Maria Perkins, a woman enslaved in Virginia, wrote plaintively to her husband about the disruption that the commercial trafﬁc in slaves was visiting upon their family:

“

”




 this theme by putting it at the heart of the plot of her acclaimed 1852 novel, Uncle Tom’s Cabin.

Life Under the Lash
 White southerners often romanticized about the happy life of their singing, dancing, banjo-strumming, joyful “darkies.” But how did the slaves actually live? There is no simple answer to this question. Conditions varied greatly from region to region, from large plantation to small farm, and from master to master. Everywhere, of course, slavery meant hard work, ignorance, and oppression. The slaves—both men and women—usually toiled from dawn to dusk in the ﬁelds, under the watchful eyes and ready whip-hand of a white overseer or black “driver.” They had no civil or political rights, other than minimal protection from arbitrary murder or unusually cruel punishment. Some states offered further protections, such as banning the sale of a child under the age of ten away from his or her mother. But all such laws were difﬁcult to enforce, since slaves were forbidden to testify in court or even to have their marriages legally recognized. Floggings were common, for the whip was the substitute for the wage-incentive system and the most visible symbol of the planter’s mastery. Strong-willed slaves were sometimes sent to breakers, whose technique consisted mostly in lavish laying on of the lash. As an abolitionist song of the 1850s lamented, To-night the bond man, Lord Is bleeding in his chains; And loud the falling lash is heard On Carolina’s plains! But savage beatings made sullen laborers, and lash marks hurt resale values. There are, to be sure, sadistic monsters in any population, and the planter class contained its share. But the typical planter had too much of his own prosperity riding on the backs of his slaves to beat them bloody on a regular basis. By 1860 most slaves were concentrated in the black belt of the Deep South that stretched from South Carolina and Georgia into the new southwest states of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. This was the region of the southern frontier, into which the explosively growing Cotton Kingdom had burst in a few short decades. As on all frontiers, life was often rough and raw, and in general the lot of the slave was harder here than in the more settled areas of the Old South.



Chapter 16 The South and the Slavery Controversy, 1793–1860


 The Cruelty of Slavery Slaveowners used devices like this collar with bells to discipline and patrol their slaves. This female slave shown toiling in New Orleans has such a collar riveted around her neck, designed to prevent her from hiding from her master or escaping.

 A majority of blacks lived on larger plantations that harbored communities of twenty or more slaves. In some counties of the Deep South, especially along the lower Mississippi River, blacks accounted for more than 75 percent of the population. There the family life of slaves tended to be relatively stable, and a distinctive African American slave culture developed. Forced separations of spouses, parents, and children were evidently more common on smaller plantations and in the upper South. Slave marriage vows sometimes proclaimed, “Until death or distance do you part.” With impressive resilience, blacks managed to sustain family life in slavery, and most slaves were raised in stable two-parent households. Continuity of family

 Slave Nurse and Young White Master Southern whites would not allow slaves to own property or exercise civil rights, but, paradoxically, they often entrusted them with the raising of their own precious children. Many a slave “mammy” served as a surrogate mother for the offspring of the planter class.

Slave Families

In reality the forced movement of slaves often involved the painful separation of family members.

 identity across generations was evidenced in the widespread practice of naming children for grandparents or adopting the surname not of a current master, but of a forebear’s master. African Americans also displayed their African cultural roots when they avoided marriage between ﬁ rst cousins, in contrast to the frequent intermarriage of close relatives among the ingrown planter aristocracy. African roots were also visible in the slaves’ religious practices. Though heavily Christianized by the itinerant evangelists of the Second Great Awakening, blacks in slavery molded their own distinctive religious forms from a mixture of Christian and African elements. They emphasized those aspects of the Christian heritage that seemed most pertinent to their own situation—especially the captivity of the Israelites in Egypt. One of their most haunting spirituals implored, Tell old Pharaoh “Let my people go.” And another lamented, Nobody knows de trouble I’ve had Nobody knows but Jesus African practices also persisted in the responsorial style of preaching, in which the congregation frequently punctuated the minister’s remarks with assents and



Tag Identifying Slaves and Free
 Blacks in Charleston All slaves in Charleston, South Carolina, were reminded of their status as property by the tags they were forced to wear, marked with their skills—such as porter or mechanic or carpenter—and the year the tag was issued. After 1848 even free blacks had to wear tags, ensuring that no African American could be anonymous in the city. The badge above was issued to a freed slave in Charleston, South Carolina, sometime after 1848.

The Burdens of Bondage
 Slavery was intolerably degrading to the victims. They were deprived of the dignity and sense of responsibility that come from independence and the right to make choices. They were denied an education, because reading brought ideas, and ideas brought discontent. Many states passed laws forbidding their instruction, and perhaps nine-tenths of adult slaves at the beginning of the Civil War were totally illiterate. For all slaves— indeed for virtually all blacks, slave or free—the “American dream” of bettering one’s lot through study and hard work was a cruel and empty mockery. Not surprisingly, victims of the “peculiar institution” devised countless ways to throw sand in its gears. When workers are not voluntarily hired and adequately compensated, they can hardly be expected to work with alacrity. Accordingly, slaves often slowed the pace of their labor to the barest minimum that would

 spare them the lash, thus fostering the myth of black “laziness” in the minds of whites. They ﬁ lched food from the “big house” and pilfered other goods that had been produced or purchased by their labor. They sabotaged expensive equipment, stopping the work routine altogether until repairs were accomplished. Occasionally they even poisoned their masters’ food. The slaves also universally pined for freedom. Many took to their heels as runaways, frequently in search of a separated family member. A black girl, asked if her mother was dead, replied, “Yessir, master, she is dead, but she’s free.” Others rebelled, though never successfully. In 1800 an armed insurrection led by a slave named Gabriel in Richmond, Virginia, was foiled by informers, and its leaders were hanged. Denmark Vesey, a free black, led another ill-fated rebellion in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1822. Also betrayed by informers, Vesey and more than thirty followers were publicly strung from the gallows. In 1831 the semiliterate Nat Turner, a visionary black preacher, led an uprising that slaughtered about sixty Virginians, mostly women and children. Reprisals were swift and bloody, and Nat Turner’s rebellion was soon extinguished. An especially dramatic episode involved the enslaved Africans who rebelled aboard the Spanish slave ship Amistad in 1839. They seized command of the vessel off the coast of Cuba and attempted to sail back to Africa, but were driven ashore on Long Island. After two years of imprisonment and several trials, former president John Quincy Adams ﬁ nally secured their freedom in a brilliant, moving argument before the

Supreme Court in 1841, and the Africans returned to the British colony of Sierra Leone, in West Africa. The dark taint of slavery also left its mark on whites. It fostered the brutality of the whip, the bloodhound, and the branding iron. White southerners increasingly lived in a state of imagined siege, surrounded by potentially rebellious blacks inﬂamed by abolitionist propaganda from the North. Their fears bolstered an intoxicating theory of biological racial superiority and turned the South into a reactionary backwater in an era of progress—one of the last bastions of slavery in the Western world. The defenders of slavery were forced to degrade themselves, along with their victims. As Booker T. Washington, a distinguished black leader and former slave, later observed, whites could not hold blacks in a ditch without getting down there with them. 
Early Abolitionism
 The inhumanity of the “peculiar institution” gradually caused antislavery societies to sprout forth. Abolitionist sentiment ﬁ rst stirred at the time of the Revolution, especially among Quakers (see Map 16.3). Because of the widespread loathing of blacks, some of the earliest abolitionist efforts focused on transporting blacks bodily back to Africa. The American Colonization Society was founded for this purpose in 1817, and in 1822 the Republic of Liberia, on the fever-stricken West African coast, was established for former slaves. Its capital, Monrovia, was named after President Monroe.

Bellegrove Plantation, Donaldsville,
Louisiana, Built 1857
 he sugar-growing Bellegrove Plantation—on the banks of the Mississippi River ninety-ﬁve miles north of New Orleans—was laid out on a grander scale than many southern plantations. In this rendering from an advertisement for Bellegrove’s sale in 1867, the planter John Orr’s home was identiﬁed as a “mansion,” and quarters for his ﬁeld hands proved extensive: twenty double cabins built for slaves (now for “Negroes”) and a dormitory, described in the ad but not pictured here, housing 150 laborers. Because of the unhealthy work involved in cultivating sugar cane, such as the constant digging of drainage canals to keep the cane from rotting in standing water, many planters hired immigrant (usually Irish) labor to keep their valuable slaves out of physical danger. The presence of a hospital between the slave cabins and the mansion indicates the very real threat to health. The layout of Bellegrove reﬂects the organi-

T


 zation of production as well as the social relations on a sugar plantation. The storehouse where preserved sugar awaited shipping stood closest to the Mississippi River, the principal transportation route, whereas the sugar house, the most important building on the plantation, with its mill, boilers, and cooking vats for converting syrup into sugar, dominated the caneﬁelds. Although the “big house” and slave quarters stood in close proximity, hedges surrounding the planter’s home shut out views of both sugar production and labor. Within the slave quarters, the overseer’s larger house signiﬁed his superior status, while the arrangement of cabins ensured his supervision of domestic as well as work life. What else does the physical layout of the plantation reveal about settlement patterns, sugar cultivation, and social relationships along the Mississippi?

 American abolitionists against the sin of slavery. Prominent among them was lanky, tousle-haired Theodore Dwight Weld, who had been evangelized by Charles Grandison Finney in New York’s Burned-Over District in the 1820s. Self-educated and simple in manner and speech, Weld appealed with special power and directness to his rural audiences of untutored farmers. Spiritually inspired by Finney, Weld was materially aided by two wealthy and devout New York merchants, the brothers Arthur and Lewis Tappan. In 1832 they paid his way to Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, which was presided over by the formidable Lyman Beecher, father of a remarkable brood, including novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe, reformer Catharine Beecher, and preacher-abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher. Expelled along with several other students in 1834 for organizing an eighteen-day debate on slavery, Weld and his fellow “Lane Rebels”—full of the energy and idealism of youth—fanned out across the Old Northwest preaching the antislavery gospel. Humorless and deadly earnest, Weld also assembled a potent propaganda pamphlet, American Slavery as It Is (1839). Its compelling arguments made it among the most effective abolitionist tracts and greatly inﬂuenced Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin.

Radical Abolitionism
 Some ﬁ fteen thousand freed blacks were transported there over the next four decades. But most blacks had no wish to be transplanted into a strange civilization after having become partially Americanized. By 1860 virtually all southern slaves were no longer Africans, but native-born African Americans, with their own distinctive history and culture. Yet the colonization idea appealed to some antislaveryites, including Abraham Lincoln, until the time of the Civil War. In the 1830s the abolitionist movement took on new energy and momentum, mounting to the proportions of a crusade. American abolitionists took heart in 1833 when their British counterparts, inspired by the redoubtable William Wilberforce, a member of Parliament and an evangelical Christian reformer whose family had been touched by the preaching of George Whiteﬁeld (see Chapter 5), unchained the slaves in the West Indies (see “Thinking Globally: The Struggle to Abolish Slavery,” pp. 488–489). (Wilberforce University in Ohio, an African American college that later sent many missionaries to Africa, is named for him.) As with Wilberforce, the religious spirit of the Second Great Awakening now inﬂamed the hearts of many

 On New Year’s Day, 1831, a shattering abolitionist blast came from the bugle of William Lloyd Garrison, a mild-looking reformer of twenty-six. The emotionally high-strung son of a drunken father and a spiritual child of the Second Great Awakening, Garrison published in Boston the ﬁ rst issue of his militantly antislavery newspaper, The Liberator. With this mighty paper broadside, Garrison triggered a thirty-year war of words and in a sense ﬁ red one of the opening barrages of the Civil War. Stern and uncompromising, Garrison nailed his colors to the masthead of his weekly. He proclaimed in strident tones that under no circumstances would he tolerate the poisonous weed of slavery, but would stamp it out at once, root and branch: I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice. . . . I am in earnest—I will not equivocate—I will not excuse—I will not retreat a single inch—and I WILL BE HEARD! Other dedicated abolitionists rallied to Garrison’s standard, and in 1833 they founded the American Anti-

The Abolitionist Crusade




 William Lloyd Garrison (1805–1879) The most conspicuous and most viliﬁed of the abolitionists, Garrison was a nonresistant paciﬁst and a poor organizer. He favored northern secession from the South and antagonized both sections with his intemperate language.

 Slavery Society. Prominent among them was Wendell Phillips, a Boston patrician known as “abolition’s golden trumpet.” A man of strict principle, he would eat no cane sugar and wear no cotton cloth, since both were produced by southern slaves. Black abolitionists distinguished themselves as living monuments to the cause of African American freedom. Their ranks included David Walker, whose incendiary Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World (1829) advocated a bloody end to white supremacy. Also noteworthy were Sojourner Truth, a freed black woman in New York who fought tirelessly for black emancipation and women’s rights, and Martin Delany, one of the few black leaders to take seriously the notion of the mass recolonization of Africa. In 1859 he visited West Africa’s Niger Valley seeking a suitable site for relocation.

 The greatest of the black abolitionists was Frederick Douglass. Escaping from bondage in 1838 at the age of twenty-one, he was “discovered” by the abolitionists in 1841 when he gave a stunning impromptu speech at an antislavery meeting in Massachusetts. Thereafter he lectured widely for the cause, despite frequent beatings and threats against his life. In 1845 he published his classic autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass. It depicted his remarkable origins as the son of a black slave woman and a white father, his struggle to learn to read and write, and his eventual escape to the North. Douglass was as ﬂexibly practical as Garrison was stubbornly principled. Garrison often appeared to be more interested in his own righteousness than in the substance of the slavery evil itself. He repeatedly

 hen slaves in the French Caribbean colony of Haiti, inspired by the Revolutionary fervor that had seized mainland France, rose up and demanded “liberty, equality, and fraternity” for themselves, they became, in 1794, the ﬁrst enslaved people in the New World to win their freedom. Although Napoleon would rip it from them again when he reinstated slavery in 1802, another revolution in France in 1848 would ensure their permanent freedom. Table 16.1 documents the long, 250-year struggle to abolish slavery throughout the world. Agitators outraged by the scourge of human bondage and committed to ending it, known as abolitionists, shared antislavery sentiments and strategies across national boundaries. From the late seventeenth through the mid-nineteenth century, British and American abolitionists wove dense networks of mutual support. They shared writings, lecturers, and funding and jointly sponsored conferences such as the World’s Anti-

 Slavery Convention of 1840 in London, which became famous for inspiring the American women’s rights movement when it refused to seat female delegates. But the political fortunes of abolitionist movements, and hence the timing of the longed-for day of freedom, varied sharply from nation to nation. In France emancipation was twice tied to revolutions. In Great Britain massive citizens’ petition campaigns, orchestrated by venerable lifelong abolitionist leaders such as William Wilberforce, brought enormous popular pressure to bear on the government. Parliament eventually responded by outlawing the slave trade in 1807 and then, three days before Wilberforce died in 1833, prohibiting slavery itself throughout most of the British Empire. In the United States as in Britain, abolitionism became a robust social movement, propelled not least by women and free blacks. But the roots of the “peculiar institution” in

Women were allowed to observe, but not to take part in, the ofﬁcial proceedings. The frustrations of the unseated American representatives led to the historic Woman’s Rights Convention at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848 (see p. 352).



 the United States ran wide and deep. Even though the American slave trade was ended in 1808, it took the Union’s victory in a bloody Civil War in 1865 to eradicate slavery once and for all. Elsewhere in the Americas, enslaved peoples secured their freedom gradually and, in stark contrast to

 the United States, peacefully. Emancipation typically became possible only after the achievement of independence from Spain, where abolitionism never gained much traction. Cuba, still a Spanish colony into the 1890s, was among the last places in the New World to set its slaves free.

Notes
 The slave trade was prohibited in 1824, but slavery itself was not abolished until 1829, eight years after Mexico gained independence from Spain. The slave trade was ended in 1807, but slavery was not abolished until 1833. The abolition of slavery did not apply to British India, where slavery persisted until 1860.* Slavery was ﬁrst abolished in 1794 but was reestablished by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802. In 1848 the Second Republic replaced the July Monarchy and abolished slavery in all French colonies. All slaves born since independence (1825) were freed in 1831, but slavery was not abolished entirely until 1851. At the time of independence in 1821, all children born to slaves after that date were declared free, but slavery persisted until 1852. At the time of independence in 1821, all children born to slaves after that date were declared free, but slavery was not abolished entirely until 1854. Emancipation, ﬁrst begun in 1813, was completed in 1854. Gradual emancipation began when independence was fully secured in 1821, but slavery was not completely abolished until 1854. Peter the Great ﬁrst abolished slavery in 1723 by converting household slaves into serfs. Tsar Alexander II freed Russia’s 22 million serfs in 1861. Slavery was abolished in all Dutch colonies. The slave trade was ended in 1808, but slavery was not abolished entirely until after the Civil War, with the ratiﬁcation of the Thirteenth Amendment. Slavery was abolished earlier in the North, in the decades after the Revolution, often through gradual emancipation. Gradual emancipation began in 1842, but slavery was not abolished until 1869. Gradual emancipation began in 1870; the Spanish government freed the remaining slaves in 1886. The slave trade was abolished in 1851. A gradual emancipation law was ﬁrst passed in 1871, but slavery was not abolished entirely until 1888. State-owned slaves were emancipated in 1801. Although slavery was formally abolished in 1894, it persisted in some regions until the 1930s. The emperor abolished slavery toward the end of the Xing dynasty, in 1910, but it persisted until the communist government proclaimed abolition in 1949. Slavery was abolished under pressure from the United Nations and moderate Arab states. Leaders of the newly proclaimed Yemen Arab Republic abolished slavery after overthrowing the imamate in 1962.

Chapter 16 The South and the Slavery Controversy, 1793–1860


 Frederick Douglass (1817?–1895), the remarkable ex-slave, told of Mr. Covey, a white owner who bought a single female slave “as a breeder.” She gave birth to twins at the end of the year:

“


 At this addition to the human stock Covey and his wife were ecstatic with joy. No one dreamed of reproaching the woman or ﬁnding fault with the hired man, Bill Smith, the father of the children, for Mr. Covey himself had locked the two up together every night, thus inviting the result.

”


 Frederick Douglass (1817?–1895) Born a slave in Maryland, Douglass escaped to the North and became the most prominent of the black abolitionists. Gifted as an orator, writer, and editor, he continued to battle for the civil rights of his people after emancipation. Near the end of a distinguished career, he served as U.S. minister to Haiti.

 demanded that the “virtuous” North secede from the “wicked” South. Yet he did not explain how the creation of an independent slave republic would bring an end to the “damning crime” of slavery. Renouncing politics, on the Fourth of July, 1854, he publicly burned a copy of the Constitution as “a covenant with death and an agreement with hell” (a phrase he borrowed from a Shaker condemnation of marriage). Critics, including some of his former supporters, charged that Garrison was cruelly probing the moral wound in America’s underbelly but offering no acceptable balm to ease the pain. Douglass, on the other hand, along with other abolitionists, increasingly looked to politics to end the blight of slavery. These political abolitionists backed the Liberty party in 1840, the Free Soil party in 1848,

 and eventually the Republican party in the 1850s. In the end, most abolitionists, including even the paciﬁ stic Garrison himself, followed the logic of their beliefs and supported a frightfully costly fratricidal war as the price of emancipation. High-minded and courageous, the abolitionists were men and women of goodwill and various colors who faced the cruel choice that people in many ages have had thrust upon them: when is evil so enormous that it must be denounced, even at the risk of precipitating bloodshed and butchery?

 After hearing Frederick Douglass speak in Bristol, England, in 1846, Mary A. Estlin wrote to an American abolitionist,

“


 [T]here is but one opinion of him. Wherever he goes he arouses sympathy in your cause and love for himself. . . . Our expectations were highly roused by his narrative, his printed speeches, and the eulogisms of the friends with whom he has been staying: but he far exceeds the picture we had formed both in outward graces, intellectual power and culture, and eloquence. *

White Southerners on the Defensive


The South Lashes Back
 Antislavery sentiment was not unknown in the South, and in the 1820s antislavery societies were more numerous south of the Mason-Dixon line* than north of it. But after about 1830, the voice of white southern abolitionism was silenced. In a last gasp of southern questioning of slavery, the Virginia legislature debated and eventually defeated various emancipation proposals in 1831–1832. That debate marked a turning point. Thereafter all the slave states tightened their slave codes and moved to prohibit emancipation of any kind, voluntary or compensated. Nat Turner’s rebellion in 1831 sent a wave of hysteria sweeping over the snowy cotton ﬁelds, and planters in growing numbers, recollecting the massive slave revolt that had erupted in Haiti in the 1790s, slept with pistols by their pillows. Although Garrison had no demonstrable connection with the Turner conspiracy, his Liberator appeared at about the same time, and he was bitterly condemned as a terrorist and an inciter of murder. The State of Georgia offered $5,000 for his arrest and conviction. The nulliﬁcation crisis of 1832 further implanted haunting fears in white southern minds, conjuring up nightmares of black incendiaries and abolitionist devils. Jailings, whippings, and lynchings now greeted rational efforts to discuss the slavery problem in the South. Proslavery whites responded by launching a massive defense of slavery as a positive good. In doing so, they forgot their own section’s previous doubts about the morality of the “peculiar institution.” Slavery, they claimed, was supported by the authority of the Bible and the wisdom of Aristotle. It was good for the Africans, who were lifted from the barbarism of the jungle and clothed with the blessings of Christian civilization. Slavemasters strongly encouraged religion in the slave quarters. A catechism for blacks contained such passages as Q. Who gave you a master and a mistress? A. God gave them to me. Q. Who says that you must obey them? A. God says that I must. White apologists also claimed that master-slave relationships really resembled those of a family. On

 many plantations, especially those of the Old South of Virginia and Maryland, this argument had a certain plausibility. A slave’s tombstone bore this touching inscription: JOHN: A faithful servant: and true friend: Kindly, and considerate: Loyal, and affectionate: The family he served Honours him in death: But, in life they gave him love: For he was one of them Southern whites were quick to contrast the “happy” lot of their “servants” with that of the overworked northern wage slaves, including sweated women and stunted children. The blacks mostly toiled in the fresh air and sunlight, not in dark and stuffy factories. They did not have to worry about slack times or unemployment, as did the “hired hands” of the North. Provided with a jail-like form of Social Security, they were cared for in sickness and old age, unlike northern workers, who were set adrift when they had outlived their usefulness. These curious proslavery arguments only widened the chasm between a backward-looking South and a forward-looking North—and indeed much of the rest of the Western world. The southerners reacted defensively to the pressure of their own fears and bristled before the merciless nagging of the northern abolitionists. Increasingly the white South turned in upon itself and grew hotly intolerant of any embarrassing questions about the status of slavery. Regrettably, also, the controversy over free people endangered free speech in the entire country. Piles of petitions poured in upon Congress from the antislavery reformers, and in 1836 sensitive southerners drove through the House the so-called Gag Resolution. It required all such antislavery appeals to be tabled without debate. This attack on the right of petition aroused the sleeping lion in the aged ex-president, Representative John Quincy Adams, and he waged a successful eightyear ﬁght for its repeal. Southern whites likewise resented the ﬂooding of their mails with incendiary abolitionist literature. Even if blacks could not read, they could interpret the inﬂammatory drawings, such as those that showed masters knocking out slaves’ teeth with clubs. In 1835 a mob in Charleston, South Carolina, looted the post

 In Defense of Slavery This pair of illustrations contrasts the supposedly benevolent slave regime of the South with the harshness of working life in England, where starvation wages and unemployment blighted workers’ lives. Apologists for slavery frequently invoked this comparison between allegedly paternalistic slavemasters and the uncaring capitalists who captained the Industrial Revolution.

 ofﬁce and burned a pile of abolitionist propaganda. Capitulating to southern pressures, the Washington government in 1835 ordered southern postmasters to destroy abolitionist material and called on southern state ofﬁcials to arrest federal postmasters who did not comply. Such was “freedom of the press” as guaranteed by the Constitution.

The Abolitionist Impact
 in the North Abolitionists—especially the extreme Garrisonians— were for a long time unpopular in many parts of the North. Northerners had been brought up to revere the Constitution and to regard the clauses on slavery as a lasting bargain. The ideal of Union, hammered home by the thundering eloquence of Daniel Webster and others, had taken deep root, and Garrison’s wild talk of secession grated harshly on northern ears.

 The North also had a heavy economic stake in Dixieland. By the late 1850s, southern planters owed northern bankers and other creditors about $300 million, and much of this immense sum would be lost—as, in fact, it later was—should the Union dissolve. New England textile mills were fed with cotton raised by the slaves, and a disrupted labor system might cut off this vital supply and bring unemployment. The Union during these critical years was partly bound together with cotton threads, tied by lords of the loom in collaboration with the so-called lords of the lash. It was not surprising that strong hostility developed in the North against the boat-rocking tactics of the radical antislaveryites. Repeated tongue-lashings by the extreme abolitionists provoked many mob outbursts in the North, some led by respectable gentlemen. A gang of young toughs broke into Lewis Tappan’s New York house in 1834 and demolished its interior, while a crowd in the street cheered. In 1835 Garrison, with a rope tied around him,

 was dragged through the streets of Boston by the socalled Broadcloth Mob but escaped almost miraculously. Reverend Elijah P. Lovejoy of Alton, Illinois, not content to assail slavery, impugned the chastity of Catholic women. His printing press was destroyed four times, and in 1837 he was killed by a mob and became “the martyr abolitionist.” So unpopular were the antislavery zealots that ambitious politicians, like Lincoln, usually avoided the taint of Garrisonian abolition like the plague.



 Yet by the 1850s the abolitionist outcry had made a deep dent in the northern mind. Many citizens had come to see the South as the land of the unfree and the home of a hateful institution. Few northerners were prepared to abolish slavery outright, but a growing number, including Lincoln, opposed extending it to the western territories. People of this stamp, commonly called “free-soilers,” swelled their ranks as the Civil War approached.

What Was the True Nature of Slavery?


B


 y the early twentieth century, the predictable accounts of slavery written by partisans of the North or South had receded in favor of a romantic vision of the Old South conveyed through popular literature, myth, and, increasingly, scholarship. That vision was persuasively validated by the publication of Ulrich Bonnell Phillips’s landmark study, American Negro Slavery (1918). Phillips made three key arguments. First, he claimed that slavery was a dying economic institution, unproﬁtable to the slaveowner and an obstacle to the economic development of the South as a whole. Second, he contended that slavery was a rather benign institution and that the planters, contrary to abolitionist charges of ruthless exploitation, treated their chattels with kindly paternalism. Third, he reﬂected the dominant racial attitudes of his time in his belief that blacks were inferior and submissive by nature and did not abhor the institution that enslaved them. For nearly a century, historians have debated these assertions, sometimes heatedly. More sophisticated economic analysis has refuted Phillips’s claim that slavery would have withered away without a war. Economic historians have demonstrated that slavery was a viable, proﬁtable, expanding economic system and that slaves constituted a worthwhile investment for their owners. The price of a prime ﬁeld hand rose dramatically, even in the 1850s.

 No such deﬁnitive conclusion has yet been reached in the disputes over slave treatment. Frank Tannenbaum’s classic comparative study, Slave and Citizen (1947), argued that slavery was more humane in Latin America than in the United States, leaving a legacy of less sharply deﬁ ned racial castes there. Beginning in the late 1950s, historians came increasingly to emphasize the harshness of the U.S. slave system. One study, Stanley Elkins’s Slavery (1959), went so far as to compare the “peculiar institution” to the Nazi concentration camps of World War II. Both were “total institutions,” Elkins contended, which “infantilized” their victims. More recently, scholars such as Eugene Genovese have moved beyond debating whether slavery was kind or cruel. Without diminishing the deprivations and pains of slavery, Genovese has conceded that slavery embraced a strange form of paternalism, a system that reﬂected not the benevolence of southern slaveholders, but their need to control and coax work out of their reluctant and often recalcitrant “investments.” Furthermore, within this paternalistic system, black slaves were able to make reciprocal demands of their white owners and to protect a “cultural space” of their own in which family and religion particu larly could ﬂourish. The crowning paradox of slaveholder paternalism was that in treating their property more humanely, slaveowners implicitly recognized the hu-

 manity of their slaves and thereby subverted the racist underpinnings upon which their slave society existed. The revised conceptions of the master-slave relationship also spilled over into the debate about slave personality. Elkins accepted Phillips’s portrait of the slave as a childlike “Sambo” but saw it as a consequence of slavery rather than a congenital attribute of African Americans. Kenneth Stampp, rejecting the Sambo stereotype, stressed the frequency and variety of slave resistance, both mild and militant. A third view, imaginatively documented in the work of Lawrence Levine, argued that the Sambo character was an act, an image that slaves used to confound their masters without incurring punishment. Levine’s Black Culture and Black Consciousness (1977) shares with books by John Blassingame and Herbert Gutman an emphasis on the tenacity with which slaves maintained their own culture and kin relations, despite the hardships of bondage. Most recently, historians have attempted to avoid the polarity of repression versus autonomy. They assert the debasing oppression of slavery, while also acknowledging slaves’ ability to resist the dehumanizing effects of enslavement. The challenge before historians today is to capture the vibrancy of slave culture and its legacy for African American society after emancipation, without diminishing the brutality of life under the southern slave regime. A new sensitivity to gender, spurred by the growing ﬁeld of women’s history, has also expanded the horizons of slavery studies. Historians such as Eliza-



 beth Fox-Genovese, Jacqueline Jones, and Catherine Clinton have focused on the ways in which slavery differed for men and women, both slaves and slaveholders. Enslaved black women, for example, had the unique task of negotiating an identity out of their dual responsibilities as plantation laborer, even sometimes caretaker of white women and children, and anchor of the black family. By tracing the interconnectedness of race and gender in the American South, these historians have also shown how slavery shaped conceptions of masculinity and femininity within southern society, further distinguishing its culture from that of the North. Scholarship on slavery continues to grow. The newest work by Philip D. Morgan and Ira Berlin has drawn attention to how both the institution of slavery and the experience of the enslaved changed over time. They have contended that slavery was far from monolithic. Rather, it adapted to particular geographic and environmental factors, which inﬂuenced the diet and work routines of slaves and shaped the degree of autonomy in family life and culture that slaves were able to carve out. Slavery also changed from one generation to the next. As southern slaveholders responded to new social and economic conditions, they gradually altered the legal status of slaves, making slavery a hereditary condition, outlawing manumission in many places, rendering freedom for the enslaved increasingly difﬁcult to attain, and placing onerous restrictions on the work opportunities and mobility of free African Americans.

Manifest Destiny
 and Its Legacy

1841–1848
 Our manifest destiny [is] to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.

T


 erritorial expansion dominated American diplomacy and politics in the 1840s. Settlers swarming into the still-disputed Oregon Country aggravated relations with Britain, which had staked its own claims in the Paciﬁc Northwest. The clamor to annex Texas to the Union provoked bitter tension with Mexico, which continued to regard Texas as a Mexican province in revolt. And when Americans began casting covetous eyes on Mexico’s northernmost province, the great prize of Cal i fornia, open warfare erupted between the United States and its southern neighbor. Victory over Mexico added vast new domains to the United States, but it also raised thorny questions about the status of slavery in the newly acquired territories—questions that would be answered in blood in the Civil War of the 1860s.

 *Earliest known use of the term Manifest Destiny, sometimes called “Manifest Desire.”

The Accession of “Tyler Too”
 A horde of hard-ciderites descended upon Washington early in 1841, clamoring for the spoils of ofﬁce. Newly elected President Harrison, bewildered by the uproar, was almost hounded to death by Whig spoilsmen. The real leaders of the Whig party regarded “Old Tippecanoe” as little more than an impressive ﬁgurehead. Daniel Webster, as secretary of state, and Henry Clay, the uncrowned king of the Whigs and their ablest spokesman in the Senate, would grasp the helm. The aging general was ﬁ nally forced to rebuke the overzealous Clay and pointedly remind him that he, William Henry Harrison, was president of the United States. Unluckily for Clay and Webster, their schemes soon hit a fatal snag. Before the new term had fairly started, Harrison contracted pneumonia. Wearied by ofﬁcial functions and plagued by ofﬁce seekers, the enfeebled

 old warrior died after only four weeks in the White House—by far the shortest administration in American history, following by far the longest inaugural address. The “Tyler too” part of the Whig ticket, hitherto only a rhyme, now claimed the spotlight. What manner of man did the nation now ﬁ nd in the presidential chair? Six feet tall, slender, blue-eyed, and fair-haired, with classical features and a high forehead, John Tyler was a Virginia gentleman of the old school—gracious and kindly, yet stubbornly attached to principle. He had earlier resigned from the Senate, quite unnecessarily, rather than accept distasteful instructions from the Virginia legislature. Still a lone wolf, he had forsaken the Jacksonian Democratic fold for that of the Whigs, largely because he could not stomach the dictatorial tactics of Jackson. Tyler’s enemies accused him of being a Democrat in Whig clothing, but this charge was only partially true. The Whig party, like the Democratic party, was something of a catchall, and the accidental president belonged to the minority wing, which embraced a number of Jeffersonian states’ righters. Tyler had in fact been put on the ticket partly to attract the vote of this fringe group, many of whom were inﬂuential southern gentry. Yet Tyler, high-minded as he was, should never have consented to run on the ticket. Although the dominant Clay-Webster group had published no platform, every alert politician knew what the unpublished platform contained. And on virtually every major issue, the obstinate Virginian was at odds with the majority of his adoptive Whig party, which was pro-bank, pro–protective tariff, and pro–internal improvements. “Tyler too” rhymed with “Tippecanoe,” but there the harmony ended. As events turned out, President Harrison, the Whig, served for only 4 weeks, whereas Tyler, the ex-Democrat who was still largely a Democrat at heart, served for 204 weeks.

John Tyler: A President
Without a Party
 After their hard-won, hard-cider victory, the Whigs brought their not-so-secret platform out of Clay’s waistcoat pocket. To the surprise of no one, it outlined a strongly nationalistic program. Financial reform came ﬁ rst. The Whig Congress hastened to pass a law ending the independent treasury system, and President Tyler, disarmingly agreeable, signed it. Clay next drove through Congress a bill for a



 “Fiscal Bank,” which would establish a new Bank of the United States. Tyler’s hostility to a centralized bank was notorious, and Clay—the “Great Compromiser”—would have done well to conciliate him. But the Kentuckian, robbed repeatedly of the presidency by lesser men, was in an imperious mood and riding for a fall. When the bank bill reached the presidential desk, Tyler ﬂatly vetoed it on both practical and constitutional grounds. A drunken mob gathered late at night near the White House and shouted insultingly, “Huzza for Clay!” “A Bank! A Bank!” “Down with the Veto!” The stunned Whig leaders tried once again. Striving to pacify Tyler’s objections to a “Fiscal Bank,” they passed another bill providing for a “Fiscal Corporation.” But the president, still unbending, vetoed the offensive substitute. The Democrats were jubilant: they had been saved from another ﬁ nancial “monster” only by the pneumonia that had felled Harrison. Whig extremists, seething with indignation, condemned Tyler as “His Accidency” and as an “Executive Ass.” Widely burned in efﬁgy, he received numerous letters threatening him with death. A wave of inﬂuenza then sweeping the country was called the “Tyler grippe.” To the delight of Democrats, the stiff-necked Virginian was formally expelled from his party by a caucus of Whig congressmen, and a serious attempt to impeach him was broached in the House of Representatives. His entire cabinet resigned in a body, except Secretary of State Webster, who was then in the midst of delicate negotiations with Eng land. The proposed Whig tariff also felt the prick of the president’s well-inked pen. Tyler appreciated the necessity of bringing additional revenue to the Treasury. But old Democrat that he was, he looked with a frosty eye on the major tariff scheme of the Whigs because it provided, among other features, for a distribution among the states of revenue from the sale of public lands in the West. Tyler could see no point in squandering federal money when the federal Treasury was not overﬂowing, and he again wielded an emphatic veto. Chastened Clayites redrafted their tariff bill. They chopped out the offensive dollar-distribution scheme and pushed down the rates to about the moderately protective level of 1832, roughly 32 percent on dutiable goods. Tyler had no fondness for a protective tariff, but realizing the need for additional revenue, he reluctantly signed the Tariff of 1842. In subsequent months the pressure for higher customs duties slackened as the country gradually edged its way out of the depression. The Whig slogan, “Harrison, Two Dollars a Day and
